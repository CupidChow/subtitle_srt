1
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,190
Goodness. Oh, my.

2
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,991
I've seen this somewhere before.

3
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,178
Why aren't they locked up?

4
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,388
They beat us up first!

5
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:41,267
I was just passing by
when they suddenly assaulted me.

6
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,435
Look here.

7
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,188
Do you see how they tore my dress?

8
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,315
Hey, this is sexual harassment.

9
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,400
-Yes, you.
-"Sexual harassment"?

10
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,194
This was a brand-new dress.

11
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,988
Had I been determined
to teach them a lesson,

12
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,741
I would've broken all of their bones.

13
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,034
Gosh.

14
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,203
-Hey!
-What are you looking at?

15
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,997
I'm sure you've never seen a monk
commit assault.

16
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,791
Gosh, that stupid monk.

17
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,086
I was just talking,
and he flew in and kicked me.

18
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,547
He flipped me over and hit me with a flag.

19
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,798
Where's that flag?

20
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,550
That one. That's a weapon!

21
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,677
Mr. Lee, you know me.
I'm dressed in white.

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,096
I wouldn't have worn this
if we were attacking them.

23
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,222
Come on, you know me.

24
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,599
-Be quiet!
-That's a load of bull!

25
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,476
-It was them!
-Be quiet!

26
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,602
He hit me right here.

27
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,903
What is it this time?

28
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,949
I'm their lawyer.

29
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,284
Me too.

30
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,703
Why would they hire two lawyers?

31
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,954
See?

32
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:46,124
This is how well-prepared we are legally.

33
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,752
They assaulted him first.

34
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,463
The others came to help him,
but they were assaulted too.

35
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:55,717
That's not true! They hit us first!

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,135
Kim Yeong-ho.

37
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,845
Kim Yeong-ho.

38
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,014
-Kim Yeong-ho--
-Coming!

39
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,474
Hey, why are you here?

40
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,853
Could you show the detectives
what you filmed?

41
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,606
Sure.
But what's with the tone of your voice?

42
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,690
Just go.

43
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,692
-What is this?
-Let's see.

44
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,027
-What's that?
-All right.

45
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,779
That's…

46
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,198
See? We have proof!

47
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,242
-See? Here's the proof.
-We have proof.

48
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,702
He filmed it.

49
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,746
-Wait!
-Hey.

50
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,166
That's me. I'm wearing the same clothing.

51
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,468
We did get what we wanted.

52
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,886
You're indeed a Mafia.

53
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,346
-Stop that.
-Ma…

54
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,555
Don't.

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,561
-I'm on cloud nine.
-We'd like more kimchi.

56
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,729
More kimchi, please.

57
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,856
-Kimchi.
-All right.

58
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,942
-That's right.
-And one more soju, please.

59
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,735
-Hold on. Stop.
-Me too.

60
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,403
-Hear me out.
-A cold one, please!

61
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,197
You all did well.

62
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,157
Especially Gi-seok here.

63
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,910
Unlike his appearance,
he could hold his own.

64
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,162
Could it be because you're my apprentice?

65
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,622
You held out well today.

66
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:11,376
I didn't tell you this before,
but I'm no average Joe.

67
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,460
Tell me about it.

68
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,088
We should've fought them
from the beginning.

69
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,839
Taking them down was a cakewalk.

70
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,549
That's how gangsters are.

71
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,094
They go around in groups
because they're weak, right?

72
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,054
Those bastards were no match for us.

73
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,681
-Exactly.
-Right?

74
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,351
Larry, you really hung in there well.

75
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,061
-That's right.
-You have my respect.

76
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,105
I didn't tell you this before,

77
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,109
but dancing and martial arts
go hand in hand.

78
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,444
I grew up tough in a slum

79
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,947
so I can take down
three or four of them at a time.

80
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,448
Oh, really?

81
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,993
I learned martial arts at a temple before,

82
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,577
so I'm not so bad either.

83
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,330
-I see.
-You're incredible.

84
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,498
I see.

85
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,501
If we're to talk about our pasts,
I have a lot to talk about.

86
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,212
-When I was younger…
-Yes.

87
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,756
I'll stop right there.

88
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,927
Come on.

89
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,723
-Hey, you little bastard.
-What?

90
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,433
Why weren't you at the academy?

91
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,394
Mr. Cassano told me to take a video.

92
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,271
What? He did?

93
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,899
-Mr. Cassano.
-Yes?

94
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,985
Thank you.

95
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:23,781
Thanks to you, we came to our senses
and stood our ground.

96
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,117
I don't understand.

97
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,536
He's right. Thanks to you,

98
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:33,291
we finally realized that Park Seok-do,
that bastard, is no match for us.

99
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:37,879
He's also stimulated me
to make better dishes.

100
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,882
In that sense, let's give him an applause.

101
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,425
-Yes!
-Applaud!

102
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,678
-Everyone, give him a round of applause!
-Applause!

103
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,514
-Vincenzo!
-Vincenzo!

104
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,724
-Vincenzo!
-Vincenzo!

105
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,184
Vincenzo!

106
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,187
Park Seok-do may seem like a loser,

107
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,398
but you should never provoke
or assault him first.

108
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,484
-We got it.
-Don't you worry.

109
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,985
Gosh, we're not him.

110
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,612
You're right.

111
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:06,532
And feel free to ask for our help anytime.

112
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,701
If it's regarding you two,

113
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,370
I can always turn off my iron
and run over.

114
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,706
We should do the same.

115
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,625
Check this out. It got 200,000 views.

116
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,376
-What?
-Two hundred thousand?

117
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,547
Look at us!

118
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,966
Why do I look so ugly?

119
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,135
Why is my face so big?
Is this photoshopped?

120
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,637
It looks just fine.

121
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,430
He did a good job. It's like a movie.

122
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,599
-He's talented.
-It looks amazing.

123
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,392
I've never mixed soju and beer before.

124
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,310
-Here.
-Try it.

125
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,772
I finally realized why these people
remained here and stood their ground.

126
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,193
They were inspired by Vincenzo's strength
and excellent leadership.

127
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,446
That means Vincenzo isn't a Mafia.

128
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,615
He's Che Guevara.

129
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,659
Here.

130
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,789
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with us, sir.

131
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,624
Since we've come to this,

132
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,043
let's try to get along.

133
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,381
We'll set up a meeting with Chairman Jang
right away.

134
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,259
Right, Myung-hee.

135
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,553
About what I told you last time…

136
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,222
About my colleague, Chief Kim's scandal.

137
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,225
-Take care of that, will you?
-Well…

138
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,395
What? Don't you want to?

139
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,856
I generously agreed to your favor.

140
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,858
You should do that much for us.

141
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,283
You're right.
We'll take care of it immediately.

142
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,285
We will, so don't worry.

143
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,289
I believe she's already working on it.
Aren't you?

144
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,209
What should I ask first?

145
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,752
EPISODE 8

146
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,588
Why did you join the Mafia?

147
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,883
How do you become a Mafia lawyer?

148
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,094
How much does a Mafia lawyer make a year?

149
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,305
I have so many questions.

150
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,931
Don't ask me anything.

151
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,226
How could I not now that I know?

152
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,979
I already have over 80 questions to ask.

153
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,611
Fine. I'll answer two of them tonight.

154
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,699
First, how did you become their lawyer?

155
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,453
They're not any different.

156
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,997
It's just business.

157
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:24,629
Then do people really get killed
like they do in movies?

158
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,840
You have to pay the price
for your actions.

159
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,134
That's what the Mafia believes.

160
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,348
They're really no joke.

161
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,975
-Next question.
-Enough.

162
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,644
You've already asked two.

163
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,188
Then I'll ask the other 78 questions
next time.

164
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,648
The number may increase.

165
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,235
Go in.

166
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:54,033
Thank you so much for saving me
from ending up behind bars.

167
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,912
Make sure to pay me back.

168
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,916
You always have to return the favor
when dealing with the Mafia.

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,545
Okay. I'll pay you back
one way or another.

170
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,547
Good night.

171
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,905
MERCHANTS IN CRISIS
FIGHTS OFF HIRED THUGS

172
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,907
Darkness cannot defeat light.

173
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,285
1.2 MILLION VIEWS IN A DAY
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

174
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,912
There are still 13 of us left.

175
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,708
Come back again, and I will teach you
a lesson with this iron.

176
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,090
There's no occupation that caters
to people more than cooks do.

177
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:56,971
All I want to be is the light and salt
of the world for the people.

178
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,640
Sir, can you move back a bit?

179
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,975
You're too close.

180
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,561
My face shouldn't look so big.
You know that.

181
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,396
Let's cut that out and do it again.

182
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,190
Lastly, let's meet the monks.

183
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,998
We are monks who carry on
the patriotic spirit of Buddhism.

184
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:29,086
It is also our duty to fight against
those demons who are blinded by greed.

185
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,173
WE WILL FIGHT AGAINST
THE DEMONS WHO ARE BLINDED BY GREED

186
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,019
We've won over
the Namdongbu prosecution service.

187
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,228
Great job.

188
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,981
Not at all, sir.
We only did what was necessary.

189
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,442
It wasn't you. It was Vincenzo.

190
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,487
It was him, wasn't it?

191
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,161
Actually, we just received
the slightest bit of help.

192
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,955
Do you even know how he convinced him?

193
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,461
He sent the chief prosecutor's son,
who is a terrible soccer player,

194
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,215
to Italy's BC Milano.

195
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,889
It's obvious how
you former prosecutors handle things.

196
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,477
Seeing how you keep failing,
shouldn't you just quit by now?

197
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,561
Sir.

198
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,771
What?

199
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:33,234
Do you know why I'm still here

200
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,069
even after you've locked me in a car,

201
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,363
bashed it, and humiliated me?

202
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,159
-Ms. Choi.
-Stay still!

203
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,415
If I were to give up like this,

204
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,584
I'd die mortified from the shame.

205
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,921
If I quit, I'll end up hanging myself
in the mountains.

206
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,589
Like you,

207
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,969
I myself have never lost twice in a row.

208
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,763
I'll pay him back a hundredfold

209
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,391
and then quit with a sense of closure.

210
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,726
And what?
It's obvious how I handle things?

211
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,813
You're right. That's the only way
I handle things,

212
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,858
and I'm going to win no matter what
using this method!

213
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,122
Yes! This is it!

214
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,716
This is exactly what I wanted!

215
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,645
I don't need a lawyer.

216
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,024
I need someone who can be
the devil himself for me.

217
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,485
I can be a mean devil too, sir.

218
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,074
Use this devilish spirit of yours

219
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,660
to keep the Namdongbu prosecution service
under control.

220
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,791
As long as you support me,
I'll do my best.

221
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,922
You do know Babel was humiliated

222
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,883
and lost its funds
because of Geumga Plaza, right?

223
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,761
Yes, I saw it on TV this morning.

224
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,015
Think of a way to secure
our funding again.

225
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,325
I read over the compensation proposal

226
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,120
you sent us regarding
the victims of Babel Chemicals.

227
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,705
Do you think this is the lottery?

228
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,209
"Lottery"?

229
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,128
We were being pretty generous, right?

230
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,506
Even though Babel's chairman bowed

231
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,092
and apologized for that incident,

232
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,886
you're still asking for too much.

233
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,305
Then we'll file a criminal suit.

234
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,642
We were willing
to end this with compensations.

235
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:16,146
There is no way Babel will agree to this.

236
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,898
You can file your suit.

237
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,275
Wait.

238
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,528
Don't you think the chairman
will agree to this?

239
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,738
Is that what you think?

240
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,241
Why don't you just listen to him?

241
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,494
You become smarter day by day.

242
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,045
Then I'll review it
and discuss it with Babel.

243
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,174
Be honest with me here.

244
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:46,844
Do you have more cards against Babel?

245
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,304
There's no need to.

246
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,514
There's no point

247
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,726
in piercing more holes
into a sinking ship.

248
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,769
-Don't you think so?
-I agree.

249
00:14:55,853 --> 00:15:00,649
You and Mr. Han can play the violin

250
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,651
on the deck of the sinking ship.

251
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:07,072
I regret having let you out of the cell
much too soon.

252
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:16,123
We'll wait and see
whether this will be the Titanic

253
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,460
or a nuclear submarine.

254
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,546
I have this one favorite Korean saying.

255
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,173
You told me about it.

256
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,383
-Oh, that?
-Yes.

257
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,804
-Looks like you need a good beating.
-Looks like you need a good beating.

258
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,287
So you're saying,

259
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,666
there's no way to convince
the banks as of now?

260
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,961
No, sir. Not for now.

261
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,881
The banks are refusing
to negotiate with us.

262
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,098
Senior Managing Director,
Junior Managing Director,

263
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,516
and Director.

264
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,019
You've been directors
since my father was alive.

265
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,896
Why are you so incompetent?

266
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,314
What is it that you do?

267
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,649
I'm sorry, sir.

268
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,111
But this isn't our fault.

269
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,031
It's because of the lawsuit
with Babel Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals.

270
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,659
Not to mention the Babel Tower incident
a few days ago.

271
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,244
Things are getting worse--

272
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,052
You're all fired.

273
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,929
Stay out of my sight from now on.

274
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,185
Damn it.

275
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,776
Sir, the product you ordered has arrived.

276
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,611
It's next to you.

277
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,982
Did you take care of those bastards
who humiliated Babel E&C?

278
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,868
I'm cold.

279
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,999
Stop saying you're cold.

280
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,586
I think my blood vessels are frozen.

281
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:13,592
I'm in huge trouble. What should I do?

282
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,053
I just did what I was told to do.

283
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,513
I'm only an accountant.

284
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,099
Why am I here?

285
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,477
I told you not to come to the office.

286
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,938
Why did you have to come?

287
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,857
I had to report surtaxes.

288
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,527
Stop talking about surtaxes.

289
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,029
Gosh. Get closer.

290
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,198
Scoot over.

291
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,283
-Today's the due date.
-We're going to live.

292
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,743
I need to report it by today.

293
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,958
-Hey, are they dead?
-What?

294
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,294
Hey, wake up. Dong-sik, wake up! Dong-sik…

295
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,629
Dong-sik… I'm cold.

296
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,382
-Come closer.
-He's dead.

297
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,759
-He's dead.
-No, he opened his eyes.

298
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,052
No, he's dead.

299
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,929
-I'm dying.
-Hey.

300
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,348
-Get closer. I feel warmer.
-Please save me.

301
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,561
SHINKWANG BANK MAIN BRANCH

302
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,524
PROSECUTOR CHOI MYUNG-HEE

303
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,826
Hello, Prosecutor Choi.

304
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,204
Goodness. I'm working for Wusang now.

305
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,497
Haven't you heard?

306
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,250
I forgot.

307
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,128
Congratulations on your fresh start.

308
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,300
Actually, I have a favor to ask.

309
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,510
Can we meet?

310
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,852
Sure, when?

311
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,360
We're her lawyers.

312
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,630
All that we can do now
is administer painkillers.

313
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,799
How long does she have?

314
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,094
It depends on her will to live,
but I'd say a few days.

315
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,390
If she has a family, you should tell them
as soon as possible.

316
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,062
We should request a stay of execution.

317
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,981
They'll grant it if we submit
her medical report.

318
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,902
Mr. Nam is looking into it,

319
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,279
but he hasn't found any family members.

320
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,418
Are you okay, Ms. Oh?

321
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,882
I'm Lawyer Hong Yu-chan's daughter,

322
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,384
Lawyer Hong Cha-young.

323
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,804
Hello.

324
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,056
Hello.

325
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,023
I thought

326
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,193
I'd never see you again.

327
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,948
You should've told them
if it was this bad.

328
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,950
I didn't say anything

329
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,036
because it was bearable.

330
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,791
I'm sorry for worrying you.

331
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,005
We're going to request
a stay of execution.

332
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,300
Once they grant it,
you should get treated right away.

333
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,218
I have

334
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:48,598
no money to receive treatment.

335
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,350
I'll take care of that.

336
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,854
I don't want to be indebted to anyone.

337
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:54,813
Ms. Oh!

338
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,316
Just do as I say!

339
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,878
Are you serious?

340
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:21,548
You want me to invest in a heinous company
like the Babel Group?

341
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,387
That's rich coming from you,
don't you think so?

342
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,640
Hasn't your bank been known

343
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,894
for being heinous
since your father was the president?

344
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:38,106
Let me count how many cases
I've dealt with.

345
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,733
Gosh, there's way too many.

346
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,570
I'm not asking you
to actually invest in them.

347
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,155
Just pretend you are.

348
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,908
You'll receive a fake application form
from Babel

349
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,452
and Shinkwang will give them a fake loan.

350
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,037
It's simple.

351
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,498
If you give us a pass,

352
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,250
receiving loans from other banks
will be a cakewalk.

353
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,336
-Our bank is--
-I know.

354
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,216
Your bank is infamous
when it comes to loan assessments

355
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,927
and you have the best credit
in this line of business.

356
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:09,805
But…

357
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:16,019
isn't your safety more important
than your bank's reputation?

358
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,856
You do know

359
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,193
that I still have your case, right?

360
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,031
Would you like me to take it out

361
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,493
and bring it into the limelight?

362
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,340
I'm Jang Han-seo.

363
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,467
Hello, sir.

364
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:56,143
I hope this relationship
will benefit both of you.

365
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,270
-Why don't you have a seat?
-Sure.

366
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,688
How about a drink?

367
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,032
Ms. Hong.

368
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,619
Ms. Oh Gyeong-ja's stay of execution
has been granted.

369
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,622
I'm glad that it didn't take too long.

370
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,041
We should move her to another room.

371
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,919
Would you like to come?

372
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,508
You can take care of it.
I have somewhere to be.

373
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,308
Are you running away?

374
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,685
A new method?

375
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,062
-Without demolishing it?
-Yes.

376
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,898
We'll use iris recognition.

377
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,319
But Wang Shaolin is dead.

378
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,987
We can't get his iris.

379
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,740
I received information

380
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,118
that he owns a museum in Hangzhou.

381
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:59,372
And the relic storage room has
an iris recognition system.

382
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,669
Then his iris must be registered there.

383
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,755
Correct. Unless they deleted it,

384
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,673
it will still be there.

385
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,801
But how can we get the data?

386
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,054
There's this group of hackers in Shanghai.

387
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,724
I'm planning
to take them to Hangzhou myself.

388
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,480
I hope it all works out.

389
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,689
It will.

390
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,656
GEUMGA PLAZA

391
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,782
What is all this?

392
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,326
What? This?

393
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,496
They're…

394
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,958
They're for my hobby.

395
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,626
For my collection.

396
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,005
-You collect these things?
-How should I put it?

397
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,800
Don't you feel stronger
just looking at them?

398
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,971
You're right.

399
00:25:56,054 --> 00:26:00,350
By the way, if you're ever interested
in learning self-defense,

400
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,895
let me know anytime.
I'll teach you a few moves.

401
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,989
Toto must be waiting for you.

402
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,031
Go on.

403
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,160
Wait.

404
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:20,829
What?

405
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,747
Why is he here?

406
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:25,834
Who is that?

407
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:30,380
He used to own the plaza
before Babel took over.

408
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,639
He looks familiar.
I think I've seen him before.

409
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,563
I've just arrived.

410
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,110
Come on, Mom. Stop grilling me.
I understand.

411
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,157
Okay. I'll make sure to say that.

412
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,912
Gosh, I'm busy as is.

413
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,420
Ma'am.

414
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,134
It's been a long time.

415
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,265
I heard they granted
your stay of execution.

416
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,767
Why are you here?

417
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,520
We were once like family.
I ought to visit.

418
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,649
Did the chairman tell you

419
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,737
to check on me and see when I'd die?

420
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,135
That's enough for you to spend
on yourself and pay for the funeral.

421
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,097
Don't waste your breath

422
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,766
on stupid ideas like a retrial.

423
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,602
What's going on here?

424
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,605
Who are you?

425
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,565
He's the son of Chairman Hwang Deok-bae

426
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,861
who died while sexually assaulting me.

427
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,822
Watch what you say.

428
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:23,076
You're President Hwang Min-seong
of Shinkwang Bank.

429
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,620
-Right?
-And who are you?

430
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,622
I'm Ms. Oh's lawyer.

431
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,165
I see.

432
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:35,046
Then you must be the daughter
of the crooked lawyer who died, right?

433
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,426
I'm warning you.

434
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,138
Don't provoke her

435
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,140
and cause a headache.

436
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,232
I think you're the one
who's causing a headache.

437
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,275
What?

438
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,736
Are you okay?

439
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,159
I have something to tell him.

440
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,661
Come here.

441
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,124
Come closer.

442
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,545
Closer.

443
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,923
-You scumbag!
-What are you doing?

444
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,926
You wretched son of a…

445
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,470
Damn you!

446
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,805
-You made me rot in prison.
-Let me go!

447
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,685
-Let me go!
-How dare you visit me on my deathbed?

448
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,937
You shameless bastard!

449
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,063
-Let go!
-Let go!

450
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,357
-Ms. Oh, you shouldn't do this!
-Let go of me!

451
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,442
-Let go!
-Don't!

452
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,215
I'm going to let this pass.

453
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,968
but you better not do anything foolish.

454
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,888
Or I'll kill you all!

455
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,433
Shinkwang Bank's decision
to invest in Babel Group

456
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:15,146
will help the latter, who has been
labeled as an evil company,

457
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,773
get back on their feet.

458
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,693
Since Shinkwang Bank is known
to have high standards in investment,

459
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,989
this decision has caught
the attention of the financial world.

460
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,244
This is absurd.

461
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,705
I thought we finally destroyed them!

462
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,876
That bank refused to give us a loan
three times already.

463
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,003
I'm sure something fishy is going on.

464
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,213
Of course.

465
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,882
Everyone knows that Babel
is hanging on by a thread.

466
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,719
Had I known this,
I would've pulled out more of his hair.

467
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,557
What are you talking about?

468
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,060
President Hwang Min-seong
visited Ms. Oh at the hospital.

469
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,729
-What?
-Right.

470
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,566
He's the son of Chairman Hwang Deok-bae
of Shinkwang Finance.

471
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,111
They're the ones who framed her.

472
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,737
I see.

473
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,824
Why did he visit her?

474
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,868
He knew her stay of execution was granted,

475
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,370
so he threatened her
with an envelope full of money.

476
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,289
He told her not to request a retrial.

477
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,252
He must be no different from his father.

478
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,087
Like father, like son.

479
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,798
Gosh, those petty scumbags.

480
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,594
We have to stop this investment
at all costs.

481
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,805
Both the Babel Group and Shinkwang Bank.

482
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:36,060
We need to screw Shinkwang Bank over
big time for Ms. Oh's sake.

483
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,401
It was really hard sneaking this out.

484
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,653
The security is extremely tight
these days.

485
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,493
You're going to let me work
for that lawyer from Boston, right?

486
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,079
Of course.

487
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,166
If this pans out, I'll transfer you
to their law firm immediately.

488
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,459
Hurry up.

489
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:03,212
After that company dinner,
Ms. Choi keeps making me do impressions.

490
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,464
She won't let me be.

491
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,258
She'd call me drunk and tell me to do it.

492
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,845
She's so annoying.
What does she take you for? A comedian?

493
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,056
-Hey.
-Yes?

494
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,266
Can you do Lee Sun-kyun
from Parasite again?

495
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,851
I've missed it so much.

496
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,439
"This isn't a test,
so drive like you normally do.

497
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,983
-Where can I have some ribs?"
-Goodness.

498
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,693
"I'm craving some ribs.

499
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:30,490
One thing she was good at
was making delicious ribs."

500
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,867
You sound exactly like him!
Hello, Mr. Lee!

501
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,661
"I've been craving some."

502
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,912
PERSONAL INFORMATION
HWANG MIN-SEONG

503
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:40,249
That's personal information
on President Hwang Min-seong.

504
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:44,253
He's been sued for dating abuse
four times.

505
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,339
Dating abuse?

506
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,766
But they're all young men.

507
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,934
Right.

508
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,144
That's just his personal preference.

509
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,523
But what's important is that
dating abuse is a form of violence

510
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,401
no matter the victims' gender.

511
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,111
How did it happen?

512
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:12,699
He'd approach his fellow club members
to date them.

513
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,243
If they refused to do as he said,

514
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,828
he'd assault them.

515
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,497
One man even went blind.

516
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,375
His victims couldn't
go public with the incident

517
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,169
as they were afraid of being outed.

518
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,464
And he wasn't indicted
thanks to Wusang, right?

519
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,300
Yes. Choi Myung-hee
was the prosecutor in charge.

520
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,636
It must have been her and Seung-hyuk.

521
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,638
I see. So…

522
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:42,353
Ms. Choi used this against him
and made Shinkwang save Babel.

523
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,356
However…

524
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,445
this won't be enough
to stop their investment.

525
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,113
I know.

526
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:56,159
But there is a way to stop the investment
and bring down the president.

527
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,119
Is there another way?

528
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,996
We'll use an homme fatale.

529
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,331
A charismatic man who'll bring him down.

530
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,421
-I've looked into it.
-Okay.

531
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,798
President Hwang has an ideal type.

532
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,134
They need to have a pale face

533
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,053
and glistening eyes.

534
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:28,691
They should look young, handsome,
and naturally exude

535
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,402
intelligence.

536
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,254
And lastly--

537
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,382
Stop.

538
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,176
Don't you dare.

539
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,262
A soothing voice
and a composed manner of speech.

540
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,015
What are you looking at?

541
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,309
What are you implying?

542
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,937
I won't do it! I can't!

543
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,730
-Just think about it.
-Don't get mad.

544
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,940
Just think about it.

545
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,359
Don't be ridiculous. This is absurd.

546
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,735
Mr. Nam, block the door!

547
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,362
Get out. I said, get out.

548
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,281
I can't do it! This isn't right!

549
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:22,036
You'll just be acting.
And you're doing this for justice.

550
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,997
I don't care about justice.
I just can't do it.

551
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,041
You don't need to do anything.

552
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,960
He'll just fall for you. Right, Mr. Nam?

553
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,003
I just never told you this,

554
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,381
but, speaking as a man,
you are indeed attractive--

555
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,049
That's enough.

556
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,676
This will work for sure.

557
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,011
We should stop the investment
and avenge Ms. Oh.

558
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,393
Still, I can't.

559
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,354
I can't do this. I can't.

560
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,398
It's ridiculous.

561
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,611
I'll give you instructions
following you around

562
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,114
so that you won't be too flustered.

563
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,283
You can do it.

564
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,041
No. I can't do it!

565
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,794
This just isn't right.

566
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,089
Don't!

567
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,717
No, I can't do it!

568
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,969
SHINKWANG BANK

569
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:25,099
He's an elite who has studied abroad,

570
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,726
but he lacks social skills.

571
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,228
According to Ms. Oh,
he never trusts anyone

572
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,063
and spends most of his time alone.

573
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,108
He's also a hardcore mama's boy

574
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,486
and only listens to his mom, the current
chairwoman of Shinkwang Finance.

575
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,659
Right. He loves horseback riding.

576
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,078
He goes horseback riding once a week.

577
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,622
Nearsen.

578
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,334
Please, listen to me today, will you?

579
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,085
Please.

580
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,341
He must be a stubborn one.

581
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,530
-What's his name?
-Hwang Min-seong.

582
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,203
It's Nearsen.

583
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,414
I see. Nearsen.

584
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,375
He must be Nearco's descendant.

585
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,836
Is he related to Northern Dancer?

586
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,171
Correct.

587
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:24,051
It takes quite some time
to gain their trust.

588
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,471
They're highly distrustful,
so you need patience.

589
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,601
You're very knowledgeable.

590
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:58,878
There was a straw.

591
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:06,302
-May I ride him?
-Sure.

592
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,180
Be as rough as you want.

593
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,500
You startled me. What's wrong?

594
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,502
There was something on you.

595
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,714
He wants to drink tonight.

596
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,718
I don't think I can do it.

597
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:34,098
Just the thought of it makes me shudder.

598
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,350
That's because it's cold. Gosh, it's cold.

599
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,396
You might as well have a drink then.

600
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,191
It'll be easier to win his heart
once he's relaxed.

601
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,484
Forget about…

602
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,614
Forget about winning his heart.
I just can't do this.

603
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,368
You're the Mafia's lawyer.

604
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,245
You're strong and cool-headed.

605
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,622
You never let go of your target.

606
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:03,043
That's your charm, Vincenzo Cassano.

607
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,795
Forget it.

608
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,886
I can do it.

609
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:18,392
You can do it, Vincenzo Cassano.

610
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,854
You are so handsome.

611
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,954
It's dangerous to startle a horse
from behind.

612
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,874
It could kick you. Be careful.

613
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,166
Cheers.

614
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,363
Right.

615
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,201
There are a few things he's fond of,

616
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,247
one of which are one-syllable first names.

617
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,415
TAE HO
ATTORNEY

618
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:05,916
"Tae Ho"?

619
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,095
-You're a lawyer.
-Yes.

620
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,557
I'm running a small law firm called

621
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,574
Do you know how it feels

622
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,912
to meet a complete stranger
and feel like you've met your soulmate?

623
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,560
Yes. I actually…

624
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,188
feel the same way.

625
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,982
You seem older than me.

626
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,526
Brother.

627
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,821
Can I call you that?

628
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:20,949
No.

629
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:26,372
Just call me by my name.

630
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,040
Your name?

631
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:32,753
Okay.

632
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,713
Tae Ho.

633
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,470
I have a condition.

634
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,682
Let's not be business partners.

635
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,018
I want us to just be friends,

636
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,354
Mr. President.

637
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,773
Let's not talk about work.

638
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,955
It feels like
you can see right through me.

639
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,375
That's what I want as well.

640
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,921
-Would you like some?
-Sure.

641
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,472
Let me.

642
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,588
You know what?

643
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,716
I envy you.

644
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:04,344
How could you become the president

645
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:09,933
of the great Shinkwang Bank
at such a young age?

646
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,492
-Tae Ho.
-Yes?

647
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,912
Do you want to know how?

648
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,288
Yes.

649
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:37,169
When my father was the chairman
of Shinkwang Finance,

650
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,922
he was against me becoming
the president of the bank.

651
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,509
But he was a despicable womanizer.

652
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:48,138
Whether they be his employees
or housekeepers,

653
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:53,185
he'd be all over them. Gosh, that geezer.

654
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,981
Then one day,

655
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,693
he was sexually harassing
one of his housekeepers.

656
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,114
She said no and fought back, and…

657
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,371
She pushed him.

658
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:18,418
My mom was secretly watching it happen.

659
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,091
Through a chink in the door.

660
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,269
She was watching?

661
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,230
Yes.

662
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,983
But my dad couldn't get back up.

663
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,777
Do you know what's funnier?

664
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,906
She didn't even bother to call 911.

665
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,201
She let him die.

666
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,834
Would he have lived

667
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,378
had she called?

668
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,338
Yes.

669
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:07,884
The doctor said he could have operated
on him had he come ten minutes sooner.

670
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,974
Why did she

671
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,686
let him die?

672
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:23,775
My mom had always wanted
to lead Shinkwang Finance.

673
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,737
Her wish came true.

674
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,783
What happened to that housekeeper then?

675
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,244
She took the blame and went to jail

676
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,663
for murdering my dad.

677
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,501
Tae Ho.

678
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,378
Yes?

679
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,673
We couldn't let the world know the truth.

680
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,344
After all, my family has
a reputation to uphold, right?

681
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,728
Right.

682
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,731
Your family's reputation.

683
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,655
Min-seong.

684
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,743
Are you free this weekend?

685
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,995
Should we spend it together?

686
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,498
This weekend?

687
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,798
I'm totally free.

688
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:43,438
NANYAK TEMPLE

689
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,943
I don't think there's gold here.

690
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,196
People hide it
in the most unexpected places.

691
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,615
Knock on the wall.

692
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,121
I got mold on my hand.

693
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,792
I think it's right here.

694
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,210
It's either behind this wall,

695
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:50,505
or through that back door.

696
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:51,965
Let's check it out.

697
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:55,677
-Honey.
-Yes?

698
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,596
I think there could be bats in here.

699
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,847
Open it first.

700
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,435
-Honey, turn that off!
-Why?

701
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,104
Turn it off! Hide!

702
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,192
-Lock the door.
-Right.

703
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,615
-You scared me.
-What is this?

704
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,325
-Goodness. Hi.
-Goodness.

705
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,994
Goodness. Fancy seeing you here.

706
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,330
What brings you here?

707
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,664
Me?

708
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,209
I come here all the time.

709
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,669
What about you two?

710
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,089
We had a late-night snack,

711
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,966
-so we were exercising.
-Right.

712
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,843
Why would you exercise here?

713
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,637
Do it somewhere spacious.

714
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,430
-Right.
-Let's go.

715
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,975
Hey, isn't that what they use
at the airport to scan your body?

716
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,228
-A metal detector?
-No.

717
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,273
-It's a massager.
-It…

718
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,317
doesn't look like one.

719
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,278
It's the latest model.
It's an AI massager.

720
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,823
It emits anions
and also works as an antioxidant.

721
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,741
-Goodness.
-Gosh!

722
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:00,659
Toto.

723
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,536
What are you doing?

724
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,372
Well, the building is too dirty.

725
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,749
This is a special type of vacuum.

726
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,960
A vacuum?

727
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:13,338
Isn't that a metal detector?

728
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,631
No, it isn't.

729
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:17,008
It's the latest model.

730
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,886
These magnets attract all the metals
around them.

731
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,973
Toto, didn't you serve at the GOP

732
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,933
and look for mines in the DMZ?

733
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:28,854
No, you got it wrong.
I just played Minesweeper.

734
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,691
-Honey.
-Yes?

735
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,944
Should we go home
now that we're done working out?

736
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,529
-Should we?
-Should we?

737
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,365
-Goodbye, then.
-Goodbye.

738
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,367
I've been massaging myself quite a bit.

739
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,579
I feel more relaxed now. Good night, then.

740
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,039
-Good night.
-Get home safe.

741
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,793
I'm done cleaning as well.

742
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,378
Okay.

743
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,758
MUMU LAND

744
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,801
Hello.

745
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,848
I haven't been this happy in a while.

746
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:08,184
The weather's wonderful,
there's a cool breeze,

747
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,603
and you're here with me.

748
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,649
It's been ages
since I came to one of these places.

749
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,861
-Tae Ho?
-Yes?

750
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:21,740
Let's act like we're kids again
and have a blast.

751
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:22,866
Okay.

752
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,662
Didn't I tell you that he'd fall
head over heels for him?

753
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,290
But the two of them together look like

754
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,959
Beauty and the Beast.

755
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,545
-Tae ho?
-Yes?

756
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:37,881
Let's run!

757
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,972
Here we go!

758
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,975
Let's go, Spaceship Victory!

759
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,352
What is that?

760
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,482
Hello!

761
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,150
Hi!

762
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,197
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

763
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,990
-Hello.
-Hello.

764
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,034
You guys seem so close.

765
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,162
People might think you're lovers!

766
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,831
Oh, come on!

767
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,835
Hello.

768
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:21,091
I'm so happy. I'm having a blast.

769
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,801
Me too.

770
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,770
Oh, no.

771
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,648
I'll hold onto you.

772
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,692
Let me hold you a little.

773
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,402
Hold on.

774
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,322
This is fun.

775
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,865
-It is, right?
-Yes.

776
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,046
What's wrong?

777
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,467
Tae Ho, there's one thing I'm scared of.

778
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,678
Zombies.

779
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:11,474
I watched a zombie movie
for the first time in seventh grade.

780
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,894
I was so traumatized that I had to see
a psychiatrist for a week.

781
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,064
Go away!

782
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,524
I'm sorry.

783
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:23,278
HAUNTED HOUSE

784
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,406
-Then let's go elsewhere.
-Did he leave?

785
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,116
Yes. Let's go.

786
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,580
Let me go. You can let go.

787
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,046
I haven't had such a blast in years.

788
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,971
Why do you look so down?

789
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,474
Did I do something to upset you?

790
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,436
No. I'll drive. Give me the keys.

791
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,275
What's wrong? Tell me.

792
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,782
It's nothing. Give me the keys.

793
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,135
We're not going anywhere
unless you tell me.

794
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:33,848
Go on.

795
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,438
I saw on the news

796
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:45,860
that your bank agreed to invest
in the Babel Group.

797
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,824
Yes, it's true. But what about it?

798
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,494
You know very well how evil they are,
so why would you do that?

799
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,205
You could get hurt because of this…

800
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,086
I'm sorry. I crossed the line.

801
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,423
I had no other choice.

802
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,762
Tae Ho. You don't have to apologize.

803
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,392
I really don't want you to get hurt.

804
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:23,481
I'm truly thankful
that you're worried about me.

805
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,029
I don't think I can see you anymore.

806
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,867
I broke our promise. I talked about work.

807
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,244
I'll leave.

808
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,205
No. No!

809
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:47,755
Tae Ho.

810
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,886
It's okay. You were just worried about me.

811
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,847
No. A promise is a promise.
Don't follow me

812
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,891
or visit my law firm!

813
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,517
-Tae Ho!
-Don't follow me!

814
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:02,520
Don't.

815
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,400
-Hong Cha-young, you…
-Tae Ho…

816
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,205
LAW FIRM ONLY YOU
ATTORNEY, TAE HO

817
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,505
OBNOXIOUS
I NEED YOU BACK IN MY LIFE, TAE HO

818
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:33,468
INCOMING CALL
OBNOXIOUS

819
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:53,738
IT'S RAINING BECAUSE OF YOU

820
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:58,243
MY HEART HAS FROZEN STILL

821
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:04,457
TAE HO, PLEASE THAW MY HEART

822
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,654
Are you finally willing to see me, Tae Ho?

823
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,366
A bank president shouldn't be doing this.

824
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,540
I'm not here as a president,

825
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,126
but as a friend.

826
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,921
And I've made a decision.

827
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,217
Business-related advice?

828
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,678
I'm willing to hear them out.

829
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:03,016
Because I know
you sincerely care about me.

830
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,814
Thank you for understanding me.

831
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,779
Tae Ho, give me advice
regarding the signing ceremony.

832
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:20,783
I'll take everything you tell me
into consideration.

833
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:24,829
Min-seong.

834
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,789
-Yes?
-How about holding the ceremony

835
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,252
at an opera house?

836
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,004
It'll be very dramatic.

837
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,598
Tae Ho.

838
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,727
How do you always come up
with such great ideas?

839
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,106
Min-seong.

840
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:57,362
There's something else I really want.

841
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:15,838
Don't mess it up today.

842
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,841
Don't just sign the agreement.

843
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:20,968
Exude your charisma.

844
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:24,972
-Got that?
-Yes, sir.

845
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,019
Right.

846
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,982
I heard you fired
three directorate members

847
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,442
without my consent.

848
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,405
Well…

849
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,453
I was too enraged.

850
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,749
I fired them
because they were incompetent.

851
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,882
Well done.
I was going to fire them anyway.

852
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,220
But you see,

853
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,016
make sure you ask for my permission
next time.

854
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,896
You're giving me the impression
that you have a lot on your mind.

855
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,483
No, sir. There's not
a single thought in here.

856
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,986
That's why I got emotional.

857
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:22,739
Right?

858
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:25,992
Don't disappoint me.

859
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,786
Of course not, sir.

860
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,874
INVESTMENT AGREEMENT SIGNING CEREMONY

861
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:51,350
Here you go.

862
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,230
Hi.

863
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,151
Did you get a haircut?

864
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:02,028
Yes.

865
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,490
-Let's go.
-Sure.

866
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:12,330
SHINKWANG BANK

867
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:22,465
Oh, my. This is grand.

868
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,258
It's nice.

869
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,767
Isn't that Hong Cha-young?

870
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,684
Who?

871
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,730
What's she doing here?

872
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,817
Hey! Cha-young!

873
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,360
What are you doing there?

874
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,071
Cha-young, why are you here?

875
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,156
-Keep an eye on her.
-Why are you here?

876
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,492
She looks suspicious.

877
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:54,539
I'm here to witness the power of love.

878
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,715
I'm here to witness the power of love.

879
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,095
"Love"?

880
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:13,140
I have a bad feeling about this.

881
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,768
What should I do with her?

882
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,950
He really is one of a kind.

883
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,975
He had his back turned for that.

884
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,102
You're dead meat.

885
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:05,902
We will now begin

886
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:09,572
the investment signing ceremony between
Shinkwang Bank and the Babel Group.

887
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,825
Chairman Jang Han-seo of the Babel Group

888
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:16,829
and President Hwang Min-seong
of Shinkwang Bank will sign the agreement.

889
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,123
BABEL GROUP
CHAIRMAN JANG HAN-SEO

890
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,966
SHINKWANG BANK
PRESIDENT HWANG MIN-SEONG

891
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:55,409
Show me how sincere you are
with your action.

892
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,161
Tae Ho.

893
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,625
Tae Ho.

894
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,718
I LOVE YOU

895
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,429
TAE HO BELIEVES IN YOU

896
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,548
INVESTMENT AGREEMENT

897
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,509
I won't sign this.

898
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,636
What?

899
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,102
My reason is simple.

900
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:07,940
Babel Group is immoral and unreliable.

901
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,109
What do you…

902
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,122
Damn it.

903
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,168
I'll be leaving now.

904
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,294
Thank you for coming.

905
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,837
-Don't go.
-Wait!

906
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:31,964
Who is that?

907
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,565
-Mom.
-You idiot.

908
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:51,400
How dare you ruin this?

909
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,283
Were you aware of this?

910
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:11,629
As the chairwoman,
I will sign the agreement myself.

911
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,884
Mom, let me take care of this.

912
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,010
Be quiet.

913
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,138
Stop disgracing our family name and leave.

914
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,056
Go on!

915
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,073
Damn it.

916
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:41,492
Your son has many weaknesses,

917
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,870
so he may fall into a trap.

918
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,998
Just to be safe,

919
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,418
I would like you to lead the ceremony.

920
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:57,007
Why should I listen to you?

921
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,513
Issues related to your son
and your deceased husband…

922
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:07,143
I have many stories to tell about them.

923
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:12,106
It's humorous to see a lowly wench
blabbering just because she studied law.

924
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,615
Then should this lowly wench

925
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,289
keep her stories to herself

926
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,457
or bring them out in the open?

927
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,274
Why are you still here?

928
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:22,301
NOT BAD

929
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,681
"Not bad"? What an impudent jerk.

930
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:47,076
-What? Who are you?
-Be quiet.

931
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,078
Who are you? What are you doing?

932
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,288
Let me go! Let me go right now! No!

933
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,666
Goodness.

934
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,961
-Oh, no.
-Tae Ho!

935
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:02,007
Damn it!

936
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:10,599
Let go of me! Let go!

937
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:11,850
Do you want to die?

938
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:15,562
How dare you? Let me go right now!
What's going on?

939
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:18,440
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

940
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,194
Wait!

941
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:25,364
DRESSING ROOM

942
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,784
-Scream!
-Open up!

943
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,494
-Open the door!
-Raise your voice!

944
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:32,288
-Scream!
-Scream!

945
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,833
Please open the door.

946
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:38,460
Mister?

947
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:39,920
I'm scared.

948
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:41,505
Mister!

949
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:05,654
What's the most heartless way
to take revenge on someone?

950
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,033
Using what they fear the most.

951
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:14,580
It could be more painful
than death itself for some.

952
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:24,298
-Wait.
-This is difficult.

953
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:25,966
We'll be filming tomorrow.

954
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,469
You'll get fired
if you don't put more soul into it.

955
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:31,305
But zombies don't have souls
to begin with.

956
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:35,059
As extras, we won't even get paid
that much.

957
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,810
Why do you expect so much from us?

958
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:39,605
Sir, I think I truly know what acting is.

959
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:43,650
I feel electricity
flowing through my body.

960
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:44,985
-Really?
-Yes.

961
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:47,738
If it's that electrifying,
keep practicing.

962
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:49,990
Five, six. Look in the mirror.

963
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:55,329
Like this.

964
01:12:57,831 --> 01:13:02,127
I have an even more electrifying offer.
Are you interested?

965
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,463
Excuse me.

966
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,049
Ma'am.

967
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:15,974
Ma'am?

968
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:18,435
Excuse me.

969
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:21,980
What?

970
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,405
I'm so pretty.

971
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:45,963
Tteokbokki.

972
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:51,009
-Hey, dig in.
-No!

973
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:52,970
Don't!

974
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:57,808
REHEARSING
DO NOT ENTER OR KNOCK! SILENCE!

975
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,815
Help me!

976
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:16,326
Good work. Let's go.

977
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:20,038
-They're Welsh corgis. Alkong and Dalkong.
-I see.

978
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:23,500
Hi, Alkong. You too, Dalkong.

979
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,378
-Thank you for everything, ma'am.
-My pleasure.

980
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:29,506
I hope we continue this friendship.

981
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,135
We should have a meal together.

982
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:36,388
Sure. I'll set a date soon.

983
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:39,266
You looked gorgeous today.

984
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:43,145
When I saw you enter,
I was totally mesmerized.

985
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,439
Thank you. I hope we get along.

986
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:46,982
We'll set a date for that meal.

987
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:52,112
He scared me.

988
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,697
What's wrong with him?

989
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,035
You darn brat! What are you doing?

990
01:14:58,118 --> 01:14:59,703
That's your son.

991
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:02,998
-What's going on?
-Sir.

992
01:15:03,957 --> 01:15:07,085
I'm scared. It was so scary.

993
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:13,133
Tae Ho?

994
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,220
Tae Ho?

995
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:20,432
Tae Ho…

996
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,101
Tae Ho.

997
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:25,604
Tae Ho.

998
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,024
I'm so scared.

999
01:15:29,107 --> 01:15:30,943
-Move aside!
-I'm so scared.

1000
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:33,695
I said, move aside.

1001
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,405
Mr. Hwang Min-seong.

1002
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,535
You're under arrest for assault
and blackmail.

1003
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:42,579
-What? On what grounds?
-What?

1004
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:46,375
We received a tip-off from a man
named Vincenzo Cassano.

1005
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,585
"Vincenzo Casanova"?

1006
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,588
What kind of name is that?

1007
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,549
-Why aren't you taking him?
-What?

1008
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:59,471
-Get over here!
-You can't do this, ma'am.

1009
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,848
You can't arrest him.
He's done nothing wrong.

1010
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:04,935
-Do you even know who I am?
-Vincenzo Cassano.

1011
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:09,565
That's me.

1012
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:14,361
-I said, let go.
-This is an obstruction of justice.

1013
01:16:15,028 --> 01:16:19,241
I believe I grabbed you by the hair
like this.

1014
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,538
How dare you touch my son?

1015
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:26,498
Please, stay still.

1016
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,333
Tae Ho.

1017
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,294
-This is wrong.
-How dare you cuff him?

1018
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,296
Hurry up and take him!

1019
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:34,840
Move aside!

1020
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,133
Tae Ho!

1021
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,759
Lawyer Choi!

1022
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,470
Yes, ma'am.
I'll take care of it right away.

1023
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:43,348
I'll go first. Take care of this
and bring him home!

1024
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:46,059
Tae Ho!

1025
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:49,438
Tae Ho!

1026
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:53,859
-Don't worry about your son.
-Goodbye, ma'am.

1027
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:56,403
What's going on?

1028
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,658
There weren't enough reporters,
so I called some more.

1029
01:17:02,242 --> 01:17:03,577
Come here.

1030
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,579
Who do you think you're messing with?

1031
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:08,206
Sir. Calm down.

1032
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:14,963
Sir.

1033
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,593
You looked way smarter
when you were working out.

1034
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:21,303
Why you little…

1035
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:24,014
Sir. Calm down. Okay?

1036
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:30,979
I should've known that something was up.

1037
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:35,108
I guess you learned something
through your consecutive losses.

1038
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:40,906
We were going easy on you
not to trample your hopes and dreams.

1039
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,075
You should be grateful.

1040
01:17:44,242 --> 01:17:48,705
Aren't you being a bit too cocky
for winning this one round?

1041
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,459
Next time you get an investment,
keep your wallet safe.

1042
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,170
Because I'll be robbing you soon.

1043
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:59,383
Be my guest. Before that happens,
I'll rip you all apart.

1044
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:01,343
You should really watch out.

1045
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:06,056
I've sharpened up my blade just for you.

1046
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:09,476
Don't even bother
with that crusty old thing.

1047
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:11,353
Just play the violin on the Titanic.

1048
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:14,648
We've already escaped on a lifeboat.
Sad news for you.

1049
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:17,192
Yes. The rich people
were the first to escape.

1050
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:19,319
It might be better if you stayed on board.

1051
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,696
There might be sharks.

1052
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:23,949
Then it'll be Jaws, and not Titanic.

1053
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,200
That's it.

1054
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,455
Gosh, she's unbelievable.

1055
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,959
Your father…

1056
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:51,476
If you don't want to end up like him,

1057
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:56,273
you should keep quiet and lie low.

1058
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:02,529
Ms. Hong.

1059
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:16,251
Reporters! Gather around!

1060
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:25,427
I am…

1061
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,682
the daughter of the late Hong Yu-chan,
a lawyer who died in vain

1062
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:33,560
while fighting against Babel.

1063
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:36,480
I'm Lawyer Hong Cha-young.

1064
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:44,237
Jipuragi Law Firm will expose
every single corrupt deed

1065
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:49,159
that the Babel Group has committed.

1066
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:56,500
Including Babel's connection
with the prosecution.

1067
01:19:56,583 --> 01:20:01,087
Reporters, this small-scale law firm
is spreading false rumors

1068
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:03,089
just to storm up some controversy.

1069
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:05,801
-Whatever.
-Kim Seong-il from CBN here.

1070
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:07,427
Could you elaborate

1071
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:10,138
what you mean by "corrupt deeds"?

1072
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:13,141
Do you mean they did something illegal?

1073
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:16,019
Are you saying the Babel Group
and the prosecution have colluded?

1074
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:18,814
-What kinds of deeds?
-Please elaborate.

1075
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,318
Write to us if you have any questions.

1076
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:26,530
If you ask any more questions,
I'll regard that as a form of assault.

1077
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,073
Please make way. Let's go.

1078
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,282
Mr. Han.

1079
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,673
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM SUNG-CHEOL
AND LIM CHAE-MOO

1080
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:54,784
Director Gil knows who it is.

1081
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,704
They're bound to leave traces
even if they're invisible.

1082
01:21:57,787 --> 01:21:58,747
That's our chance.

1083
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:01,583
Don't worry about me.

1084
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,711
Who do you think gave the orders?

1085
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:07,631
It's someone who was working alone.

1086
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:10,508
I just have to promise
not to kill you, right?

1087
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,470
I'll change things to the way it once was
starting today.

1088
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:15,972
And I'll show them
what they're up against.

1089
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:18,808
I won't make him pay for it.

1090
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:21,811
I'll kill him right away when I find him.

1091
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:27,609
