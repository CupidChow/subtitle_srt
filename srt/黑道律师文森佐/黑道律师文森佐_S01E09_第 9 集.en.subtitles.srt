1
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,229
Are you saying the Babel Group
and the prosecution have colluded?

2
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,024
-What kinds of deeds?
-Please elaborate.

3
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,528
Write to us if you have any questions.

4
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,865
If you ask any more questions,
I'll regard that as a form of assault.

5
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,283
Please make way. Let's go.

6
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,493
Mr. Han.

7
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,963
Joon-woo.

8
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:15,426
Why do you keep going easy on them?
We can just get rid of them.

9
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,637
-I never went easy on them.
-Pardon?

10
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,099
I never went easy on them.

11
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,893
They got us because they are smart.

12
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,270
Then…

13
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,232
Then, shouldn't we
have gotten rid of them sooner?

14
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,651
Why would I get rid of
such good partners so soon?

15
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,944
"Partners"?

16
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:37,282
They are my sparring partners
who make me stronger.

17
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,911
The day I get rid of Vincenzo

18
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,539
will be the day when I've defeated him.

19
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,752
We wasted such a great opportunity.

20
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,712
EPISODE 9

21
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,257
The investment agreement
almost went up in smoke.

22
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,427
Be happy we paid the bank president
back for what they did to Ms. Oh.

23
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,137
We're even now. It's not so bad.

24
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,139
Bullseye.

25
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,853
Oh, right. I'm visiting Ms. Oh tomorrow.
Do you want to come with me?

26
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,940
I'll check my schedule.

27
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,654
Gosh. Single points. Why can't I get that?

28
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:20,033
At this point, there's something
we must direct our attention to.

29
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,784
The real boss of Babel, right?

30
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,287
I thought he might show himself
if things went south,

31
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,955
but they bounced back again.

32
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,583
Evil bounces back faster than good.

33
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,710
And every time they do,
they become stronger.

34
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:34,130
What should we use
to draw out the real boss?

35
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,884
They're bound to leave traces
even if they're invisible.

36
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,594
That's our chance.

37
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,682
From now on, we'll call Babel's boss
"Babo" for short.

38
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,019
I like it. Babo.

39
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,283
If she has a family, you should tell them
as soon as possible.

40
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,745
Those with a history of cancer must
pay special attention to their health.

41
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,746
This is unfortunate.

42
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,957
Did she have cancer in the past?

43
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,377
Yes. She had lung cancer before.

44
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,172
When was that?

45
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,969
She was diagnosed with lung cancer
in January of 1993.

46
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,096
It was Stage Three lung cancer.

47
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,474
But it says it was completely cured
four years later without surgery.

48
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,228
Stage Three cancer being cured
without surgery?

49
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,146
It's like a miracle.

50
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:47,412
She was diagnosed with lung cancer
in January of 1993,

51
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,333
and she left me at the orphanage
in May of 1993.

52
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,087
Did she really abandon me
because she was sick?

53
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,090
Because she thought she might die on me?

54
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,701
No one is here today.

55
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,660
Yes.

56
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,996
They give up so easily.

57
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,112
I get the feeling that it's over there.

58
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,990
That's the most deserted place
in our building.

59
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,283
Right.

60
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,119
Are you here to rob the safe?

61
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,496
Why bring a stethoscope?

62
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,081
I couldn't come empty-handed.

63
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,665
Doesn't this look cool?

64
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,335
First, let's find the gold bars.

65
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,055
Gosh, they're trying so hard.

66
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,519
By the way, the monks aren't here.

67
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,689
I guess they are
true believers of Buddhism.

68
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,983
TAROT READING AND FORTUNE TELLING

69
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,660
Sir.

70
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,539
Are you sure we can find gold
with the dowsing rods?

71
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,292
Like water, gold also has chi.

72
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,921
We can detect the gold's chi
with these dowsing rods.

73
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:02,922
I see.

74
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:08,970
By the way, I wonder if it's okay
for us to chase worldly things like this.

75
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,972
Chase worldly things?

76
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,933
Even if we find gold,
we will not take it ourselves.

77
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,560
You know that.

78
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,772
Right. We decided to donate all of
the money for children with rare diseases.

79
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,817
We are not chasing after money.

80
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,111
We are trying to practice
Buddha's generosity.

81
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,362
Yes, sir.

82
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,407
Sir!

83
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,201
What is it?

84
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,500
I stepped on the Death card.

85
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,170
Get lost, you Western maguni!

86
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,464
MAGUNI, EVIL INCARNATE IN BUDDHISM

87
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,011
Oh, my God!

88
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,696
Again!

89
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,837
Go.

90
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,842
Go away.

91
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,220
Go away. Get out of here.

92
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,182
Please.

93
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,850
Please, go away.

94
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,944
Get lost! Get away from here!

95
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,575
You really are stubborn, aren't you?

96
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,536
You just like this spot, don't you?

97
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,663
Okay. Fine.

98
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,749
Just don't coo when I'm sleeping. Got it?

99
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't.

100
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,132
From now on, your name is

101
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,302
Inzaghi.

102
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,264
Hey, Inzaghi. Don't coo. Okay?

103
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,037
Hello, sir.

104
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,092
Director Gil Jong-moon?

105
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,970
Yes. After breaking the contract with us,

106
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,306
he requested the prosecution
for protection.

107
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,516
What's he scheming with the prosecution?

108
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,936
We haven't found that out yet.

109
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,693
Who's the prosecutor in charge?

110
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,989
It's Prosecutor Jung In-kuk
of the Namdongbu Prosecution Service.

111
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,366
-You'll be safe here.
-Jung In-kuk?

112
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,826
His name sounds familiar.

113
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:23,205
He targeted and investigated Babel
when your father was the chairman.

114
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,582
So he's a headache, right?

115
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,043
Yes. He doesn't listen to anyone

116
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,836
including the chief prosecutor.

117
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:33,090
It's like his ears are made of iron,
so his nickname is Iron Ears.

118
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,136
He was transferred to Mokpo
but he came back last week.

119
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,097
Damn it.

120
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,440
This is Jang Joon-woo speaking.

121
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,902
This is Gil Jong-moon.

122
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,820
Mr. Gil.

123
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,198
Come on, don't do this to us.

124
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,283
I need to make a few demands.

125
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,994
Just name anything. I'll give it to you.

126
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,288
First, don't kill me.

127
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,791
I never tried to kill you.

128
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,250
You'll try soon enough.

129
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,419
I'm the only one who knows who you are.

130
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,049
Okay.

131
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,843
I just have to promise
not to kill you, right?

132
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:22,348
And wire 30 million US dollars
to the account of my choice.

133
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,975
Once I get the money,
I'll leave without saying a word.

134
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,727
And if you don't give me the money,

135
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,814
I will tell the prosecutor
who you really are and what you did…

136
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,275
to your father.

137
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,903
Gosh. I got it.

138
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,531
The account number…

139
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,868
No, text me the account number.

140
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:47,456
And it will take a few days to launder
30 million dollars before I wire it.

141
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,750
I'm sure you know that.

142
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,045
Yes, Mr. Gil. I'll be in touch.

143
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,590
He asked for 30 million dollars?

144
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,135
Gosh, that asshole.

145
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:20,865
Don't you want any?

146
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,826
Why are you eating burnt food?
It's not good for you.

147
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,786
This much is fine.

148
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,581
Here.

149
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,249
Have the part that's not burnt.

150
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,339
I bet it's good.

151
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,221
As long as I don't have the burnt parts,
this should be fine.

152
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,726
I printed the document.

153
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,061
-Nice. Thank you.
-Thanks.

154
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,523
This is the file the police have
on Jang Han-seok,

155
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,150
Jang Han-seo's older brother.

156
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,360
His American name is Henry Jang.

157
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,242
"Babo."

158
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,120
What?

159
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,040
Does this mean
that Jang Han-seo's brother is Babo?

160
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,042
We're not sure about that.

161
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,002
We're looking into his family first.

162
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,672
Since he left for the states 15 years ago,

163
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,216
he hasn't come back to Korea.

164
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,635
He became an artist
after majoring in arts.

165
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,428
We don't know where he is now.

166
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,096
Gosh. What a free spirit.

167
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,891
He must have no interest in the company.

168
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,019
When did the former chairman,
Jang Guk-hwan, die?

169
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,062
Two years ago.

170
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,523
That means he didn't even come
to his dad's funeral.

171
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,274
He didn't attend his dad's funeral?

172
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,401
What an awful son.

173
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,030
Oh, no! We can't have sweet potatoes
while working on an important case.

174
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,032
It'll bring a roadblock to our plan.

175
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,078
Isn't that a superstition?

176
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,665
I made sure not to have seaweed soup
whenever I had important exams.

177
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,416
Thanks to that, I passed every exam.

178
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,585
But Wusang and Babel are the ones

179
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,296
who have messed up their plan,
aren't they?

180
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,714
I don't care about them.

181
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,967
Gosh, this doesn't feel right.
I'll stop eating.

182
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,892
I'm going to see Ms. Oh now.

183
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,112
Don't forget we have a meeting
with the victims' families later.

184
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,447
Oh, I almost forgot. See you later.

185
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,620
Oh, right.

186
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,914
About Ms. Oh…

187
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,792
I ran a background check on her,

188
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,753
but she doesn't have
any family members to call.

189
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,841
Things would have been so much better
if she had a child.

190
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,927
No. Even if she did, they wouldn't go.
So many kids are undutiful.

191
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,805
Seriously. There's no point raising kids.

192
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,891
They deserve to be punished.

193
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,560
You don't want it?

194
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,772
I'll have it then.

195
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,611
-Mr. Nam.
-Yes?

196
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,613
Do you have to make such a mess?

197
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,741
Wipe your mouth.

198
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,200
Thank you so much.

199
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,786
You're such a messy eater.

200
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,415
I'm sorry I'm not as tidy as you are.

201
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:21,045
I'm glad to hear that. They deserved it.

202
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,257
Thank you so much.

203
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,259
It was all Mr. Cassano.

204
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,303
I just helped him a bit.

205
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,806
Thanks to you,

206
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:38,187
things are turning out
so much better for me.

207
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,899
And Mr. Cassano is paying
for this room, too.

208
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,611
Oh, no. I feel horrible.

209
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,033
I feel so ashamed to stay here any longer.

210
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,580
Hello, doctor.

211
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,165
Hello, Ms. Oh.

212
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,002
-How are you feeling?
-Good.

213
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,838
I heard you didn't want to be
medicated overnight.

214
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,465
Well…

215
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,803
I feel nauseous when I have them.

216
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,430
I've managed fine without them.

217
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,349
Then do as you want and--

218
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,226
How could you say that?

219
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,733
Is this a resort?
She shouldn't be doing as she wants.

220
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,237
That's not what I meant.

221
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,824
Besides, shouldn't you check yourself
if the patient is having

222
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,993
her meal or not?

223
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,329
Look. She didn't touch her food.

224
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,622
I was getting to that.

225
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,584
Look at these awful side dishes.

226
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,005
Do you expect her to eat them?
Would you eat them?

227
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,257
I'm not a nutritionist,
so that's not my area.

228
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,175
Right. You're a doctor.

229
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,637
How can you not prescribe pain meds
just because the patient said no?

230
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,140
-That was my--
-Don't say anything, Ms. Oh.

231
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,144
We've held back from medicating her

232
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,729
because of the side effects.

233
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,605
Look at her! She needs her meds now!

234
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,566
That's enough. Stop it.

235
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,276
Why are you getting all worked up?

236
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,902
Ms. Oh.

237
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,405
Why are you even here at the hospital?

238
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,531
Why?

239
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,992
Don't be stubborn
and do what the doctors tell you.

240
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,952
Okay.

241
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,913
Mr. Cassano.

242
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,959
I'm sorry. Sorry.

243
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,632
Please be understanding.

244
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,010
He has a lot on his plate these days.

245
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,095
That was quite scary,

246
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,686
but strangely enough, it felt nice.

247
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:50,069
Sir, I had meetings with the presidents of
Dongil and Taesan Banks this morning.

248
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,322
Both of them won't invest in Babel.

249
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,741
Even when Shinkwang Bank
is investing in Babel?

250
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:59,536
It's because of what Hong Cha-young
said to the reporters yesterday.

251
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,872
They lost their faith in Babel.

252
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,875
I warned you about this.
If we got rid of Vincenzo

253
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,251
and Hong Cha-young--

254
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,171
I'm saying this because I'm on your side!

255
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,381
Don't raise your voice at me.

256
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,968
You're scaring me.

257
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,640
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Tell you what.

258
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,768
I'll set up a meeting with
the Namdongbu office tonight.

259
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,186
Don't be late.

260
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,813
Okay.

261
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,781
He didn't even bat an eye
when he killed Dad. Why hesitate now?

262
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,248
Get me Mr. Lee from the Strategy Division.

263
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,379
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

264
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,632
Gosh, it looks so good.

265
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,967
Thank you.

266
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,595
We made a reservation
at a Chinese restaurant in a hotel,

267
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,931
but Mr. Nam changed the restaurant.

268
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,059
This restaurant is the real deal.
You have to try this.

269
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,978
The food here is so good.

270
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,607
They should keep this place a secret.

271
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,364
My gosh. This is so good!

272
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,576
It's like I'm in heaven right now.

273
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,037
How should I put it?
It tastes like tomato pasta.

274
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,456
It's the taste of Mr. Cassano's hometown.

275
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,167
Right.

276
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,670
We should have done this sooner.
We're sorry that it took this long.

277
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,714
That's okay.

278
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:39,094
By the way, I heard that there was
a small commotion last week.

279
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,512
Yes.

280
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,223
The shareholders of Babel Pharmaceuticals

281
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:49,313
came to our meeting and caused a scene
blaming us for the stock price going down.

282
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:52,983
Luckily, they just cursed at us and left.

283
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,486
They're such sociopaths.

284
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,947
They don't care about people
who were wronged.

285
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,534
"I'm sick of it. Stop it.
Stop using your late family."

286
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,204
We're used to hearing that now.

287
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,039
You can't get used to that.

288
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,250
Call me when you've been mistreated.
I'll help you right away.

289
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,337
Thank you.

290
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,425
Try the food. It's really good.

291
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,681
I should have invited you sooner,
but things have been hectic.

292
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,560
I bet. Your company is a mess right now.

293
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,438
Yes. I made some mistakes.

294
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,822
Anyway, I hope we will have
a fruitful partnership.

295
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,575
I think you are mistaken.

296
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,745
We are not your partners.
We are doing this under a contract.

297
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,831
I'm saying our interests must align
for this to last long.

298
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,041
Mr. Seo, please.

299
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,212
I believe I've given you enough
to guarantee that.

300
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,131
But that doesn't give you the right
to walk all over us.

301
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,217
If you disrespect us in any way,

302
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,428
we can charge you whenever we want.
Are we clear?

303
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,517
Yes. I'll keep that in mind.

304
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:13,647
Now that we're on the same boat,
why don't you give us words of blessing?

305
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,608
Gosh, Myung-hee. You acted
as if you could never be bought off,

306
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,652
but you're like a saleswoman now.

307
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,153
That suits you.

308
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,868
I think today is such a historical day.

309
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,620
Right? Don't you agree?

310
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,125
We'll have to see if this historical day
will bring us glory

311
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,668
or humiliation.

312
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,298
I will stay humble and do my best.

313
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,675
I appreciate your help.

314
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,595
Don't do your best.
That makes me uncomfortable.

315
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,267
Okay.

316
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,604
Mr. Hwang, may I pour you a drink?

317
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,276
I think I could be as old as your uncle.

318
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,820
-I can get this with one hand, right?
-Yes. Of course.

319
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,780
MARIONETTE

320
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,074
Pour one for him, too.

321
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,160
-Of course.
-What's up with these geezers?

322
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:11,246
-Allow me to pour you a drink.
-They don't know their place.

323
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,918
Do you enjoy drinking often?

324
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,591
Get home safely, Mr. Hwang, Mr. Seo.

325
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,802
Thanks. And talk to Myung-hee,
your saleswoman,

326
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,513
if you need anything.

327
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,599
Let me know through her.

328
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,850
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

329
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,352
Okay. Do a good job. Let's go.

330
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,189
-Good night.
-Good night.

331
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,491
Let's have an after-party. Follow my car.

332
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,159
Pardon?

333
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,703
What does he want?

334
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,166
I don't know. Well, he told us
to follow him, so we should.

335
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,250
Let's go.

336
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,838
You know, Myung-hee

337
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,674
is a saleswoman of Seocho-dong now.

338
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,928
So we just need to keep her
under our thumb.

339
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,806
She was better off
when she was working for us.

340
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,767
-Gosh. Right.
-But that bitch didn't know that.

341
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,519
-Hey!
-Hey.

342
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,854
-Hey. Are you crazy?
-What is this?

343
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,356
Can't you drive properly?

344
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,233
-I'm sorry.
-Who are they?

345
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,651
What?

346
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,570
-Who are they? Hey, what's going on?
-What?

347
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,198
-What?
-Hey. Damn it.

348
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,076
Let go of me.

349
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,912
Who the hell are you?

350
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,163
Who the heck are you?

351
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,041
-Do you think who we are?
-Hey.

352
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,112
Are those bastards…

353
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,572
Are they thieves?

354
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,533
I bet Mr. Cassano has a lot of valuables.

355
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,577
Keep an eye on them.

356
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,287
I'll go and get the master key.

357
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,371
By myself?

358
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,583
Be careful.

359
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,060
I do not want to hurt you.

360
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,146
So just leave.

361
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,399
Gosh, look at these thieves.

362
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:46,318
How dare you steal from people?

363
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,237
You should make an honest living. Okay?

364
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,242
-Honey.
-How dare you push my wife?

365
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,410
Yeon-jin.

366
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,079
I don't think I can hold back anymore.

367
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,249
I will only use 10 percent of my powers.

368
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,250
No, honey!

369
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:17,766
Please help me.

370
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,685
Did you think I'd beg for my life?

371
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,272
Come on. You've exposed my ears.

372
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,736
You scumbag. All right. Here it goes.

373
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:37,911
You know what? I'll stretch
my hip today. It's been a while.

374
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:41,873
Clean…

375
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,627
and jerk.

376
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,468
You still got it, Yeon-jin.

377
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,265
-Look at these punks. How dare you…
-What?

378
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,811
-Honey.
-Honey.

379
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,064
-Yes. I got him.
-I got him!

380
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,566
My goodness.

381
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,153
We should meet again
when the weather warms up.

382
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,780
We should go on a picnic.

383
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:19,619
Actually, the four of us decided
to go on a trip to Jindo next week.

384
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,080
That's a great destination.

385
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,083
When you're there, send me a bottle
of matrimony vine wine.

386
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,627
Sure.

387
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,130
-Have a safe trip.
-Have a fun trip.

388
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,172
Thanks.

389
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,301
Mr. Cassano.

390
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,263
Thank you so much.

391
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,850
Gosh.

392
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,985
-Have a safe trip.
-Okay.

393
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,907
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

394
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,701
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

395
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,912
-Mr. Nam!
-Gosh.

396
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,498
-Gosh. Get in here, Mr. Nam.
-Okay.

397
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,167
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

398
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,044
-Thank you.
-Sure.

399
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,503
-Bye.
-Okay.

400
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,797
-Bye.
-Thank you.

401
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,591
-Safe travels.
-Okay.

402
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:22,307
I hope the victims' families
will only have happiness in their lives.

403
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,561
I also hope that, but they won't be able
to forget the pain that easily.

404
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:28,897
That's true.

405
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,775
I just hope happiness can mask the pain.

406
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,528
You should go in.

407
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,866
Thank you for driving me home.

408
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,369
I just dropped you off
on my way to buy wine.

409
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,246
But there's a big wine shop
across Geumga Plaza.

410
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,999
They don't have the wine I want.

411
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,251
So I'm going to the shop near here.

412
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,879
-It's probably closed by now.
-I can go tomorrow then.

413
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,717
Good night.

414
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:25,954
Hold on.

415
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,499
Wait. There are so many tools
you can choose from. Why a hammer?

416
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,295
Maybe you don't know this,
but I'm a blackbelt.

417
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,756
Third-degree in taekwondo,
second in jiu-jitsu and in hapkido.

418
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,007
A total of eight degrees!

419
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,009
It's seven.

420
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,971
Right. Seven. Three, two, and two. Seven!

421
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,349
So if you come at me,
you won't stand a chance!

422
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,809
Don't come near me!

423
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,936
No, don't come near me!

424
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,734
Hey! My gosh!

425
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,944
Don't come near me.

426
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,573
Hey, we have a problem.

427
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,456
-What is it?
-Damn it.

428
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,250
It's me.

429
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,600
What's that?

430
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,727
Go and scratch your back. Over there.

431
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:37,776
I mean, if you were trying to tail us,
you shouldn't have made it so obvious.

432
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,069
You weren't trying, were you?

433
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,530
-Let's go.
-Okay.

434
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,912
My goodness.

435
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,706
02K 0416

436
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,465
02K 0416

437
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,271
Are you okay?

438
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,491
Those bastards…

439
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,702
Wait. No. Don't go after them.

440
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,246
I'm scared to be alone.

441
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,206
We have to find out who sent them.

442
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,999
It's obvious who sent them.

443
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,090
What's wrong with me?

444
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,883
I should've had more chicken.

445
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,010
My legs feel like jelly.

446
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,894
Mr. Hwang?

447
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,148
-Hey, Jang.
-Yes, that's me.

448
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,360
Do you know what you're doing right now?

449
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:07,448
You've kidnapped two high-ranking
prosecutors. You know what that means?

450
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,994
You shouldn't have
treated me like that earlier.

451
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,122
You took me for a pushover
since I was being nice.

452
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,832
Mr. Jang…

453
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,835
Did Chairman Jang Joon-woo
sign off on this?

454
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,298
Yes. He told me to shake them up,
so they can come to their senses.

455
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,215
Okay.

456
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,971
You're making a huge mistake right now.

457
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,768
It's you who made a huge mistake.

458
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,105
You took my money,

459
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,107
so you should know to respect and obey me.

460
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,401
Hey! Do you want me to teach you a lesson?

461
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,695
How dare you pull
this amateur stunt on us?

462
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,699
Expect your company to be destroyed
starting tomorrow.

463
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,618
Myung-hee, untie me now. My arms hurt.

464
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,995
-Seung-hyuk, untie me now!
-Okay.

465
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,205
-Do it now!
-Gosh, be quiet, will you?

466
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,917
Why are you such crybabies?

467
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,356
And who the hell is this?

468
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,519
Please spare me!

469
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,812
Sir.

470
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,815
Please spare me, sir!

471
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,738
Is he dead?

472
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,990
I guess he is.

473
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,588
I won't kill you first.

474
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,050
Who do you think is next?

475
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:36,514
Your son in Italy
who is terrible at football!

476
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,727
Sir! I was too arrogant!

477
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,354
Please forgive me. I was wrong!

478
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,606
Sir, you have my respect!

479
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,942
I'm begging you. Please.

480
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,028
I'm showing my respect to you.

481
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:54,198
I respect you. Please don't kill my son.
Please don't kill him.

482
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,826
Please don't kill him. Please.

483
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:06,586
See that? You should've listened…

484
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,756
when you had the chance.

485
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,488
You should have given us a heads-up.

486
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,408
Isn't this nice?

487
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,161
With all due respect, sir,

488
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,955
this could be a huge problem later on.

489
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,085
Nothing's a problem for me
as long as I don't feel like shit.

490
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,509
Why won't it come off?

491
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,892
I'll change things to the way it once was
starting today.

492
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,605
And I'll show them
what they're up against.

493
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,441
I'll do as you say, sir.

494
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,402
I'll do my best, too.

495
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,696
Yes.

496
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,244
Gosh, Han-seo.

497
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,748
I want you to fatten up
the security around yourself.

498
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,334
You're my Achilles heel.

499
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,213
Yes, sir. I'll do that.

500
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,988
I'm sure it's either Babel or Wusang.

501
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,615
Who do you think gave the orders?

502
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,660
It's someone who was working alone.

503
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,579
It was rushed and sloppy.

504
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,372
Who on earth would want…

505
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,917
Do they think
everything will go away if I die?

506
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,838
I don't think killing you was their goal.
It must've been to maim you.

507
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,381
What?

508
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,633
He had a hammer.

509
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,305
If they wanted to kill you, they would've
strangled you or stabbed your stomach.

510
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,973
-Or--
-Stop it.

511
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,395
Stay somewhere else tonight.

512
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,356
The window is broken,
and you can't rest here.

513
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,611
Okay. I'll stay with a friend.

514
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,906
Okay. That would be better.

515
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,419
What is it?

516
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,756
Call them.

517
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,314
No.

518
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:16,609
No?

519
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,903
Not a chance.

520
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,166
The person you have dialed
cannot come to the phone right now.

521
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,543
Please, call again later.

522
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:46,264
I have late-night service at church today.

523
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,182
Damn it.

524
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,977
It's been 30 minutes.
You still haven't found anyone?

525
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,190
I guess everyone is busy.

526
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,734
Or they still don't want
to associate with you.

527
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,821
I can just sleep at a hotel.

528
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,407
Won't you be scared alone?

529
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,869
"Scared"? My gosh. I don't believe this.

530
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,580
Do you think I'm going to start
seeing and hearing things?

531
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,582
From what I saw earlier, you may.

532
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,713
I was scared
because I was startled earlier.

533
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,675
But my mind is as strong as iron now.

534
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,856
I know today was a tough day.

535
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,816
Thanks.

536
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,931
Call me if anything happens.

537
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,157
Don't worry about me.

538
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,857
Hello and welcome.

539
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:22,962
Gosh.

540
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,007
Why are they giving me that weird look?

541
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,766
Excuse me.

542
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,145
That's my room. What are you doing?

543
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,690
They said the lock wasn't working.

544
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,444
You almost slept with an unlocked door.

545
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,790
Ma'am, it's done!

546
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,585
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

547
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,671
We went into your home
without your permission.

548
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,383
You don't have to apologize.
I should thank you.

549
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,553
They didn't look like ordinary thieves.

550
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,097
I think they were waiting for you.

551
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,559
I had no idea that they had a gas pistol.

552
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,438
-It was quite strong.
-My hunch is that they were hitmen.

553
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:26,025
I am certain that he is in danger.

554
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:30,404
Do you think Babel or Park Seok-do
sent them?

555
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,991
No way. If they did,
they would have sent professionals.

556
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,452
Seeing how Mr. Lee could chase them away,

557
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,995
they must be just petty thieves.

558
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,955
They were professionals.

559
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,459
I could feel it the moment I grabbed them.

560
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,129
They were definitely pros.

561
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,924
Anyway, thank you.

562
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,302
I doubt they'll come back.
Get some rest now.

563
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,095
-Wait.
-Okay.

564
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,227
Have these. They're really tasty.

565
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,646
-No. I'm good.
-Please take it. It's our gift.

566
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,773
-They're really good.
-Okay.

567
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,399
Okay.

568
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,986
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

569
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,530
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

570
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,698
Bye.

571
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,077
-What is it? What happened?
-I can't see.

572
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,497
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

573
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,832
-I'm fine.
-Be careful.

574
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,334
You know what?

575
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,213
Those bastards could've passed out
on the street.

576
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,923
I'm sure I've hit the vital points…

577
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:48,876
Hey, Inzaghi.

578
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:52,880
Take your friend and go.

579
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,966
Get your friend and get out!

580
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:58,886
Inzaghi!

581
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,764
You…

582
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,277
Why is it so fast?

583
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,404
Damn it.

584
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,222
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

585
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,140
And it's so cold.

586
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,895
Okay? I'll come in.

587
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,316
It's so warm in here!

588
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,904
My feet are itchy.

589
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,578
Let me crash here tonight.

590
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,874
Do you have to wear that to sleep?

591
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:16,422
Booralro made this
on the 80th anniversary of their…

592
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,257
-Are you cooking ramyeon?
-Yes.

593
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,013
I didn't know you eat ramyeon.

594
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,517
Well, Ms. Jang gave them to me.

595
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,687
Want some? Should I cook two servings?

596
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,731
No, I'm good.

597
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,068
My face will get puffy from indigestion.

598
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,321
Sure.

599
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:03,010
Generally speaking, a single serving
of Korean ramyeon is pretty small.

600
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:06,096
They should pass a law to
standardize and regulate the portion.

601
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,353
-It'll never happen, right?
-Won't your face get puffy?

602
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,938
I can exercise before I sleep.

603
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,982
Didn't you eat a lot at dinner earlier?

604
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:20,402
I got hungry really quickly
after that traumatizing incident.

605
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,780
I see. Sure. Of course.

606
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:27,242
By the way,
I didn't eat that much earlier.

607
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,994
Maybe I was wrong.

608
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,330
I'll get the blankets for you.

609
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:34,958
You're not going to eat?

610
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,462
If we were in Italy, you would have been…

611
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,425
Go ahead. You can finish it.

612
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,103
Are you sleeping here?

613
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,192
I feel awful.

614
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,986
I have to sleep on the floor,
and you, on the sofa.

615
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,489
Oh, my! How scandalous!

616
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,033
The two of us here? Together?

617
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,993
But there's a bedroom.

618
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,419
Go ahead.

619
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,759
You're so naughty.

620
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,806
My goodness. Oh, no!

621
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,769
Are they chickens or what?

622
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,983
Let me crash here just for the night.

623
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,944
You can stay here until you feel safe.

624
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,739
No. I'll go back as soon
as the house gets fixed.

625
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,368
My eyes won't survive this place.

626
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,912
How tacky.

627
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,749
The previous tenant put it up.

628
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,840
Don't forget to replace the ramyeon
you had before you go.

629
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,468
Don't worry. I'll buy you a whole box.

630
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:17,644
Can I ask you two more questions?

631
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,479
It's about the Mafia.

632
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,192
Just two questions.

633
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:28,030
Are Mafia bosses really scary
like they say?

634
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,033
Are they brutal and heartless?

635
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,909
It depends on the boss.

636
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,789
The boss I served
was a reasonable businessman.

637
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,208
He must have been a nice man.

638
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:44,046
Yes. To me, he was like a father.

639
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,299
Here's my next question.

640
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:52,596
The other day, you said that
people get killed like they do in movies

641
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:57,601
and that the Mafia believes you have to
pay the price for your actions.

642
00:48:58,644 --> 00:48:59,478
Right.

643
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:06,193
Then, have you ever done it yourself?

644
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,156
Are you asking me if I've killed a person?

645
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,163
No.

646
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,707
I'm a lawyer.

647
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,417
Right?

648
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,088
Right. I was just wondering.

649
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:34,596
Even if you did work for the Mafia,
there's no way you would kill people.

650
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,810
Will you cut ties with me
if I've killed anyone before?

651
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,063
It's not that. If you did,

652
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,110
it'd feel like you're someone

653
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,404
from a very distant world.

654
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,116
Like someone

655
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:58,370
trapped on a mural
or in a faded newspaper.

656
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,666
And if anyone thought of me that way,

657
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,335
I would be a bit sad.

658
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,671
But…

659
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,759
I want to live that kind of life,
away from other people.

660
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:17,723
Why?

661
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,475
I know.

662
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:24,396
It's because you don't want
to be hurt by others, right?

663
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,778
No. Because a lot of people try
to borrow money from me.

664
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:38,410
I was expecting some fancy answer.

665
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:42,497
But that was such a down-to-earth answer.

666
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,834
No more questions now. Go to sleep.

667
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:49,629
Fine.

668
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,457
You know Prosecutor Seo Ung-ho, right?
Chief Prosecutor Hwang's right-hand man.

669
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:11,920
He died last night while driving under
the influence and fell off the mountain.

670
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,547
PROSECUTOR SEO UNG-HO DEAD FROM DUI

671
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,299
This is probably connected to
what happened last night.

672
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,551
No.

673
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,720
It looks meticulously planned.
It wasn't sloppy at all.

674
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:29,271
From the looks of things,
more people might get hurt.

675
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,567
When are you coming back?

676
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,361
I see. Okay. Bye.

677
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:41,908
Is someone coming?

678
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,037
I sent someone to Italy
to look into Vincenzo.

679
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,540
I see. Did they find anything?

680
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:50,667
I'll find out once he comes back.

681
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,127
I see.

682
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,309
I must have startled you last night.

683
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,397
No. I learned a lot from you again.

684
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,357
Okay.

685
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:20,947
Starting today,
everything must go perfectly.

686
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,992
You got more bodyguards, right?

687
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,369
Yes. I have two teams
in case someone tails me.

688
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,542
Well, sir…

689
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,256
I have something to tell you.

690
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,844
It seems like
you did something wrong again.

691
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,024
Who told you to do something like that?

692
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,485
I'm sorry.

693
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,820
I just wanted to lift
some of your burdens.

694
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,574
I only did it out of my loyalty for you.
Please, you have to believe me.

695
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,535
Don't you be giving me excuses.

696
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,246
That just makes your mistake stand out.

697
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,217
Why are you video calling me?

698
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,136
-Because I missed you.
-Really?

699
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,930
Go ahead. Admire me.

700
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,850
Aren't you at work yet?

701
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,437
I'm about to.
Anyway, you don't call me much lately.

702
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,397
By the way,

703
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:20,817
are you at your house?

704
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,278
The house looks different.

705
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,324
Good morning.

706
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:33,079
Is that Mr. Cassano's house?
Why are you there?

707
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,498
-I slept here last night.
-What?

708
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,584
I have to go to work.
I'll talk to you later.

709
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,877
Cha-young…

710
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,181
Mr. Cassano.

711
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,020
Right here.

712
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,939
Hello.

713
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,906
You're in danger right now, aren't you?

714
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,574
I can see right through that.

715
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,534
Pardon?

716
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,328
This is…

717
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,915
This is my number.

718
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,417
Feel free to call me
when you find yourself in danger.

719
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:24,089
Or you can simply text, "Help me."
That will work, too.

720
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,300
Okay.

721
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,304
YOUR HELPER, AN GI-SEOK

722
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,984
I'm sure you may have already realized,

723
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,405
but I'm not just a kitchen assistant.

724
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,492
And let's leave it at that.

725
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:57,789
Act natural.

726
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,916
Act natural.

727
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,672
Are you…

728
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,516
BABEL GROUP

729
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,836
PEOPLE AROUND CHAIRMAN JANG HAN-SEO

730
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,092
Gosh, he's ridiculous.

731
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:53,178
Does he think he's the President?

732
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,763
I'm sure Babo instructed him
to strengthen security

733
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,223
in case he gets followed.

734
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,311
He's protecting his most vulnerable area.

735
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:04,314
Then, we won't be able to go after
Jang Han-seo for the answer.

736
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,400
Who on earth is Babo? Damn it.

737
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,068
Ms. Hong.

738
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,196
I just found out.

739
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:14,949
Director Gil of Haemun Medical Center
is under protection of the prosecution.

740
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,743
He asked them to protect him? Why?

741
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,828
I don't know. No one knows why.

742
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,832
He must be trying to cut a deal.
A big one at that.

743
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:25,418
-Who's the prosecutor in charge?
-Jung In-kuk.

744
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,255
Whatever it is,
I'm sure Babel is involved.

745
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,258
I'll try to get some intel
from Prosecutor Jung now.

746
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,309
Yes, Mr. Cho.

747
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:43,561
Yes.

748
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,943
-Thank you for going to Shanghai for this.
-No problem.

749
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:53,571
Fortunately, the data on
Wang Shaolin's irises was still there.

750
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,323
And our hackers were quick too.

751
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,953
We figured out the most difficult part.

752
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:04,249
Yes. Now we just need to open the door
after removing the slabs to the entrance.

753
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,668
Will there be any problems
when we remove the slabs?

754
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:11,130
No. They are thin and designed
to be removed easily.

755
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,509
That's good. Let's get started then.

756
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:18,304
But to do that, we must
relocate Nanyak Temple first.

757
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,692
NANYAK TEMPLE

758
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,654
Hello.

759
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,447
Hello.

760
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:41,661
Ms. Seo has converted to Buddhism.

761
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:43,663
I see.

762
00:59:57,302 --> 00:59:59,804
I will go now.

763
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:00,763
Okay.

764
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:08,104
Bye.

765
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,832
Why are you asking only us to move out?

766
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,543
I'm worried about the others too,

767
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,421
but I'm especially worried
you might be in danger.

768
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,715
But we are okay here.

769
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:41,095
I can help relocate your temple
to a place with clean air outside Seoul.

770
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,724
You have enlightened us
with courage and insight.

771
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,101
Whatever happens,

772
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,647
we will protect our temple and the plaza.

773
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,201
Have some sweet potatoes.

774
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,985
He wants the monks to move out.

775
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,406
Then, does that mean…

776
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,495
No matter how you put it,

777
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:52,250
Jang Joon-woo crossed the line outright.

778
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:56,838
We already crossed the line.
It's better to go all the way.

779
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:57,964
Myung-hee.

780
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,468
Ms. Choi.

781
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,012
This could put us in danger, too.

782
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,390
We already crossed over
to the dark side long ago.

783
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:09,559
Why are you suddenly worried about that?

784
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,185
Exactly.

785
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,191
Sir.

786
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,403
I've been working so hard.

787
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:23,781
Gosh.

788
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,785
I must've scared you
a lot yesterday, boss.

789
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,078
No. That's not it.

790
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:34,000
It's just that my respect for you
has increased a lot.

791
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,919
There's something I need from
Chief Prosecutor Hwang right now.

792
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,966
-Can you relay the message?
-I will.

793
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,605
TAESAN BANK

794
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:02,737
PROSECUTION SERVICE

795
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:15,166
Su-nam, did you check the box?
There might be useful stuff in there.

796
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:17,376
Always check
before you throw them out. Gosh.

797
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,129
HAIR SALON

798
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,507
Let's just hire some people.

799
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,591
Mr. Park.

800
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,177
We should do something cool.
What are we doing here?

801
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,471
Why are you looking at me like that?

802
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,515
You should be grateful that you're alive.

803
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,934
Besides, we must tighten our belts
and save money!

804
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:36,187
We almost lost everything.
All we have left are some slush funds.

805
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,772
You're unbelievable.

806
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:41,025
Gosh, I'm hungry. You could order
some jjajangmyeon for us.

807
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,402
Hey, boil some water.
I'll go buy some noodles.

808
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,698
What's all this?
Are you opening a shop here?

809
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,575
What are you guys doing here?

810
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,619
You have to recycle these properly.

811
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,037
-What?
-Hey.

812
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:58,501
I won't fight with you guys. I closed down
my company. I'm not a thug anymore.

813
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,587
As if we'd believe you.
Get out of here now.

814
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:05,383
Gosh. We're running
a different business here.

815
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,802
-A travel agency.
-A travel agency?

816
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,178
At a time like this?

817
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,973
Is it a travel agency that
sends people to the afterlife?

818
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:14,642
No. A real travel agency.

819
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:20,356
What kind of name is that?
"Bye Bye Balloon"?

820
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:23,317
Are you even paying rent here?

821
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:26,237
-Pay the fee for the association.
-You don't own this building.

822
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,614
Let me use this unit.
Mind your own business.

823
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,367
Hey, Chalk. What are you doing here?

824
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,370
-Are you here to dye your hair?
-Come on.

825
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,456
Oh, my goodness. Who is that?

826
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,336
Mind your own business, everyone.

827
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,422
She startled me. Enough about them.

828
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,132
Let's talk.

829
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,884
-She's new.
-Let's talk for a second.

830
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,719
Come here. I need to talk to you.

831
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,097
-Hi.
-They are here.

832
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,390
-You're here.
-Hey.

833
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,352
Gi-seok, can you give us some privacy?

834
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,562
I know everything.

835
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,899
He's like a family to me now.

836
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,525
I told him everything.

837
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,778
Damn it. That's one more person.

838
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:11,908
Gi-seok, didn't you see the monks

839
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,118
looking for the gold?

840
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,000
Well, now that we're all on the same page,

841
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:24,128
let's not try to fool each other.
We're neighbors. What is this?

842
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:25,630
We're all trying to find it.

843
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,424
It looked like you were
trying the hardest.

844
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,885
You know what?
We should all look for it together.

845
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:34,388
Yes. We'll put it in writing that
we'll divide it equally whoever finds it.

846
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:37,558
Shouldn't the person who finds it
get a bigger cut?

847
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,685
That will just complicate things.

848
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,520
Let's divide it equally.

849
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:44,732
Come to think of it, it is unfair.

850
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:49,862
Then, should we ask the lawyers
about the best way to divide it?

851
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,949
Then, more people
will know about the gold.

852
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,742
There's Ms. Hong, Mr. Cassano…

853
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:57,036
What was his name again?
The paralegal guy.

854
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,496
Chaesin.

855
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:00,873
I'm sorry.

856
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,708
Gosh. What should we do, then?

857
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:06,379
All right. Enough.
Let's take our time on it.

858
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:10,675
From now on, let's be strategic
and look for it all together.

859
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,222
No backstabbing, okay?

860
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,349
Meanwhile,
the Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office

861
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:20,643
announced that they arrested
the bank presidents

862
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:23,437
and are questioning them now.

863
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:26,065
However, they haven't disclosed
the details

864
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,985
of the banks' violations
of the Capital Markets Act.

865
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,362
Any relevant witnesses will be summoned…

866
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:33,614
Isn't this too obvious?

867
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,825
Prosecutor Seo's death
and the raid on the two banks.

868
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,785
…to uncover corrupt
activities at the banks…

869
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:40,997
It's clear now that Babel killed him
to threaten the Chief Prosecutor.

870
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,375
That must be why they're taking action
against these banks.

871
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:49,130
I get the feeling these two banks
will invest a lot of money in Babel.

872
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:57,513
Prosecutor Jung In-kuk is calling me.

873
01:06:57,596 --> 01:06:59,140
I knew you could do it.

874
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,394
Hello, Mr. Jung. This is Hong Cha-young.

875
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:05,563
Yes.

876
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:09,108
I see. I contacted you
because I had a few questions.

877
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,860
Yes. When are you available?

878
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:14,196
GIL JONG-MOON

879
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,116
I really enjoyed following your lawsuit.

880
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,326
Thank you for going up against Babel.

881
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,121
But our effort was in vain.

882
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,998
It looks like they're bouncing back.

883
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:25,833
They've always done that.

884
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:28,210
But we must bring them down for good
this time.

885
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:33,132
Could you tell us
about Director Gil's demands?

886
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,926
He wanted immunity
and permission to leave the country.

887
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,888
I believe he's planning to flee abroad
with a new identity.

888
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,639
And what about his statement?

889
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,684
He only told me it was about a collusion
between Babel and Haemun.

890
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,437
He's trying to make a deal with Babel.

891
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,813
You're right.

892
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:51,108
I think he's stalling for time,
so he can set something up.

893
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,777
Mr. Jung.

894
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,072
What will you do if there's a real boss
behind Jang Han-seo?

895
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,656
A real boss?

896
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:01,118
-Who is that?
-We don't know that yet.

897
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:04,580
But we are certain that
Jang isn't the real boss.

898
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:10,169
Then, is that what he meant by…

899
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,300
Do you know how Jang Guk-hwan died?

900
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:18,636
Is there something I don't know about?

901
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:26,727
No.

902
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,564
I'll tell you everything later.

903
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,858
Gosh. Those scumbags.

904
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:36,821
They are unbelievable. They should've
shown respect at his last moment.

905
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:39,824
This is why being born into
a respectable family matters.

906
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:41,867
Gosh, those jerks.

907
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,994
Are you sure he used plurals?

908
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,455
"Scumbags" and "jerks."

909
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,750
Yes. I'm sure of it.

910
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:53,295
Perhaps, both of his sons
could have been there at his deathbed.

911
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:57,258
That means Director Gil knows who it is.

912
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,218
"Babo"?

913
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:03,305
We call Babel's real boss Babo for short.

914
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:09,061
Did Director Gil call anyone
from the safe house?

915
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:13,149
He did make an untraceable call.
It was to a burner phone.

916
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:14,984
Given the circumstances,

917
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,027
the owner of the burner phone
must be Babo.

918
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:20,990
Mr. Jung.

919
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:25,578
Do you think we can launch
an operation to get information?

920
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:31,375
Are you talking about sting operations?

921
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:35,171
Yes. Something like that.
It's like putting on a play or a show.

922
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,842
No. I've always played by the book so far.

923
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,846
Can you look at this
from a different point of view?

924
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:46,807
I will not allow deception
in my investigation.

925
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:48,851
I'm sorry.

926
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:57,610
Your appetizer,
sugar-glazed deep-fried sweet potatoes.

927
01:10:16,837 --> 01:10:19,506
Mr. Jung, have some water.

928
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,508
I'm good. Please eat.

929
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,413
What's wrong?

930
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:55,876
It's nothing.

931
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,963
What's the problem?

932
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:03,926
I got something that
could make you proud of me.

933
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,455
We'll get a huge investment
sometime next week.

934
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,123
First,

935
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:19,710
we'll resume the production of
Babel Pharmaceuticals' RDU-90.

936
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:23,672
We'll triple the import of
the raw materials to boost the production.

937
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:28,177
Triple the security level
of our warehouses immediately.

938
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:33,474
"Dongil and Taesan banks to make
large investments into the Babel Group"?

939
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,560
You were right, Mr. Cassano.

940
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:39,271
Evil does recover quickly.

941
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:42,566
That darned RDU-90 will end up
hitting the market.

942
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,152
My father worked so hard to stop it.

943
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:56,622
I guess the victims' families
are going on that trip today.

944
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,251
We're leaving for our trip now.

945
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,712
We probably shouldn't tell them

946
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,131
about the tabloid, right?

947
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,050
Let's tell them once they come back.

948
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:11,261
PROSECUTOR JUNG IN-KUK

949
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,267
Yes, Mr. Jung.

950
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:21,105
I think Director Gil is going with Babel.

951
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:23,482
He started to deny the charges one by one.

952
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:26,485
To be honest, we were expecting this.

953
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:28,821
Speaking of which…

954
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:34,326
Does your offer to launch
a sting operation still stand?

955
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,996
Yes. Our specialty is to design operations
that leave no traces.

956
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:41,333
Let's do it tonight.

957
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:44,294
I'm going against my principles for this.

958
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:57,141
Okay. We'll call you as soon
as we've made the preparations.

959
01:13:57,808 --> 01:13:58,767
Okay.

960
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,772
Well, this one is easy.

961
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,692
Here's our plan A. We'll pretend
to be hitmen from Babel

962
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,694
and make him say who Babo is.

963
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:09,778
Plan B.

964
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,365
Punch him in the face
and get his confession.

965
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,037
Let's go with plan A.

966
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:31,717
Didn't Mr. Jung say that
there would be cops in plain clothes?

967
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,179
Right. It's past our go time.

968
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:37,306
Let's go to the entrance.

969
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,446
Excuse us.

970
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:12,758
What happened here?

971
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:18,263
He's dead.

972
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:20,516
Director Gil…

973
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:22,768
Where's Director Gil?

974
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:00,889
They beat us to it.

975
01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:13,944
Mr. Cassano.

976
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:31,712
I'm sorry, Ms. Hong.

977
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:36,091
All of us couldn't handle
the sadness of losing our families

978
01:16:36,174 --> 01:16:38,302
and the anger we felt today.

979
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:43,557
So we are going to do
something very foolish.

980
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:49,438
I hope you can be understanding.

981
01:21:35,181 --> 01:21:37,559
This isn't about justice.

982
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,812
This is about the principle
that I've lived by.

983
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,189
I'll let you break that promise.

984
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:48,361
God enjoys making people suffer
while remaining hidden someplace.

985
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:51,114
-That's why this is so fun.
-How do we find the killer?

986
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:53,366
If we can't find them,

987
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,743
-we'll make them come to us.
-Wait!

988
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:58,330
So he's one of the best consiglieres
in Italy?

989
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,624
They know your true identity?

990
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,043
I'll have to kill him. Or he'll kill us.

991
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:04,794
Something bad might happen.

992
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:07,589
I know who it is.
The real boss behind Babel.

993
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:14,346
