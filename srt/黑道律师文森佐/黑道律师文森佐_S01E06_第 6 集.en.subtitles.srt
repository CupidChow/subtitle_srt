1
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,733
The heinous Babel Chemicals

2
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,526
must repent!

3
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,571
-Repent!
-Repent!

4
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,406
OUT WITH BABEL CHEMICALS

5
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,825
BABEL CHEMICALS MUST BE HELD RESPONSIBLE

6
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,369
I can't live my life coughing up blood.

7
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,705
Babel Chemicals must repent!

8
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,919
This performance shows

9
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:30,048
the painful struggle of the victims,
everyone!

10
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,309
MURDEROUS BABEL CHEMICALS MUST BE GONE

11
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,485
THE TRUTH WILL BE REVEALED

12
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,821
What are those assholes doing?

13
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,697
Let's go.

14
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,325
Unbelievable.

15
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,918
LIFE

16
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,743
Their dishes don't taste as good
as they once did.

17
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,453
Their broth is terrible.

18
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,581
-Let's go elsewhere, okay?
-Yes, sir.

19
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,374
This is tasty. My gosh!

20
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,377
Goodness! I'm so sorry!

21
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,504
-Come on!
-You're all drenched!

22
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,423
I lost my contact lenses.

23
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,758
-Damn it!
-Hold on. You got some here.

24
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,303
Watch where you're going!

25
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,890
I'm truly sorry.
Let me pay for the laundry.

26
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,266
-Forget it!
-Okay.

27
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,184
-Damn it.
-I'm sorry.

28
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,271
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. Did you leave?

29
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,774
You can't see the judge before trial.

30
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,445
I still had to say hi to you, sir.

31
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,616
Did you quit so you could work with him?

32
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,118
He said he'd treat me well.

33
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,120
You should do the same for me.

34
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,248
I always clean up after
Babel Group's trials.

35
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:31,544
I promise to repay you
and our association handsomely.

36
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,089
Do that under the table, okay?

37
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,841
Do it secretly.

38
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,220
Yes, sir. Please help us out today,
as always.

39
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,554
Secretly, that is.

40
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,767
Well, I don't think today's trial will be
that hard.

41
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,645
The plaintiff's evidence
is not concrete at all.

42
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,232
Anyway, I hope your first trial
as a lawyer goes well.

43
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,608
I hope so too.

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,526
Thank you, sir.

45
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,289
What? What's going on?

46
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,959
Water has been leaking from the ceiling
and the walls.

47
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,293
We're looking into it.

48
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,087
Then move us to another room.

49
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,797
All the rooms are occupied.

50
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,423
I'm sorry, sir.

51
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,176
I guess this building was
poorly constructed.

52
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,470
-Who the hell built it anyway?
-Babel E&C.

53
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,596
What?

54
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,183
To be exact, it's Haemun E&C.
It's their former name.

55
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,810
They have it engraved out there.

56
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,687
This is nothing.

57
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,439
Every six months, the toilets leak too.

58
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:37,443
Damn Haemun. It's a government facility.
How could they do such a poor job?

59
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,321
Tell me about it. They should've done
a proper job, right?

60
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,450
I bet Babel E&C is
much better than Haemun E&C.

61
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,327
-Are you excited, you fool?
-Yes.

62
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,745
-Having fun? Happy?
-Yes.

63
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,248
Are you here to have fun?
Go inside. You little…

64
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,306
PLAINTIFF'S TABLE

65
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:33,916
B**** C******* INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT CASE
IN PROGRESS

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,835
EPISODE 6

67
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,505
Mr. Nam.

68
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,507
-I have a question.
-Sure. What is it?

69
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,426
We're told to rise when the judge enters.

70
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,761
-Yes.
-But

71
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,137
what happens if you don't?

72
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,098
Right. I've been quite curious about that
as well.

73
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,602
A maximum of 5 years in jail
or a fine of 50 million won.

74
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,354
Really?

75
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,191
They charge you that much
for simply not standing?

76
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,902
I was kidding.
Nothing happens if you don't rise.

77
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,613
-Damn it. I fell for it.
-Goodness.

78
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,618
Anyway, why do they tell you to rise?
It's not like we know the judge.

79
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,204
It's not for the judge, but…

80
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,665
How do I put it? To show respect
for the law and his ruling.

81
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,793
-"Respect"?
-Yes.

82
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,587
They always give such ridiculous rulings.

83
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,588
-Right?
-Yes.

84
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,715
They always side with the wealthy.

85
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,092
-How absurd.
-Right.

86
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,551
I won't stand up.

87
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,347
I'll show them my determination
as a martial artist.

88
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,264
Me too.

89
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,560
I'll show them my conscience
and resistance as an artist.

90
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,814
With the spirits of all the former monks,

91
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,565
we won't stand up either.

92
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,655
Let's all not stand up
as a show of defiance.

93
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,615
-Okay.
-It's okay to do so, right?

94
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,492
Of course. They won't arrest you.

95
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:54,122
-Okay.
-Let's show our solidarity by doing this.

96
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,290
-Sure.
-All right, then.

97
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,960
Here comes the judge. All rise.

98
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,756
So much for solidarity. Salute.

99
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,769
-Goodness.
-Oh, dear.

100
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,355
-Are you okay?
-Goodness.

101
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,483
Goodness.

102
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,530
Why did you cover the floor
with plastic wraps?

103
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,324
Water was leaking from the walls as well.

104
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,745
How could water leak
in the sacred court of law?

105
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,875
-Goodness, my back.
-Are you okay?

106
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,043
Goodness.

107
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,141
Based on the submitted materials,
the researchers neglected

108
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:59,187
the safety regulations
that were written on the manual

109
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,022
and were exposed to toxic agents.

110
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:12,033
However, they decided to blame
the company for it

111
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,785
and are arguing
that it was an industrial accident.

112
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,207
Will the plaintiff's attorney refute
this claim?

113
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,458
Yes, Your Honor.

114
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,004
We have enough evidence…

115
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,384
-What's wrong with her?
-What is going on?

116
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,262
…to refute.

117
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,682
-What's wrong?
-Your Honor.

118
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,894
Lately,

119
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,189
I've been suffering from a panic disorder.

120
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,734
-Goodness.
-Panic disorder?

121
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,110
-Oh, no.
-Did you know?

122
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,111
I had no idea.

123
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,030
Your Honor.

124
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,032
May I take some medication?

125
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,743
Yes, hurry up. Go on.

126
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,379
You may continue.

127
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,133
Your Honor…

128
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,722
-Goodness!
-Ms. Hong!

129
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,599
Are you okay?

130
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,394
-Oh, dear!
-What should we do?

131
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,938
-Hey, call 911 right now!
-Help her!

132
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,439
At this one gambling joint,

133
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,776
the Mafia does this first when
someone is about to win big.

134
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,573
They remove the dealer from the table.

135
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,991
The dealer?

136
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,243
The "dealer" at the court is…

137
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,581
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

138
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,500
-What's going on?
-What should we do?

139
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,294
Cha-young!

140
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,421
Open your eyes.

141
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,839
Someone call 911!

142
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,675
Oh, no! I heard a loud thump!
You heard it, right?

143
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,260
-Oh, dear.
-I heard it.

144
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,637
Call 911.

145
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,431
Did you hear the loud thump?

146
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,891
Silence!

147
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,685
Goodness. Lieutenant.

148
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,354
-Call 911 right now.
-Yes, Your Honor.

149
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,232
Cha-young.

150
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:13,821
Generally speaking, in the absence
of the plaintiff's lawyer,

151
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,450
it is impossible to go on with the trial.

152
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:22,663
However, due to the gravity
of today's issue,

153
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,707
we cannot postpone this trial.

154
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,252
During recess, we will ask the doctor

155
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:33,174
to check up on the lawyer's condition.

156
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:38,554
After that, we will resume the trial
later in the day.

157
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,806
What if it doesn't work?

158
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,059
What do you think? Get up right away.

159
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,269
Goodness.

160
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,479
-Gosh.
-She's up.

161
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,564
-Goodness.
-She got up.

162
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,066
-She's okay.
-Really?

163
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,484
-She just took a nap.
-I see.

164
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,153
You're up. Are you all right?

165
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:58,115
Yes, Your Honor. I feel better
once I regain consciousness.

166
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,923
DEFENDANT'S TABLE

167
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,260
Why did you rush over there?
She was obviously putting on a show.

168
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,970
I see.

169
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,182
Then let's resume.

170
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:27,228
The plaintiff's lawyer may refute.

171
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,482
Since the materials weren't submitted,
I will explain them in words.

172
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,858
The evidence is…

173
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,445
Goodness.

174
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,447
-What's going on?
-Gosh.

175
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,991
-My goodness.
-Oh, dear.

176
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,953
-Goodness.
-What should we do?

177
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,789
Goodness. What's going on?

178
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,084
What if the game resumes
without the dealer?

179
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,044
If that happens,

180
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,216
they black out the entire gambling house

181
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,552
so no one can play.

182
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,310
-Come on.
-Silence!

183
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,187
Oh, my.

184
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,398
Why is there a blackout?

185
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,861
Your Honor.

186
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,238
We cannot continue without stenography.

187
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,533
One minute. Let me evaluate the situation.

188
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,827
-What did you say?
-Right.

189
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,287
Your Honor.

190
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,622
We can't hear you
because your microphone is off.

191
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,374
-Me neither.
-I can't hear you.

192
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,169
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed for them.

193
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,341
You can use your laptop, right?

194
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,386
Yes, Your Honor. One minute.

195
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,431
It's impossible to record quickly
or accurately on a laptop.

196
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,350
It doesn't matter. She just needs
to record the core matters.

197
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,771
Goodness. This isn't right.

198
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,940
This won't do.

199
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,068
-She should jot down everything.
-That's right.

200
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,487
-Can they do that?
-Come on.

201
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,490
-Shouldn't she record everything?
-She should.

202
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,867
Are they allowed to do that?

203
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,578
-Does that even make sense?
-I don't know either.

204
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,331
-If she forgets the details…
-What if the player insists

205
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,333
on gambling no matter what?

206
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,836
Then as a last resort,

207
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,923
they kick out everyone else

208
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,759
and create chaos.

209
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,677
SEOUL NAMDONGBU DISTRICT COURT

210
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,347
WITNESS STAND

211
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,480
-She's back.
-I can see that.

212
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,363
Not yet.

213
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,950
Calm down.

214
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,166
The plaintiff's lawyer may continue!

215
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,252
The defense lawyer's claim

216
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,712
that the researchers neglected
the safety regulations

217
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:03,968
is shameless, cunning, and evil.

218
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:09,056
It's a big, fat lie!

219
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,349
Your Honor.

220
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,227
That remark is unrelated to this case.

221
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,021
It's meaningless and a personal attack
at that.

222
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,066
Acknowledged. Please be careful.

223
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,276
-Yes, Your Honor.
-Now!

224
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,193
-Yes!
-Now!

225
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,503
What is that?

226
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,339
What's this sound?

227
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,717
-What's going on?
-Where's this sound coming from?

228
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,344
-It's so noisy.
-What's happening?

229
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,262
My gosh.

230
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,555
What is this sound?

231
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,308
Is someone flying a drone in here?

232
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,352
Who is it?

233
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,856
Which reporter is secretly flying a drone?

234
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,526
-Look at that!
-What?

235
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,445
-What is that?
-Goodness!

236
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,700
It's a giant hornet!

237
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,623
You'll certainly die
if you get stung by it!

238
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:16,749
Everyone, run!

239
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,919
Get out, everyone!

240
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,522
Get out of here! Go! Hurry!

241
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,941
You should get out of here.

242
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,735
Those hornets are notorious
even in the States.

243
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,987
Why should I get out?

244
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,031
I can't believe this!

245
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,050
My goodness!

246
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,260
Oh, no!

247
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,930
Move out of the way!

248
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,349
Silence, everyone!

249
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:21,647
If you keep this up, I'll have to
ask you all to leave the court!

250
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,819
How can we cause a scene
and teach the judge a lesson?

251
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,365
We'll have to think about that a bit more.

252
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,369
Ma'am.

253
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,372
-Hello, Mr. Lee.
-Hello.

254
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:44,461
My uncle made this hornet drink himself.

255
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,213
You should try it.

256
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,758
Hornet drink? Goodness!

257
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,694
-Here.
-Thank you.

258
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,863
Be careful.

259
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,781
They're unconscious right now.

260
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,743
Be careful when you take them out.
They can be deadly.

261
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,001
We should add the honey first.

262
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,711
-No. Water first.
-No, water.

263
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,421
-It's honey first.
-No, it's water.

264
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,256
-The honey should float on top.
-Right.

265
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,924
-Great idea.
-Pour it in.

266
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,718
-Pour it in.
-Now, the honey.

267
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,107
Silence, everyone!

268
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,825
-Goodness!
-Your Honor!

269
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,869
That hurts! What was that?

270
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,579
Goodness!

271
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,269
Did you get stung here?

272
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,771
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,773
-You won't die.
-I won't?

274
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,775
-You'll be fine.
-That's right.

275
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,402
-It hurts a lot, doesn't it?
-Goodness.

276
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,987
All rise.

277
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,229
-Oh, my.
-Unbelievable.

278
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,689
Goodness.

279
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,358
-Oh, dear.
-His mouth is swollen.

280
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,944
That's even better than
any special effects.

281
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,070
That's so terrifying.

282
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,125
Sit down, please.

283
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,005
It's just marvelous.

284
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,133
Help us, merciful Buddha.

285
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,476
I can…

286
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:54,651
no longer go on with this trial today.

287
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,618
Due to the gravity of this case,

288
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,332
we will…

289
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,583
What is he saying?

290
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,001
We will continue…

291
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,378
-What?
-I can't understand him.

292
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,088
…the trial

293
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,594
a week from now.

294
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,597
-Your Honor!
-Are you okay?

295
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,474
Your Honor! Wake up!

296
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,518
-Are you okay?
-Your Honor!

297
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,402
Be careful.

298
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,112
-Can we go now?
-Be careful.

299
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,156
-Goodness.
-We should leave.

300
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,658
Let's go.

301
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,244
-Good work, everyone.
-I can't believe this.

302
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,455
-Goodness.
-Can we leave now?

303
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,666
You should be ashamed.

304
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:40,007
How could you insult the sacred court
just to buy a week?

305
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,800
Insult what?

306
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,969
You also practice the law.

307
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:47,431
But this is too cheap, immature,
and lowly!

308
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,974
What are you talking about?

309
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,310
Wasn't it like a musical?

310
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,729
It had a well-organized narrative,

311
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,814
and the climax was just wonderful.

312
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,233
And what did you say?

313
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,402
I insulted the sacred court?

314
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,904
The judge who was bribed
by the Babel Group,

315
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,240
Wusang who colluded with him,

316
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,994
and us, who planned this scheme,
are all in the same boat.

317
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:14,124
Since when did you become
a hero of justice?

318
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,837
How can you be so cheesy?

319
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,548
I don't care about justice.

320
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,134
Then why are you fighting back?

321
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,595
Because you're despicable.

322
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,889
Both Wusang and the Babel Group
are despicable.

323
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:29,931
What did you say?

324
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,476
Isn't it just human instinct

325
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,479
to have the urge to slap those
who are despicable?

326
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,731
See you in a week.

327
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:46,114
That damn girl really must
have a few loose screws.

328
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,075
Are you okay?

329
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,243
-Only I can take this.
-It stung your butt.

330
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,369
-I was touched.
-Me too.

331
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,871
-She's here?
-Where?

332
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:53,830
Goodness!

333
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,625
My gosh.

334
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,252
-You were awesome!
-Let's go.

335
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,213
-Goodbye.
-I'm famished.

336
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,881
Let's go.

337
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,677
Hurry up.

338
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,013
Zumba Snake is more furious
than I expected.

339
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,181
"Zumba Snake"?

340
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,892
Choi Myung-hee.
She's a snake that dances to Zumba.

341
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,771
She went on about how cheap, immature,
and lowly we were.

342
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,941
This is one of the Mafia families' motto.

343
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:25,654
"The strongest punch comes from behind."

344
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:29,032
That's right. You need to fight dirty
if you want to win.

345
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,495
And if you win, it's more effective
because your opponent is humiliated.

346
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,082
I'll make sure I'm well-prepared
for next week's trial.

347
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,375
Wonderful!

348
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,547
Before anything, let's go eat.

349
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,259
I'm famished. My blood sugar levels
have dropped.

350
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,595
Go without me. I have to be somewhere.

351
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,100
-Why don't you come eat first?
-No, I need to go right now.

352
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,603
Where is he going?

353
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,815
Right. Today is…

354
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,109
Tuesday.

355
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,486
Is he going there?

356
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,488
Where?

357
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:16,788
Since the day the Korean constitution was
established on July 17, 1948,

358
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:21,877
giant hornets
have never appeared in court.

359
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,796
Okay? Not even once.

360
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,550
Gosh. In my 25 years as a lawyer,

361
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,178
I've never experienced
such chaos in court before.

362
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,389
It's my first time. Okay?

363
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,307
That hurts.

364
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,475
-Does it hurt?
-Yes.

365
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,312
Well, suck it up! Suck it up!

366
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,522
Yes, sir.

367
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,649
On top of that,

368
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,445
my first trial as a lawyer was a flop.

369
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,657
God, those dirty bastards.

370
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,453
Of all things, how could they think
of bringing in those hornets?

371
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:57,996
What should we do?

372
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,290
Aren't we the best in the country
when it comes to playing dirty?

373
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,918
We don't play dirty. We're…

374
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,377
What's it called again?

375
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,047
Strategic? Yes, we're strategic.

376
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,298
Shut up.

377
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,676
We're all dirty here.
You have such a double standard.

378
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,055
But since the trial has been postponed,
there is no winner just yet.

379
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,516
Of course, there is. They beat us.

380
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,685
Yes, they did.

381
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,654
You damn assholes!

382
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,615
I will gouge every single
one of your eyes!

383
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,872
HANJU PRISON FOR WOMEN

384
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,300
What should I do?

385
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,094
What?

386
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,304
-What's the matter?
-Well…

387
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:00,725
Mr. Hong was a public defender
for a woman named Ms. Oh Gyeong-ja.

388
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,352
She's currently incarcerated.

389
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,146
He took such great care of her.

390
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:10,277
He'd visit her the last Tuesday
of every month.

391
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,530
But now that he's gone,

392
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,115
that won't happen anymore.

393
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,256
Hello.

394
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,759
Please sit down.

395
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,062
How are you feeling?

396
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,733
I'm doing okay.

397
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,694
The pain has subsided.

398
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,867
Since Mr. Hong passed away,

399
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,203
I thought no one would come
see me anymore.

400
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,707
Thank you so much for coming.

401
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,585
Don't thank me.

402
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,299
I only came to tell you that
no one will be visiting anymore.

403
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:25,226
You should ask your friends
or family members for help instead.

404
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,981
I have no one.

405
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,571
What about your husband?

406
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,208
What about your children?

407
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,506
I have none.

408
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:58,927
I see.

409
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,265
You don't have any family.

410
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,773
I get that you were wrongly accused,

411
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:18,696
but how did you live your life that
you have no one who could help you?

412
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,494
Life…

413
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,206
isn't always rosy for everyone.

414
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,252
No matter how hard you try,

415
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,714
you rarely get it your way.

416
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,136
It's probably because you're…

417
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,264
so full of excuses.

418
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,474
Yes.

419
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,145
My life was full of excuses.

420
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,941
I'm sorry for living this way, sir.

421
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,904
Don't apologize to me.

422
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,576
Spend the rest of your life
thinking about the ones

423
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,827
who deserve it the most.

424
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,621
Goodbye, then.

425
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,498
We won't…

426
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,294
ever meet again, will we?

427
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,302
I'm leaving Korea.

428
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,474
This isn't my country.

429
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,770
Sir.

430
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,530
Goodbye.

431
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,188
Are you Ju-hyeong?

432
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,651
Ju-hyeong, we are going to be a family.

433
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,404
Ma'am.

434
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,031
My mom.

435
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:11,452
My mom said she'd come for me.

436
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:18,376
She said to wait
and that she'd come back for me.

437
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,379
I need to wait

438
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,716
for her to come back.

439
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:34,702
Here's your pepperoni pizza.

440
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,873
Once I post about your restaurant
on my blog,

441
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,292
it'll flourish in just three days.

442
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,460
Thank you in advance.

443
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,880
In that party photo,
people complimented your pizza.

444
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,799
-But it's not that special.
-Sorry?

445
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:51,260
-Well--
-If you want us to put in a good word,

446
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,388
you can just give us this food for free.

447
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,848
I see. For free.

448
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,311
That puts me in a pickle.

449
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,231
Try to savor it,

450
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,276
and you'll be able to see
how our pizza is different from the rest.

451
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,199
Try this one.

452
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,701
It's too strong.

453
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,916
Hey, if they ask for some jalapeños,

454
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,751
say we're out of them. Okay?

455
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,462
And don't give them any freebies.

456
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,215
-They're terrible customers.
-Yes, sir.

457
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,300
Why are you teary-eyed by the way?

458
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,102
DIRECTOR TAE

459
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,604
Hello?

460
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,025
-Are you crying?
-No, I'm not, sir.

461
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,152
Are you drunk and feeling sorry
for yourself?

462
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,695
No, sir.

463
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:51,904
Where are you?

464
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,699
I'm running errands.

465
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,284
Come back right now.

466
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,995
-It's an emergency.
-Yes, sir.

467
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,628
I'm sorry.

468
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,949
-Sir.
-Hello, sir.

469
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,373
Thank you for today.

470
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:48,044
My pleasure.
I'd like to thank you as well.

471
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,838
Why are you carrying this cross?

472
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:55,259
Oh, this? There's an abandoned church

473
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,720
that Babel E&C's men took over.

474
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,682
And for over a month, this cross
has been lying on the ground.

475
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,434
But what will you do with it?

476
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,728
I'm going to donate it to Geumga Church.

477
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,190
They will value this cross.

478
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,192
Goodbye, then.

479
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,570
Sir.

480
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,115
Would you like to help me?

481
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,079
Sure.

482
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,389
Goodness. Thank you for helping me
carry the cross.

483
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,936
Sir, I have a question.

484
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,813
Ask away.

485
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:56,487
If I go live somewhere far away
like in the middle of the ocean,

486
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,617
will the anger inside me disappear?

487
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:09,292
It doesn't matter where you live.

488
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:13,671
What matters is whether you still
have the anger inside you or not.

489
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,595
Does that mean

490
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,932
that I need to achieve enlightenment?

491
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,229
The only way to get rid of your anger
is by fighting it.

492
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,940
Stand your ground and fight back.

493
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,652
Enlightenment is what you get
when you win that battle.

494
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,921
Should I hire someone
to tail Vincenzo and Cha-young?

495
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,172
There's no need.

496
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,009
No matter what they do,
they can never outwit me.

497
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,344
What is this?

498
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,096
Did you make your move already
without telling me?

499
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,307
Goodness. You're just amazing.

500
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,351
-Call the tech team.
-The tech team?

501
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,561
The tech team.

502
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,397
Get me the tech team.

503
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,149
The tech team.

504
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,152
The tech team.

505
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,117
LAW FIRM WUSANG

506
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,913
It's done.

507
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,665
REP. ATTORNEY HAN SEUNG-HYUK

508
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,710
Over there. That plant is from me.

509
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,256
Raise the volume.

510
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,049
It's a live broadcast.

511
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:44,428
But if people catch us doing this,
we'll be in big trouble.

512
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,180
Didn't you hire me to do big things?

513
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,557
That's exactly why
we shouldn't get caught.

514
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,686
-All right.
-I don't get them.

515
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,063
Two days ago, all I heard
were footsteps and music.

516
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,857
We're bound to get something
if we keep listening.

517
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,485
SPEAKER

518
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,114
What is that sound?

519
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,324
LAWYER HONG CHA-YOUNG,
I HOPE YOU LEARN TO BE HUMBLE

520
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,547
What is it? You're scaring me.

521
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,344
Stop it! You're giving me goosebumps!

522
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,432
How did you know the plant was tapped?

523
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,186
Stuckyis grow well
even when they're not watered for a month.

524
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,733
It's the perfect spot
for electrical devices such as wiretaps.

525
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,694
In the past, intelligence services

526
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,071
often used them for wiretapping.

527
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:48,367
My gosh. Even her dirty tricks
are old-fashioned.

528
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,288
By the way,
you sound like an expert in this area.

529
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,374
Isn't this just common sense?

530
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,087
I see. "Common sense."

531
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,465
Then I must seriously lack common sense.

532
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,385
Ignorance isn't a sin,

533
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,928
but refusing to learn is.

534
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,808
I choose to sin and remain ignorant.
I can't be bothered.

535
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,227
Right. I asked Mr. Nam

536
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,773
to look for a good shopping district
in Sangchi-dong.

537
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,984
Are you really going to get them
a new place?

538
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,694
Yes.

539
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,032
I'm planning to pay for everything
as well.

540
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,617
But…

541
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,328
is that really necessary?

542
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,459
I want to wrap everything up quickly
and leave.

543
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,298
Then you should hurry.

544
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,386
Thanks to that,
the people here have hit the jackpot.

545
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,598
I have to study for the hearing.
I'll get going first.

546
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,685
Wait.

547
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,203
What is this? Are you a wizard?

548
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,871
Did you just get back from Hogwarts?

549
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,082
My blind date wants to see me again.

550
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,711
That's great, but this is wrong.

551
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,296
She'll want to flee.

552
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,340
"Flee"?

553
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,008
She can flee into my heart.

554
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,720
Well, then…

555
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,561
Are you fleeing too?

556
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,233
Mr. Cassano.

557
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,701
If you're not too busy,
we should have a few drinks.

558
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,244
Something more proper than beer.

559
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,455
Do you have something to tell me?

560
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,957
Do you only drink
when you have something to say?

561
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,543
It'll help us work better together.
It'll be nice.

562
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,589
You don't have drinking habits, do you?

563
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,591
Hey!

564
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:11,886
I told you not to look
into that consigliere!

565
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:15,514
How dare you ignore my orders and
disguise yourself as an assistant chef?

566
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,849
How did you know, sir?

567
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,976
Do you think this is
some ordinary company?

568
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,979
Ten minutes is all I need
to find out what you're doing!

569
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,064
Right, that's true.

570
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,734
You have no respect for your boss. Gosh.

571
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,945
My blood pressure is rising.

572
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,490
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Damn it.

573
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,868
DIRECTOR TAE JONG-GU

574
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,036
Take a look.

575
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,209
Two parties have requested
a background check on Vincenzo Cassano.

576
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:47,213
One is Law Firm Wusang,
and the other one is the Babel Group.

577
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:50,966
What the hell is he doing
for them to take interest in him?

578
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,385
Is he really forming his own gang?

579
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,055
Or is he gathering some money?

580
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,057
I haven't found anything strange so far.

581
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,475
Then what's going on?

582
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,852
I'll write up a report and submit it.

583
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,938
And as for these requests…

584
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,482
I'll reply to them myself.

585
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,275
Okay.

586
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,197
And don't use money from your own pocket.
Charge the company.

587
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,491
You're dirt poor.

588
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,327
-No, I'm not.
-As if.

589
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,163
I know you still haven't
paid off your loan

590
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,957
due to your mother's hospital bills.

591
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,836
Okay, then.

592
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,299
-Thank you, sir.
-You may leave.

593
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,719
I…

594
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,764
Gosh, that crybaby.

595
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,650
I burst out laughing
when I saw the judge's face.

596
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,988
It looked like there was playdough
on his face.

597
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,825
And his speech was muffled like this.

598
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,002
Right.

599
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,797
You visited Ms. Oh Gyeong-ja
this afternoon, didn't you?

600
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,175
-How did you know?
-Mr. Nam told me.

601
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,554
Isn't she the one
who was falsely accused of murder?

602
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,515
I read it in my dad's files.

603
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,225
He even flagged it as important.

604
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,728
I see.

605
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:31,942
Thank you

606
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,695
for visiting her on his behalf.

607
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,364
I should've gone instead.

608
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,368
You're better than his own daughter.

609
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,457
I just told her
that nobody would be coming anymore.

610
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:47,916
What?

611
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,586
You don't need to take over
all of his duties.

612
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,963
You should focus on your own work now.

613
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,007
-I thought she was ill.
-Enough about her.

614
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,053
Now, help me get Geumga Plaza back.

615
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,933
How can I when you're refusing
to tell me why?

616
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,310
Do you have to know that?

617
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,270
Of course.

618
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,939
Only then can I come up with a plan.

619
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,745
Promise me you'll keep this secret.

620
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,873
You must never tell anyone.

621
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,045
What is it?

622
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,638
Do you want drumrolls?

623
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,938
Underneath Geumga Plaza,

624
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,150
there are 1.5 tons of gold.

625
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,319
Really? 1.5 tons?

626
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,447
How much is that exactly?

627
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:05,536
That's about 110 million in euros,
and 150 billion in Korean won.

628
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,125
A hundred fifty billion won?

629
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,503
But there's a problem.

630
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,921
The gold is--

631
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,426
Underneath my house,

632
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,431
there are 100 golden calves.

633
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,441
That's hilarious.

634
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,778
You know how to toy with people.

635
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:43,866
Do you think I'm lying?

636
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,618
So this is your drinking habit.

637
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:49,288
-You bluff with a straight face.
-"Bluff"?

638
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,914
-It's about time we left.
-"Bluff"?

639
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,833
-Let's go.
-"Bluff"? Wait.

640
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,878
What does "bluffing" mean?

641
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,004
It's a good thing!

642
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,339
You even sound like you're really upset.

643
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,800
I'll get this.

644
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:11,351
Let's go, Mr. Mansour Cassano.

645
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:15,814
Monsieur Mansour, Monsieur Mansour

646
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,276
I'm not lying.

647
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,576
Yes, Mr. Cho. It's me.

648
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,829
I left the equipment you requested
at your house.

649
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,438
We need to hurry

650
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,899
and also think of another way
to retrieve the gold.

651
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,318
I'll hire some more experts
and look into it again.

652
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,863
Right. Just in case,

653
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,075
check if the explosion system
is still working.

654
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,203
It uses electricity,
so you'll be able to detect it.

655
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,248
But why do you want to know that?

656
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,669
If the system has malfunctioned
and been turned off,

657
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,130
then we could just dig in the ground
without demolishing it.

658
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,340
All right.

659
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:26,760
I'll seek the advice of some experts
and get you a detector.

660
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,435
Damn it.

661
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,663
NANYAK TEMPLE

662
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,369
Why is it so hot in here?

663
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,753
Why do they keep these on?

664
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:44,856
Why is an Italian mobster
bowing so respectfully?

665
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,537
He's crying.

666
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,498
Could those be tears of repentance?

667
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,876
The consigliere of the Mafia

668
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,838
is bowing and shedding tears
in front of Buddha.

669
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,381
What is going on?

670
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,467
Does this mean he flew in

671
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,386
to repent?

672
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,610
The system is doing just fine.

673
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,071
It's perfect.

674
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,073
It is.

675
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,790
-The mission was a success.
-It really was.

676
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,834
-It was absolutely perfect.
-It was.

677
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,045
-"It's a giant hornet!"
-"It's a giant hornet!"

678
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,215
I'd like to say something.

679
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:56,219
Thank you very much for helping
U-yeong out so willingly.

680
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,804
Gosh, it's nothing.

681
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:01,391
He's pretty much our family. Right?

682
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,685
Your compassion and willingness
to help others

683
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,854
remind me of Buddha.

684
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,314
-Goodness.
-Don't mention it.

685
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:12,944
Who in the world could possibly sneak
a giant hornet into a courtroom?

686
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,447
-Right.
-Even James Bond wouldn't be able to.

687
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:19,534
Gosh, your butt is still swollen, honey.

688
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:23,413
I can withstand the venom
because of my background in martial arts.

689
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,416
Remember that judge? He was knocked out.

690
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,001
Goodness.

691
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:30,086
-I don't think I can sit yet.
-Be careful.

692
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,715
By the way, how is U-yeong doing?

693
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,426
He needs to receive chemotherapy first,

694
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,929
and then we'll see how things go.

695
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,972
-He still has hope.
-Yes.

696
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,808
U-yeong will pull through just fine.

697
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,226
-Of course.
-You bet.

698
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:50,065
By the way, you truly put on
a marvelous show today.

699
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:53,485
The empathy I had for the victims

700
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,529
helped me do a great job.

701
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,660
Your salami, cheese,
and spaghetti vongole are here.

702
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,746
Enjoy.

703
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,082
-It looks scrumptious.
-Eat up.

704
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,251
-Isn't this expensive?
-It is.

705
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:12,295
I'm truly sorry
that I couldn't go to the trial today.

706
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:16,174
I had to serve food
to some popular influencers.

707
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,468
You totally missed out.

708
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,972
By the way, what should we do?

709
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,641
Do we need to move out or not?

710
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:27,978
Oh, right. Mr. Nam told me this.

711
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:32,023
Mr. Cassano asked him to look
for a shopping district in Sangchi-dong

712
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,443
-where we could move into.
-Is that true?

713
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,112
Not only that,

714
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,573
but he's also going to pay for everything.

715
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:44,369
Then we should ask him to build
our temple over the ground.

716
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,371
You know what?

717
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:50,083
I felt the sincerity in his gaze
from the very beginning.

718
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,294
I'm still a bit dubious.

719
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,129
Okay. What's your plan?

720
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,965
It's obvious. Whether it's here,
there, or anywhere else…

721
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,885
Gosh, that was a killer line.
We should definitely move.

722
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,720
Yes. We must.

723
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:05,056
I'd love to continue my fight
with Park Seok-do,

724
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,559
but we need to put bread on the table.

725
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:10,270
Is this a unanimous decision? I'm down.

726
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,897
-Me too.
-Me too.

727
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,898
Me…

728
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,360
-Have mercy, Buddha.
-Have mercy, Buddha.

729
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,613
-I'm down too.
-Me too.

730
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,990
Fine. I'm down.

731
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,745
-What is it?
-What's going on?

732
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,040
Isn't he that homeless man by the station?

733
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:34,419
You're right. He rambles on
when it's about to rain.

734
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,546
I think his name is Gilbert.

735
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,506
Why is his name Gilbert?

736
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,051
I don't know. That's what he said.

737
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,138
Why did he come inside? Goodness.

738
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:49,684
I'd like a bottle of beer
and one of those.

739
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,811
-Get out.
-Come on.

740
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,189
Okay. It's a good day.
We can share some food.

741
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,566
-He's right.
-Yes. He must be famished.

742
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:01,363
No, hold on.
You're not allowed to sit anywhere.

743
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,031
Wait.

744
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,912
You look very familiar.

745
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:10,830
Am I wrong?

746
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:16,586
If you give me food,
I'll tell you something important.

747
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,130
It could totally change your life.

748
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,050
Sure. Let's hear it.

749
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,219
It's never too late to change my life.

750
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,140
You're all extremely lucky.

751
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,231
REPORT ON VINCENZO CASSANO

752
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,733
CONSIGLIERE TO THE CASSANO FAMILY

753
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:44,447
It's a secret agent's duty
to deliver accurate information.

754
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,493
HANDSOME, DOE-EYED

755
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,080
However…

756
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,966
Yes. I need more time to observe him.

757
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,926
It's not time yet.

758
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,875
Hello! Good morning…

759
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,717
Let us go inside if you're all at peace.

760
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,938
What? What's gotten into them
so early in the morning?

761
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,734
VINCENZO CASSANO

762
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:05,361

POPE BERNARDO AND VINCENZO CASSANO

767
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,876
ATTENDED THE FASHION MAGAZINE
VOGO'S CHARITY EVENT

768
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,931
What a perfect guy.

769
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,189
He's a famous human rights lawyer
in Milano,

770
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,816
a celebrity, and a philanthropist.

771
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:48,071
He also defended the Mafia's victims
and has received numerous death threats.

772
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,200
Is this really true?

773
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,577
That was from the one in charge
of Italia's mob crimes.

774
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,542
I'm a bit dubious.

775
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,254
Hello, Mr. Jang.

776
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:05,922
Yes.

777
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,341
Chairman Jang of Babel.

778
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,218
No, sir.

779
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,470
Sorry? Today?

780
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:18,351
We need you to testify
during our second trial.

781
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:22,730
You also need to be prepared for
questioning from the defense and myself.

782
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,901
-Do you think we can manage?
-Don't worry.

783
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,237
We'll tell you our questions in advance

784
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,407
and share
the defense's expected questions.

785
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,033
Mr. Nam.

786
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,497
You should brace yourselves.

787
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,708
Our opponent's lawyers
are extremely malicious.

788
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,846
I'm so busy as it is. Why does he
want me to brief him all of a sudden?

789
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,681
Why does he need me?

790
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,475
All the Babel companies

791
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,477
must know how things are going.

792
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,770
I'm sure he called you over for a reason.

793
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,023
We'll find out soon.

794
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:07,775
Joon-woo, you better do a proper job.

795
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,569
Don't you stutter.

796
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,571
Sorry?

797
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,781
Right. Okay.

798
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:16,784
See? He's already stuttering.

799
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,870
"Sorry? Right. Okay." You little…

800
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:21,456
-Is this all fun and games to you?
-No.

801
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,875
What should I do
about this foolish partner of mine?

802
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:26,002
"Foolish partner"? Okay.

803
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,254
Is it funny? It is, isn't it?

804
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,422
Be quiet.

805
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,425
He doesn't take his job seriously.

806
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,385
Enough, already.

807
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,723
What is our chance of winning this trial?

808
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,684
If our witnesses testify well,

809
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,436
then I'd say it's 40 percent.

810
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,814
It's much higher
than that of the first trial.

811
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,234
Have you filed in the request?

812
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:52,237
Yes, I have. They're probably
looking over them right now.

813
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,324
If Director Gil of Haemun Medical Center
testifies, it'll be difficult for us.

814
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,577
We also need a reliable doctor
on our side.

815
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,455
-Any news?
-Until last night,

816
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:06,125
we were rejected by a total of 56 doctors.

817
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,963
It's always difficult to find a medical
adviser for industrial accident cases.

818
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,215
They won't buy off our witnesses, right?

819
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,593
It's highly unlikely since they're
very hostile toward Babel.

820
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,095
-However…
-However?

821
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,764
…they may provoke them in other ways.

822
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:22,267
Then we should do the same.

823
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,395
At times like this, we must find out
who their enemies are.

824
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,439
Because the enemy of my enemy is a friend.

825
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,485
I'm having butterflies.

826
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:37,073
Never in my wildest dreams did I consider
provoking Babel's witnesses.

827
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,285
Then let's find out who their enemies are.

828
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,590
Begin.

829
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,550
I said, start.

830
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:02,599
All right, then.
I will begin the briefing.

831
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,272
THE SECRET OF BABEL

832
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:13,276
I will now reveal
the secret of the Babel Group.

833
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,574
We came up with a fun briefing.

834
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,119
51 YEARS AGO FROM NOW

835
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:26,331
Chairman Jang Guk-hwan,
the founder of Haemun Group,

836
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,249
now known as the Babel Group,

837
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,710
had two sons.

838
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:43,848
He and his wife, Hwang Suk-jin,
had their eldest son.

839
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:45,975
As for his second son,

840
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:50,897
he was birthed by Seo Min-hui,
a young secretary.

841
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:00,031
Instead of focusing on the company,
he cheated.

842
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,327
Hey, Joon-woo! What are you saying?

843
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,828
Joon-woo! Come back here.

844
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,832
-Stop that.
-Stop?

845
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,376
-Sit.
-Sit?

846
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,835
-Quickly.
-Quickly?

847
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,675
First…

848
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,136
who is this second son?

849
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,848
It's none other than
Chairman Jang Han-seo!

850
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:26,849
JANG HAN-SEO

851
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,559
What a surprise!

852
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:39,195
Now, who is the eldest son?

853
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:47,370
He was always smart and active.

854
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,580
He was always the top student.

855
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,082
He didn't graduate

856
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:54,335
from Stanford Law School as
the top student, but he got good grades.

857
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:58,256
On top of that, God has made him
perfect and charismatic.

858
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,846
So who is it?

859
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:06,723
Who?

860
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,397
WHO IS THE TRUE KING OF BABEL?

861
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,450
-Jang Joon-woo.
-What's going on?

862
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,206
The real owner of the Babel Group is

863
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:39,172
Jang Joon-woo!

864
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,841
Han-seo, are you ready?

865
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:45,595
-Tonight, the star is me
-The star is me

866
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,847
Babel Group is actually mine

867
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,140
It's his

868
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,516
It's mine!

869
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:54,020
-Babel Group is actually mine
-It's actually mine

870
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,605
It's mine

871
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:58,691
-It's mine
-You didn't know that, did you?

872
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,068
-You had no idea!
-It's mine

873
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,237
I fooled you all!

874
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,448
Babel Group is actually mine!

875
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:07,992
-It's mine!
-It's mine!

876
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:10,870
-It's mine!
-It's mine!

877
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,163
It's mine!

878
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:13,915
I'm sorry, sir.

879
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:16,459
Please forgive me for my transgressions.

880
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,922
It's okay. I had fun.

881
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:23,216
Didn't you?

882
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:28,554
Of course. It felt like
I was on a rollercoaster every day.

883
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,849
-Sit down.
-Okay.

884
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,526
Aren't we

885
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,445
like robot vacuums?

886
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,405
We do our best, but we always fall short.

887
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,699
Not at all, sir.

888
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,993
I'm proud of both of…

889
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,787
No. I'm amazed by your wisdom.

890
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:57,375
I mean, you both have endless talents.

891
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,129
Come on. Just be yourself.

892
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,259
My foolish boss.

893
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,136
"Foolish"? Right.

894
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:13,349
I can be quite the fool.
I have so much room for improvement.

895
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:15,685
It's a shame.

896
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:20,606
From now on, give him the respect
he deserves as the chairman.

897
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,358
And keep it a secret.

898
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,485
-Yes, sir.
-Don't be like that.

899
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,821
It doesn't matter who the chairman is.

900
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,699
No, sir. Now that we know,

901
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,951
we should treat you with proper respect.

902
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,454
Right, Ms. Choi.

903
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,291
I heard you wanted
the prosecution service.

904
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,584
Yes, sir.

905
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,545
Give me a list

906
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:45,798
of people I need to buy off
and how much they will cost me.

907
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,635
I'll purchase them for you
after reviewing it.

908
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,264
Yes, sir. I'll submit it to you.

909
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:55,016
Enough about that.

910
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:02,940
Yesterday's trial was disappointing.
You barely did anything.

911
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:06,777
You guys at Wusang aren't doing
a proper job these days.

912
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,779
Can't you see how patient he is?

913
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:11,824
I'm sorry, sir.

914
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:15,161
We won't let them have their way again.

915
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,039
I heard you were dubbed "the butcher"

916
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,541
at your former workplace.

917
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:25,463
But in my eyes, Vincenzo seemed
to be the one wielding the sword.

918
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,550
Do you know about him?

919
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,093
How could I not?

920
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:34,096
He was the one who blew up my warehouse.

921
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,435
He's the one who put 50 syringes
in my pillow, isn't he?

922
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,604
If you can't beat him,

923
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,316
just get rid of him
like you did with Mr. Hong

924
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,526
and the researchers.

925
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,531
Nice and simple.

926
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,243
Please have trust in us, sir.

927
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,371
Okay.

928
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:00,539
All right.

929
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,085
Fine.

930
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,259
Take good care of my brother as well.

931
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:15,763
-Don't ignore him just because he's fake.
-Yes, sir.

932
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,099
-Right?
-Right.

933
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,524
Goodbye, sir.

934
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:03,102
I heard you were dubbed "the butcher."

935
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:08,065
But in my eyes, Vincenzo seemed
to be the one wielding the sword.

936
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:20,411
In the next five hours,

937
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,623
we'll come up with an entirely new plan.

938
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,128
Excuse me.

939
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,672
-Yes?
-Hello.

940
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:36,260
Are you the treasurer
of the Babel E&C victims' group?

941
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:37,678
Yes, I am. Why?

942
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,200
PATIENT: LEE U-YEONG

943
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:12,379
DAECHANG DAILY

944
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,798
And lastly,

945
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:18,344
report it on the 6 a.m. morning news.

946
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,981
Mr. Nam, why are you calling me
so early in the morning?

947
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:33,567
Ms. Hong! Turn on the news right now!

948
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:36,362
According to an exclusive
by Daechang Daily,

949
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:39,073
the delegate of Babel E&C victims' group

950
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:42,701
had been embezzling donations
for the past two years.

951
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,703
What the hell is that?

952
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:47,123
SECURITY AREA
RESTRICTED ACCESS

953
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:59,718
Detective, if you look closely…

954
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,179
-Detective.
-Ms. Hong.

955
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:04,849
Ms. Hong, what should we do? Help us.

956
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,308
What's going on?

957
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,061
-Are you their lawyer?
-Yes.

958
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,313
Did you arrest them
because you had solid proof?

959
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:12,398
Proof?

960
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:19,155
We've been bombarded with too much.

961
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,198
We found cash everywhere

962
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:25,244
from their cars and houses
to the ceiling of their office.

963
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,871
They embezzled the donations.

964
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,457
Do you have proof of that?

965
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:31,876
Him.

966
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:36,130
The treasurer of the group confessed.

967
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:40,217
He said he was coerced into tampering
with the book and had no choice.

968
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,011
That's not true.

969
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:45,639
We're being falsely accused.

970
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,601
We have nothing to do with this, okay?

971
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,852
We're innocent.

972
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:52,062
We have absolutely nothing to do
with this.

973
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:55,024
You know us. We're innocent.

974
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:56,942
Please help us. Please.

975
01:09:57,026 --> 01:10:00,946
We're being falsely accused.
We're truly innocent.

976
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,667
Choi Myung-hee should work
in the movie industry.

977
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,462
She's an excellent screenwriter
and a director.

978
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:20,174
And how could they blindly believe
her lies?

979
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:26,180
Because the power of their lies grow
with how powerful the person lying is.

980
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,228
They need to testify,

981
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,521
but they won't be allowed to now.

982
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,107
Even if they're allowed to testify,

983
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:39,485
she'll just prey on them.
That'll do us no good.

984
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:43,989
I guess the last witness we have is
Mr. Lee U-yeong who's hospitalized.

985
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,040
Yes, Mr. Nam.

986
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:56,168
The court called just now.

987
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,212
Our witnesses were denied?

988
01:10:58,295 --> 01:11:00,089
Yes, that too.

989
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,633
And Mr. Lee U-yeong was denied as well.

990
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:04,843
Mr. Lee? Why?

991
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,304
MR. NAM JU-SUNG

992
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,181
They tested him for drugs

993
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,893
and found small traces of meth.
They need to investigate him.

994
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:13,894
Methamphetamines?

995
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,815
Talk to you later, Mr. Nam.

996
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:25,155
Unbelievable.

997
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,284
She made sure to put an end to everything.

998
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,577
She must be a part
of the Mafia or something.

999
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,164
Even the Mafia don't do
things like this these days.

1000
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:36,792
Cha-young.

1001
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:45,175
What? Are you here to gloat?

1002
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,636
Come on. Don't be so harsh.

1003
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,471
I'm here to prepare for my briefing.

1004
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,933
-Then go do your job.
-Cha-young.

1005
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:56,270
Come back to Wusang.

1006
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,190
-Are you the boss?
-I'm just relaying his message.

1007
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:04,236
He said you'll be given
the same treatment as Ms. Choi.

1008
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:09,116
I guess those giant hornets
made him want me back.

1009
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,242
Tell him no thanks.

1010
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,000
Why do you waste your talents
on such grueling cases?

1011
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,002
Why is Babel so important?

1012
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:24,006
Why are you suddenly so serious?

1013
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:28,719
Watching you suffer for no good reason
is making me upset.

1014
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,929
And…

1015
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:35,559
I don't appreciate the way you do things
after you two joined hands.

1016
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:37,186
Joon-woo.

1017
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:41,065
Remember what I told you before
about crossing the line?

1018
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,900
I'm just worried. Can't I do that?

1019
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:46,528
No, you can't. Just focus on your job.

1020
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,199
Let's go back and look for a solution.

1021
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:53,952
Sir.

1022
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,004
I'd like to share

1023
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,132
this one memorable saying.

1024
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:09,551
"Don't dig

1025
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:11,678
your own grave."

1026
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,058
I don't want her to be six feet under.

1027
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:19,269
And I don't appreciate you
digging it for her.

1028
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:26,276
I believe you're a very smart person.

1029
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:31,573
And those who are smart
know when to give up.

1030
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:35,661
Two things.

1031
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:38,705
First, we are digging a grave.

1032
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:43,335
But it's not for us.

1033
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,548
Second, it's not about knowing
when to give up.

1034
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:53,429
A smart person knows
when their opponent is weak.

1035
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,936
Wusang is teaching you well.
You'll become a promising lawyer.

1036
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:03,897
I'll see you next time.

1037
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:24,585
They murdered my dad, and now what?

1038
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:26,587
They want me back?

1039
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,672
Those brazen bastards.

1040
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:33,802
One is easily humiliated when cornered.

1041
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:39,183
Hey.

1042
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:43,061
Can't you share some encouraging
or hopeful words

1043
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,897
at times like this?

1044
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,441
Hopeful words?

1045
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,234
Right.

1046
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,696
"Giving up on a hopeless war
will give you a new opportunity."

1047
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:53,822
How is that hopeful?

1048
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,160
Damn it. I'm so annoyed.

1049
01:14:58,744 --> 01:14:59,828
Whatever.

1050
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:02,664
I won't summon any witnesses.

1051
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:06,293
That's right. Everyone is alone in life.

1052
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:10,047
I'm going to walk back and blow off steam.

1053
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:12,299
Get a cab or something.

1054
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:20,682
All I need to do now
is ramble by myself in court!

1055
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:25,062
What should I wear?

1056
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:31,068
5 DAYS LATER
SECOND HEARING

1057
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:51,588
This can open both ways.

1058
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:53,715
Hi, Cha-young.

1059
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:58,220
DEFENDANT'S TABLE

1060
01:15:58,303 --> 01:15:59,930
Are they summoning any witnesses?

1061
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:01,723
Of course not.

1062
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,809
They were all denied.

1063
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:07,771
My God. What's that fishnet?
Is it see-through?

1064
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:13,277
The judge called in a bee expert
just in case.

1065
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,403
He's been traumatized.

1066
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:19,950
Chairman Jang. Hello, sir.

1067
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,286
-Go.
-I'll sit here.

1068
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,123
Okay.

1069
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,504
Once again, thank you in advance.

1070
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:38,343
Well, Director Gil from Haemun
will put an end to the hearing today…

1071
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,429
Sir.

1072
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:54,234
All rise.

1073
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:15,380
You may be seated.

1074
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:24,806
WITNESS STAND

1075
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:29,227
Therefore, the claims made
by the plaintiff are absurd.

1076
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:32,064
None of them were healthy.

1077
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:33,774
They enjoyed smoking and drinking.

1078
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:38,695
And the other workers at Babel Chemicals
were no different.

1079
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:40,906
That'll be all.

1080
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:57,881
All of your witnesses were denied.

1081
01:17:58,548 --> 01:18:02,177
You don't have any additional witnesses
to summon, do you?

1082
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,139
Your Honor.

1083
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,892
I'd like to summon a surprise witness.

1084
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:10,852
A surprise witness?

1085
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:12,771
What is going on?

1086
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:15,273
Well…

1087
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:19,569
Do they have any information
regarding the case?

1088
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:23,115
Yes, Your Honor.
He has concrete information.

1089
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:25,951
Then…

1090
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:28,412
First…

1091
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:31,581
Bring them in then.

1092
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,583
Come inside,

1093
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,752
my surprise witness.

1094
01:19:57,042 --> 01:20:00,170
This is Vincenzo Cassano,
my surprise witness.

1095
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,766
There's a card I can't help but play.

1096
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,644
It's the most common method.

1097
01:20:57,727 --> 01:21:01,523
Creativity is something you're born with,
just like Vincenzo Cassano!

1098
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:03,108
Take her for everything she has.

1099
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:04,901
Then do something.

1100
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,778
Just shut up and demolish it.

1101
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,822
The business owners may get hurt.

1102
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:12,325
They're bound to leave traces even if
they're invisible. That's our chance.

1103
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:16,162
I present to you this critical evidence.

1104
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,123
You'll dive head-first into hell.

1105
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:20,375
You have to pay the price
for your actions.

1106
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,461
I will make them pay no matter what.

1107
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:28,550
