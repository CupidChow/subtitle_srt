1
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,269
You jerk.

2
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:08,026
-Oh, no!
-Boss!

3
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,944
If you take one more step…

4
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,033
-your boss will fall.
-Don't move, you dimwits.

5
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,409
Just stay still.

6
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,162
Everyone, stay still.

7
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,416
Babel E&C bought this building
through an illegal means.

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,210
Unless you want to die, pull me up.

9
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,419
Now!

10
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,507
I'll get this building back
no matter what.

11
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,427
And I will make all of you
pay for what you did.

12
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,141
This building belongs to me.

13
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,394
That was Italian, right? What did he say?

14
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,813
-What?
-What did he say?

15
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,064
He said…

16
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,995
Take your men and get lost.
Then, I'll help you back up.

17
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,372
I'll get lost. Help me up.

18
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,290
-What?
-I'll leave, so help me up.

19
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,584
-Promise me.
-Seriously. I promise.

20
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,752
Do I really need to?

21
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,671
Okay. I can't straighten my finger.

22
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,257
-This hurts. Oh, my finger.
-Stamp it.

23
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,758
You cruel bastard.

24
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,176
Come on. I stamped it.

25
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,719
Help me up. Hurry.

26
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,930
Go on. Help him.

27
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,225
Bring me up! Hurry up!

28
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,810
Boss!

29
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,148
Be careful.

30
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,483
-Goodness!
-It hurts!

31
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,152
-Boss, are you okay?
-Hey!

32
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,154
Boss, are you all right?

33
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,364
Oh, no! You're bleeding!

34
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,578
This could leave a scar.

35
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,913
This could leave a scar. Damn it.

36
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,378
-Kill that bastard.
-Grab your weapons.

37
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,047
I know you're a lowlife punk,

38
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,467
but aren't you breaking your promise
way too soon?

39
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,553
Let's go!

40
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,350
Hey! Stop it! Stop right there.

41
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,227
-What?
-Seriously?

42
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,855
Mr. Park, you should leave.

43
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,273
There are reporters outside.

44
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,733
Reporters? Why?

45
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,776
How should I know?

46
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,486
All right.

47
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,489
-Let's quickly disperse.
-Leave.

48
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,991
-What?
-Get lost.

49
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,578
Hey. Hey!

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,289
Stay right there.

51
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,167
I'll hang you from this very plaza soon.

52
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,336
Damn it!

53
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,254
Damn it, this scar!

54
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,966
-Goodness.
-Those bastards.

55
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,885
What was that?

56
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,220
We should talk.

57
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,268
Gosh.

58
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,939
Didn't I tell you not to fool around?

59
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,024
I wasn't fooling around.

60
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,110
I told you Mr. Cho was threatened
to sign the contract.

61
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,529
"Threatened"? Gosh.

62
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,448
That was quite a stunt you put up there.

63
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,659
You guys are amazing.

64
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,035
Why are you so childish?

65
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,453
Why won't you…

66
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,831
Why won't he trust me?

67
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,835
Seeing how you're speaking Italian,
you must feel guilty.

68
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,545
Shut up!

69
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,589
It sounds like you're cursing.

70
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,301
Think about it.

71
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,513
Why would I still be here
if I sold this building?

72
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,765
I'd take the money and go abroad.

73
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,433
-That's true.
-Be quiet!

74
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,605
Go back to your country
and stop inconveniencing us.

75
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,525
Babel E&C, Babel Pharmaceuticals,
and Law Firm Wusang

76
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,943
are all garbage.

77
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,528
Leave. All of you.

78
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,531
Somehow, I got caught in the crossfire.
Unbelievable.

79
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,324
I don't expect you to believe me.

80
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,120
I'm going to get this building back.

81
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,835
That's impossible.

82
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,712
The contract has been signed already.

83
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,677
How may I help you?

84
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,178
I'm a reporter from HBN.

85
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,847
I'd like to meet with…

86
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,560
Mr. Vincenzo Cassano.
He gave us the tip. Is he here?

87
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,562
He called you here?

88
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,652
Sir.

89
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,073
What a surprise.
You even called the reporters.

90
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,325
EPISODE 2

91
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,411
However, there's something
I just can't wrap my head around.

92
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:35,168
Why would you get worked up over this
even more so than your client?

93
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,878
The building was sold at a high price,

94
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,713
so you'll be getting a hefty sum.

95
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,592
Putting aside the money,
wouldn't this upset anyone?

96
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,509
Not at all.

97
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:47,889
Lawyers don't usually involve themselves
in matters like these.

98
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,391
European lawyers are quite strict
about these things.

99
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,976
What are you trying to say?

100
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,189
My experience tells me
that there's more to this.

101
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,232
A reason enough to make them act this way.

102
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,400
So…

103
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,448
What could that be?

104
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,326
Beats me.

105
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:13,289
But it must be something
that's more valuable than the building.

106
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,478
I saw this coming.

107
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,939
Those show-offs in flashy suits

108
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,024
are all the same.

109
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,776
Six days is nowhere enough.

110
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,779
I ought to put him in a guillotine choke
for 11 days straight.

111
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:47,573
Can you please sit down and talk?

112
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,825
Sit down.

113
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,954
He robbed us blind, didn't he?

114
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,914
I said we shouldn't trust him

115
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,332
and his good looks!

116
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,126
I knew it when he badmouthed my food.

117
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,378
It's obvious that I'm older than him,

118
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,879
but he spoke casually to me.

119
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,424
This Booralro or Vincenzo guy
is more heinous than the building owner.

120
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,345
You're right. He totally deceived us.

121
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,181
Should I go teach him a lesson?

122
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,519
How about I slam that face of his
on the ground?

123
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,354
Should I fling him to the ground?

124
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,397
Gosh.

125
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,483
I get that you're upset,
but you shouldn't hurt his face.

126
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,903
You should stop high-fiving the ground
whenever you're drunk.

127
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,948
Why are we always the ones
to get robbed blind?

128
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,534
We're not that stupid.

129
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,494
But we're not that smart, either.

130
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,371
You still don't know the times table.

131
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,539
I can't believe you.

132
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,376
I even got a new stamp
to seal the agreement.

133
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,548
Aren't Italian men
supposed to be gentlemen?

134
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,136
Not at all. They slack off
and are terrific liars.

135
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,181
They distract people
with their hand gestures.

136
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,476
-What should we do?
-You can…

137
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,145
You can just move to another temple.

138
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:03,316
Not at all. We will stay by your side
until the end.

139
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,278
I'll need to verify whether
he has truly deceived us or not.

140
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,655
Look what happened.
What's the point of that?

141
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,408
We already lost our building.

142
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,369
He was the one who called the reporters.

143
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,580
What's his plan? Why is he confusing us?

144
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,499
I'll make a thorough evaluation

145
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,251
on whether he's on our side or not.

146
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,632
Higher.

147
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,470
Okay, get ready.

148
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,181
Good.

149
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,647
-Four. Turn your waist. One, two, three.
-That's it.

150
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,940
All right. Two.

151
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,400
PROSECUTOR CHOI MYUNG-HEE

152
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,239
Our dear Deputy Minister Lee Nam-su.

153
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,625
All right.

154
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,005
So…

155
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,009
Just say that you, Minister Park Dae-jin,

156
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,846
and President Kim Song-hyeon
of JT Investment…

157
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,558
The three of you had some sushi

158
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,811
at a restaurant in Cheongdam-dong.
That's all I need from you.

159
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,564
What kind of story will you concoct
with the reporters

160
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,691
this time around?

161
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,777
Gosh. That's hurtful to hear.

162
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,405
I'm here to protect you.

163
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,491
I'm not going to reveal this to the public
or call any reporters.

164
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,078
You're planning to use JT Investment
to get to the top.

165
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,914
-I can't let you do that.
-Sir.

166
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,749
Do you know what my specialty is?

167
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,212
I can turn the most heartfelt stories
into the most heinous ones.

168
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,256
Is that so?

169
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,927
You don't believe me.

170
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,181
Minister Kim Ui-pyeong from Cheongbaek-ri

171
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:03,352
who had 1.07 billion won in debt
and no house to his name.

172
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,606
Who do you think accused him

173
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,109
of illegally accumulating two billion won
and made him end up

174
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,154
-killing himself?
-Look here, Ms. Choi!

175
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,323
Sir, you see,

176
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:20,828
I'm the person who can find faults
in the most innocent people.

177
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,538
Wait and see.

178
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,957
I'm sorry, sir.

179
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,627
Don't say that.

180
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,298
I'm glad your family's safe.

181
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,177
The plaza…

182
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,765
The plaza building.

183
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,393
If Babel E&C demolishes it,
they'll find out.

184
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,732
You have to demolish it before they do.

185
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,738
But there's more.

186
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,283
That secret room comes
with a special feature.

187
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,203
3 YEARS AGO

188
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,579
What is it?

189
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,290
It has to do
with the structure of the room.

190
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,919
The room will be touching
the building's columns and the beams

191
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,048
and will be equipped with
a device that amplifies impact.

192
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,177
When the room is put
under a considerable impact,

193
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,472
the impact will cause the columns
and the beams to crack,

194
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,141
and the building will collapse.

195
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,112
If anyone tries to break in
to steal the gold,

196
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,659
the building itself

197
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,412
will be their graveyard.

198
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,790
And there is one more important thing.

199
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,167
You must get rid of everyone

200
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,379
who has built that room
or is aware of its existence.

201
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,717
Except for Mr. Cho and me, of course.

202
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,892
For anyone apart from you
to get that gold,

203
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,978
the building…

204
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,983
will have to be demolished.

205
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,570
The family will gift you the blueprint

206
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,322
as proof of our friendship.

207
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,492
1 YEAR AGO

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,838
WANG SHAOLIN, A CHINESE TYCOON,
DIES OF CARDIAC ARREST AFTER A SWIM

209
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,228
Does his family know
about the secret room?

210
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,146
10 MONTHS AGO

211
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,274
No. It's just the three of us who know.

212
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,945
Given his nature,
I'm certain he didn't tell anyone.

213
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,284
Mr. Cho.

214
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,537
Care to make
some retirement money with me?

215
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,499
3 MONTHS AGO

216
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:18,464
Babel E&C has begun purchasing
the shops and residences around the area.

217
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,218
They also contacted me. What should I do?

218
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,720
Tell them that you're going to rebuild it.

219
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,765
We only need two days
after the construction begins.

220
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,935
Two days to move the gold.

221
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,895
NANYAK TEMPLE

222
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,402
I need to kick them out
and demolish this building.

223
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,322
I have to retrieve the gold.

224
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:47,076
When should I tell the workers to come?

225
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,204
Please tell your friend to come
three days later.

226
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,499
That'll do.

227
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,459
Okay. I got it.

228
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,671
Are you going to fix something in there?

229
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,216
Yes. We're going to fix the boiler.

230
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,095
By the way, why are you here?

231
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,224
I liked this text.

232
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,976
I see.

233
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,895
"Do not expect to get rich
through illegal means."

234
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,189
Yes, you shouldn't do that.

235
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:18,941
Sir.

236
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,068
"Don't be greedy for wealth or land.

237
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,486
Do what's right."

238
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,363
-Let's go inside.
-Thank you.

239
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:34,039
Praying on the cold floor

240
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,376
-gave me hemorrhoids.
-Oh, dear.

241
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,461
I know.

242
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,883
That sharp and heavy pain…

243
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,552
Let's install a boiler this weekend.

244
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,761
No!

245
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,315
I mean…

246
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,233
Why waste money

247
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,612
when they'll be demolishing
this place anyway?

248
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,406
I'll buy you an electric pad
that can cover this size

249
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,409
-and pay for the electricity.
-That's okay. Don't worry about it.

250
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,744
I said no!

251
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,454
Sir.

252
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,878
Please don't refuse my goodwill.

253
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,298
I'd like to show my appreciation
for you all.

254
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,223
He must've felt Buddha's presence
from beneath again.

255
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,350
I see.

256
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:40,189
-Gosh.
-Are you okay?

257
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,649
-Gosh.
-Okay.

258
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,540
The witness of the recording
confessed to perjury.

259
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,501
Even if the second trial takes place,

260
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,544
it'll be dismissed
due to lack of evidence.

261
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,713
-It's over then.
-Yes.

262
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,715
My dad has no more cards up his sleeve.

263
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,260
Yu-chan must be getting old.

264
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,929
He's out of moves.

265
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,518
-Good luck wrapping things up.
-Yes, sir.

266
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,646
Cha-young!

267
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,398
You startled me! You…

268
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,025
Damn it. Gosh.

269
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,404
You have no class and no manners.

270
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,781
Look at you wearing sneakers at work.

271
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,618
Why did you pick him of all people?

272
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,162
It was you who picked me, sir.

273
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,248
I did?

274
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,293
I should quit drinking.

275
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,132
Cha-young.

276
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,633
Quiet down.

277
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,469
Cha-young. You see…

278
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,762
What? What is it?

279
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,890
Babel Pharmaceutical's
Drug Development Division called.

280
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,643
Qua… What was it?

281
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,979
-Quarantine?
-Right! One of its researchers

282
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,897
who was quarantined went missing.

283
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,149
What?

284
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,153
The Italian Intelligence Service
sent this.

285
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,279
Okay.

286
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,364
DIRECTOR TAE JONG-GU

287
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,493
After their boss died, Vincenzo Cassano,

288
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,455
the successor in line,
was targeted by the mob.

289
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,497
I believe…

290
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,209
I believe he fled here
to avoid getting killed.

291
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,755
What does a member of the Mafia
coming to Korea

292
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,923
have to do with our security?

293
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,550
What do you mean?

294
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,927
The most wicked gang in the world
advanced into--

295
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,847
"Advanced"?
Is that what you think this is?

296
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,392
Then, if two of them flew in,
it might as well be an invasion.

297
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,104
What if Vincenzo creates
a new gang in Korea?

298
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,731
He needs money to do that.

299
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,567
How much could he have brought
before fleeing?

300
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,153
He could have secretly stashed
a fortune in Korea.

301
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,572
Why would a member of the Mafia
hide money here?

302
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,033
There are plenty of places
better suited for that.

303
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,160
Please authorize this mission first.

304
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,912
I'll get to the bottom of this.

305
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,830
You'd better not spend any of our money.

306
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,333
For every 10 won, I'll deduct 100,000 won.

307
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,001
-Sir!
-Enough!

308
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,464
What was that? Yes.
Go help the yakuza division.

309
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,675
A yakuza breaded himself
with a stab knife yesterday…

310
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,011
No. He stabbed the bread with a knife…

311
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,972
Damn it. I can't even say it right.

312
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:19,973
Get out!

313
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,061
But they're the Mafia.

314
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,105
Like the movie, The Godfather.

315
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,231
Hey.

316
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,582
SHINKWANG BANK
1,198,345 WON

317
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,251
This is enough.

318
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:52,464
Just you wait, Vincenzo Cassano.

319
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,926
I'll pay for the mission
out of my own pocket.

320
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,682
TOTAL

321
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,850
INTEREST ON LOAN

322
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,143
REMAINING BALANCE

323
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,730
It's okay.

324
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,360
It's all right. I can do it.

325
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:19,324
REMAINING BALANCE

326
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,369
You said that you told the truth
for the victims of Babel.

327
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,705
-Was everything a lie?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

328
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,415
Why did you lie?

329
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,126
-I told you that you would regret it
-I'm sorry.

330
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,752
one day.

331
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,588
I felt guilty.

332
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,424
-You sold your conscience for money
-Any words to the victims?

333
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,925
and broke the hearts of the bereaved.

334
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,594
I'm sorry for causing confusion.

335
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,346
I'm truly sorry to everyone
that I've hurt. I'm sorry.

336
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,896
What are you doing?

337
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,939
Getting rid
of the Babel lawsuit documents.

338
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,733
It's really over now.

339
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,318
Don't be absurd.

340
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,153
-It's not over--
-Until it's over?

341
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,781
-But it is really over now.
-We still have hope.

342
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,575
Trials are full of twists and turns.

343
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,118
And they always work against us.

344
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,494
Maybe not this time around.

345
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,333
-God help us.
-Oh, God.

346
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,584
You little…

347
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,345
Back for more tricks, are you?

348
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,097
I have a favor.

349
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,143
Please share with me the documents
you have on Babel E&C.

350
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,186
What for?

351
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,355
I see.

352
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,941
You want to study your enemy
before defeating them?

353
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,567
Gosh.

354
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,736
Are you still pulling this stunt?

355
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,071
Yes.

356
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:44,368
I will blow both you and the tenants away
with this stunt.

357
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,786
You should leave.

358
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,961
The one who helps out the losing team
in a war isn't an enemy but--

359
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,462
An ally. Right?

360
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,463
You little…

361
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,093
That ally…

362
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,915
Sir.

363
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,131
There are things that can only be verified
through trust.

364
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,968
If you want to win,

365
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:47,347
give me a chance instead of doubting me.

366
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,608
-Ju-sung.
-Yes?

367
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,320
Hand him all the documents

368
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,948
-we have on Babel E&C.
-Yes, sir.

369
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,585
It's been two days.
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

370
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,670
Look at her.

371
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,547
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:22,966
Seriously.

373
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,555
I told you to keep a close eye
on all the newly employed researchers.

374
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,474
I didn't want them to complain,

375
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,601
so I got them to stay
at the chairman's villa.

376
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,021
If that researcher

377
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,356
talks nonsense, we'll lose this suit.

378
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,776
And It'll be the end
for that new drug as well!

379
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,736
I'm truly sorry.

380
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,947
Do the higher-ups know?

381
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,365
No, ma'am. They don't.

382
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,951
Let's keep it that way.

383
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,453
Don't you dare tell them.

384
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,707
Okay.

385
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,133
This is driving me nuts.

386
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,636
No matter how hard we cover it up,

387
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,679
one whistleblower will end everything.

388
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:14,601
-What if they go to your dad?
-Gosh!

389
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,814
I didn't say it out loud
because I didn't want to jinx it.

390
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,442
Sorry, Cha-young.

391
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,154
They can go to the police,
the prosecution, or the reporters.

392
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,156
Just not my dad.

393
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,455
Seeing how we haven't heard anything,
I don't think they're there yet.

394
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,791
If they knew anything,

395
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,835
they wouldn't go to an incompetent lawyer.

396
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,340
Who is that?

397
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,300
-Chairman Jang Han-seo of Babel.
-What?

398
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,388
Hello, sir.

399
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,850
Who are you?

400
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,394
I'm Lawyer Hong Cha-young
from Law Firm Wusang,

401
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,812
in charge of the Babel lawsuit.

402
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,733
I heard about you.
Didn't she ask to borrow my villa?

403
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,445
That's right.
I had to because it was the safest place.

404
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,908
It's fine. I rarely go there.
Tell me if you need anything.

405
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,287
I don't like things dragging on,
so cut it short.

406
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,788
Yes, sir.

407
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:25,922
I get that he's a chairman, but how can he
talk down to us on our first encounter?

408
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,632
And he's young too.

409
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,761
Anyone who's rich and powerful

410
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,014
can do so even if they're younger than me.

411
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,767
-I see.
-Hold on.

412
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,147
Thanks to you, I have a bad feeling.

413
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,149
I'm going home.

414
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,610
Already?

415
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,157
Want some steak? I got paid yesterday.

416
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,618
No, thanks. I have somewhere to go.

417
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,998
She always leaves without me.

418
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,251
Cha-young! Your car's over there!

419
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,128
The other way!

420
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,011
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

421
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:24,147
BABEL PHARMACEUTICALS SUED
AFTER TEST SUBJECT DIES

422
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,192
Mr. Nam.

423
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,529
May I see the documents
regarding the lawsuit, please?

424
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,783
-Why?
-I'm just curious.

425
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,826
Well…

426
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,371
I need his permission.

427
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,997
Hand them over to him.

428
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,832
Every single one of them.

429
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,044
Yes, sir.

430
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,421
Here are your documents.

431
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,140
You did well dealing with Lee Nam-su.

432
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,725
Good work.

433
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,144
He was quick-witted,
so we could wrap it up quickly.

434
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,021
-Who's next?
-That's it for now.

435
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,109
He's going to hand it over
to Prosecutor Seo U-yeong.

436
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,652
Prosecutor Seo U-yeong?

437
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,364
Mr. Seo.

438
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,033
This isn't your nephew's specialty.

439
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,078
All the more reason to hire him.
That's how he'll learn.

440
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,833
Also, there's something you must do
right now.

441
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,005
It's about my colleague,
Chief Kim Won-u's scandal.

442
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,464
Can you wrap that up for us?

443
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:39,848
The sexually assaulted victim
testified against him.

444
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,684
Another woman who was at the scene
also testified,

445
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,980
and the footage of the villa was found,
which is more than enough evidence.

446
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:51,943
Exactly. That's why I want you
to touch it up, so it looks less serious.

447
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,738
This matter doesn't only pertain
to Mr. Kim.

448
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,074
The honor of our office is at stake.

449
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,827
Sir, let me pour you a glass.

450
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,920
Damn it.

451
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,551
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM

452
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,766
How many times has it been just today?

453
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,690
How do I sound him out?

454
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,821
Cha-young, you can do it.

455
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,839
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

456
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,800
He's sleeping soundly.

457
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,927
I guess there's nothing going on.

458
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,975
BABEL E&C, BABEL PHARMACEUTICALS

459
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,188
What are you doing?

460
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,315
Why are you back?

461
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,112
-Answer me.
-Did you see my wallet?

462
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,780
I lost it.

463
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,323
It's not here.

464
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,534
I cleaned the entire office today.

465
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,580
Where could it be?

466
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,541
I can guarantee that it's not here.

467
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,340
Why is he reading these?

468
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,050
Because he wanted to.

469
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,302
"Know your enemy
if you want to beat them."

470
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,762
What?

471
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,514
Babel Group is…

472
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,686
Would you mind me being vulgar?

473
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,937
Knock yourself out.

474
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,482
They're assholes.

475
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,818
"Assholes"?

476
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,529
They do everything the yakuza
and the Mafia do.

477
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,197
Everyone knows that.

478
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,366
But some lawyers help them
stay out of jail.

479
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,952
Mr. "Vincenzo Quassano."

480
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,328
Why are you doing this?

481
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,247
They're really out of line.

482
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,458
They're just like the Mafia.

483
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,878
And Law Firm Wusang, their partner,
is no exception.

484
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,379
To be clear,

485
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:20,008
Law Firm Wusang is a parasite
that mooches off those assholes.

486
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,134
Correct.

487
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,095
Assholes like them should be made to pay.

488
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,265
"Pay". I like the sound of that.

489
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,059
They ought to.

490
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,771
You guys click very well.

491
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,106
How about you two start streaming online?

492
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,485
Call it, "Hong-Vin TV," or "Hong-Qua TV."

493
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,904
That sounds nice.

494
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,822
I should get going now.

495
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,741
I'll be glad to help
if you need anything else.

496
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,118
-Do you have more?
-Yes, we do. We have plenty.

497
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,330
No, thank you. This will suffice.

498
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,831
Sir. Your tie.

499
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,125
Thank you.

500
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,960
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for your help.

501
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,590
Goodness, look at her.

502
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,137
Was this your plan B?

503
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,807
Provoking my dad to continue fighting
against Babel

504
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,142
while you make a profit off the lawsuit?

505
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,602
Am I right?

506
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,354
I'm going to eat. Please leave.

507
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,317
Unfortunately, we're closed for the day

508
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,902
since we ran out of ingredients.

509
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,906
You can go to Yeongho Snack Bar.

510
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,076
They have the best tteokbokki
in this neighborhood.

511
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,423
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

512
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,884
Welcome.

513
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,389
I won't sell anything to you.

514
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,432
-But I want to eat.
-I said no food for you.

515
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,019
Then, I'll buy it.

516
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,650
I never said you could sit there.

517
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,569
Do you not want to eat?

518
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,326
Sit down.

519
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,706
-What do you want?
-Take your pick.

520
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,332
Tteokbokki

521
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,752
Flour rice cakes, traditional gochujang,
and a bit of artificial--

522
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,670
Two servings of tteokbokki.

523
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,633
You're pretty basic.

524
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,759
"Basic"?

525
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,511
You know "asshole" but not "basic"?

526
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,681
It means "common."

527
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,894
Let's make this clear.

528
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39,898
I have no reason to provoke your dad.
I'm preparing myself for war.

529
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,320
Your enemy has tanks and armored vehicles.

530
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,530
What use would 200 stones be?

531
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,073
Do you think that's all I have?

532
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,619
Yes. The weak usually resort to
throwing stones or butting heads

533
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,704
when they are out of options.

534
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,207
I didn't think of head-butting.

535
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:04,297
Go back to Italy and fight
against those you're used to.

536
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,633
This country doesn't suit you.

537
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,134
Why not?

538
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:12,138
In Italy, only the Mafia
perform such heinous deeds.

539
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,974
But everyone here runs
their own gangs and cartels.

540
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,894
The National Assembly, prosecution,
police, public offices, and companies.

541
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,103
All of them.

542
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,482
It doesn't matter who you're up against.

543
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,609
It'll be a grueling ordeal for you.

544
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,526
Why?

545
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,154
Because that's Korea.

546
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,953
-Thanks for the advice.
-Your tteokbokki is ready.

547
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,209
May I have a glass of water?

548
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,045
You can get it yourself.

549
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,798
That is a water filter dispenser.

550
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,557
-Let's eat.
-Thank…

551
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,485
Happiness isn't far away.

552
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,195
-Do you like it?
-Yes!

553
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,408
I'm home. I'm hungry.

554
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,966
What are you doing?

555
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,136
What?

556
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,096
Didn't I tell you not to smoke?

557
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,390
I didn't.
I was just standing next to them.

558
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,269
I told you I'd give you a good beating
if you lied.

559
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,105
Snap out of it! Don't hit your son!

560
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,608
If you don't want to die,
put your guard up.

561
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:49,944
Mom! Come on, it hurts.

562
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,863
One, two.

563
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,032
You little brat!

564
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,580
Does she have a black belt?

565
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,712
Goodness.

566
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,383
Oh, dear.

567
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:23,770
You want me to cover for a filthy bastard
and take all the blame?

568
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,525
Let's go.

569
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,245
I'll destroy each and every
last one of you, you assholes.

570
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,919
Hello, there!

571
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,760
I'll just cut to the chase.

572
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,138
Ms. Choi. I mean, Myung-hee.

573
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,557
Hey.

574
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,561
Join my law firm. Okay?

575
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,358
You impudent brat. Explain yourself.

576
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,819
Prosecutor General Hwang and Mr. Seo.

577
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:16,239
Everyone knows they're trying
to form a cartel of sorts

578
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,032
at the Namdongbu Prosecutors' Office.

579
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,284
One that's impenetrable
by even the Reform Committee.

580
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,954
Do you think they'll let you in? No way!

581
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,832
They'll use and discard you
like they did today.

582
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,416
Enough already.

583
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,796
Just drink up and stop nagging me.

584
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,256
I'm not nagging.

585
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,510
If you join us,

586
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,222
I'll let you bring down that prosecution.

587
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,557
Have you gone insane?

588
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,229
You know I'm helping out
Babel Group, right?

589
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,691
They'll back us up no matter what.

590
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,609
They are just a company.

591
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:57,071
In three years, they'll be
one of the twenty richest companies.

592
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,490
Their drugs are second to none.

593
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,827
Also, their chairman has a few
loose screws and is easy to handle.

594
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:08,374
You must have a good reason
to be cleaning up after their messes.

595
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,375
Exactly.

596
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,379
Even though I'm cleaning up their shit,

597
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,589
I keep getting richer.

598
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,218
Unbelievable.

599
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,221
So you want us to act like their bidets?

600
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,515
I'll do all the trivial work.

601
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,976
You just need to leave them
a solid impression.

602
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,896
Have you been working
as a salesman instead?

603
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,857
Just choose me
like you choose your clothes.

604
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,484
I heard it takes you ten minutes
to shop for clothes.

605
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,280
The alcohol is getting the better of me.

606
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,659
Exactly how crazy is this chairman?

607
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,064
It's all my fault.

608
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,734
I should've kept an eye
on the researchers, but I failed.

609
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,736
I'll take care of it as soon as…

610
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,538
I'm sorry for the delay
in the Babel Tower construction.

611
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,582
There were issues with the building owner.

612
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,084
I'll also take care of…

613
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,592
I promise

614
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,303
to be more thorough from now on.

615
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,515
I promise I won't disappoint you again.

616
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,187
Please give me one more chance.

617
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,983
I promise I'll do better.

618
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,345
Don't tell me you've already run out
of ingredients.

619
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:08,888
No.

620
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,767
If it wasn't Italy,
where did you learn to cook?

621
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,812
Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province.

622
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,149
At a place called
Mom's Touch Cooking Academy.

623
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:22,860
"Mom's Touch"?

624
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,656
Serve me food until I can finally
get a taste of a mom's touch.

625
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,450
But I'm not a mom.

626
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:34,288
If not, then I'll have no choice
but to expose you.

627
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,539
Sorry?

628
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,758
Saffron risotto.

629
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,552
Okay. I'll get it ready.

630
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,514
It tastes like vomited baby food…

631
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,307
How should I put it?

632
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:38,144
Yes. And it's been mixed
in wine and broth.

633
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,942
You have a knack for making awful food.

634
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,790
If you look over here…

635
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,584
-Sir.
-Yes?

636
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,003
We need to go somewhere.

637
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,005
Where?

638
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,219
They won't see you without an appointment.

639
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,555
-Let's ask.
-What?

640
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,269
How may I help you?

641
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,354
I'm here to see Mr. Na Deok-jin
of Investment and Development.

642
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,898
-Have you called beforehand?
-No.

643
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,193
I'm afraid you can't meet him.

644
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,909
BILL OF INDICTMENT

645
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,537
Tell him he has a bill of indictment
for threatening and abetting an abduction.

646
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,836
When did you get that?

647
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,516
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

648
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,769
Let me see the bill. Let's read it.

649
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,576
BILL OF INDICTMENT

650
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,161
THREAT AND ABETTING AN ABDUCTION

651
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,501
It's empty.

652
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,837
I lied, so we could meet.

653
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:33,592
We've paid you enough already. Why…

654
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,471
-But why are you so clingy?
-We're not clingy.

655
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,306
We just want to correct what's wrong.

656
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,685
Sure. Then, feel free to sue or report me.

657
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,520
Do as you please.

658
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,814
Or demonstrate in front of the Blue House

659
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,941
-and shave your head.
-No.

660
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,944
I thought I'd do the same as you did.

661
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,824
We'll kidnap your family

662
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,742
and force you to cancel the contract.

663
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,414
Are you a die-hard fan of The Godfather?

664
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,207
Are you mimicking the Mafia

665
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,126
since you're from Italy?

666
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,593
I'm glad you asked.

667
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,679
If we were in Italy,

668
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,849
you would've become a fertilizer
for the vineyards.

669
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,062
You would have become some cheap wine
being sold on a buy-one-get-one-free deal.

670
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,610
I'm not here to negotiate but to warn you.

671
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,945
We're not going to take it anymore.

672
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,990
Okay.

673
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,586
Was that how you did things in Italy?

674
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,046
At times.

675
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,923
I loved what you said.

676
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,760
"Vineyard fertilizer.
Buy-one-get-one-free."

677
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,804
"Hey.

678
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,849
You're buy-two-get-one-free."

679
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,810
I should use it sometime.

680
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,108
Let's eat. It's on me.
Two meals for the price of one.

681
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,362
RESIGNATION LETTER

682
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,575
Some company must've given you an offer.

683
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,744
Law Firm Wusang? Wintis?

684
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,955
-Ko and Gu?
-No.

685
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,708
I just want to rest.

686
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,543
Don't sugarcoat it.

687
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,004
What's the real reason?

688
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:35,756
I just…

689
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,760
I'm sick of being your hound.

690
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,887
That's a bit harsh.

691
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,389
I'm sorry to break it to you,

692
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,725
but wherever you go,
you'll always be a hound on a leash.

693
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:47,893
Probably.

694
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:49,978
However,

695
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,440
my leash will probably be longer.

696
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,027
And they'll feed me better.

697
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,158
Goodbye, guys.

698
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,244
Where do you think you're going?

699
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,455
Hey, Ms. Choi. Hey!

700
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,299
PROSECUTOR CHOI MYUNG-HEE

701
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:33,021
Prosecutor or not, I'm going to
destroy all of you before I leave.

702
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,832
What's with the meeting?

703
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,878
This way, please.

704
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,468
You splurged, didn't you?

705
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,344
Isn't that Prosecutor Choi?

706
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,680
Sit down.

707
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:12,060
I'm sorry to gather you all so suddenly.

708
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,438
We have an important guest.

709
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,733
I'm sure you all know her.
It's Prosecutor Choi Myung-hee.

710
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:21,111
From this day on,

711
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:24,948
she will be a senior lawyer at Wusang.

712
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:31,455
Soon, she will represent us on my behalf.

713
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,049
I knew you'd be happy.

714
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:46,220
Wusang will be invincible.

715
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,138
Please say a word or two.

716
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,724
I have two things to say. Number one.

717
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:54,686
One who achieves small victories
will eventually achieve big ones.

718
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,064
Number two. I beg you.

719
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,359
Let's not work hard
if it can't be appreciated. That's all.

720
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:04,571
Clap, will you?

721
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,495
Look at her acting all tough
from the get-go.

722
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:15,123
She just got here.
How could she represent our law firm?

723
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,416
She's a mere rookie.

724
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,377
Well, she was the best prospector there.

725
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,130
Ms. Hong should be the one
to represent us.

726
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,675
She achieved the most out of all of us.

727
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,556
You're not consoling or bashing me.
What is this?

728
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,683
Bash you?

729
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:34,685
We're just upset by the unfair treatment.

730
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,146
But I can see you grinning.

731
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,027
She's so quick to notice.

732
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,280
How did she know we were happy?

733
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:49,866
I knew it ever since
he deducted the withholding taxes.

734
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,660
Gosh.

735
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,470
I get you,

736
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,847
but you don't have soul.

737
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,558
You look more like a patient
than a zombie.

738
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,476
I could do just as much.

739
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,022
Like this.

740
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,692
You're so good. I can do it too.

741
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,031
I'm a pretty zombie.

742
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,201
-Goodness, you're terrifying.
-Go away.

743
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,704
-That's not how you do it.
-Try that again, Larry.

744
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,456
Not like this. Do this.

745
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,667
That's it.

746
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,878
No, try harder. Put your back into it.

747
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,213
That's it.

748
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,267
-Goodness.
-Wait.

749
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,228
I heard some gagging noises.

750
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,564
What were you doing?

751
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,942
I was chosen to coach the zombies

752
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:10,113
for the upcoming Train to Ulsan Part Two.
I was practicing.

753
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,448
We were helping him out.

754
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,699
I see.

755
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,701
Yes.

756
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,745
Good luck.

757
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,041
Let's go.

758
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,918
Okay.

759
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,464
Darn it.

760
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,675
-How humiliating.
-Oh, no.

761
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,803
His cold gaze.

762
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,057
He probably saw the roof of my mouth.

763
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,560
What should I do?

764
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,106
What should I do?

765
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:51,196
Let us know if you need extras
for the movie.

766
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,364
I'll do my best.

767
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,908
Me, too. I'm serious.

768
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,743
-No, you can't.
-Please.

769
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,746
No, I need to ask them for permission.

770
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,877
From what I've seen of Babel E&C,

771
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,131
they forcibly evict the residents
one week after the notice.

772
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,966
Yes, they've always done that.

773
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,468
They demolish the non-residential areas

774
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,512
and instill fear
in the remaining residents.

775
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,348
It's downright illegal,
but Law Firm Wusang has their back.

776
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:22,227
Isn't there a law
that protects the tenants?

777
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,441
I heard they need to pay
a premium compensation to the tenants

778
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,026
and negotiate the demolition date
with an officer.

779
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,111
That's what I read.

780
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,698
You've studied a lot.

781
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:40,996
They were being too ridiculous
that I had to read up on it.

782
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,748
I see.

783
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,127
Those rules exist, but they force
the tenants out with a small sum.

784
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,755
People get hurt or die too.

785
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,842
They'll probably carry out
the eviction suit first.

786
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,093
We should get ready.

787
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,803
Isn't the biggest issue here

788
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,347
the forced illegal demolition?

789
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,474
Yes.

790
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,101
They'll make a move in a day or two.

791
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,729
But there's nothing we can do.

792
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,232
Gosh.

793
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,529
Here. Do you want one?

794
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,990
-No, thank you.
-Then, why…

795
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,664
Do you drink?

796
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,423
You've never makgeolli before?

797
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,842
-No.
-I see.

798
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,970
It only gives a mild hangover,
so drink up.

799
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,597
Here. Bottoms up.

800
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,808
Here you go.

801
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,112
I can finally taste it
now that I've had my second glass.

802
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:59,783
In that case, drink up.

803
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,326
Here you go.

804
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:06,915
Cheers.

805
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,686
By the way, should I congratulate you
for diving headfirst into hell?

806
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,232
I'm fighting against Babel
because I'm stupid.

807
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,984
But not you.

808
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,279
By the way,

809
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:42,617
are you also a public defender?

810
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,704
I am. For one person.

811
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,708
I truly pity her.

812
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,461
She was falsely charged with murder.

813
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,090
And yet, she accepted it

814
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,634
and made peace with her pancreatic cancer.

815
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:04,848
Why

816
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,310
would she do that?

817
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:15,483
She believes she's being punished
for abandoning her son in the past.

818
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,945
She says feeling guilty isn't enough.

819
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:23,241
There are people who readily accept
their punishment.

820
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,287
And there are those who are shameless
even after committing crimes.

821
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,205
In any case,

822
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,584
only the kindhearted and the weak suffer.

823
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,170
I know you won't get it.

824
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,131
For the past two days,

825
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,053
I experienced firsthand

826
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,513
how the weak suffered.

827
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,018
I couldn't do anything.

828
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,813
So I became even more furious.

829
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:58,026
Those who are truly weak endure
the feeling of helplessness and rage

830
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,820
until the day they die.

831
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,790
I have a question.

832
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,669
What's the story
behind your law firm's name?

833
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,008
I don't defend my clients.

834
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,761
I become their last straw, a jipuragi.

835
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:29,641
When they don't have anyone to lean on,

836
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,727
they can still grab onto me.

837
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,605
I am their last straw.

838
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:42,696
Excuse me.

839
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,700
Hello, Hong Yu-chan speaking.

840
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,038
Hello, I'm listening.

841
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,624
Hello?

842
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,925
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

843
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,970
Was that a prank call?

844
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,854
I heard this is how you pour drinks here.

845
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,110
You seem quite genuine today.

846
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,362
Or have I become dull?

847
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,992
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

848
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,412
You need to turn around and drink.

849
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,164
Yes.

850
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,628
Just turn halfway.

851
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,380
Halfway.

852
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,557
We've pretty much won
the Babel Pharmaceuticals case.

853
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,350
Ms. Hong just needs to finish up.

854
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,103
Babel E&C is the problem here.

855
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,773
We need to demolish a plaza
in Geumga-dong.

856
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:00,940
Brace yourselves.

857
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,984
Why do they need to brace themselves?

858
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,780
It's quite sly.

859
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,990
Demolishing it right away
would be illegal,

860
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,493
so we bring in heavy equipment
for a so-called cleanup

861
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,369
and accidentally damage the building.

862
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,205
The tenants move out in fear,

863
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,581
and Babel claims it's a mistake.

864
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,166
The building becomes vacant in a few days.

865
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:21,044
Legal or not, we'll get the job done

866
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:22,712
because they trust us.

867
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:27,509
Lawyers are better than prosecutors
at making people shit their pants.

868
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,345
Such assholes.

869
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,640
She says that all the time.

870
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,476
And…

871
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,562
Oh, dear.

872
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,567
Your dad is once again leading
the Development Opposition Committee.

873
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:48,071
What a fun life he's living.

874
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,284
Shouldn't we estimate the scale of damage?

875
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,746
Thankfully, it'll be smaller than
the redevelopment in Yucheon-dong.

876
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,374
I believe four people still died there.

877
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,834
That's not bad.

878
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,336
Twelve people died
during Yonghu-dong's redevelopment.

879
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,339
It's fine. They'll crawl out
when push comes to shove.

880
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:09,175
Right. Don't forget your dad.

881
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,517
Let's see.

882
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,359
I heard that they're demolishing it.

883
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,990
They're so cruel. There are people--

884
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,199
It's not cruel!

885
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,745
It wouldn't be so cruel
if they moved out willingly.

886
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:47,130
What's with those people?
How can they be so dense?

887
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:50,175
It's easier said than done.

888
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,222
Their lawyer is the one who's the worst.

889
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:01,936
If he's a lawyer,
he should be more levelheaded.

890
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:29,964
Hello.

891
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,008
Doesn't it feel like
your head's been split open?

892
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,427
Mine's already smashed.

893
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,056
Yes. I'm having a pretty bad hangover.

894
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,601
Come over. Let's eat something.

895
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,478
I'll text you my address.

896
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,604
But I…

897
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,692
Come in.

898
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,070
It's a mess, isn't it?

899
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,906
The soup just needs to boil,
so please sit down.

900
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,491
There's nothing worth looking at.

901
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,786
All right.

902
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,963
You must have another daughter.

903
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,589
What? No.

904
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,049
That's Cha-young.

905
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:14,968
What?

906
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,687
I see.

907
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,569
Hello, Chairman Jang.

908
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,240
They've informed me
that they're ready for the demolition.

909
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,535
We'll be ready by tomorrow as well.

910
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,328
Yes, sir.

911
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,331
Don't worry.

912
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,792
This is our job.

913
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:52,547
I believe they'll start working
around 11 p.m. tomorrow.

914
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,008
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

915
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:59,929
Cha-young!

916
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,849
-What is it this time?
-They're--

917
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,767
What? What is it?

918
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,936
Tomorrow at 11 p.m.

919
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,106
That's when they'll demolish the building.

920
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:14,402
I heard Mr. Han speaking
with that impudent chairman.

921
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:18,072
They're ready, and they'll do it tomorrow.

922
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,449
What?

923
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,790
How is it? Don't you feel so much better?

924
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,083
-Right?
-Yes.

925
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,586
I make the best--

926
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,713
Can you please pick up?

927
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,340
I called you more than 30 times.

928
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,674
You're so noisy.

929
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,676
What is it this time?

930
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,262
Why do you still have these hanging?

931
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,181
You're going to donate them?

932
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,517
Eat while you're here. Come.

933
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,773
There's a serious problem.

934
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:54,275
-This isn't a time to be eating.
-What is it?

935
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,864
Hello, Hong Yu-chan speaking.

936
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,449
See? You screen my calls.

937
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,660
-Why do you ignore my calls? Why?
-Sorry?

938
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,665
I see. One moment, please.

939
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,083
Hang on.

940
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:18,800
I'd like to tell you about what they did
to their test subjects.

941
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,635
So there were problems, weren't there?

942
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,096
Yes. I can't tell you the details
over the phone.

943
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,514
I'd like to meet soon.

944
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,516
Of course.

945
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,351
Go ahead.

946
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,603
All right.

947
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:33,856
I'll head over there right now. Goodbye.

948
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,197
Babel E&C is--

949
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,991
This is urgent. Speak with him, okay?

950
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,910
Dad! Mr. Hong!

951
01:01:58,756 --> 01:01:59,799
What is it?

952
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:10,727
They'll demolish the building
at 11 p.m. tomorrow.

953
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,730
Evacuate the tenants right now.

954
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:16,607
They say they'll avoid
the residential area,

955
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,985
but who knows what'll happen?

956
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,489
I've only met you three days ago,

957
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,533
but this is the first time
you seem worried.

958
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:31,122
I'm worried about none other than myself.

959
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,374
If my dad gets hurt during the demolition,

960
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,293
it'll do me no good.

961
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:39,756
Think about it.
What will my colleagues think of me?

962
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,424
I see.

963
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:50,183
What is this place? A crime scene?

964
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,189
Darn it. You're done, right?

965
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,566
Unbelievable.

966
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:01,736
I told him many times
not to pile up the dirty dishes.

967
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:19,879
MOTEL

968
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,521
Hello, Mr. Yu Min-chul.

969
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,380
They'll demolish the building
at 11 p.m. tomorrow.

970
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,674
Evacuate the tenants right now.

971
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,434
How can I stop them?

972
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,104
How?

973
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:23,693
What?

974
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,236
Tonight?

975
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:26,946
Yes, at 11 p.m.

976
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,781
How could you tell us now?

977
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,367
-You're unbelievable.
-When they come,

978
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:35,705
I could grab and nail them to the ground.

979
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,623
Since I know martial arts,

980
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,084
I'm afraid I might kill them.

981
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,335
Nail them, my foot.

982
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,379
We should evacuate. Do you want to die?

983
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:47,216
Goodness. Babel, those assholes.

984
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,176
I hope they all go under!

985
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,386
Is there a solution?

986
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,389
Mr. Hong is busily--

987
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:54,473
Busily doing what?

988
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,558
Tell us.

989
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,226
I didn't see him all day.

990
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:03,649
This is where we live and work.

991
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:08,362
If we evacuate,
we'll be leaving behind everything.

992
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:14,327
I bought all my utensils new last month.

993
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,536
Me too.

994
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,080
I got a loan two months ago
and bought a new piano.

995
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:20,666
Mr. Cassano.

996
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,086
Say something, will you?

997
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,049
Goodness, that damn man.

998
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:29,675
What the hell is he doing?

999
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:33,012
Who cares? Let's go pack our things.

1000
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:36,807
I'll protest outside and distract them.

1001
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,268
What the hell are you doing?

1002
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:46,025
Sir, you don't have time
to be liking photos online.

1003
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,152
-What?
-What is he liking?

1004
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:53,032
Come up with a solution, will you?

1005
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,130
IMAGES MATCHING VINCENZO CASSANO
SEARCHED ON 13:11

1006
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,842
Isn't anyone in here?

1007
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,595
Hold on.

1008
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,389
Who locked the door?

1009
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,685
Damn it. Hey, open up.

1010
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,023
Vincenzo Cassano…

1011
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,526
Vincenzo Cassano.

1012
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:38,244
-Pack everything!
-Goodness!

1013
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,000
Hey…

1014
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,049
Is that true?

1015
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,217
Yes.

1016
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:56,095
I called you yesterday,
but you weren't picking up.

1017
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:58,889
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

1018
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,307
What time is it?

1019
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,477
Let me think. What should I do?

1020
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,065
What should I do?

1021
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,738
ATTORNEY HONG CHA-YOUNG

1022
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,131
I'll call you back.

1023
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,093
Nothing is easy these days.

1024
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,680
Everything requires so much work.
It's such a headache.

1025
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:44,977
All notable paintings
have several layers of paint.

1026
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:49,106
But then again, it's our job
to paint over without leaving a trace.

1027
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,236
-When will I get to see the chairman?
-Right.

1028
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,405
In two days.

1029
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,659
He has great expectations for you.

1030
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:04,246
I need to see for myself how crazy he is.

1031
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,042
Sir.

1032
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:11,045
Why are you here?

1033
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,755
I have something urgent to report.

1034
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:15,049
What is it?

1035
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:17,885
I caught wind of something
at the Babel headquarters.

1036
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:20,429
One of the researchers
of Babel Pharmaceuticals

1037
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:23,015
ran away during the quarantine.

1038
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,391
What?

1039
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,893
Damn it.

1040
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,604
They've dropped a giant bomb on us.

1041
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:30,272
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1042
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:43,536
Shouldn't you go?

1043
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,329
There's nothing I can do.

1044
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:10,896
Where are you, Dad?

1045
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,899
Why are you still there?

1046
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,943
Don't worry. I won't die.

1047
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:18,821
Cut that nonsense and get out of there.

1048
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,575
I'm turning my phone off again.
You're distracting me.

1049
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,453
Dad!

1050
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,330
Oh, come on!

1051
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:30,541
Wait!

1052
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,222
The stress is killing me.

1053
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,935
-Hello, sir.
-Hey!

1054
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,020
Where are you?

1055
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,063
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now.

1056
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:03,949
Come over here.

1057
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:06,202
Okay.

1058
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:08,704
All right.

1059
01:10:08,787 --> 01:10:10,539
Sir, we're ready.

1060
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,588
All right! Let's go!

1061
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:18,964
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

1062
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,691
Come on.

1063
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,303
Damn it.

1064
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,379
What is this?

1065
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:43,424
TRADITIONAL SICILIAN WINE PARTY
FOR INSIDERS

1066
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:48,846
What is this?

1067
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,520
-What? What is that?
-A party?

1068
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:30,054
We're at the Traditional Sicilian
Wine Party for Insiders.

1069
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:31,889
I've finally arrived.

1070
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,558
Make sure to subscribe and like my video.

1071
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,419
-Mr. Nam.
-Sir.

1072
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:05,214
These men love this party.

1073
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:06,673
They've been complimenting.

1074
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:08,342
Hello. Thank you for coming.

1075
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,095
-Cheers.
-How nice.

1076
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,639
We still have a lot of time,
so please enjoy the party.

1077
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,645
Let's leave him here. Let's go.

1078
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:46,398
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

1079
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,608
We don't need him.

1080
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:49,234
Wait.

1081
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:56,617
How about

1082
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,287
we have a party tonight?

TRADITIONAL SICILIAN WINE PARTY
FOR INSIDERS

1086
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,470
Excuse me for a second, sir.

1087
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,223
Hello, sir.

1088
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,976
He's the owner of the shop next door.

1089
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:04,977
I see.

1090
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,728
Hello. Thank you for coming.

1091
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:07,854
The spaghetti is good.

1092
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:10,148
-Please escort them.
-This way.

1093
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:38,695
Have you grasped the core problem
of this lawsuit?

1094
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,615
Drugs? Cartels? Do you think this is
some American TV show?

1095
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:43,784
Stupid idiot.

1096
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:45,118
Hey, it's Vincenzo!

1097
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:47,579
They're not businessmen. They're monsters.

1098
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,707
They couldn't care less
about the lives of others.

1099
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:54,086
Can you not represent
Babel Pharmaceuticals?

1100
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,963
That will be the end of you, you brat.

1101
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,340
I will not cave in without a fight.

1102
01:17:58,423 --> 01:18:00,342
Why are you being so reckless?

1103
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:03,136
For me, running away
isn't the coward's way out.

1104
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,722
It's putting other people in danger.

1105
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,474
Don't try anything funny.

1106
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:09,059
You'll be dead if anything happens to me.

1107
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:13,730
