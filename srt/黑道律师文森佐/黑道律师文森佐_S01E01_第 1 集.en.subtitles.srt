1
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,706
My goal is

2
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,336
to tear down this building.

3
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,825
72 HOURS AGO, ROME, ITALY

4
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,962
CONSIGLIERE OF THE CASSANO FAMILY

5
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:54,007
VINCENZO CASSANO

6
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,718
CONSIGLIERE

7
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,679
A LEGAL ADVISER OR COUNSELOR
OF AN ITALIAN MAFIA'S BOSS

8
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,382
To Emilio's house.

9
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes, Mr. Consigliere.

10
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,561
EPISODE 1

11
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,614
Why did you come here?

12
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,222
GRECCO VINEYARD

13
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,572
How can you do business
even on the day of your boss' funeral?

14
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,337
This is the last offer from my boss,
Fabio.

15
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,506
An offer from his grave? Not interested.

16
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,300
You can take it and leave.

17
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,725
Killing Union President Carlo
to take over the vineyard and the union

18
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,894
was a mistake on your part.

19
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,146
He was like

20
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,566
a brother to Fabio.

21
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,818
Whatever the offer is,
I won't be accepting it.

22
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,490
Does it sound like an offer to you?

23
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:12,038
This is Fabio's last act of mercy to a man

24
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,833
who killed his dear friend.

25
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,338
Are you here to make a deal…

26
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,007
or to threaten me?

27
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,012
If you sign this now,

28
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,807
there won't be any problems.

29
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,974
Get lost.

30
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,562
Go back to your country,
you arrogant yellow.

31
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,607
I fought fair and square to take over.

32
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,859
The Cassano family has no shares
in this place.

33
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,903
Get out of here.

34
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,797
You sure you won't regret it?

35
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,511
Regret?

36
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,597
The Lucino family is backing me up.

37
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,642
I'm not scared to go to war.

38
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,691
Regret is the most painful thing
you can experience in life.

39
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,193
Emilio.

40
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:29,574
I am here to give you a chance
to redeem yourself,

41
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,243
not to start a war.

42
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,370
Sure. Whatever.

43
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,580
Arigatou.

44
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,748
You uncivilized yellow.

45
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,475
Emilio.

46
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,772
You will pay

47
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,734
for disrespecting my people.

48
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,111
You neanderthal.

49
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,119
Vincenzo, did you curse at me?

50
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,163
What did you say to me?

51
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,219
Why are they spraying
the pesticides today?

52
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,681
We sprayed them last week.

53
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,688
Damn it! What…

54
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,735
Shit.

55
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,946
They're not spraying pesticides.

56
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,207
Oh, no! It's all burning!

57
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,959
Everything is burning!

58
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,378
Don't just stand there!

59
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,089
Move it! Now!

60
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,383
Hurry!

61
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,304
That asshole, Vincenzo!

62
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,722
I'll get my revenge!

63
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,558
I'll get back at everyone!
You and the Cassano family!

64
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,602
Hurry!

65
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,518
Father.

66
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,496
You could have done that
after the funeral.

67
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,709
It was his last order.

68
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,004
He told me to take care of it
as soon as possible.

69
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,630
Even so,

70
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,050
burning down the entire vineyard
was stupid.

71
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,847
He said I could use any means necessary
to get it done.

72
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,225
Right. My father always trusted
your decisions,

73
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,352
but never trusted mine.

74
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:56,650
Because you were always careless
when you took care of things.

75
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,071
You went against his word
that no matter what happens,

76
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,449
we do not harm women or children.

77
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,377
Vincenzo.

78
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,421
My friend.

79
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,507
My brother.

80
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,803
Now that I'm your boss,
I'd like to see you be more loyal.

81
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:25,888
Paolo.

82
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,681
My brother.

83
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,102
I am always ready
to show my loyalty to you…

84
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,858
as long as you deserve it.

85
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,102
Looking for me?

86
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,477
Did you enjoy the party?

87
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,270
Vincenzo.

88
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,401
I can hear Payan barking.
You must be heading towards the door.

89
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,530
How did you…

90
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,408
Oh, right. Let me apologize in advance.

91
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,994
I know that it's your favorite car.

92
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:43,627
I didn't kill you
out of respect for Fabio.

93
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,798
And this will be the last time.

94
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,015
I'm leaving Italy
and will never come back.

95
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,894
Do not look for me.

96
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,949
The next time you try to find me,

97
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,162
the car will explode before you get off.

98
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,748
Paolo.

99
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,417
I knew you didn't deserve to be the boss.

100
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,822
LIST OF BUSINESSES IN GEUMGA PLAZA

101
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,515
GEUMGA PLAZA TO BE DEMOLISHED
DUE TO CONGLOMERATE'S TYRANNY

102
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,141
GEUMGA PLAZA

103
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,128
Ta-da!

104
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,673
Get your blood sugar up with this.

105
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,007
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE

106
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,718
I bought this from the most popular bakery
in Yeonnam-dong.

107
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,721
I'm good. Please go.

108
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,850
Eating this tasty snack

109
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,519
in the middle of a long day
is a form of happiness.

110
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,521
I'm happy enough already.

111
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,484
You're happy?

112
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,444
Didn't you sign up as a test subject

113
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,780
at a pharmaceutical
to pay back your student loan?

114
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,657
You didn't have any side effects,

115
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,410
but you were the only one
who blew the whistle.

116
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,246
-How can you be happy right now?
-I can.

117
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,248
I believe my action meant something.

118
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,458
You are fearless.

119
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,919
But…

120
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,757
will you still be happy
when Babel Pharmaceuticals sues you?

121
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,758
What?

122
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,803
They're livid right now.

123
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,182
They just ordered us
to destroy your life, Seon-ho.

124
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:51,064
No one really cares
about what happens to you.

125
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,901
Why? Because your sob story
won't make anyone sad.

126
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,319
It's not sad at all.

127
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,365
I'm the only one who actually
cares about your life, Seon-ho.

128
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,867
It's just me, Hong Cha-young.

129
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,955
Pull the cake topper.

130
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,214
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE

131
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,765
How much is that?

132
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,657
My goodness. What a mess.

133
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,669
-Sorry, Cha-young.
-Where are you manners?

134
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,213
If you were late,
you should've taken a taxi.

135
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,839
That's faster than a taxi.

136
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,424
Besides, that's the city's trend.

137
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,468
Just tell me why you're late.

138
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,764
Lawyer Yoon In-seo told me
to make 1,200 copies out of the blue.

139
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,724
Intern Jang Joon-woo.

140
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,185
Tell me the kind of person
I hate the most.

141
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,353
Robotic people.

142
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,730
Right.
People who work their ass off like robots,

143
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,066
but always fall short in the end.

144
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,736
I might be lacking,
but aren't I a good intern?

145
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,697
A lovely intern at that?

146
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,157
If you start wearing different ties,

147
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,410
I'll think about
whether to like you or not.

148
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,371
But Steve Jobs wore the same turtlenecks.

149
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,623
I prefer sophisticated men
to stubborn men.

150
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,963
COURTHOUSE

151
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,674
DAY 1 OF THE HEARING
FOR BABEL PHARMCEAUTICAL'S LAWSUIT

152
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,363
Claiming the victims died
from the side effects of the drug

153
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,781
is still preposterous.

154
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,576
The plaintiff is provoking the press
with unproven evidence.

155
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,662
The victims all passed away
from cardiac infarction

156
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,747
and had no prior conditions.

157
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,583
One of them had arrhythmia.
Another had pulmonary edema.

158
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,626
And another had low blood pressure.

159
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,672
She extracted these conditions
from the victims' old medical histories.

160
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,174
The paramedics on the scene

161
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,885
stated that they showed typical signs
of an overdose.

162
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,095
Paramedics aren't licensed doctors.

163
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,890
They only stated the external symptoms.

164
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:33,894
Your Honor, I have the recording-based
statement from one of the test subjects.

165
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,773
Babel coerced him
to make a false statement

166
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,191
to silence the others.

167
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,777
-This statement clearly states--
-Your Honor.

168
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,279
The test subject who made the statement

169
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,865
turned himself in for perjury an hour ago.

170
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,035
I submit the interrogation report
as evidence.

171
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,707
After perjuring himself,
the witness planned

172
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,960
to extort money from Babel Pharm
through the plaintiff's counsel.

173
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,879
But as he was conscience-stricken,

174
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,507
-he decided to turn himself in.
-Your Honor.

175
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,303
It's a one-sided statement. His perjury
charge hasn't been established.

176
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,388
The recording should
be admissible in court.

177
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,475
We will rule
once the witness' perjury charge

178
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,726
has been established.

179
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,563
The next hearing will be held
a week from today in this courtroom.

180
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,735
That is all.

181
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,703
Give me a cigarette.

182
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,706
-I quit two years ago.
-Just leave, then.

183
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,211
At least wash your hair
when you come to court.

184
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,632
I don't need that from you. Just go.

185
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,678
We could have just settled out of court.

186
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,431
How could you start this mess
when you weren't even sure you could win?

187
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,725
Start this mess?

188
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,522
-That's no way to talk to your father.
-I thought you disowned me.

189
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,482
Right.

190
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,485
No daughter of mine would
buy off a witness like that.

191
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,946
Do you find peace
when you criticize your daughter?

192
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,739
You and Babel deserve it.

193
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,241
You guys are like mafias.

194
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:16,580
How could you be so proud
of destroying the powerless?

195
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,585
Dad.

196
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,212
Can't you stop?

197
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,632
Even if you don't treat me
like your daughter,

198
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,178
I still worry so much about you.

199
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,763
I worry that this might be
taking a toll on you

200
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,682
physically and emotionally.

201
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,268
Dad.

202
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:42,689
If you stop, I'll help you.

203
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,194
I'm embarrassed to say this now,
but now that I'm older,

204
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,197
I realized that family comes first.

205
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,330
-Cha-young.
-Yes, Dad.

206
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,875
Why don't you quit being a lawyer
and start anew as an actor?

207
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,337
That way, you won't ruin
other people's lives.

208
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,592
You'll never beat me!

209
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,970
We'll find out when it ends.

210
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,098
Also, I've made up my mind.
I am really going to disown you.

211
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,350
How will you do that?

212
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,602
I'm sure I'll find a way.

213
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,437
Bye.

214
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,785
Excuse me.

215
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,204
I need to do an inspection.

216
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,376
WANTED
NAME: PARK JEONG-GUK

217
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,045
May I see your identification?

218
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,679
REPUBLICA ITALIANA
VINCENZO CASSANO

219
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,520
Gosh. You're Korean Italian.

220
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,855
I'm so sorry. Gosh, my bad.

221
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,776
The wanted man is Korean, you see.

222
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,195
Gosh, I'm sorry.

223
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:16,700
Oh, my. You have such a cool name.

224
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,785
"Vincen Zo"?

225
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,870
Which Zo clan are you from?

226
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,047
-Give me back my passport.
-Okay.

227
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,888
Yes. Mr. Cho. I got here safely.

228
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,599
I see.

229
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,935
See you there, then.

230
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,855
It will take about an hour and a half.

231
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,523
Okay.

232
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,193
Come on. How can they cancel
when I just got here?

233
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,865
Excuse me. Are you looking for a taxi?

234
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,700
Yes.

235
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,828
I drive a limousine.

236
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:04,456
My appointment just got canceled,
so I am available.

237
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,582
Where are you headed?

238
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,543
Geumga-dong, Seoul.

239
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:11,921
Really? Then, I promise to
give you a comfortable ride.

240
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,506
-I'm good.
-I'm good, too.

241
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,467
Please get in. All right.

242
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,346
Gosh, you're so handsome.

243
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,282
Did you enjoy your trip?

244
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,826
Where did you go?

245
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,703
I'd prefer not to talk.

246
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,538
Okay. I apologize.

247
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,670
Turn on the news instead.

248
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,214
Okay.

249
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,426
…was apprehended by the police.

250
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,887
In several fishing villages,
Korea Coast Guard…

251
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,098
I must finish everything in a month.

252
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,226
Then I'll leave for Malta right away.

253
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,605
There have been many reports of crimes
against foreigners at our airport.

254
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,942
According to the police, they pretend
to be taxi drivers at the airport,

255
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,444
offer drinks after spiking them
with sleeping pills,

256
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,948
-and steal their valuables. Especially…
-Gosh, these assholes.

257
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,077
How could they when Bong Joon-ho
and BTS worked so hard for our image?

258
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,246
Scumbags like them
are ruining our reputation.

259
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:27,956
Don't you agree?

260
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,667
Based on the victim's statement
about the stolen valuables,

261
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,920
-A month from now, I'll be…
-the police are investigating if there are

262
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,672
any accomplices.

263
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,258
…drinking a cold beer

264
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,261
on Xlendi Bay.

265
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,682
The in-flight meal must've been salty.

266
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,934
He chugged the whole bottle.

267
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,073
Mr. An.

268
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,160
They caught Agent Wang when he was tailing
them in Incheon and cut his arm off.

269
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,578
What? Where is he now?

270
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,620
Can they reattach it?

271
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,205
Damn it.

272
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,252
Ma'am, ten minutes ago, Masato of
the Kawaguchi Gang stabbed himself

273
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:17,547
with a bread knife at a bakery in Busan
when our agents surrounded him.

274
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,257
What? With a bread knife?

275
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,301
Gosh, that's really long.

276
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,636
-Call for a helicopter and move out.
-Okay.

277
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,098
So what? Do you have the details?

278
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,767
How the hell did he get here?

279
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,581
He's…

280
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,250
He's a consigliere to the mafia.

281
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,336
He's in Korea?

282
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,053
When he came to Korea five years ago,
he was just an ordinary lawyer.

283
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,681
But now, he's no longer a small fry.
He's the key member of the mafia.

284
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,893
He came back to Korea as a consigliere.

285
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,273
Hey, Mr. An.

286
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:21,986
Why would they come all the way to Korea?
To achieve what?

287
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,988
There's a lot here in Korea.

288
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,907
We're a global target now.

289
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,451
Then, perhaps,
he just came here on a holiday

290
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,829
to have bulgogi, dongdongju,
makgeolli, and pajeon.

291
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,205
We should welcome him.

292
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,083
Sir, this isn't something
you should take lightly.

293
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,627
-The consigliere is a mafia's--
-What about it?

294
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,880
What the heck is that supposed to be?

295
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,216
It's like you're trying to get scolded.

296
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,926
We have to track him, sir!

297
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,137
The Italian mafia are a heinous bunch.

298
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,806
Just let him be.

299
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,100
Don't you dare launch some operation.

300
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,852
-But he's the consigliere--
-Why you…

301
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,164
Ms. Hong, I heard
you scored a big one today.

302
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,916
Congratulations, Ms. Hong.

303
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,960
You are indeed my role model.

304
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,351
Yes, I did it again today

305
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,020
Go, Hong Cha-young

306
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,771
You're so cool, Cha-young

307
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,900
I am so cool

308
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,359
Yes, yes, yes

309
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:50,074
Hong Cha-young, Hong Cha,
Hong Cha, Hong Cha-young

310
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,870
I should install blinds here.

311
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,204
Everyone can see through.

312
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,960
Come on, you should've gone easy on him.
He's your dad.

313
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,173
He's not my dad.
He's the counsel for the plaintiff.

314
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,053
Your dad still goes by his nickname
the Tosa among the alumni.

315
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:13,181
That's why he always takes things too far,
not knowing when to stop.

316
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,433
I'll end this at the next hearing.

317
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:16,851
Yes. That's it.

318
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:21,773
A competent lawyer can end things
before things get out of hand.

319
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,738
I should've quashed this
when he filed the petition. I'm sorry.

320
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,781
It's okay.

321
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:35,536
You should get off work early today
and have some fun.

322
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,746
Oh, right.

323
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,540
Check your bank account.

324
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,210
It's a bonus.

325
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,298
You don't have to give me a bonus.

326
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,927
You are already treating me so well here.

327
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,138
Hold on.

328
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,392
Gosh, I'm so touched.

329
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,480
It's fine. Just take it
and spend it all today.

330
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,440
Gosh, Cha-young.

331
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,901
Cha-young, Cha-young, Hong Cha-young

332
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,903
I'm so moved. I'm serious.

333
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,534
Did he deduct taxes again?

334
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,120
Come on.

335
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,416
His meals must've been salty.

336
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,335
I didn't even ask him to drink it.
He just drank it on his own.

337
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,629
Hey, didn't I tell you?

338
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,590
When I saw him at the airport,
I knew he was loaded.

339
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,509
Gosh, this is a designer bag, too.

340
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,719
Wait. What's this?

341
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,640
This must be over 4,000 dollars.

342
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,146
-Holy shit.
-Hey.

343
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,439
Look at his watch.

344
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,443
If this is authentic,
it'll cost over 100 million won.

345
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,153
Hey. It can't be a knockoff, right?

346
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,074
-Gosh, no way.
-Right? Right.

347
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,200
Look at his style.

348
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,745
He'd never wear a fake watch.

349
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,038
-Hey.
-Look at this.

350
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,873
-He even smells good, too.
-Really?

351
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,958
Find his cologne, too.

352
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,170
You're up.

353
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,716
Who are you guys?

354
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,426
Us?

355
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,553
We are what you think we are.

356
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:18,681
Seriously?

357
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,683
Gosh, that sounded so cool.

358
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,394
-I told you you were talented.
-Drop the beat.

359
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,206
50,000 WON

360
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,772
I swear I'm going to catch
you assholes and kill you!

361
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,148
I swear to God I will!

362
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,865
Be quiet!

363
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,742
I told you to be quiet!

364
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,664
Damn it.

365
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,999
Shut up!

366
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,103
50,000 WON

367
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,212
Look over there.

368
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,299
He seems like a nice person
now that I get a closer look.

369
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,134
-He's so handsome.
-He is.

370
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,677
-He seems nice.
-Yes.

371
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,637
She only likes handsome guys.

372
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,472
-Seriously.
-Gosh.

373
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,685
Here.

374
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,979
Like this. Go ahead.

375
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,360
-It looks like he was beat up.
-Really?

376
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,906
-He's sure is handsome.
-That's all you care about.

377
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:07,808
GEUMGA PLAZA

378
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,856
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING
THE ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW

379
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,776
My goal is

380
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,947
tearing down this building.

381
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,366
What do you need advice with?

382
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,409
5 YEARS AGO, MILAN
CASSANO FAMILY'S STUDY

383
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,162
My friend, Fabio, told me

384
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:32,667
that you knew a safe way to hide my gold.

385
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,670
He said his old friend, Fabio, told him

386
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:39,924
that you would tell him
how to safely hide his gold.

387
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,761
I want to hide my gold in Korea,
not China.

388
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:50,017
And it must be kept safe to the point
that no one can steal it.

389
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,478
He wants to hide it in Korea.

390
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,815
And he wants it to be safe to the point
that no one can steal it.

391
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,947
There is this method our family uses
which has been passed down for 50 years.

392
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,866
Buy an old building in Korea.

393
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,035
Buy the building under my friend,

394
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,414
Mr. Cho's name
so you don't raise any suspicions.

395
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:16,168
And then, make one of the lots
look like either a shop or a company.

396
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,086
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

397
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,549
And hire technicians

398
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,510
to create a secret room in the basement
to store your gold.

399
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:33,269
To avoid getting caught,
transport the gold little by little.

400
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,648
To open the secret room,

401
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,485
the biometric system that recognizes
only you should be utilized.

402
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,906
It must only recognize you.
Not even your family or friends.

403
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,380
But there's more.

404
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,549
That secret room

405
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,761
comes with a special feature.

406
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,095
Sir.

407
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,223
-Mr. Cho, have you been well?
-Yes.

408
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,561
What on earth happened to you?

409
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,105
It's nothing.

410
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,526
What about my residence?

411
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,862
I heard you were coming,
so I had it cleaned.

412
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,531
And I also put away your items
and clothes from Italy.

413
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,784
-Let's get going now.
-Okay.

414
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,120
How are things going?

415
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,622
As you read it in the file,

416
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,124
the Development Opposition Committee
has been formed.

417
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,835
I already told them that
I wouldn't sell off the building.

418
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,212
But they won't believe me.

419
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,338
Oh, right.

420
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,549
Babel E&C bought
all the shops around the plaza.

421
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,303
Any other pressure from Babel E&C?

422
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,722
Nothing, other than the team leader
of Investment and Development

423
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,599
coming here daily to make an offer.

424
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,877
Sir.

425
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,385
The bathroom…

426
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,303
Damn it.

427
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,827
I already set up the bed
and blankets for you.

428
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,539
And I will schedule a meeting
with the tenants tomorrow.

429
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,959
Okay. Sure.

430
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,672
Once this project is done,

431
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,300
are you interested in staying in Korea?

432
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,430
No.

433
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,474
I see.

434
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:21,103
I put your new cell phone, cash,
and the things you asked for

435
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,688
in the bedroom.

436
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,356
Okay.

437
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,153
What's that?

438
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,449
Oh, the previous tenants put them up.

439
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,327
Should I get them off?

440
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,413
That's fine. I won't be here long.

441
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,919
Gosh, that's a lot.

442
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,463
-Really?
-Yes.

443
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,464
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM

444
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:53,093
I definitely saw a man with
the building owner at the entrance.

445
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,512
So I followed them.

446
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:59,099
But it looks like he even rented out
a housing unit upstairs from us.

447
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,392
-A housing unit?
-Yes.

448
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,354
When you saw him,
what's the vibe you got from him?

449
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,527
He kind of gave off an eerie vibe.

450
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,987
What was that movie called?

451
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,115
He looked like a handsome movie villain.

452
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,370
Did you know?

453
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:22,915
Handsome villains are
scarier and more brutal.

454
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,129
That must be why people
are scared of me. Goodness.

455
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,466
People aren't scared of you, Mr. Lee.

456
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,762
Should I go scare him
and get some information?

457
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,389
Like who he is and why he's here.

458
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,850
Mr. Nam, come closer. Come.

459
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:46,188
I'll grab his throat and twist it to
the side. Then, he'll start talking.

460
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,231
-Name?
-Nam Ju-sung.

461
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,399
-Where are you from?
-Wangsimni.

462
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,234
-Favorite food?
-Tteokbokki.

463
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,529
-Let go of his throat now.
-Okay.

464
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,488
Okay. You're good.

465
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,073
Tell the rest of the tenants.

466
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,116
-Hurry.
-Okay.

467
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,040
Most of the existing tenants moved out.

468
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,126
We have some tenants left
on the third floor.

469
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,460
Why is that?

470
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,422
The lawyer in the Opposition Committee
is on the third floor.

471
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,549
So that must have played a part in this.

472
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:53,547
The tenants in this building
are very cautious of me.

473
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,052
This is interesting.

474
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,554
DRY CLEANING

475
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,860
-Well…
-Gosh.

476
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,824
-It's an Italian restaurant.
-Yes.

477
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,710
Well, this is the usual routine.

478
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,842
This is a dancing studio.

479
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,055
What's wrong with him? Is he sick?

480
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,312
He's definitely sick.

481
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,856
Don't eat it, then.

482
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,650
Give me that.

483
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,111
You're basically telling me
my food is awful!

484
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,737
It's just fishy.

485
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,826
Your good looks can't save your ass.

486
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,912
I'm dirt-poor and have no connections!
That's everything I've got!

487
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,250
Stop it!

488
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,795
-I tap out.
-What are you looking at?

489
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,302
I like fishy food!

490
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,184
YEONGHO SNACK BAR

491
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,519
Save me!

492
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,980
-My goodness.
-You brat!

493
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,191
How could you only get 18 points
on your Korean test? Seriously?

494
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,276
Why you…

495
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,654
-I did my best.
-Are you a foreigner?

496
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,948
Are you not from here?
Are you from the States?

497
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,411
Get your guard up. Do it, you brat.

498
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,079
Keep your guard up, you punk.

499
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,713
Please save me. She's going to kill me.

500
00:45:57,796 --> 00:46:00,007
You don't deserve to be saved.

501
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,216
Mom, it really hurts.

502
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,677
-Mom.
-You're a disgrace to this town.

503
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,471
I didn't give birth to an idiot.

504
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,972
They must be insane.

505
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,807
-Yes. This is supposed to hurt!
-What?

506
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,727
-You punk.
-Mom, come on!

507
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,353
You brat.

508
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,898
JIPURAGI LAW FIRM

509
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,158
Well…

510
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,578
Let's go to the basement
where the secret room is.

511
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,498
The business that used to be there
went under,

512
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,708
so I picked a more stable tenant.

513
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:35,918
Are you sure about that?

514
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,378
They are well-mannered.

515
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,341
NANYAK TEMPLE

516
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:45,385
So, the tenants…

517
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,303
It's a temple.

518
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:51,934
NANYAK TEMPLE

519
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,152
That monk is sitting on

520
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,947
15 tons of gold.

521
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,903
You are the owner of the building.

522
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,448
-Yes. Hello, sir.
-Hello.

523
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,618
I have joined
the Development Opposition Committee.

524
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,580
I plan to protect our temple.

525
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,339
All right. He felt a strong presence
of Buddha from beneath the temple.

526
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,049
-He's been fasting.
-"From beneath"?

527
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,427
-No.
-What about it?

528
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,595
-He's fasting.
-Yes.

529
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,180
He's just fasting. He's not eating.

530
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,518
I don't know who you are,

531
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:20,647
but you should clean your outfit
before you clean out your mind.

532
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:33,827
Gosh.

533
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,254
I want to get these dry cleaned.

534
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:49,217
BEST LAUNDROMAT

535
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,807
This is a very rare suit
you can't find in Korea.

536
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,476
The material is different, too.

537
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,062
It's a vintage brand label.

538
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,316
No, you're not getting it.
It's custom tailored in Italy

539
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,234
-by Booralro--
-As in "Testicles"?

540
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:11,406
Stop lying. Everyone says their suit
is expensive when they come here.

541
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,910
I'm serious. This was a limited edition
of Booralro's fall line.

542
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:18,580
What nasty name is "Testicles"?

543
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,499
I can tell this is cheap.

544
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,170
I'm from unit 606.
I want them by tomorrow.

545
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,256
You should've come yesterday then.
I can't finish them by tomorrow.

546
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,240
I heard that you came
with the building owner.

547
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,617
-Yes.
-Nice to meet you.

548
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,286
I'm the CEO and the senior lawyer
of Jipuragi Law Firm

549
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,914
and the chairman of
the Development Opposition Committee.

550
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,999
I'm Lawyer Hong Yu-chan.

551
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,128
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

552
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,212
I see.

553
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,048
Nice to meet you.

554
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,801
I'm Lawyer Vincenzo Cassano.

555
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,261
-What?
-Is "Vin" his last name?

556
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,304
-Right.
-Is he Chinese?

557
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,764
-He might be.
-What did he say?

558
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,182
I don't know. What was that?

559
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,101
Just treat my name as an English name.

560
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,437
Vincenzo Cassano.

561
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,356
-It was Casanova. Casanova.
-That was English.

562
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,525
-Vincenzo Casanova?
-Right.

563
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,694
You must not be licensed
to practice law here.

564
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,071
No. I'm from Italy.

565
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,992
Mr. Baek, you've been to Italy.

566
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,618
-Yes, that's right.
-Right?

567
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,872
He studied to be a chef in Milan, Italy.

568
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:46,001
Then, you two must have
a lot to talk about.

569
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:50,005
We'll talk when an occasion
organically arises. We'll talk then.

570
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,631
Where in Milan did you stay?

571
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:55,135
Well, I was in Milan, Italy.

572
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,638
I stayed in the heart of Milan.

573
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,765
Uffizi?

574
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:01,850
Uffizi.

575
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:07,856
Nice to meet you.

576
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,065
I'll stop by later.

577
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:12,903
Okay.

578
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,698
I guess he understood it. What did he say?

579
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,785
If you're licensed in Italy,

580
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,788
you can't practice law here
other than give advice.

581
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:26,082
That's correct. I'm not here
to practice law here, anyway.

582
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,044
-I simply came to offer some advice.
-Is that so?

583
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,297
The owner told us
he wouldn't sell the building.

584
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,633
But we don't trust him.

585
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,760
We're different, Mr. Hong.

586
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,012
Don't say stuff like that.

587
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,473
Who would turn down a big payout
from a conglomerate?

588
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:46,686
We will tell you the details
at the meeting tomorrow afternoon.

589
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,029
Vincenzo Cassano.

590
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,422
What's wrong with the water?

591
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,344
Damn it.

592
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:33,275
Damn it.

593
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,944
There's no hot water?

594
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:39,114
Damn it.

595
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,368
There it is.

596
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,122
It's hot!

597
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,089
Are you kidding me?

598
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,890
What's wrong with the hot water?

599
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,267
Look at me.

600
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,354
It's so hot.

601
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,649
So hot!

602
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,612
Hot!

603
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,066
Come on.

604
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,675
Gosh.

605
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,873
REQUEST TO TRANSFER PRISONER
TO HANJU PRISON FOR WOMEN

606
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,924
Defense, make your argument.

607
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:04,968
The defense rests.

608
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,638
Prosecution, question the defendant.

609
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,141
Defendant Oh Gyeong-ja

610
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,309
was often criticized
by Chairman Hwang Deok-bae

611
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:17,439
and his family for her improper behaviors
as a housekeeper.

612
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:21,443
On the day of the incident, when
he said she didn't do her job properly,

613
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,154
she was livid and assaulted him
which led to his death.

614
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,114
The defense rests.

615
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,658
Your Honor,

616
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,454
Defendant Oh Gyeong-ja
had abandoned her own child in the past.

617
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,832
I'm submitting her affidavit
of voluntary relinquishment

618
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,959
of parental rights
to an orphanage in Incheon.

619
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,638
As she is a coldblooded mother
who even abandoned her own child,

620
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,600
it's highly likely that she does not value
other people's lives.

621
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,685
This proves the validity--

622
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,228
That's irrelevant to this case.

623
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,774
You're my lawyer. Say something.

624
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,234
I was sexually harassed.

625
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,737
His whole family is lying!

626
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,198
Don't say anything.
This will work against you.

627
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:14,954
Chairman Hwang sexually harassed
his previous housekeepers.

628
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,332
He harassed every woman
that came to work for him.

629
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:18,291
Defendant.

630
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,502
If you speak without permission again,

631
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,504
you will be escorted out.

632
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,927
Suit yourselves.

633
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:33,098
You've already made your ruling.

634
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,690
HONG YU-CHAN OF JIPURAGI LAW FIRM
APPOINTED AS THE NEW LAWYER

635
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,192
RETRIAL REFUSED BY THE INMATE

636
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:57,956
LAWYER HONG YU-CHAN

637
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,582
…APPOINTED AS THE NEW LAWYER

638
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,808
The statement given by the test subject
who blew the whistle

639
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,935
on the risks
of Babel Pharm's clinical trials,

640
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,938
turned out to be false
which deeply impacted the lawsuit.

641
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:24,816
Lee had been a participant
in the clinical trial for RDU-90,

642
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:27,861
a new drug developed
by Babel Pharmaceuticals.

643
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,113
-Hey, look at that lady.
-He planned to extort…

644
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,157
-money from the company.
-Is she mad?

645
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,534
-His intention
-Does she think she's Jun Ji-hyun?

646
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,952
was exposed at the hearing.

647
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,954
Goodness, look at her swinging her hip.

648
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:41,082
-Their new drug, RDU-90, shows…
-Does she not have a washing machine?

649
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,876
Why is she dancing here?

650
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,588
This is a therapeutic place for me.
So what?

651
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:49,007
…the market is expected to face some heat.

652
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,176
I heard everything, you punks.

653
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:56,639
How dare you sexually harass a woman
in a public place?

654
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,934
Do you want the Ministry of Justice
to lock you up? You rascals.

655
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,854
Give me that.

656
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,939
Give me your phone now.

657
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,737
My gosh. Look at this. What…

658
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,363
I should smack you.

659
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,908
Should I send you to prison for this?

660
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:19,412
What's wrong
with a little dancing, you punks?

661
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,372
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

662
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:23,875
You stay here.

663
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:27,962
Sit down.

664
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:31,090
I'm not done with you yet.
I have one more bag of blankets to wash.

665
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,308
TI DIAMO IL

666
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:45,522
You're my sun
How beautiful you are

667
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,148
You are beautiful.

668
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,566
You're so handsome.

669
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,361
I love

670
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,120
Welcome.

671
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,748
What's your best dish?

672
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,834
Well, that would be my porcini dish.

673
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,963
It's truffle porcini spaghetti.

674
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,883
Everything on your menu sounds delicious.

675
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,637
I'll have that.

676
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,305
What?

677
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:20,723
Yes.

678
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:04,934
It tastes like you took this out
from a trash can.

679
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,271
But I'm glad…

680
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,357
that you removed the maggots.

681
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,655
So you studied in Uffizi, Milan?

682
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,617
Yes, in Uffizi.

683
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,286
I see.

684
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,583
But Uffizi is in Florence, not Milan.

685
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,501
What?

686
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,504
I…

687
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,594
A con artist.

688
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,685
-He learned to cook at Uffizi Gallery?
-Excuse me.

689
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,770
I…

690
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,357
Come again.

691
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:57,403
HANJU PRISON FOR WOMEN

692
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:08,706
You're out.

693
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,197
The look on your face tells me
you're losing again.

694
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:46,119
Did you become a psychic?
How can you tell?

695
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:50,665
It's been five years
since I first met you.

696
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,584
I can tell just by looking at you.

697
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,255
Has it been that long?

698
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,217
You're being treated, right?

699
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:02,969
Thanks to you.

700
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,974
To be less of a burden to you,
I should die soon.

701
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:11,769
Gosh. Come on. Don't say stuff like that.

702
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,438
Hearing that drains my energy.

703
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:21,195
You don't have to visit me
every month now.

704
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,073
People might think
that you're my secret husband.

705
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,575
You can tell them that I am.

706
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:29,287
It will be nice for Cha-young
to have a mom.

707
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,164
Gosh. Goodness.

708
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:38,671
Anyway, Ms. Oh,

709
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,383
-for one last time--
-Don't even bring up the retrial.

710
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,470
I really don't need it.

711
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:50,141
Just leave me be.

712
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:57,064
I've done a lot of bad things in life.

713
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,120
Did you have a nice trip?

714
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:12,872
Yes.

715
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:16,125
The team leader from Babel's Investment
and Development is on his way.

716
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,460
I'll go and meet him.

717
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:18,753
Where should we meet?

718
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,547
There's a cafe across the street.

719
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,882
How about my office?

720
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,011
It concerns our plaza.

721
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,555
Wouldn't it be better to do it
in my office?

722
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,396
How many times must I repeat myself?

723
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,566
My client will demolish the building
and build a new one.

724
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,444
And the previous tenants
will have their lots back.

725
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,865
All right.

726
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:51,160
This is our last offer.

727
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,996
It's a much better offer
from two days ago.

728
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:56,874
It's the best we can do.

729
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,187
Do you not understand me?

730
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:19,730
I hear you just fine.

731
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,399
You know what?

732
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,193
I wanted to wrap things up nicely.

733
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,030
If you keep this up, things will get ugly.

734
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,535
I'm here on behalf of Babel E&C.

735
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:36,747
If you keep rejecting our offer,
you'll regret it later.

736
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:42,211
-Are you threatening me?
-Just a little?

737
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,214
Don't ever threaten me again.

738
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:49,969
It's my first and last advice to you.

739
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,637
What?

740
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,848
-No one is here yet?
-No.

741
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,725
Did you eat?

742
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,268
-Hey.
-Gosh.

743
01:04:57,935 --> 01:05:00,354
-Hey, do you have more? What is it?
-Gosh, what?

744
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,940
Mr. Tak, take off your shoes
when you come in.

745
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,483
Sorry about that. Are you upset?

746
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,360
-You always forget that.
-Sorry.

747
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:10,990
Mr. Lee, do you have
a wet rag attached to your feet?

748
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,702
Either wash your feet
or put on some socks.

749
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:15,703
Sorry.

750
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:18,873
My sweat glands are clustered
on the bottoms of my feet.

751
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,708
-It's an illness.
-Come on.

752
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:26,672
Everyone, please don't touch the glass
when you open the door.

753
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,842
Do you know how hard it is to wipe this?
There's a handle here.

754
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,349
Gosh, my mirror.

755
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:38,809
Sorry.

756
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:42,188
I closed the curtains for a reason.

757
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,942
All right. So is everyone here?

758
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:58,162
As tenants, we want your promise.

759
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:03,042
That's why we plan to draw up
an agreement by tomorrow.

760
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,586
And you can sign it
by the end of this week.

761
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,798
I know what you said yesterday,
but are you really a lawyer in Italy?

762
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,217
Yes.

763
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,053
Then how will you handle it
when you don't know our law?

764
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,806
I don't think
my legal qualification matters here.

765
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,808
Our promise to you and your signatures do.

766
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:22,395
I will guarantee that you will have
your lots back once I rebuild this place.

767
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,562
You promise, right?

768
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,900
We never lie.

769
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,360
What do you think?

770
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:34,573
Well, they seem very genuine.
Why don't we trust them?

771
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:39,912
I'm also going to trust you,
Mr. Vincenzo Casanova.

772
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,748
Yes. Me, too, Mr. Casanova.

773
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,670
Let me inform you in advance.

774
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,467
I know martial arts.

775
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,721
If you are deceiving us,

776
01:06:56,804 --> 01:07:00,850
I'm going to put you in a guillotine choke
for six days straight.

777
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:05,146
Don't do stuff like that. No one cares.
You're embarrassing and so tacky.

778
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:06,647
Let's sum it up.

779
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,025
Who agrees to trust them?

780
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:16,115
My gosh. That annoying Vincenzo.
This doesn't feel right.

781
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:18,743
We have no choice.

782
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,120
Right. Damn it.

783
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:24,206
This is driving me crazy. Darn it.

784
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:27,043
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt
and go with the flow.

785
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,052
Merciful Buddha.

786
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:48,773
Mr. Hong.

787
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,776
The tenants have nothing
but your word to go on.

788
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,737
But I find this unfortunate

789
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,448
because it looks like
you're toying with us.

790
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:02,161
Is it that hard for you to trust me?

791
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:07,416
I pretended to trust you earlier
to assure the other tenants,

792
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:12,797
but I never trust people like you.

793
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,472
I am a lawyer,

794
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:23,682
and so are you.

795
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,852
But we clearly have different jobs.

796
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:29,480
You represent money,

797
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:31,273
but I represent people.

798
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:38,030
I also represent people.

799
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,365
Oh, yes.

800
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,450
Rich people.

801
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,206
I know Babel E&C will buy this building
so I prepared myself for everything.

802
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,542
So don't pretend
to be a mediator in front of me.

803
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,460
Just proceed with your plan.

804
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:17,403
Where's everyone?

805
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:19,989
Honey.

806
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:21,740
Ju-yeong.

807
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,450
My goodness!

808
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,202
Honey!

809
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,287
Ju-yeong!

810
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:29,707
-Who are you people?
-We don't have time to chitchat.

811
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,545
Ju-yeong.

01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:44,763

-You…

814
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,224
Stamp your seal on it.

815
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:50,436
I have a show to catch on TV.

816
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:08,579

My goodness. Jeez.

824
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,697
I'm good.

825
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:46,825
What do you mean?

826
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,038
I'm not interested.

827
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:56,585
I'm so sick of him.

Don't you think I'd be a better actor?

830
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:11,517
Of course, sir.

831
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,811
-Gosh, that's a no-brainer.
-Come over here.

832
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:19,233
Yes.

833
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,277
Okay. I got it.

834
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,156
Check your bank account. It's over.

835
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,450
Hey, let's go.

836
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,576
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

837
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,869
Gosh, let's go.

838
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,505
It says that by nature of clinical trials…

839
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:42,840
Hello, Ms. Hong.

840
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:47,553
Who are you to barge into my office?
That's some nasty manner you have.

841
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,805
What's this?

842
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:51,265
Oh, that?

843
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,518
I mailed that to remove you
from my family registry.

844
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,105
You can't do that anymore.

845
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,691
The family registration system
was abolished ages ago.

846
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:01,817
You're a lawyer.

847
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,695
I can still try, can't I?

848
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:06,196
-Hey.
-Yes.

849
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,281
This one, too.

850
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:10,659
And look at this. This is ridiculous.

851
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:13,370
"The petitioner rejects
the following words

852
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,665
and any similar words from the recipient.
The following words are,

853
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,918
appa, abuji, papa, daddy,
otosang, bàba, and père."

854
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,588
This is just outright ridiculous.

855
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,549
It's so immature.

856
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:29,928
-Mr. Nam.
-Yes?

857
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,638
I'm talking here.

858
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,265
Go ahead.

Damn it. How is this even possible?

861
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:43,025
Damn you. Get out of my sight!

862
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,073
What happened to my suit?

863
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:51,742
It's because your suit
was made from cheap fabric.

864
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:54,411
-It doesn't happen to good fabric.
-Cheap?

865
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,372
-Do you know how much this is?
-How much?

866
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,749
This is a limited edition
from Booralro's line…

867
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,795
There's no point in talking to him.

868
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,758
By the way, you have a nice build.

869
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:10,636
You know? You still look cool
with that tight suit.

870
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,970
This might catch on.

871
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,681
Did you do this on purpose?

872
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:17,893
What are you talking about?
I'm the laundry master.

873
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,812
Then you shouldn't have messed up!

874
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,276
You will have to pay

875
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,279
for what you did to my suit.

876
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:30,614
You will.

877
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:39,706
Tenants of Geumga Plaza,
come out of the building now.

878
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,959
Someone's looking for me.
Pay before you go.

879
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:52,886
Yes, Mr. Cho.

880
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:56,098
My wife and daughter were
taken hostage. I had no choice.

881
01:13:57,474 --> 01:13:58,517
I'm sorry.

882
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:01,687
I'll fix this no matter what.

883
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:03,605
Yes. I will…

884
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:10,070
Mr. Cho.

885
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,658
Mr. Cho. Mr. Cho? Mr. Cho!

886
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:18,954
Fine. I can overlook everything
you wrote here. I can live with that.

887
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,206
But this one. Look.

888
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:25,669
"All the photos that the recipient
took with the petitioner as a minor and

889
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:28,672
photos that remind the recipient
of the petitioner as the parent

890
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:31,842
will be donated for the exhibition,
Geumga-dong's History,

891
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,553
held at the Sangcheon District Office
for public interest."

892
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:37,347
Who are you to donate my photos?

893
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:39,808
They're the epitome
of my embarrassing past!

894
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,101
It's up to me.

895
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,769
I raised you.

896
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:46,273
And does that give you the right
to abandon me? This is embarrassing!

897
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:47,566
"Embarrassing"?

898
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,402
It's because what you do
is less than human!

899
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:56,033
You're a lawyer. How could you not
have a sense of duty or justice?

900
01:14:56,116 --> 01:15:00,078
Your sense of duty just makes you
the nosiest lawyer in the world!

901
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:04,249
And your sense of justice is just
groundless hostility against the rich!

902
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,710
This is called mechanical justice!

903
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:07,878
"Mechanical justice"?

904
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:09,963
Then is following money
"rational justice"?

905
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:13,091
Yes. Money is justice in Korea.

906
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,468
And power means justice.

907
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,303
Then, keep living your life like that!

908
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:19,473
But do not show your face around me. Okay?

909
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:22,309
Okay. Let's cut off all ties!

910
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:23,894
-Yes. Let's do that.
-Don't.

911
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:25,604
Let's never call each other.

912
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,523
-I won't.
-Don't you dare call me!

913
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:28,649
-I won't.
-Mr. Hong!

914
01:15:28,732 --> 01:15:29,691
Never call me!

915
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:30,901
Mr. Hong.

916
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,697
You have to come outside now.

917
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,451
GEUMGA PLAZA

918
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:43,664
Hello.

919
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:47,501
My gosh. You're a bunch of lazy bums.

920
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:50,212
Why haven't you put up the signs?

921
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:52,172
Do it now.

922
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,341
Aren't you cold?

923
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:56,635
Let's go.

924
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:57,970
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

925
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,267
NOTICE

926
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,893
SELLER: CHO YEONG-UN,
BUYER: BABEL E&C

927
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,228
-What happened?
-What?

928
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,980
-But he promised.
-What happened?

929
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,273
What do we do, then?

930
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:10,857
-Put it up. Just do it.
-Okay.

931
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:12,276
Cover up the sign.

932
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,195
Hello, sir.

933
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:21,702
Nice to meet you.

934
01:16:21,785 --> 01:16:23,370
I'm Park Seok-do, the CEO of Ant Company

935
01:16:23,453 --> 01:16:26,873
and the chairman of the Development
Committee for Babel Tower.

936
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:31,545
What kind of company is that?

937
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:33,714
It's a shady company
that performs dirty jobs

938
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:36,300
like high interest loans
and beating people up.

939
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:37,342
I see.

940
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:41,096
Oh, right. As of today,
this building belongs to Babel E&C.

941
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:44,516
Starting today,
the Compensation Team will visit you.

942
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,102
Let's handle this peacefully.

943
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:49,313
I knew it. Damn it.

944
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:52,024
This was their plan. But what?
They'll let us move back in?

945
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:55,444
That lousy Vincenzo or whatever.
I should've shrunk his suit even more.

946
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:56,778
-Where is he?
-Right.

947
01:16:56,862 --> 01:17:00,365
If any of the tenants give us a hard time,

948
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:05,746
one of these uncompromising men
will tire you out physically and mentally.

949
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:06,788
Hey.

950
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,915
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

951
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,500
-Why?
-Who are you?

952
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:17,257
-You can't do this.
-Why not?

953
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:21,928
-Are you okay?
-You startled me.

954
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:22,929
I thought I hit you.

955
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:29,895
You can't block the path to the restroom.

956
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:34,066
-What about the people who need to go?
-You got me excited for a second.

957
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:35,901
Goodness.

958
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:38,528
-Guys, step aside. Gosh. It's urgent.
-Okay.

959
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:40,989
I don't want him to do his business here.
Hurry.

960
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:43,450
-Go. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

961
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:48,080
My goodness, that idiot.
He's so embarrassing.

962
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,373
Leave now.

963
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:53,043
You're violating the law
by threatening us like this.

964
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:56,505
Why don't you stop already?
We will compensate you handsomely.

965
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:58,215
You say you'll compensate us,

966
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:00,425
but you'll just beat us up
and kick us out.

967
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:04,054
This is a good occasion.
Why are you ruining the mood?

968
01:18:04,137 --> 01:18:05,430
-Gosh.
-Hey.

969
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:08,767
Who are you?

970
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,311
I'm his only daughter.

971
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:14,106
And I'm Lawyer Hong Cha-young
of Law Firm Wusang.

972
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,734
-You're not my daughter.
-Come on. Be quiet.

973
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:23,532
-What is a lawyer from Wusang doing here?
-It's none of your business.

974
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,285
This isn't the way
to go about your business.

975
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,913
Don't you know the era we live in?

976
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:32,249
It's not like we're in
some '90s gangster movie!

977
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:33,500
Hey, miss.

978
01:18:33,583 --> 01:18:37,170
Do you want to get beaten up
like the movies from the '90s?

979
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:40,298
-My goodness.
-Hey!

980
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:48,932
If you touch me again,

981
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,810
I'll make you pay for what you did!

982
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:55,188
Sure. Okay. Let's see how much money
I have to pay to settle with you!

983
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:57,399
Stop!

984
01:19:25,218 --> 01:19:26,386
What did he say?

985
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,932
Where's my tape measure?

986
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,315
Do you also need to use the bathroom?

987
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:40,400
Is it urgent?

988
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,027
Go ahead. Go on.

989
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,820
-Go.
-Let's talk.

990
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:45,697
Who the heck are you?

991
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,116
Vincenzo Cassano.

992
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:52,412
I represent the owner of Geumga Plaza,
Cho Yeong-un.

993
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,331
"Vinchenzo Quassano"?

994
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:55,707
This is ridiculous.

995
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:58,335
There's no talking your way out of this.

996
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:05,300
Hey, hold on.

997
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,096
Goodness.

998
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,850
I'm not that curious, but I'll listen.

999
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,149
So what is it?

1000
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:27,781
-Sir!
-Sir!

1001
01:20:31,451 --> 01:20:33,787
-My nose is bleeding!
-A nosebleed?

1002
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:36,498
Gosh. Come on. Seriously.

1003
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:38,542
You jerk.

1004
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:45,340
-Oh, no!
-Boss!

1005
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:47,259
If you take one more step…

1006
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,265
-your boss will fall.
-Don't move, you dimwits.

1007
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:54,641
Just stay still.

1008
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:56,601
Everyone, stay still.

1009
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:04,109
Given the height of the building,
you won't die.

1010
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,694
You'll just break your leg.

1011
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,408
But if you're unlucky and fall head-first,

1012
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:16,580
I will be the last person
you see from this world.

1013
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:17,664
Right?

1014
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:20,333
Shouldn't we stop him?

1015
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:22,919
He said he won't die. Leave him.

1016
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:26,172
Pull me up now, you asshole. Pull me up!

1017
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:32,012
Babel E&C bought this building
through illegal means.

1018
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:36,975
And I will not forgive their atrocity.

1019
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:39,394
Unless you want to die, pull me up.

1020
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:40,729
Now!

1021
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:44,733
I'll get this building back
no matter what.

1022
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:48,612
And I will make all of you
pay for what you did.

1023
01:21:51,281 --> 01:21:54,993
This building belongs to me.

1024
01:21:56,119 --> 01:21:58,121
That was Italian, right? What did he say?

1025
01:21:58,204 --> 01:21:59,581
-What?
-What did he say?

1026
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:00,916
He said…

1027
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:25,273
SPECIAL THANKS TO JIN SUN-KYU,
LEE HEE-JUN, JEONG SOON-WON

1028
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:53,134
I don't expect you to believe me.

1029
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,052
"Threatened"?

1030
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,595
Are you still pulling that stunt of yours?

1031
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,307
I will blow both you and the tenants away
with this stunt.

1032
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:01,643
My experience tells me
that there's more to this.

1033
01:23:01,726 --> 01:23:04,270
A reason enough to make them act this way.

1034
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,815
He could have secretly stashed
a fortune in Korea.

1035
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:09,859
Aren't we the best in the country
when it comes to playing dirty?

1036
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:12,737
I don't like things dragging on,
so cut it short.

1037
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,365
-Assholes like them should be made to pay.
-"Assholes"?

1038
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:17,283
Cha-young! Tomorrow at 11 p.m.

1039
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:20,495
Legal or not, we'll get the job done.

1040
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:22,497
We have to stop them no matter what.

1041
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:24,040
Hey!

1042
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:26,167
I thought I'd do the same as you did.

1043
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:28,169
