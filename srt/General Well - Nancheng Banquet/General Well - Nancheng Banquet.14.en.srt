Ms. Fu Xiao, are you going to see His Majesty?

No, I'm going to visit the Thousand Feather Guards.

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,700
His Majesty has married a commoner woman named Fu Xiao.

54
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
That's right. She used to be my buddy, for real.

55
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Isn't he a man?

56
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

Of course, she's not a man.

Her status has soared.

59
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,200
No wonder Xiao Qiangzi was favored by His Majesty upon entering the palace.

60
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,400
In just a few months, she became the Military Governor

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,000
and subdued the Commander Yan Changyun.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,400
And then she suddenly became pregnant with His Majesty's child.

63
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,000
It's very likely she'll move into the harem and become a powerful concubine.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,400

I cherished our friendship dearly, but you…

125
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
I swear I have no feelings toward His Majesty.

I am not angry with you because you're carrying His Majesty's child.

I will never lie to you again, I promise.

130

If I keep going like this, when my belly won't grow, it will be exposed sooner or later.

I'm going to die right now.

175
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,200
I have a foolproof plan. It all depends on whether you can take it.

176
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm even willing to die. What else can't I accept?

177
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,800
- Just say it.
- All right.

178
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,900
You follow me back to my room. Let's turn the act into reality.

179
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,200
I am definitely capable of making you conceive an imperial heir. Let's go.

180
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,400
You might as well just kill me!

181
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,100
Your Majesty!

182
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,700
Can I ask a question?

183
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,200
Do you think I'm a treacherous official?

184
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,600
Why would you say such a thing?

185
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,800
Commander Yan has always seen me as a villain, making things difficult for me.

186
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,200
Now my residence is surrounded so tightly, with inspections day and night.

187
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,200
This has caused my family to live in fear, unable to find peace.

188
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,400
If you think I am a treacherous official,

189
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,200
please grant me a quick verdict.

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,800
Commander Yan.

191
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,500
Your Majesty, please understand.

192
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,100
We carry out the investigation by your orders with no ulterior motives.

193
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,600
Instead, inside the prison under Lord Xiao's charge,

194
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
many innocent people were imprisoned.

195
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,500
Commander Yan,

196
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,000
you're referring to the official courtesan, Chu Yue, whom you take care of. Right?

197
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,800
I have long heard that your lover

198
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,100
is the leading courtesan of the capital, unparalleled in charm and talent.

199
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,600
How did she end up in the prison of the Ministry of Justice?

200
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,400
Replying to Your Majesty.

201
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,200
Chu Yue has an inseparable connection with the remnants of the Guanyou incident.

202
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Her father was Lei Bao, the deputy general on the run for years

203
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,400
to Duke Ding, Qin Wenzhong.

204
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,600
Your Majesty, 15 years ago, Chu Yue was implicated due to the Guanyou Incident.

205
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,500
She was demoted to an official courtesan to atone for it.

206
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,100
All of these records can be found at the Yunshao Bureau.

207
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,600
I don't know why Lord Xiao is suddenly making an issue out of it,

208
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,900
framing Chu Yue and targeting me.

209
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,700
If you have nothing to hide,

210
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,800
why go to such lengths over an official courtesan?

211
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,440
Enough.

212
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,600
You two, one in civil affairs and one in military,

213
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,800
are my right-hand men.

214
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,400
I place equal trust in you both.

215
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,260
Lord Yan.

216
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,000
As Minister Xiao followed the traces to Chu Yue,

217
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,700
there must be reasons for it.

218
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,200
I believe he is certainly not targeting you.

219
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,800
Lord Xiao, it's understandable that Commander Yan protects the Xiao Mansion.

220
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,200
Isn't it to find the murderer at the earliest?

221
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,300
Just bear with it.

222
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,600
This morning at the court meeting, I will talk about something joyful.

223
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,800
You have all heard of my happy occasion, haven't you?

224
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,200
The imperial lineage will continue.

225
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,600
I want to give Fu Xiao a rank.

226
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,300
I have decided to confer her the title of Concubine.

227
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,000
Hurry with the preparations.

228
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,800
Your Majesty, this matter is really difficult to handle.

229
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,000
This strange news about a eunuch's pregnancy

230
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
has already caused an uproar throughout the city.

231
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,400
It has even become the talk of the streets.

232
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,600
This is very bad for our image.

233
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,500
Yes, Your Majesty, commoners are fine,

234
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,700
but if word of this spreads to foreign countries,

235
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,600
I am afraid the kingdom's reputation…

236
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,039
Lord Xiao, what do you think?

237
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,400
Your Majesty, while conferment is a significant matter,

238
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,800
after all, this is still your family affair.

239
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,600
Since the young lady is already carrying your child,

240
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,800
I won't say more.

241
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,900
Absolutely not.

242
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,400
<i>- Greetings to the Grand Empress Dowager.
- Greetings to the Grand Empress Dowager.</i>

243
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,000
Please rise.

244
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,300
<i>- Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager.
- Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager.</i>

245
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,800
Your Majesty, if you confer her the title of Concubine,

246
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,000
this is simply an insult to the dignity of the imperial family.

247
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,800
How will you face our ancestors?

248
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,600
Grandmother, didn't you tell me to take care of her and the unborn child?

249
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,200
Yes, all I want is the baby in her womb.

250
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,600
As for her, after she gives birth to a prince,

251
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,400
I have my own plans.

252
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,300
- Grandmother, you—
- Say no more!

253
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,600
There is no room for discussion on this matter.

254
00:19:14,368 --> 00:19:17,880
<i>Who would have thought after so many years, finally a prince would be born?</i>

255
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,440
<i>I have always said there is nothing wrong with His Majesty.</i>

256
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,760
<i>It's too unexpected.</i>

257
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,839
<i>- Pregnant?
- Yes.</i>

258
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,440
<i>So envious.</i>

259
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,839
<i>Truly envious.</i>

260
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:37,519
Pregnancy really is wonderful.

261
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,039
<i>Yes!</i>

262
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,300
Your Majesty, I thought everyone would be unhappy

263
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
about my pregnancy.

264
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,300
Why would they be?

265
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,940
Before this, His Majesty always avoided me,

266
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,000
I thought…

267
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,640
But now, it's good.

268
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,079
Now, everyone has hope.

269
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,759
<i>- Yeah.
- Right. We all have hope now.</i>

270
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:05,920
Fu Xiao, you must take good care of the baby.

271
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,904
It is now the hope of our entire kingdom.

272
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:12,399
- You hear that?
- Yes.

273
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,088
What's wrong?

274
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,880
The baby suddenly kicked me.

275
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,220
Hasn't it just been a few months?

276
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,459
Because it's the heir of His Majesty.

277
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,140
Your Majesty, I would like to lie down and rest for a while.

278
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,584
- Go.
- Yes.

279
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:40,640
<i>- Be careful.
- Slow down.</i>

280
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,948
- Come on.
- Help her.

281
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:44,159
<i>- Come on.
- Take care.</i>

282
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,960
<i>- Be careful.
- Is she okay?</i>

283
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,628
Fu Xiao!

284
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,759
Greetings, Your Majesty.

285
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,200
You are pregnant. Don't run around.

286
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,019
Your Majesty, did you see Yan Changyun?

287
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,200
Yes, I did see him just now.

288
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,839
Commander Yan has not been in a good mood recently.

289
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:25,299
Really? Why?

290
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:28,499
His lover, Miss Chu Yue, has encountered a problem.

291
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:31,120
Chu Yue? What happened to her?

292
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,480
Minister Xiao claims she is a remnant of the Guanyou rebels.

293
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,200
He suspects she is involved with the assassin who tried to kill Chancellor Xiao.

294
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,100
And they arrested her directly.

295
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,920
Commander Yan was furious upon hearing it.

296
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,980
You know about their relationship.

297
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,560
Last time he didn't save you,

298
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,200
because he went to save her instead.

299
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:53,219
He didn't come to save me last time because he went to save her?

300
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,739
That's one way to put it.

301
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,027
<i>Did I say something wrong?</i>

302
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:12,032
<i>[Commander's Mansion]</i>

303
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,000
- Uncle Lei.
- Young Master.

304
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,060
- Take the medicine.
- Okay.

305
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,939
I hear that little eunuch is a woman in disguise

306
00:22:55,939 --> 00:23:00,099
and that she's carrying that dog emperor's child.

307
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,430
She is not pregnant.

308
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,860
Are you sure?

309
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,880
Young Master, you must not forget

310
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,419
before her amnesia, she already knew your true identity.

311
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:16,860
Now she has become that dog emperor's woman.

312
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,019
Once she regains her memory,

313
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,220
our years of planning will all be for naught.

314
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,440
We need the jade ring.

315
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,960
For now, we can only wait for her to regain her memory before making any plans.

316
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,120
No, it's too risky.

317
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,720
She is a trouble that cannot stay.

318
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,870
In my life, I have been dutiful and loyal

319
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,720
to your father and to you.

320
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,550
The only person I feel sorry for

321
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,480
is Chu Yue.

322
00:23:54,039 --> 00:24:00,040
I know she really wants to marry you.

323
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,240
Uncle Lei, I don't want to think about it right now.

324
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,520
Especially with my current identity.

325
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,900
No matter who I marry, it will only bring danger to them.

326
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,960
I don't want to cause harm to anyone because of me anymore.

327
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,620
Just like that little girl back then.

328
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:35,080
<i>Harboring court rebels secretly is a capital offense.</i>

329
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,599
<i>[Wanshi Pavilion]</i>
I suspect that person that year didn't die.

330
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,879
So many years have passed since the Guanyou Incident.

331
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:01,559
The only ones left in the capital are the remnants of the army.

332
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,119
They couldn't possibly have killed my father.

333
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:07,170
Qin Yan?

334
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,070
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

335
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:15,039
Are you so sure that Qin Yan died that year?

336
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,580
Of course, I personally ended his life.

337
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,220
<i>Kill him!</i>

338
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:58,600
Maybe he was lucky and didn't die after falling off the cliff.

339
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,319
If he didn't die, his attempt to kill my father for the Guanyou Incident

340
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,200
shows he doesn't know too much of the truth.

341
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,019
We can kill him once again.

342
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:11,008
Once again?

343
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,619
Xiao Quan, will you be that lucky again?

344
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,500
Sir,

345
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,510
my victories never rely on luck.

346
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:25,859
And I believe in you, Prince of the Ning Kingdom.

347
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:29,559
You don't want to leave your destiny to fate, do you?

348
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,359
As long as we join forces again,

349
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,279
we will be invincible like we were back then.

350
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,730
You reclaim the throne of the Ning Kingdom

351
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,730
and I will rule the Southern Kingdom.

352
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,119
You want me me to ask for a title on her behalf?

353
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:01,440
Heng'er, she's carrying His Majesty's child, and it's an insult to you.

354
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,839
Why would you seek a title for her?

355
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,979
Brother, I don't care who is carrying His Majesty's child.

356
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:12,099
As long as His Majesty has an heir, as his wife, I will be happy for him.

357
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:15,980
Right now, I'm most concerned about Fu Xiao's safety.

358
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,380
After she gives birth to the child,

359
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,359
the Grand Empress Dowager will definitely not let her off.

360
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,240
Silly girl, let me tell you this.

361
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,719
She's not a good person. Why do you want to help her?

362
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:33,180
Think about it. Even if the two of us help her get a title,

363
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,039
how will you live your days in the palace in the future?

364
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,519
Brother, I know you mean well.

365
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,079
But she's now pregnant with His Majesty's child and can't become his concubine.

366
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:45,160
His Majesty is restless and deeply troubled because of this. I feel bad for His Majesty.

367
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,860
His Majesty. All you talk about is His Majesty.

368
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,540
When has he ever considered your feelings?

369
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,799
I just want to make His Majesty happy.

370
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,000
Brother, please.

371
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,659
Go and ask the Grand Empress Dowager for mercy and help fulfill His Majesty's wish. Okay?

372
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,039
All right. After all, you're my precious little sister.

373
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,956
I promise you.

374
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,476
Thank you, Brother.

375
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,720
Okay then, I'll go back.

376
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,330
His Majesty can't have children.

377
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,650
That woman must not stay.

378
00:28:37,747 --> 00:28:39,936
<i>[Phoenix Rite Palace]</i>

379
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:54,460
Your Majesty, what is this?

380
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,920
I am preparing for your wedding with His Majesty.

381
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,640
Who said I must marry His Majesty?

382
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,799
I know this matter is fraught with difficulties.

383
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,540
But trust me. There will be a turning point.

384
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,660
The ceremony of conferring a title of consort is a major event in the Southern Kingdom.

385
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,339
On that day, His Majesty will write a coronation decree

386
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:17,240
and lead the court officials to announce it to the Grand Temple.

387
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,559
A ceremonial guard will be arranged for you to escort you into the palace for marriage.

388
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,200
Surrounded by flowers and brocades, you'll enter the bridal chamber together.

389
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,839
But you must not use the baby to monopolize His Majesty's heart.

390
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,710
I…

391
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,880
Your Majesty, you really don't mind?

392
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,279
I do.

393
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:48,480
But I know His Majesty doesn't belong to me alone.

394
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,640
If you truly love someone, you should not worry over it

395
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,940
and sincerely devote yourself to him.

396
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,620
Only when he is happy will I be happy.

397
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,860
Your Majesty, you are too kind.

398
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,504
Loving someone like this,

399
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:05,179
don't you feel aggrieved? Don't you feel it's difficult?

400
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,900
There is grievance and hardship.

401
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,900
But for him, it's all worthwhile.

402
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,699
Her Majesty is really a good person.

403
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:30,500
But if you love someone, shouldn't you get what you want?

404
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,860
But if you love someone, shouldn't you get what you want?

405
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,899
But if you love someone, shouldn't you get what you want?

406
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,279
Anyway, I can't be like Her Majesty.

407
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,860
I must find a way to be with Yan Changyun.

408
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,300
Don't shout. It's me.

409
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,640
It's you?

410
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,590
Why haven't you shown up for so long?

411
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,939
I've completed the task you arranged for me.

412
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:20,540
But that drug you gave me was forced down my throat by someone else.

413
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,219
It truly isn't that I couldn't complete it.

414
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:23,979
It's just that Yan Changyun is too formidable.

415
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:27,799
I know. I came this time for another task.

416
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,219
Another task?

417
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:34,060
Come closer and I'll tell you.

418
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,680
<i>[Genteel]</i>
Say it. Who instructed you?

419
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:30,860
Nobody.

420
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,680
Then, why did you want to kill me?

421
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:36,620
You have the nerve to ask?

422
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,860
Her Majesty has been so good to you,

423
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,699
but you seduced His Majesty and became pregnant with his child.

424
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:45,780
Since you insulted Her Majesty, I must kill you.

425
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,380
Impossible. I don't believe it.

426
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,340
Xue Ru, we grew up together.

427
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,319
You didn't do it, did you?

428
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:54,860
Your Majesty, you don't have to defend me anymore.

429
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,459
I have done wrong, but I have no regrets at all.

430
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:01,140
Even if I were given another chance to choose,

431
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,160
I'd still try to kill this treacherous wench.

432
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,600
How dare you!

433
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,240
Commander Yan, drag her out and have her beheaded.

434
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,179
Your Majesty, I believe a servant would not have such audacity.

435
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:13,060
She must have been ordered by someone.

436
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,499
Please allow me to take her back for questioning.

437
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:19,979
- All right! This matter must be thoroughly investigated.
- Yes.

438
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:22,448
- Someone.
- Here.

439
00:33:22,448 --> 00:33:24,320
- Take her to our camp.
- Yes.

440
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,999
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.

441
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:30,219
I will atone with my death.

Xue Ru!

443
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:42,160
Xue Ru, why are you so foolish?

If it weren't for me,

446

Xue Ru would not die.

447
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,699
Her words are not to be trusted.

448
00:34:06,699 --> 00:34:11,519
Her reason seems perfect, but it doesn't hold up under scrutiny.

449
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:17,900
Are you suspecting Her Majesty?

450
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,980
Her Majesty would not do such a thing.

451
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,200
I am not suspecting Her Majesty.

452
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:27,120
I just want you to know

453
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,939
the palace seems calm, but actually, there are undercurrents.

454
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:32,380

You are a grown man, why are you hesitating so much?

It's really unpleasant for you to be like this.

464
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:56,220
Your Majesty, after Xue Ru died, Her Majesty was so heartbroken,

465
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,220
and you have time to sit here drinking tea?

466
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,480
How can you talk to His Majesty like that?

467
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,619
How can you talk to the crown prince's mother like that?

468
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,419
I was wrong.

469
00:36:03,419 --> 00:36:07,359
The crown prince's mother. For his sake, I have endured for so long.

470
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,719
I'm not playing the role of a mother anymore.

471
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:17,360
Be careful not to affect the fetus.

472
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,180
Ten months. It'll pass quickly.

473
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,719

00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,679
What if the Grand Empress Dowager finds out you have no child?

478
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,960
The one who will die isn't me, but you.

479
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,019
I assure you, as soon as the time is ripe,

480
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:44,900
I'll have this thing removed immediately.

481
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,096
Hands off.

482
00:36:50,396 --> 00:36:51,780

00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,900
After ten months.

484
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:59,399

Slow down.

488
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,900
