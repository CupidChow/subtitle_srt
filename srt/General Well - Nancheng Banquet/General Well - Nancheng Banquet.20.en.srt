<i>[Episode 20]</i>

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,699
Aren't you usually quite talkative?

22
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:46,380
How come you've all become mute as soon as something happens?

23
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,259
Princess Jiayang died in our Southern Kingdom.

24
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,020
What do you think I should do?

25
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,540
Your Majesty, as the leader of the Thousand Feather Guards,

26
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,300
Yan Changyun initially had Your Majesty's deep trust,

27
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,779
and was responsible for protecting Princess Jiayang's safety.

28
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:03,239
His failure in this matter is indeed a severe dereliction of duty.

29
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,059
He should bear all the responsibility.

30
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,120
Ning Kingdom has always had ulterior motives.

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,360
Their recent visit to Southern Kingdom is even more dubious.

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,260
For the mere sake of Princess Jiayang, and lose a great general of our dynasty

33
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,460
is truly a loss greater than the gain.

34
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,660
I hope Your Majesty will think carefully.

35
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,219
Although Commander Yan is not the murderer,

36
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:23,720
he is responsible for protecting Princess Jiayang's safety.

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,860
And he was there when the princess died.

38
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,759
If we can't find the murderer,

39
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,300
then how are we to explain to Ning Kingdom?

40
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:39,059
Your Majesty, if Yan Changyun doesn't die, Ning Kingdom's anger will hardly subside.

41
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,940
Finding a good commander is harder than raising an army, Your Majesty.

42
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,379
- Please reconsider, Your Majesty.
- Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

43
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,500
I'm going in to see someone.

44
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,136
Stop there.

45
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,499
Where's your token?

46
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:15,539
I have it.

47
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,472
Where's your token?

48
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:22,219
Think it over, you two.

49
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:25,819
How would I have come inif I didn't have a token?

50
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:27,572
Token.

51
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,704
Token.

52
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,300
If you have the token, then you should have said so earlier. Go in.

53
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,260
Thank you, big brother.

54
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,640
Yan Changyun!

55
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,750
Yan Changyun!

56
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,332
Yan Changyun!

57
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,340
Fu Xiao?

58
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,468
- How did you get in?
- I paid.

59
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,920
I brought you dumplings. I made them by hand overnight.

60
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,539
You haven't been eating well in here, have you?

61
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,399
<i>You're so young and you can already cook?</i>

62
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,739
<i>I'm not little anymore. I'm already seven years old.</i>

63
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:53,079
<i>Besides, when my parents are away, I cook for myself.</i>

64
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,380
<i>So, what are we doing here?</i>

65
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,739
<i>Making dumplings.</i>

66
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:00,560
<i>Aren't these only eaten during festivals?</i>

67
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,099
<i>Who cares whether it's a festival or not.</i>

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,739
<i>Do you want to eat them or not?</i>

69
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,700
<i>Of course.</i>

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,739
<i>Then go fetch some water for me.</i>

71
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,288
<i>Okay.</i>

72
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:24,348
Is it tasty?

73
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,790
Yes.

74
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,500
Yan Changyun, this is Xiao Quan's territory.

75
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,820
They haven't bullied you, have they?

76
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you joking?

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,900
Who am I? Would they dare to bully me?

78
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,760
Okay. They wouldn't dare to bully you.

79
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,720
Time's up.

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,820
Big brother, please make an exception for me just this once.

81
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,180
Your money only buys such little time.

82
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,339
Then I'm going back.

83
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:54,700
You wait for me; I'm going to beg His Majesty right now.

84
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,380
Here, you eat all the dumplings.

85
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,500
I will come to see you again.

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,900
If Yan Changyun is released, Ning Kingdom will raise an army to attack.

87
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,179
If Yan Changyun isn't released, then Xiao Quan's schemes will succeed.

88
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,870
Your Majesty!

89
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,520
Your Majesty.

90
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,940
Your Majesty, why did you agree to arrest Yan Changyun?

91
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,020
Princess Jiayang died in the Southern Kingdom,

92
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,339
and she died in Yan Changyun's arms.

93
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,859
This matter is no small issue.

94
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,760
The court officials' petitions have come like a deluge.

95
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,560
All of them demand that I kill Yan Changyun; otherwise, Ning Kingdom will…

96
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,040
But you can't just execute a loyal official of the Southern Kingdom just to appease Ning Kingdom.

97
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,000
I didn't say that I would kill him.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,464
I…

99
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,880
I intend to release him.

100
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,596
Really?

101
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,279
I knew it. Your Majesty is certainly a wise ruler.

102
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,299
Then, could Your Majesty lend me a token,

103
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,180
so I can go and see him in prison?

104
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,959
Sure, come here.

105
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,580
Take this.

106
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

107
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,620
Your Majesty, about Commander Yan…

108
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,040
I'm going to see him.

109
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,700
Greetings, Lord Xiao.

110
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,040
Are you sleeping, Commander Yan?

111
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,600
It seems that the Ministry of Justice's prison beds suit you well.

112
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,160
If you like it, feel free to stay a few more days.

113
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,720
Lord Xiao seems very pleased.

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,659
I've just suspected that there's a problem with the Dark-Green Imperial Incense,

115
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,439
and then Princess Jiayang died.

116
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,439
Lord Xiao truly employs drastic measures.

117
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,920
I have no idea what you're talking about.

118
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,160
Dark-Green Imperial Incense is from the Ning Kingdom.

119
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,160
How would I know what's inside it?

120
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,580
As far as I know, before I suspected there was an issue with the Dark-Green Imperial Incense,

121
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,720
Lord Xiao had already prevented Her Majesty from using the Dark-Green Imperial Incense.

122
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,399
You've been hindering my investigation all this time.

123
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:35,799
First, by luring and capturing Chu Yue then by killing the former people of the Qin Family.

124
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,639
Even going so far as to harm Princess Jiayang, and putting me in mortal danger.

125
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,960
But it is precisely because of this,

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,200
that I was able to see clearly the true killer behind the Guanyou Incident.

127
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,639
It solved the mystery that has been in my heart for many years.

128
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,100
You should have died long ago.

129
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,970
Yes.

130
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,550
The fact that you didn't kill me 15 years ago...

131
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,159
must be your biggest regret.

132
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,719
For 15 years, you've lived in disgrace and have not been able to clear your family's name.

133
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:18,059
That must be your greatest regret, Qin Yan.

134
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,299
To tell you the truth.

135
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:25,320
Even if you kill me now,

136
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,200
it won't be of any use.

137
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,980
Your Qin Family will forever be branded as traitorous officials and rebels.

138
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,379
And you won't even be able to walk out of the Ministry of Justice's prison.

139
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,679
I advise you to just wait for death here.

140
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,399
Even if Your Majesty doesn't execute you,

141
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,440
I can easily fabricate some unfounded charges against you,

142
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,160
and let you die here.

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,360
And who would be able to doubt it?

144
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,600
Then I would advise Lord Xiao to take action quickly.

145
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,180
Otherwise, once I get out, it will be you who dies.

146
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,279
I'll be waiting for you.

147
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,876
<i>[Prisoner]</i>

148
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:12,968
<i>[Ministry of Justice's Prison]</i>

149
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,080
This is the Ministry of Justice's prison.

150
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,000
What are the Thousand Feather Guards doing here?

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,800
What are we here for?

152
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
The land under my feet is the capital's.

153
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
The Thousand Feather Guards are responsible for the protection of the capital's safety.

154
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,440
We need to enter.

155
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,039
<i>Yes, we need to go in!</i>

156
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,440
Without my command, no one may enter.

157
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,679
Lord Xiao, please hold.

158
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,060
By His Majesty's oral decree, we're to enter on his behalf to visit Commander Yan.

159
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,279
May I go in, then?

160
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,239
- Hurry, open the door.
- Okay.

161
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,260
Yan Changyun.

162
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,740
Fu Xiao, how did you get here?

163
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,240
HisMajesty gave me a token,

164
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,400
and he said that he'll release you soon.

165
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,460
It's not that simple;

166
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,870
His Majesty will not let me go easily.

167
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,420
He said it himself.

168
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,519
Moreover, he also knows that you're not involved in this matter.

169
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,679
But the court of civil and military officials will not think the same.

170
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,159
And the Ning Kingdom will not let things go easily.

171
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,519
I'm worried that the Ning Kingdom will take this opportunity to provoke a war.

172
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,200
What you're worried about is the country,

173
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,080
but what I'm worried about is you.

174
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,000
Rest assured, after all, I didn't kill Her Highness.

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,960
It won't be so easy for Xiao Quan to kill me.

176
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,840
As long as the murderer and the secret within the Dark-Green Imperial Incense is found,

177
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,820
His Majesty will naturally vindicate me.

178
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,279
Understood, me and Tianjiao will quickly investigate and rescue you.

179
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:16,920
<i>[Imperial Spring Palace]</i>

180
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,670
<i>[Emulating the Worthy]</i>

181
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,364
Greetings, Your Majesty.

182
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:22,379
Rise.

183
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:23,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

184
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,079
I called you here to—

185
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,859
Your Majesty, are you intending to release Commander Yan?

186
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:31,500
The matter of Princess Jiayang is yet unresolved.

187
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,700
And since Commander Yan isn't the murderer, so…

188
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,820
Your Majesty, please reconsider at all costs.

189
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,460
Although Commander Yan is not the murderer,

190
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,940
the princess died due to his negligence.

191
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,800
If Commander Yan is released without evidence,

192
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,779
then it may well exacerbate the conflict and escalate the situation.

193
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:50,840
At that time, officials from all departments will voice their challenges.

194
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,419
Your Majesty will find yourself in a situation of both internal and external troubles.

195
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,159
I hope Your Majesty will think carefully before making a decision.

196
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,220
You may leave now.

197
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,279
I'll be leaving for now.

198
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,879
<i>I wonder how Tianjiao and the others are progressing with the investigation.</i>

199
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,328
Fu Xiao.

200
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,539
Senior Sister,

201
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:38,120
Master's affection for you has not been in vain.

202
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,720
You still remember Master.

203
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,039
Have you regained your memory?

204
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,792
Reach out your hand.

205
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,579
Master is very skilled in medicine. Let him take a look at you.

206
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,079
If the medicine is good, why is he in a wheelchair?

207
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,519
Senior Sister.

208
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,179
Sorry.

209
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,299
A healer cannot heal oneself, that's all.

210
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:11,420
You don't distrust me even now, do you?

211
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,720
You look so good; you must be a kind person.

212
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,536
I believe you.

213
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,240
Still so glib even now.

214
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,719
There are old injuries inside.

215
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,919
However, the recovery has been quite good during this period.

216
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,559
Don't worry, your memory can be restored.

217
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,599
It just needs a little time.

218
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,480
Thank you, Master.

219
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,959
Come back with me.

220
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:53,320
Let me take good care of you. So, your memory may recover quickly.

221
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,279
I'm sorry, Master.

222
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,100
I can't go back right now.

223
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,960
I have someone I like.

224
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,960
He's in prison now, and I have to save him.

225
00:15:04,616 --> 00:15:06,230
Senior Sister.

226
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,720
Have you really betrayed Master?

227
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,500
It's not betrayal. Yan Changyun is in trouble now.

228
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,800
I can't just leave like this.

229
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,179
After the matter is resolved,

230
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,779
I will go and ask for your forgiveness.

231
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:20,199
I hope you won't blame me.

232
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,910
Enough.

233
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,520
I'm tired. You may go.

234
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,140
Then I won't disturb you.

235
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,764
I'm leaving.

236
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,380
Master, don't be angry. Senior Sister is bewitched.

237
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,679
Once Yan Changyun is executed, she'll return.

238
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:55,756
<i>[Thousand Feather Guards]</i>

239
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,664
Why did you just come? I've been waiting for you for a long time.

240
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:02,852
Are you all right?

241
00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:04,960
I'm fine; I got held up by some matters.

242
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,080
<i>[Autopsy]</i>
This was obtained by the coroner.

243
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,230
Unstoppable bleeding,

244
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,270
the shape of the knife wound is unusual.

245
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,440
<i>Do you remember this plum blossom dagger given by Master?</i>

246
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,360
<i>One cut and the bleeding won't stop.</i>

247
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,020
<i>It's her.</i>

248
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,279
Master.

249
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,900
<i>Come in.</i>

250
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,400
Master, where is Eldest Senior Sister?

251
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,140
Qing Li?

252
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,140
She's at Wanshi Pavilion. What's wrong?

253
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:54,240
Master, actually, I discovered the wounds on Princess Jiayang's body.

254
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,380
It's a wound by a plum blossom triangular dagger.

255
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,440
Isn't that Senior Sister's weapon?

256
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,319
Are you suspecting Qing Li killed Princess Jiayang?

257
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,559
Senior Sister, although Eldest Senior Sister is petty and jealous,

258
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,540
but killing the Princess of the Ning Kingdom could affect relations between the two countries, and even lead to war.

259
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,219
She wouldn't do such a thing.

260
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,459
Fu Xiao, do you think that I gave the orders?

261
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,359
No, Master.

262
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,039
I didn't mean that. Please don't overthink it.

263
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,580
Master, could there possibly be a chance

264
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,140
that she killed Princess Jiayang without your knowledge?

265
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,279
Senior Sister, you're still suspecting Master.

266
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:49,819
If you really think it's Master, then you might as well arrest Master directly.

267
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,420
Qing Yun.

268
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:56,400
Master.

269
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,960
Return to Wanshi Pavilion tomorrow and check if Qing Li is still there.

270
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,560
Okay.

271
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,319
Fu Xiao, rest assured.

272
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,079
If it was really her,

273
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,899
I'll certainly not let this unfilial disciple go.

274
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,600
If it really was her, why would she do it?

275
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,820
I haven't figured it out either.

276
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,640
By the way, Fu Xiao, have you thought it through?

277
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,839
Do you want to come back with me?

278
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,540
Master, I just remembered that there's something important I haven't done yet.

279
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,900
I'm on my way right now.

280
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,160
Remember to tell me once you find out.

281
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,000
Imperial Physician Qu, wake up quickly!

282
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,079
Miss Xiao. Lord Wei.

283
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,400
Okay, Imperial Physician Qu, have you found out anything or not?

284
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,799
Does the Dark-Green Imperial Incense contain vermilion silver powder?

285
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:34,499
Ever since Commander Yan assigned me a perfumer,

286
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:37,008
I've been working tirelessly with them for several days.

287
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:39,399
- Although the process was arduous—
- Let's talk about the results.

288
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,240
Yes, it indeed contains vermilion silver powder.

289
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,720
However, the art of fragrance-making in the Ning Kingdom is very exquisite.

290
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,700
For now, I still can't extract vermilion silver powder from the Dark-Green Imperial Incense.

291
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,020
Brother Qiang. Lord Wei. You're here too.

292
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,379
Imperial Physician Qu, the medicine you prescribed to me last time seems to be working.

293
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,960
I'm not addicted to Dark-Green Imperial Incense anymore.

294
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,940
Do you have any more? Prescribe me some more.

295
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,460
- Imperial Physician Qu,
- This...

296
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,160
vermilion silver powder can't be extracted from Dark-Green Imperial Incense.

297
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,079
But it can be extracted from Liu Yidao's body. Right?

298
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,880
This might work.

299
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,640
I have seen it in a fragment of a medical book.

300
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,680
The urine extraction method.

301
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,179
Liu Yidao.

302
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,352
Hurry up.

303
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:42,536
<i>[Imperial Medical Bureau]</i>

304
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,856
That stinks.

305
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,519
Look, this contains vermilion silver powder.

306
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,759
Princess Jiayang of the Ning Kingdom,

307
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:24,879
came all the way to the Southern Kingdom with sincerity.

308
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:26,999
Just for the benefit of the people of both countries.

309
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:30,319
Yet she met with this tragedy and died innocently.

310
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,120
I hope that Your Majesty of the Southern Kingdom will punish the murderer severely,

311
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,759
and show justice for Princess Jiayang's death.

312
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:40,340
We are deeply grieved by the princess's death.

313
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,720
However, the investigation of the murderer is still underway.

314
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,500
What more is there to investigate?

315
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,060
Princess Jiayang died in the arms of the commander of the Thousand Feather Guards.

316
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,260
Even if Yan Changyun isn't the murderer, he can't be absolved of responsibility and must be punished severely.

317
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,870
Your Majesty, please execute Yan Changyun.

318
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,180
I...

319
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,400
The people saw that Commander Yan didn't do it that day.

320
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,880
Then why did the princess die in Yan Changyun's arms?

321
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,519
In order that our princess can receive fair treatment,

322
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,500
we've already sent a message back to the Ning Kingdom.

323
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,020
If the Southern Kingdom refuses to execute Yan Changyun,

324
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,980
then don't blame me when the Ning Kingdom starts an attack.

325
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,619
You may have a hundred thousand cavalries,

326
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:18,139
but the Thousand Feather Guards of the Southern Kingdom are not pushovers either.

327
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,819
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Please rise.

328
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:30,719
Envoys, the Southern Kingdom has always been reasonable.

329
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:34,240
The princess's death in the Southern Kingdom grieves us as well.

330
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,720
So many were there that day, yet the murder weapon has vanished.

331
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,400
Judging from the fatal wound on the princess's body,

332
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,320
the murder weapon is a plum blossom triangular short blade.

333
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,839
Therefore, the murder must be someone else.

334
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,359
There must be someone plotting behind the scenes.

335
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,880
Lord Xiao has a point.

336
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,079
Regarding this kind of person inciting war between two nations and murdering the princess,

337
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,359
I feel deeply sorry.

338
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,180
The Southern Kingdom sincerely wishes to have good relations with the Ning Kingdom.

339
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,240
That's right, there is also another matter

340
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,720
that requires the Ning Kingdom envoy to clarify for us.

341
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,759
Stop beating around the bush, speak directly.

342
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,788
Bring it up.

343
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,539
<i>Isn't this Eunuch Liu?</i>

344
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:18,960
<i>How did he end up like this?</i>

345
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,500
<i>That's Xiao Daozi, look.</i>

346
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,280
This is Eunuch Liu;

347
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,400
you may not recognize him.

348
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,000
But he is the most trusted eunuch by His Majesty's side.

349
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,839
His Majesty finds it hard to endure even a single day without him.

350
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,600
That's correct.

351
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,259
It is because he used Ning Kingdom's Dark-Green Imperial Incense.

352
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,540
Here, take a look!

353
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,930
Look at what he has become.

354
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,940
A person who was once lively and jumpy,

355
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,220
now has such a severe problem.

356
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,799
What do you say is the reason?

357
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,479
How would we know the reason?

358
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:59,740
Fine, let me tell you.

359
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:05,100
The imperial doctor found vermilion silver powder in the Dark-Green Imperial Incense.

360
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,160
<i>The Dark-Green Imperial Incense contains vermilion silver powder.</i>

361
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,240
In the Southern Kingdom, vermilion silver powder is strictly prohibited.

362
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,680
Shouldn't you give us an explanation?

363
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,280
Jiaojiao.

364
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,540
Your Majesty, this was extracted from within Eunuch Liu's body by the imperial doctor.

365
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,180
Due to excessive exposure to Dark-Green Imperial Incense,

366
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,430
this is proof of vermilion silver powder deposits in the body.

367
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,460
You have come from afar as guests, and I have treated you with respect.

368
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,620
However, regarding this matter,

369
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,839
shouldn't you give me an explanation?

370
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,680
This matter concerned the diplomatic relations between the two countries.

371
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,340
Without evidence, I didn't wish to bring it to the table.

372
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,119
But you press aggressively.

373
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,179
My Southern Kingdom's wealth and strength nullify any fear of the Ning Kingdom.

374
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:04,160
We don't attack others yet fear no invader.

375
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,200
It's just that I am the ruler of a nation.

376
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,319
I have to consider the people of the entire nation.

377
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:11,119
That is why I value peace when dealing with you.

378
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:13,640
Dark-Green Imperial Incense contains vermilion silver powder.

379
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,740
We were unaware of this!

380
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,280
We ask for Your Majesty's discernment.

381
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,610
Enough.

382
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:24,039
I'm not so petty.

383
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,620
Trade between the Southern Kingdom and the Ning Kingdom shall continue.

384
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,759
But this Dark-Green Imperial Incense is absolutely forbidden.

385
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:35,400
To compensate for the wounded hearts of our Southern Kingdom's people,

386
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,156
we shall add another 20 percent to the tariffs.

387
00:25:39,156 --> 00:25:41,860
<i>[Imperial Spring Palace]</i>

388
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,279
Secretary Xiao, what is your view on today's court discussions?

389
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:50,720
Your Majesty, today the court has already presented proof to the Ning Kingdom.

390
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,839
Dark-Green Imperial Incense contains vermilion silver powder.

391
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,759
Ning Kingdom's actions are of unclear intent.

392
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,700
Since they are in the wrong, then regarding Ning Kingdom's demand for me to execute Yan Changyun,

393
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,859
I will not comply.

394
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,240
What's the matter? Do you have doubts?

395
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,330
I dare not.

396
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,590
It's just that, Your Majesty,

397
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,200
after all, Princess Jiayang did die in our Southern Kingdom.

398
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,900
There must be an explanation, mustn't there?

399
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,860
I have a temporary solution.

400
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,000
During the New Year's Eve festival, a thief committed theft,

401
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,359
and was blind to fortune and mistakenly killed the innocent Princess Jiayang.

402
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,080
While we express our deep sorrow,

403
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,910
we're also willing to send this thief to the Ning Kingdom.

404
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:40,880
Are we short of death row inmates in our Ministry of Justice?

405
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,240
Then what about Yan Changyun?

406
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,440
As the commander of the Thousand Feather Guards,

407
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,340
he neglected his duty, and resulting in Princess Jiayang's death.

408
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,440
We must, after all, give a solution to the Ning Kingdom.

409
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,119
A solution, of course, will be given.

410
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,759
I will punish Yan Changyun and replace the commander of the Thousand Feather Guards.

411
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,960
Yan Changyun is to be demoted to a commoner.

412
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,839
This counts as giving a solution to the Ning Kingdom.

413
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:09,920
It is also a solution to the civil and military officials of the court.

414
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,440
I obey the decree.

415
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:27,740
<i>Upon investigation, it is confirmed that Yan Changyun is not the murderer.</i>

416
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,100
<i>However, the Thousand Feathers Guards were responsible for Princess Jiayang's safety,</i>

417
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,360
<i>and Yan Changyun has the crime of dereliction of duty.</i>

418
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,780
<i>He is now demoted to a commoner and will never be employed again.</i>

419
00:27:44,636 --> 00:27:47,080

Prepared for you.

This is impressive; it's called "Complete Roundness".

00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,744
Eat a bit more.

442
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,319
I already know.

443
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,599
When I was in prison,

444
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:34,179
you ran around everywhere to prove my innocence.

445
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:37,359
And even battled in debate with the four nobles in court.

446
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,324
That's very impressive.

447
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,740
Isn't this what I should have done?

448
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:50,340
Brother Yan, it's all due to my incompetence.

449
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:54,799
When you were in prison, I didn't help in any way.

450
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,200
I'm sorry.

451
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,459
Boss, Commander Wei is here.

452
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,559
Commander Wei, please, take a seat quickly.

453
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:07,350
No!

454
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,880
A traitor can't sit at the table.

455
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,579
My serving as the commander of the Thousand Feather Guards was an order from above.

456
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,400
It has nothing to do with me; I'm innocent.

457
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,700
Boss!

458
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,980
All right, you two stop teasing him.

459
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,720
Sit down now.

460
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,440
Boss, it's not that we didn't come to pick you up from prison.

461
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,220
- Someone didn't allow us.
- Eat your food.

462
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,588
Come, let's first welcome the boss back home.

463
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:36,379
- Here.
- Come on, Boss.

464
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,280
Thank you, everyone.

465
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,890
Come.

466
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,960
Miss, it's already this late, why are you still working?

467
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,920
You should rest earlier.

468
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,400
Today is a good day because Brother Yan was released from prison.

469
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,040
I want to give him the clothes I sewed myself.

470
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,880
It's like a welcome gift to cleanse the dirt of the outside world.

471
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,640
It's almost finished.

472
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,119
Later, help me deliver it to the young master.

473
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,839
Miss, others may not know you, but don't I know you well?

474
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,470
You've waited for the young master for so many years,

475
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,680
yet he has not given you a proper status to this day.

476
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,440
Before, no one competed with you, but now Fu Xiao has suddenly appeared.

477
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,960
The two of them are always so affectionate every day,

478
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,180
I think the young master is very fond of Fu Xiao.

479
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,920
Miss, I'm afraid you have devoted so many years in vain.

480
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,720
- Don't talk nonsense.
- Miss, I'm not talking nonsense.

481
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,720
I just feel it's not worth it for you, waiting all these years for nothing.

482
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,920
All right, you may leave first.

483
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,884
Yes.

484
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:21,880
Someone told me, those freshly freed from prison,

485
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,799
should use pomelo leaves to ward off bad luck.

486
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:33,240
This is a new set of clothes specially prepared for you.

487
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,400
I have already ironed them.

488
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,080
Here.

489
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:57,440
Fu Xiao. I'm sorry for making you worry this time.

490
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,810
You are mine.

491
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,440
Of course, I will worry about you.

492
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,300
Promise me, no matter what happens in the future,

493
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,060
you must protect yourself first.

494
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,359
But what if it's like this time?

495
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,699
What if you are in danger?

496
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:20,160
Your being in danger is the greatest danger to me.

497
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,516
I understand.

498
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,019
<i>Mother, everyone at the house says you have left,</i>

499
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:23,000
<i>and will never return.</i>

500
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,300
<i>They're lying to me, aren't they?</i>

501
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,419
<i>[Madam Lei's Tablet, Mother Liu]
You'll return, right?</i>

502
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:33,059
<i>Father has gone to perform military duties again.</i>

503
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:36,019
<i>Once again, I'm alone at home.</i>

504
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:40,239
<i>Mother, I miss you so much.</i>

505
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,139
<i>May I stay here with you?</i>

506
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,800
I never expected Miss Chu Yue to come to me on her own initiative.

507
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,360
Please have a seat.

508
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:51,039
Fu Xiao is the murderer who killed Guo Zhen.

509
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,419
Do you think I care who killed Guo Zhen?

510
00:35:56,419 --> 00:36:00,780
Who killed Guo Zhen doesn't matter to Lord Xiao, of course.

511
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,979
But Fu Xiao took the jade ring from Guo Zhen's hand.

512
00:36:04,979 --> 00:36:08,380
I wonder if you are interested in this.

513
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,499
Originally, Yan Changyun didn't kill Fu Xiao just because of this jade ring.

514
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:19,760
I think you might have misunderstood, Miss.

515
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,539
What does all this you've said have to do with me?

516
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,740
Lord Xiao, something that Yan Changyun is so eager to obtain,

517
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:34,240
aren't you the least bit curious that it may contain a few secrets?

518
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,599
Too much curiosity does you no good.

519
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,280
Aren't you afraid of bringing trouble upon yourself, Miss?

520
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,120
Of course,

521
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,320
but I'm more afraid of losing someone important.

522
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,360
Fu Xiao shouldn't have fallen in love with Yan Changyun.

523
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,240
Yan Changyun is my man.

524
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,119
Fine.

525
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:04,239
Since you've asked, I'm willing to relieve your worries.

526
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,228
- Xue Ying.
- Yes.

527
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:19,220
- Keep a close eye on her for me.
- Understood.

528
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,639
Lord, is that ring really so important?

529
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:26,239
I'm worried that the hidden secrets

530
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,639
about the Guanyou Incident is inside that ring.

531
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:32,119
<i>General Guo is a man of Duke Ding.</i>

532
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,880
<i>Together, we'll use vermilion silver powder to bring down Duke Ding.</i>

533
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,220
<i>Once it's done, General, you will surely get what you wish.</i>

534
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,239
<i>Promotion to a high position.</i>

535
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,399
<i>I, Guo, promise here that after success,</i>

536
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:48,300
<i>I will never return to the capital in this life.</i>

537
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,599
<i>The future of Ning Kingdom's throne now rests in the hands of you two.</i>

538
00:37:59,292 --> 00:38:03,552
<i>[Signatories Guo Zhen, Ge Heng, Xiao Quan]</i>

539
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,740
However, it wasn't long after the Qin Family's incident

540
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,639
that the agreement was destroyed.

541
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,840
<i>Congratulations General Guo, you have achieved your wish. </i>

542
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,040
<i>Congratulations to you too.</i>

543
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,780
<i>Also, congratulations to Young Master Xiao on successfully eliminating a major threat.</i>

544
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,380
<i>Ning Kingdom's future still greatly relies on the support of both of you.</i>

545
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:25,079
<i>You two, the tripartite agreement that we signed</i>

546
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,039
<i>should be destroyed as soon as possible.</i>

547
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:29,759
<i>Lest it falls into the wrong hands.</i>

548
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:03,179
Do you worry that what Guo Zhen destroyed was a fake agreement?

549
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:06,640
If Fu Xiao regains her memory,

550
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,119
and shows that jade ring,

551
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,100
then Yan Changyun will reveal the secrets of the Guanyou Incident.

552
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,320
It seems we really can't afford to keep Fu Xiao.

553
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,460
- Xue Ying.
- Yes.

554
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,160
Arrange a meeting with Bai Yi for me.

555
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,880
Understood.
