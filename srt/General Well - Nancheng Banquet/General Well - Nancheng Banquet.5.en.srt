00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,839
Boss, didn't you originally plan for His Majesty to protect Xiao Qiangzi?

22
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:42,259
Why did you take the hit for him?

23
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,619
If Xiao Qiangzi were to take the blame for this,

24
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:48,580
I'm afraid the Empress Dowager would have had him killed.

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,419
Besides, this was a trap we set up in the first place.

26
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:54,180
This is my responsibility to bear.

27
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,059

Commander Yan, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,540
It's all because I was too impulsive that you got beaten.

32
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,980
You don't know how I felt when you were getting paddled. I actually felt really bad for you.

33
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,159
I wished I could have taken a few hits for you.

34
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,159
No one was stopping you.

35
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,380
But there were so many people there at that time.

36
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,120
I was afraid of being accused of causing trouble again.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,060
Commander Yan, rest assured, you've saved my life today.

38
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,680
From now on, you're my boss.

39
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,199
I'll "lead your follow" from now on.

40
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,980
Follow your lead.

41
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,479
Follow your lead.

42
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,580
I'll be thankful enough if you didn't bring me any more trouble.

Don't worry, it won't happen again. I promise!

45
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,464
Just a moment.

46
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,699
Let me do it, Imperial Physician Qu.

47
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:01,339
Since he was injured for my sake, I should be the one to do it.

48
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:02,500
Then I'll leave it to you.

49

52
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,499
How did you get this very long wound?

53
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:44,459
I got it by accident.

54

And this one?

55
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,420
I scraped it during training.

How did you get this new wound?

59
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,480
I was bitten by a dog.

Bitten by a dog? It doesn't look like it.

61
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,639
It must be very painful with so many injuries.

62
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,140
It'll stops hurting when I blow on it.

Not only can it solve the problem of the Thousand Feather Guards' pay,

The personnel responsible escorting it from Jiangnan,

142

confirmed it with your people before leaving.

143
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,579
The silver stayed one night in Duke Wei's residence,

and incidentally, we find evidence of Duke Wei trafficking the vermilion silver powder.

175
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:03,639
Then congratulations to you. Is there anything else?

176
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,459
It's just actually the antidote.

177
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:09,820
So, it's about the antidote.

178
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,480
That's right! Didn't you say before

179
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,020
that the antidote costs ten taels of silver per pill.

180
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,259
I have 100 taels, which is enough to buy ten pills.

181
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:18,679
But could you consider the fact

182
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,399
that I'm buying so many at once,

183
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,800
could you kindly give me three more?

184
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,039
Well…

185
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,560
I'm begging you. It's about my life.

186
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,140
All right.

187
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,140
Thank you, Boss.

188
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,399
These days, if you want to live, then go bankrupt first.

189
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,739
Liu Yidao, what are you eating?

190
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:10,320
You're eating something so expensive as if it's candy?

191
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,500
Haven't I had a poor appetite recently?

192
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,240
I specifically asked Doctor Qu for some hawthorn pills to open my appetite.

193
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,128
You're eating this, too?

194
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,960
What did you say this is? Hawthorn pills?

195
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,159
<i>That evil Yan Changyun.</i>

196
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,919
These are hawthorn pills, not the antidote.

197
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,988
That's right.

198
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,039
You even dare to admit it.

199
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,620
Yan Changyun, you're a big liar.

200
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,860
I'm almost dying and you're still deceiving me with fake medicine.

201
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,799
Is your heart made of stone?

202
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,540
- Here's the situation…
- Save it. Explaining is to cover up,

203
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,240
and covering up is to have unforgivable crimes.

204
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,659
I trusted you with all my heart and soul.

205
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,939
I have worked my fingers to the bone to make money to save my life,

206
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:19,540
yet you deceived me with fake medicine.

207
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,279
You never cared about my life.

208
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,459
Am I right? I was wrong to trust you.

209
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,140
Yan Changyun, tell me the truth.

210
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,159
Do you actually have the antidote or not?

211
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,090
No.

212
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,399
Xiao Qiangzi, you…

213
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,040
Boss.

214
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,119
A'Cheng, do you think I'm wrong?

215
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:02,040
Boss, we originally wanted to use Xiao Qiangzi,

216
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,760
but it turns out that he helped us so much this time.

217
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,940
Tricking him like this is indeed a bit too much.

218
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,299
<i>I kept him by my side</i>

219
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:36,559
<i>to obtain the secret of the jade ring.</i>

220
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,239
<i>But why…?</i>

221
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:46,890
<i>[Civil and Military Strategies]</i>

222
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,959
Is Yan Changyun even human?

223
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,640
This is too inhumane.

224
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,219
This is for you.

225
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:15,459
What's this?

226
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:19,980
If you run into danger in the future, just blow it and I will come immediately.

227
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,839
Don't misunderstand. Everyone in the Thousand Feather Guards has one.

228
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,480
I have to discuss matters, you rest. No need to wait for me.

229
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,640
What kind of crappy thing is this? Trying to fool me with it?

230
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,540
The national treasury is now empty.

231
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,332
I wonder which of my beloved ministers could succeed Duke Wei,

232
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:12,020
managing the national treasury, enriching the treasury, to benefit the Southern Kingdom.

233
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,740
As the saying goes, "Exercise your powers when in position."

234
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,740
According to old rules, the treasury should be managed by the Ministry of Revenue.

235
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,340
I believe Minister Han of the Ministry of Revenue suits it best.

236
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,880
In that case, Minister Han,

237
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,359
you must not fail the expectations of me and Chancellor Xiao.

238
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,520
I shall obey the order.

239
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,780
Upon my youthful ascension to the throne, Duke Wei controlled the internal treasury.

240
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,919
Now let me manage this internal treasury.

241
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,688
<i>Well…</i>

242
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:10,600
Commander Yan, you've led the Thousand Feather Guards on a large-scale searches recently,

243
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,079
causing panic among the people and making them feel uneasy.

244
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,720
But you only managed to remove the cancerous tumor that is Duke Wei.

245
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,359
What do you mean by this, Chancellor Xiao?

246
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,964
You've been investigating the vermilion silver powder for so long,

247
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:26,179
yet there's not a bit of news.

248
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:30,600
Isn't this somewhat unreasonable?

249
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,419
Your Majesty, I believe

250
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:38,640
if Commander Yan lacks the ability to continue the investigation,

251
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,540
it might be better to hand this matter over to the Ministry of Justice.

252
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,680
You have a point.

253
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,380
I agree.

254
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,220
The Ministry of Justice has already begun preparations to take over this case.

255
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,499
Find an opportunity to arrange for Fang You to escape from prison.

256
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,220
We'd finally caught him,

257
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,499
what if he's killed by the others?

258
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:05,340
I don't care about his life or death.

259
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,760
What I want is for the person behind the scenes to appear.

260
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,079
We have already startled the snake by beating the grass.

261
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,100
Now that we've handed the case over to the Ministry of Justice,

262
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,980
this is the time for them to let down their guard.

263
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,519
Where have you been? You're back so late.

264
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,119
How come? Do I have to report my whereabouts now?

265
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:29,659
I didn't feel that you treated me as a member of the Thousand Feather Guards before.

266
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:32,240
So, does my business have anything to do with you?

267
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,100
Boss, Tianjiao's temper comes and goes quickly.

268
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,319
He'll be fine in a few days; don't take it to heart.

269
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:58,659
Old Six, the same old.

270
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:02,340
Brother Jiao, you're mistaken. Old Six is my dad.

271
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,060
Which three things did you eat?

272
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,659
Vermicelli noodles, white ginger shrimp, and roasted dried pork.

273
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:11,739
Briefly blanch the vermicelli noodles in boiling water; don't overcook them.

274
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:16,259
Add more balsamic vinegar and chili; no green onions, please.

275
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:18,700
Serve the sauce for the white ginger shrimp in a small bowl.

276
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,240
He likes to dip and eat.

277
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
Choose streaky pork for making dried roasted pork.

278
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,799
Okay, please wait a moment.

279
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,460
Thank you.

280
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,440
Isn't this the royal mare's milk wine from the Northern Barbarian dynasty?

281
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,444
Haven't you always been reluctant to drink it?

282
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:34,580
It depends on the occasion.

283
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,480
What occasion?

284
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,319
When you're angry.

285
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:48,620
Boss, you're being too serious with your words.

286
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,759
I'll punish myself with a drink.

That was my father's fault.

290
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:05,780
Even if you told me the plan,

291
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,760
I certainly can't raid my own home, can I?

292
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,840
Boss, I'll toast to you once more.

293
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,820
Come on.

294
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,592

then I would have taken more than just these.

Who stole it? It was given to me by him. Okay?

It would be right for him to give me something, wouldn't it?

346
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,079
He wronged me too; how come I don't have anything?

347
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,219
How about I call him over and ask?

348
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,480
What's the matter? What happened?

349
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:58,019
Is this whistle really that useful?

350
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,000
It's nothing; I'm just giving it a try.

351
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:06,860
You're blowing the whistle just to prove it's useful?

352
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,200
No, he's looking for you.

353
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,459
Boss, you wronged me too; where's my gift?

354
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:26,919
I'll go prepare it right now.

355
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,888
Thank you, Boss.

356
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,039
<i>So, he values me this much.</i>

357
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,440
<i>[Elegance]</i>
Look at what this is.

358
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,880
Isn't this the fan that the Commander cherishes the most?

359
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,172
That's right.

360
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:53,380
- Where did you get this from?
- He gave it to me.

361
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,839
Impossible. Why would he give it to you?

362
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,920
- He gave it to me for good performance.
- Keep practicing well.

363
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,400
Isn't that quite normal?

364
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,520
Boss!

365
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:06,300
We want one, too.

366
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,284
Boss, I want one too.

<i>[Civil and Military Strategies]</i>

368
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,480
Thank you, Boss.

369
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:29,404
We're all brothers; it's only right.

370
00:27:29,404 --> 00:27:30,972
Let's go.

371
00:27:30,972 --> 00:27:32,499
I said Boss isn't stingy.

372
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:34,300
He just hasn't found the right opportunity.

373
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,440
Look! How nice of him to give me this treasure.

374
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,220
What's happened again?

375
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,120
Commander Yan, you've come too slowly;

376
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,930
I'm tired of waiting.

377
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:06,319
Pour me a glass of water, please; I'm thirsty, it's over there.

378
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,319
You won't pour? Fine.

379
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:16,080
The words of the Thousand Feather Guards Military Governor don't seem to work.

380
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,540
If Your Majesty asks about it,

381
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,880
then I'll just have to tell the truth.

382
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:24,240
If Your Majesty finds out

383
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,599
that the Thousand Feather Guards only obey military orders and not His Majesty's orders.

384
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,119
Mind your attitude.

385
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:51,780
Commander Yan, where are you going?

386
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,759
I'm swinging on the swing here.

387
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,820
My feet can't reach the ground. Give me a push, will you?

388
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,759
Don't go too far.

389
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,559
I thought the Military Governor of the Thousand Feather Guards had great power.

390
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,619
Then I'll go ask His Majesty.

391
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:16,730
Wait!

392
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,390
I don't want to swing anymore.

393
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,720
Commander Yan, why do you look so pale?

394
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,559
Is it because you're now serving a Military Governor?

395
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,219
So, you're in a bad mood, huh?

396
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:39,419
How can I be upset when I'm just following orders?

397
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,079
<i>[Military Governor]</i>
Is it impressive, the gift from His Majesty?

398
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,059
From now on, you must follow orders properly. All right?

399
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,839
What is it?

400
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:08,000
Commander Yan, these are everyone's clothes.

401
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,400
Would you mind washing these for them?

402
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,200
You have to understand me, too.

403
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,300
<i>[Military Governor]</i>
I'm just acting under orders.

404
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Everyone, sit down and eat. Sit down, Brother Dao.

405
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,400
Did I call you here to eat?

406
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,700
I called you here to cook some vegetables for my friends.

407
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,600
Go on.

408
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,680

00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,200
- Commander Yan.
- Commander Yan.

411
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,600
You're here. Look how long I've been waiting.

412
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,500
I've just been taking the brothers for a stroll around the Thousand Feather Guards.

413
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,100
Now my back is sore and my legs ache; give me a massage.

414
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,900
How…?

415
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,000
Commander Yan, you don't showenough consideration for your subordinates.

416
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,800
It seems I haven't done my job well enough.

417
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,600
I'll go to His Majesty right now.

418
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,300
You misunderstood; it was a mistake.

419
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,400
Commander Yan, you have good comprehension.

420
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,600
Even if you can't be the commander of the Thousand Feather Guards in the future,

421
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,600
you'll certainly be able to make a good living with this skill.

422
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,000
Xiao Daozi.

423
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,400
Let's go.
- I don't want a massage anymore, I'm hungry.

424
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,200
Be careful.

425
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,400
Xiao Qiangzi has been getting more and more arrogant lately.

426
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,200
He even dares to bully Boss like this.

427
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,600
When Boss can't take it anymore, he'll have it coming.

428
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,100
Better avoid him in the future.

429
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,700
But I guess he won't be arrogant for much longer.

430
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,400
Let's try not to cause trouble in the future.

431
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,680
Am I really that excessive?

432
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,000
Even if I did go a little bit overboard,

433
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,400
but after eating the fruit I picked,

434
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,700
he'll finally simmer down. Right?

435
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,500
Are you really angry with me, or did you not hear me?

436
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,000
How come you're still not here?

437
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,600
Be careful!

438
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,300
Why are you climbing so high?

439
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,600
Why is it you?

440
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,300
Otherwise, who did you think it was?

441
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,000
Come down quickly; it's dangerous.

442
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,400
I…

443
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,700
Don't be afraid, I'll catch you. Come!

444
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,000
No way.

445
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Be careful.

446
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,500
Your Majesty.

447
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,300
Your Majesty, what are you doing here?

448
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,200
Recently, I got the key to the inner treasury.

449
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,600
I wanted to celebrate with you. Do you want to go out of the palace?

450
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,500
Do you want to go or not?

451
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,400
- Let's go.
- Let's go

452
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,300
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

453
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Xiao Qiangzi.

454
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,800
You should be a little happier for this rare outing from the palace.

455
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,900
If you fancy anything here, I'll pay for it.

456
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,200
Then I won't be polite.

457
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,900
Don't be.

458
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
This one looks nice, this one too. What should I do?

459
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,800
Buy it.

460
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Buy them all.

461
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
Thank you, you're so kind.

462
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Xiao Qiangzi, why would you, a man, buy so many pieces of jewelry?

463
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,740
To wear… To collect.

464
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,400
I have this hobby.

465
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,800
Okay then.

466
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,400

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,700
After using it, your hands will be smooth and delicate.

470
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,400
Give it a try.

471
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,000
Xiao Qiangzi, I didn't expect you to be quite good at self-care.

472
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,300
No wonder your hands are as tender as a woman's.

473
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,250
Self-care is not gender-specific. Young Master,

474
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,400
please kindly pay.

475
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Stop making a fuss.

476
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,600
If you continue to make a fuss, the Thousand Feather Guards will take you.

477
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,700
I want it.

478
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,800
The people of the Thousand Feather Guards are very fierce, aren't you afraid?

479
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Thank you, Young Master.

480
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,200
Madam,

481
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,100
the Thousand Feather Guards protect people, they don't eat people.

Kid, the imperial city is a place of importance, under His Majesty's feet.

483
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
If there's trouble, find the Thousand Feather Guards; if you're in distress, look for Yan Changyun.

484
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,600
He can do anything and is willing to serve everyone,

485
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,000
serving His Majesty and the people.

486
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,800
This is the principle of the Thousand Feather Guards. Okay?

487
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,000
You still dare to seek the Thousand Feather Guards?

488
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,300
Let's go! This person is crazy.

489
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,000
Unexpectedly, you really defended the Thousand Feather Guards.

490
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,800
Of course. The Thousand Feather Guards represents Your Majesty's image.

491
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,300
You can't let the people be afraid of Your Majesty.

492
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,400
That makes sense.

493
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,800
So, we might as well just let the Thousand Feather Guards

494
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,600

00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,700
♫ <i>If I could truly fall in love with you</i> ♫

00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,100
♫ <i>Why should I be afraid of the wind and snow disturbing my heart?</i> ♫

517
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:58,200
♫ <i>Never giving up, never forgetting, never regretting is my heartfelt wish for you</i> ♫

518
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,100
♫ <i>If I could fill pages with my affection for you</i> ♫

519
00:40:02,112 --> 00:40:06,560
♫ <i>Why fear the world's high mountains and long rivers?</i> ♫

520
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:17,000
♫ <i>One thought, one dream, a lifetime, I place you in my heart</i> ♫
