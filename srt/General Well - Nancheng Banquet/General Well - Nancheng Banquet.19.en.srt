Where are you going so early in the morning?

Nothing, just getting some stuff.

34
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,840
I'm afraid he can't carry it, so I'll go help him with the stuff.

- That's right.

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,400
Your Highness.

44
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,500
What are you guys going to do?

45
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,000
We're going out to buy some New Year's goods.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Why didn't you call me?

47
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,400
I love shopping,

48
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,800
and I've heard that the Southern Kingdom's Spring Festival is very lively.

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a sight I've never seen in the Ning Kingdom.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Take me to see it now. Let's go.

51
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,320
Then, I will go too.

52
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,100
Accompanying Your Highness is also my duty.

53

Dear guests, celebrate New Year's Eve by pressing the spring branches.

54
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,500
Once the spring branch is pressed, your wishes will come true.

55
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,800
The merchandise in our store is always true.

56
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,000
What is the pressing of spring branches?

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Your Highness, pressing the spring branches is a custom of the Southern Kingdom.

58
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
As long as you press the spring branches with the person you love on New Year's Eve,

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,300
then your wishes can come true.

60
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,000
Changyun, then I want to press the spring branches with you on New Year's Eve.

61
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,900
Your Highness, I have official duties on New Year's Eve.

62
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,900
I need to lead the Thousand Feather Guards to protect the safety of the capital.

63
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,300
What about my safety?

64
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,200
Rest assured, Your Highness. I'll dispatch elite soldiers to protect you.

65
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Take a look.

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,400
Boss, how much is that mascot?

67
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,100
These are two for five wen, three for ten wen, and five for fifteen wen.

68
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,400
Two for five wen, three for ten wen, and fifteen…

69
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,000
So, the more you buy, the cheaper it gets.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,500
Then I'll take all of these, and those three over there as well.

71
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,000
Also, one of those same items.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,800
Okay.

73
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,900
You sure know how to crunch numbers.

74
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,000
Really good at doing business.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,500

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,700
You're truly smart and clever.

77
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,400
I'll give you these peace charms for free. They can bring you good luck.

78
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,000
Thank you, boss. It's free.

79
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,100

80
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,700

81
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay.

82
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,000
Ms. Fu, you don't mind helping me carry these, do you?

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,300
I don't mind.

84
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,400
Changyun, I've looked inside, and there's not much.

85
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,950
Come with me next door for a look.

86
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,500
Let's go.

87
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,700
Boss, please pack up everything she just mentioned.

88
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,100
Okay.

89
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,600

91
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,200
Changyun, I'm really happy that you could be with me today.

92
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,400
Of course, I must also thank Master Xiao for her hard work today.

93
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,000
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,500
Dispense with the formalities.

95
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,000
- Your Majesty.
- Come on.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,600
What's the matter? Here.

97
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,800
I'll take it myself.

98
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,100
Don't move, I have appointed you as the reception officer.

99
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,200
It's fine, it's not heavy.

100
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,700
It's not like I'm asking you to do menial labor.

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,700
Sorry about that. The goods from the Southern Kingdom were too beautiful and too attractive.

102
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,900
I couldn't control myself, and that's why I bought so much.

103
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,200
Master Xiao, you surely didn't mind helping me carry these things, did you?

104
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,600
I didn't mind. I wish Your Highness would have bought even more.

105
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Then may I ask, Your Majesty, do you have any business here?

106
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,500
The end of the year is approaching, and I have prepared some gifts for you.

107
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Please see if you like them.

108
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
Thank you for the gifts, Your Majesty.

109
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,600
No need to be polite. Enjoy the New Year in the Southern Kingdom.

110
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,400
If you need anything, just ask.

111
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,800
In that case, I do have a matter to request Your Majesty's approval.

112
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,000
Go ahead.

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,700
I heard that Changyun must guard the capital's safety on New Year's Eve.

114
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,200
I would like to request a leave for him.

115
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,800
So, Changyun can stay by my side on New Year's Eve,

116
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,000
and have a good time.

117
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Fine, you're about to be her consort anyway.

118
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,500
From now on, you must fulfill the duties of a consort.

119
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,600
I grant it.

120
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Your Majesty, isn't the marriage alliance still undecided?

121
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,100
I have also prepared a gift for you. Where is it?

122
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,000
Bring it here.

123
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,900
Fu Xiao, see if you like it.

124
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Your Majesty, I must continue patrol, so I shall take my leave now.

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,840
Commander Yan, if you have official duties,then go ahead with your business.

126
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,400
Come closer.

127
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,600
Look, how is it?

128
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,400
It's just average.

129
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,500
Even so, you should thank Your Majesty.

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,700
Thank you for the reward, Your Majesty.

131
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,400
Eunuch Feng, I have prepared a gift for you.

132
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,400
You have my thanks, miss.

133
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,600
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

134
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Oh, right! Inside this box, there's a pair of dolls.

135
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,200
Please trouble Eunuch Feng to pass this on to Her Majesty,

136
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,800
and wish Her Majesty a speedy delivery of a blessed child.

137
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
What about mine?

138
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,600
I bought it. Of course, I bought it.

139
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,200
Just wait.

140
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,300
An exalted status such as Yours Majesty's requires this box to be worthy.

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,800
This is…?

142
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,200
Ginger, used for cooking.

143
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,600
Lame, please take a closer look.

144
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,700
It's ginger.

145
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,400
You're not getting it; this is ginger shaped like a mountain.

146
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,000
This represents the land and rivers, Your Majesty.

147
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Only you are worthy of it.

148
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,900
I like it, here.

149
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,000
- I'm glad you like it.
- I'll accept it.

150
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,600
However, compared to this land and rivers,

151
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,000
I would rather have someone who gets me.

152
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,200
There is one.

153
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,400
Her Majesty is the one who gets Your Majesty.

154
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,700
Everyone in the world knows Her Majesty cares for Your Majesty the most.

155
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,900
Am I right, Eunuch Feng?

156
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,800
So, Your Majesty, you must cherish your fortune.

157
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,600
You left too early just now.

158
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,000
You missed the thoughtfully prepared gift that Fu Xiao gave me.

159
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
It's profoundly meaningful.

160
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
She is indeed my woman.

161
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,900
Your Majesty, it should be her own decision that whose woman she wants to be.

162
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,200
I'm the ruler of the Southern Kingdom.

163
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,700
Who I desire, is mine.

164
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,400
As a subject, I protect the Southern Kingdom.

165
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,200
I shall not yield an inch of land that should not be lost.

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,400
You're right.

167
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,500
But don't forget, you're also mine.

168
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,100
<i>[150 taels]</i>

169
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,800
This outfit suits you; would you like to try it on?

170
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,600
<i>[150 taels]</i>
150 taels, only a fool would try.

171
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,000
Silly.

172
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,300
How beautiful.

173
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Silly, spending 150 taels on a piece of clothing?

174
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,700
As long as you like it, who cares if it's 150 taels?

175
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,800
What's the use of that?

176
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,400
I can't exactly wear it out in the open.

177
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,300
It'd be nice to wear it just for me to see.

178
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
That works.

179
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,400
On New Year's Eve, I'll accompany you to press the spring branches.

180
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,800
Forget it, you still have to accompany Your Highness.

181
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,200
When will I ever have the chance?

182
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,400
I was joking. I don't mind sacrificing one New Year.

183
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,800
Anyway, you'll have plenty of chances to make it up to me.

184
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,400
We need to prioritize the bigger picture now.

185
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,800
We can't afford to be clingy in love, you know.

186
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,800
Trust me.

187
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,200
I'll surely do so openly and honorably let you become my woman.

188
00:14:56,196 --> 00:15:00,556
<i>[Emulating the Worthy]</i>

189
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,400
I'm the emperor of the Southern Kingdom, right?

190
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,300
Of course.

191
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,800
The whole realm is mine, right?

192
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
That's right.

193
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,400
The Thousand Feather Guards are mine, and so is Commander Yan.

194
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,500
- Right?
- Yes.

195
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,800
So naturally, Fu Xiao should also be mine. Right?

196
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,400
You hesitated.

197
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,600
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

198
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,559
Even you can see that Fu Xiao prefers Yan Changyun.

199
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,000
<i>Her Majesty arrives.</i>

200
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

201
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,800
You may rise.

202
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,700
Your Majesty, tomorrow is New Year's Eve.

203
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,000
I prepared new clothes for you overnight.

204
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,800
I understand. You worked hard.

205
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,000
Let me help you put them on to see how they fit.

206
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,400
No need.

207
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,600
Your Majesty, you have to try on the clothes to know if they fit.

208
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
If they don't fit, then I can still alter them overnight.

209
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,400
I said it's not necessary. Do you not understand?

210
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,500
I have other matters to attend to.

211
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,700
Your Majesty, did I upset you?

212
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,000
I spoke too harshly just now. I have something on my mind.

213
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,300
Don't take it to heart.

214
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,200
Your Majesty, don't feel bad. I don't blame you.

215
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,000
I know that you have someone else in your heart.

216
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,400
I don't presume to win your love.

217
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,600
It's just that, could Your Majesty not push me away?

218
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,000
Because in the palace,

219
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,800
I only have Your Majesty as a relative.

220
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,800
I'll try the clothes on, and let's see if they fit.

221
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,300
Your Majesty.

222
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,400
Be careful.

223
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,100
Your Majesty, were you looking for me?

224
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,300
Bring the things here.

225
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,200
I really like the New Year's gift you had His Majesty send me.

226
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,800
Gifts should be reciprocated. These are all for you.

227
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,600
All for me? Thank you, Your Majesty.

228
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
- Do you like it?
- I do.

229
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,900
Fu Xiao. You are now a court lady.

230
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,400
You can't be as impetuous as before.

231
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,100
Your every word and action represent the entire Southern Kingdom.

232
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,200
You must be careful and cautious.

233
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,200
I understand, Your Majesty.

234
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,000
Your Majesty, are you still using that Dark-Green Imperial Incense?

235
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,300
The fragrances the princess gave during the banquet,

236
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,200
were taken away by my elder brother.

237
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,700
I was thinking of asking His Majesty for some more.

238
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,800
Coincidentally, Grand Empress Dowager also came asking for some.

239
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,600
So, my elder brother made his own decision by giving the fragrances

240
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,800
that His Majesty gave me to the Grand Empress Dowager.

241
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,200
Lord Xiao has always been most fond of you.

242
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,700
He gives you whatever you ask for.

243
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,800
How could he bear to let you give away the Dark-Green Imperial Incense this time?

244
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,500
I don't know if it's because our father passed away.

245
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,700
My elder brother has become more cautious in his actions.

246
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,200
Your Majesty, then I shall take my leave first.

247
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,400
There are still matters to attend at the Azure Garden.

248
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,900
I'll come to see you again in a few days.

249
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,200
Go ahead.

250
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

251
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,200
Your Majesty, I'll be leaving.

252
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
Be careful.

253
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Xiao Quan took away Her Majesty's fragrance.

254
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,900
And then he gave Her Majesty's fragrance to Grand Empress Dowager.

255
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,200
This is just too inconceivable.

256
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,700
Don't you think there's something going on here?

257
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,900
Grand Empress Dowager is Her Majesty's grandmother.

258
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,500
It makes sense that Xiao Quan wants Her Majesty to be respectful.

259
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,000
This can't be. That evil man Xiao Quan likes Her—

260
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,720
What do you mean, "Xiao Quan likes Her Majesty"?

261
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,000
I discovered it unintentionally.

262
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,500
So, it means that whatever Her Majesty wants, he will surely give it to her.

263
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,800
Even if he doesn't have it, he will find a way to give it to her.

264
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,400
But this time, Xiao Quan actually gave the thing his sister wanted to someone else.

265
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,200
If it's really as you say,

266
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,500
Xiao Quan should have long known there was poison in this fragrance.

267
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,460
Commander Yan.

268
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,600
Her Highness is calling you to write couplets together.

269
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,799
I'm going too.

270
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,599
But Her Highness didn't ask for you to go.

271
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,640
Don't worry. I'll handle it and be back soon.

272
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,260
That woman dares to steal my man.

273
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,580
Just you wait.

274
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,400
Princess Jiayang dares to steal my man.

275
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,664
Princess Jiayang dares to steal our people.

276
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:44,520
- Do you two agree?
- No.

277
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,459
Keep your voices down.

278
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,920
Actually, I have a plan.

279
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,100
A plan to get rid of the fate of Commander Yan's arranged marriage.

280
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,000
Tell us.

281
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I plan to…

282
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:08,199
In doing so, Commander Yan won't leave us to go to Ning Kingdom.

283
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:11,780
- Brilliant!
- Clever, isn't it?

284
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:13,880
Isn't this framing someone?

285
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,680
No, I think it's not bad.

286
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
This "kill two birds with one stone" strategy of mine,

287
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,680
will not only save Commander Yan, but also get rid of Xiao Quan.

288
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,040
- How nice.
- That's right.

289
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,880
So, what do you say? Are we doing this or not?

290
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,588
Let's do it.

291
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:29,000
- Let's do it.
- All right.

292
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,920
Then, we'll take action on New Year's Eve tomorrow.

293
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,020
Come on, put some effort into it.

294
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,668
Boss!

295
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,879
I said I can't do this. They insist on dragging me into this.

296
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:49,660
I have a dinner engagement. I don't have much time left; I must go first.

297
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,324
You…

298
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,219
Boss, I think we can pull this off.

299
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,940
I have the same dinner engagement as Jiao.

300
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,240
Jiao, wait for me.

301
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,612
You…

302
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,680
I'm going to sleep.

303
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,900
That's my room.

304
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,292
Aren't you going back to sleep?

305
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:23,079
- Your plan…
- No plan, the plan is canceled.

306
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,240
Everyone here is good people.

307
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,939
Very good, then off to sleep then.

308
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,839
Then wake me up tomorrow morning.

309
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,060
We'll stick spring couplets together.

310
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,980
Okay.

311
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,580
I'll do it.

312
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,380
- His handwriting is really good, look.
- A bit higher.

313
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,492
This is well written.

314
00:22:54,492 --> 00:22:56,140
To the left, a bit more to the left.

315
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,240
Okay.

316
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,304
Stick it again.

317
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,428
Apply a bit more glue.

318
00:22:59,428 --> 00:23:01,344
That's enough. How is it now?

319
00:23:01,344 --> 00:23:02,400
It's quite good now.

320
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,556
Good, looks nice.

321
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,839
All done?

322
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:15,939
All men are liars.

323
00:23:15,939 --> 00:23:17,520
Why is it like this?

324
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,479
You promised to wake me up to stick the Spring Festival couplets together.

325
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:24,200
Xiao Qiangzi, it was the princess who forbade us from waking you up.

326
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,559
She said that you've worked hard recently.

327
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,720
Today is New Year's Eve. She said you should rest well.

328
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,839
No, you guys are too naive.

329
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:33,419
She is just not well-intentioned.

330
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,200
Where is Yan Changyun?

331
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,299
He went into the palace with Her Highness.

332
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:37,300
What are they doing in the palace?

333
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,960
What else to do? Have the New Year's Eve dinner, of course.

334
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,120
Today is New Year's Eve. A banquet is being hosted in the palace.

335
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,960
Then, why didn't they invite me?

336
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,839
Only officials of the second rank and above,

337
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,859
and the empresses are allowed to dine in the palace.

338
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,839
- You?
- You…

339
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,640
Then the two of you should go.

340
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,380
What if Yan Changyun is taken advantage of?

341
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,059
Her Highness made an announcement early on, and gave both of us a day off.

342
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:01,039
Conspiracy, all of these are conspiracies.

343
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,200
Then this New Year, it'll just be the three of us.

344
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,056
Don't count me in, I have to have dinner with my dad.

345
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:11,879
After so many years, it's the first time my dad is eating outside the palace.

346
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:13,540
It's all thanks to you.

347
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,019
Thanks, I'm off then.

348
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,359
So, what shall the two of us eat tonight?

349
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,920
Me? Who said I'm eating with you? I have plans.

350
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,400
Well… I'll eat by myself then.

Isn't this going to infuriate me?

374
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:18,860
No, Fu Xiao, you have to stay calm.

375
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,459
If it weren't for my Changyun protecting this capital city,

376
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:25,260
would everyone be as happy as they are now?

377
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,880
Of course not.

378
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,540
That's right! You're someone who does great things.

379
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,320
You are different from everyone else.

380
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,160
If he is occupied with official duties and has no time to find you, just go look for him.

381
00:26:38,219 --> 00:26:40,780
Changyun, I'm really happy to be out with you.

382
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,820
This is much livelier than Ning Kingdom.

383
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,480
Isn't this fate?

384
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,880
Changyun, the Southern Kingdom is truly flourishing.

385
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,080
If one day, Ning Kingdom can be like this, that would be great.

386
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,659
Ning Kingdom has an abundance of talents.

387
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:57,200
If everyone were as smart as Your Highness, naturally it wouldn't be difficult.

388
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,100
When the time comes to sign the trade agreement,

389
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,760
you'll have to come back to Ning Kingdom with me.

390
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,820
Once you become the prince consort, you must help me out.

391
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,380
Naturally.

392
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,300
You'd better not lie to me.

393
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,300
No one can escape the scrutiny of my eyes.

394
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,920
Just like this mask.

395
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,600
If one wants to take it off after wearing it for a long time,

396
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,219
then it's like peeling off a layer of skin. Right?

397
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,820
Look, is it pretty?

398
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,424
Yes.

399
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,540
Are you talking about me or the mask?

400
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,499
Of course, Your Highness is prettier.

401
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:59,540
For someone as confident as Your Highness, why care about my opinion?

402
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,860
I care about what the person I like says.

403
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:06,419
I don't find this place very amusing.

404
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,699
Let's go take a walk up ahead.

405
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,472
Look over there.

406
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,420
Fu Xiao!

407
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,440
How is it? Isn't it a pleasant surprise?

408
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,920
You didn't expect me to be here, did you?

409
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:36,079
What a surprise.

410
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:38,720
Fu Xiao, rest assured. I have already arranged everything.

411
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,120
First, we'll hit the city's south for spring blossoms, then catch a play.

412
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,060
Lastly, I'll take you for some delicious food.

413
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,559
I'll give you a perfect New Year's Eve.

414
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,119
No.

415
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:50,200
How dare you.

416
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,240
How dare you! Speak gently to Fu Xiao.

417
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,660
At this age.

418
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:03,100
Fu Xiao, wait for me.

419
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,100
Chu Yue, legend has it that on New Year's Eve,

420
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,039
if writing one's name on a blessing card and hanging it on intertwined branches

421
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:19,040
and make a wish under the tree, will make the wish come true next year.

422
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,679
If one seeks a fated-marriage relationship,

423
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:23,760
then tie the cards of both people to the intertwined branches,

424
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,379
then it would prove that these two people can be together for a lifetime.

425
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,880
What a coincidence, you two are here too.

426
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,359
I'm incognito.

427
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,140
Don't call me Your Majesty.

428
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,780
Greetings, Your—

429
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,419
I'm incognito.

430
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:49,840
Thank you, elder.

431
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,219
Who is this? Isn't this A'Cheng who has plans tonight?

432
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,119
Aren't I here for a date?

433
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,679
Fu Xiao, hang this on the branches and make a wish.

434
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,039
Then the wish will come true.

435
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:20,759
<i>[Xiao Qiangzi]</i>

436
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,956
Make a wish.

437
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:45,579
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

438
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:47,980
Commander Yan, you did that on purpose. Right?

439
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,360
Your Majesty, forgive me. I just wanted to make a wish with everyone.

440
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,799
I think you did it on purpose.

441
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,359
Your Majesty, Commander Yan has already said

442
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,559
that he just wanted to pray for blessings with everyone.

443
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,060
We should be magnanimous.

444
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,020
You're right, I'm generous and forgiving.

445
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,760
- Generous.
- Generous.

446
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:17,179
Princess Jiayang, why don't you try making a wish in our Southern Kingdom way?

447
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:22,119
Sure. I would like to experience the traditions of the Southern Kingdom.

448
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,880
Eunuch Feng, prepare a blessing plaque for Princess Jiayang.

449
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,640
Please, Your Highness.

450
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,599
Everyone, close your eyes and make a wish for Your Highness.

451
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,524
Close your eyes.

452
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,559
Princess Jiayang, even the budding branch is not precise.

453
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:24,340
Southern Kingdom has many other fun things.

454
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,880
As an envoy coming to the Southern Kingdom on New Year's Eve,

455
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,640
you must have a good time.

456
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,900
If Commander Yan doesn't take good care of you,

457
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,659
feel free to tell me, and I'll punish him.

458
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,320
Your Majesty, you must be joking.

459
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,460
Commander Yan is one in a thousand.

460
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,599
He takes extra care of me.

461
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,240
Commander Yan is doing quite well.

462
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,739
Your Majesty, isn't this all done according to your wishes?

463
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:56,759
Good, then Commander Yan will accompany the princess around.

464
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,680
Be sure to display the hospitality of a host.

465
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,420
There's no need to stay here with me.

466
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:05,680
Your Majesty, am I not accompanying Your Highness to visit the paired branches?

467
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,059
Commander Yan, I don't find this very interesting.

468
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:12,359
Why don't you accompany me over there for a look?

469
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:16,039
Commander Yan, why don't you go quickly?

470
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:32,959
You guys go have fun too.

471
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:36,799
I'm fine with just Fu Xiao accompanying me, go on.

472
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,256
Yes.

473
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:43,099
- Tianjiao. A'Cheng. Take me with you.
- Fu Xiao.

474
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:46,160
Fu Xiao, there're fireworks to watch.

475
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,040
Watch while eating.

476
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,720
Let's go.

477
00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:02,324
<i>[Yan Changyun, Xiao Qiangzi]</i>

478
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:09,780
Commander Yan. Commander Yan!

479
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,459
Such a festive day on Chinese New Year's Eve,

480
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:13,800
and you don't relax for even a moment, do you?

481
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,459
Aren't you taking advantage of it being just the two of us, and seizing the opportunity properly?

482
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:20,159
Your Highness, New Year's Eve is crowded and chaotic.

483
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,719
We should still go look for Your Majesty.

484
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,320
I'm afraid it's not Your Majesty that you're worried about. Right?

485
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:32,440
- Your Highness is overthinking it.
- Is that so?

486
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,380
Commander Yan, you tried everything you could to get close to me.

487
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,200
Just so I would like you.

488
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,750
Now, I'm willing to like you, yet you act so coy;

489
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,180
why is that?

490
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,800
Could it be that Commander Yan has other motives?

491
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:56,780
If that's the case, then I'll just speak frankly.

492
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,219
What secret does Your Highness's Dark-Green Imperial Incense really hide?

493
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:03,400
Do you want to know the truth?

494
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,719
Once the trade agreement is signed and you've returned with me to Ning Kingdom,

495
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:09,760
then I will tell you the secret of the Dark-Green Imperial Incense.

496
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:18,459
That depends on whether the trade agreement can be successfully signed.

497
00:35:18,459 --> 00:35:23,136
I have never failed to get what I want.

498
00:35:26,939 --> 00:35:28,728
Go ahead.

499
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,139
Your Highness, let's watch the fireworks.

500
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:40,239
Southern Kingdom's fireworks are no worse than the Dark-Green Imperial Incense.

501
00:36:08,256 --> 00:36:09,840
Your Highness!

502
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,440
Murder! Someone's been killed!

503
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:18,679
Your Highness.

504
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,800
Yan Changyun, how dare you?

505
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,960
What a coincidence, Lord Xiao.

506
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,980
Lord Xiao, why are you surrounding me,

507
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,239
and not going after the murderer?

508
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,439
The murderer must be caught.

509
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:18,580
But with Your Highness being killed, you can't escape blame.

510
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,500
- Arrest him!
- I'd like to see who dares.

511
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,760
The Ministry of Justice is working; those who obstruct us are treated as accomplices.

512
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,960
Arrest them all.

513
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,000
Stop!

514
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:47,639
Xiao Quan, let the Ministry of Justice to withdraw for me.

515
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,140
Your Majesty,

516
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,250
Commander Yan was ordered to protect Princess Jiayang.

517
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:56,760
Now that Princess Jiayang has been killed by an assassin,

518
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,000
if Commander Yan can't provide a reasonable explanation,

519
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,260
I fear that the Ning Kingdom will cause trouble.

520
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,960
If war breaks out again,

521
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,219
it's the people who will suffer.

522
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:12,539
<i>- Yes, indeed.
- How will we live if a war starts?</i>

523
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:13,920
<i>We are commoners...</i>

524
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,060
<i>Indeed, life would become unbearable.</i>

525
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,360
Your Majesty, I dare not to defy your orders.

526
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,159
But please, Your Majesty, think carefully.

527
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,599
Think carefully for the Southern Kingdom and for the people.

528
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:40,399
Your Majesty, the urgent matter is to catch the murderer as soon as possible.

529
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:42,520
What good does arresting Yan Changyun do?

530
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,120
He's merely settling personal scores under the guise of public affairs.

531
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,120
Lord Xiao!

532
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:01,440
I can go back with you to the Ministry of Justice for investigation,

533
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,080
and give an explanation to the people of the Southern Kingdom and the Ning Kingdom.

534
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,000
No, that won't do. How can things be made clear that way?

535
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Boss, don't listen to Xiao Quan.

536
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,519
Find out the truth as quickly as possible.

537
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:18,660
As long as an explanation is given to the Ning Kingdom,

538
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:23,380
then I believe Lord Xiao will certainly not make things difficult for me anymore.

539
