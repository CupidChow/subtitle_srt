21
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,459
<i>[Chancellor's Residence]</i> This Chancellor has died inexplicably.

22
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:39,440
- Who on earth did this?
- Haven't you heard?

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,600
It was the remnants of the Qin Family who killed Chancellor Xiao.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,800
Back then, someone saw the son of Duke Ding being rescued.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,439
Do you think it could be him?

26
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,279
- Qin Yan? Didn't he die a long time ago?
- That's right.

27
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:54,520
His body was never found back then; he might still be alive.

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,460
Move aside! The Thousand Feather Guards are on the case.

29
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,860
Commander Yan, you don't need to feign concern anymore.

30
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,900
You were the last person my father wanted to see when he was alive.

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,199
The body cannot be buried until the murderer is caught.

32
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,580
- Someone, take the Chancellor's body back to the Thousand Feather Guards.
<i>- Yes.</i>

33
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,380
Let's see who dares to lay a hand on it.

34
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:35,960
Lord Xiao, we are in charge of investigating the Chancellor's cause of death.

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,300
Only by examining the body can the truth be uncovered.

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,150
Ridiculous.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,950
My father was a first-rank Chancellor in his lifetime.

38
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,750
After his death, how can you allow such a great humiliation?

39
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,900
I'm simply acting in accordance with regulations.

40
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,940
Yan Changyun,

41
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,210
I have been patient with you time and time again.

42
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,260
Do not push me too far.

43
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,859
Lord Xiao, only by catching the real murderer

44
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:07,780
can we truly serve the Chancellor's memory and the Southern Kingdom's interests.

45
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,879
I hope you understand.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,010
Excuse the offense.

47
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,310
Take him away.

48
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,600
<i>If we were to open the coffin for an autopsy, I think the murderer could be found very quickly.</i>

49
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,080
<i>Yes! Who exactly is the murderer?</i>

<i>[Chancellor's Residence]</i>

51
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,679
<i>I say it's definitely from Duke Ding's lineage.</i>

52
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:30,952
<i>It must be.</i>

53
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,360
- Your Majesty.
- My beloved minister.

<i>[Emulating the Worthy]</i>

55
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,060
My beloved minister, please restrain your grief.

56
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,159
I know this is unfair to you, both emotionally and rationally.

57
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,240
But on second thought, Commander Yan is doing this

58
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,260
to find the murderer sooner and to avenge the Chancellor.

59
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:59,420
Your Majesty, my father devoted his life to the Southern Kingdom.

60
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,180
Yet after his death, he suffers such humiliation at the hands of Yan Changyun.

61
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,219
I suspect that Yan Changyun is not really investigating the case.

62
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:08,280
He has ulterior motives; he must be up to something else.

63
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,090
No, no!

64
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,360
Both you and Commander Yan are loyal subjects of the country.

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,999
The Chancellor has passed away.

66
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:21,740
I really can't bear to see the two of you fighting over this matter.

67
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,380
The court needs stability now more than ever.

68
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,460
Your Majesty, I understand.

69
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,780
But my father left behind the two characters "Guanyou" at the time of his murder.

70
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,300
This must be related to the remnants of Guanyou.

71
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,660
Yet he, Yan Changyun, doesn't investigate the remnants of Guanyou.

72
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,880
He took the body away for examination, while my father's body is still not cold.

73
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,600
I implore Your Majesty to seek justice for me.

74
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,799
What you say makes sense.

75
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:55,519
In that case, I'll draft an imperial edict immediately. Ordering Yan Changyun to return the body of the Chancellor.

76
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,720
So, the Chancellor may return to dust as soon as possible.

77
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,560
Thank you for your understanding, Your Majesty.

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,399
Come. My beloved minister, please rise.

79
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,100
Then I shall take my leave.

80
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,480
My beloved minister, please restrain your grief.

81
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,580
Boss, the several stabs on Xiao Wanli's chest were not forceful.

82
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,519
Only this one that pierced the heart is the fatal wound.

83
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,060
Not only was the force weak, but it was also very unprofessional.

84
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,216
What is this?

85
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,839
It appears to be the white makeup powder used by women.

86
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,059
Could it be that a woman killed Xiao Wanli?

87
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,680
Commander, a decree from His Majesty.

88
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,739
He orders us to return the Chancellor's body for burial.

89
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:27,600
Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday was the last time I saw my father.

90
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,120
Your Majesty, please do not be too sad.

91
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,319
Your crying makes my heart sour.

92
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,399
Actually, sometimes I feel very conflicted.

93
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,272
I have thought countless times.

94
00:06:45,024 --> 00:06:47,959
If it weren't for my father's relentless pressure,

95
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:52,739
would things be simpler for His Majesty?

With the Chancellor gone,

101
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:28,280
you can't even send him on his last journey as a daughter. Right?

102
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,550
The Chancellor was murdered,

103
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,360
and it's a special period.

186
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,299
Last night with Yan Changyun…

187
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:35,079
No way. It must have been a dream; a nightmare.

188
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:03,360
<i>Your Majesty, I am actually a woman.</i>

189
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,960
It's over.

190
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,079
Now Her Majesty knows I am a woman.

191
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:16,680
If Her Majesty tells His Majesty about this,

192
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:23,999
then what should I do?

193
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,772
Here.

194
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,040
Don't drink so much alcohol in the future. All right?

195
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,399
It's bad for your health. Be obedient.

196
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,000
Brother, you won't be like father, will you?

197
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
Coveting the power in His Majesty's hands?

198
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,200
No, don't worry about it.

199
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,019
Stop having wild thoughts.

200
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:18,520
Come, lie down and sleep a bit longer; I'll be with you.

201
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,000
Here.

202
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,240
<i>Her Majesty drank even more than I did last night.</i>

203
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,680
<i>She probably doesn't remember what happened.</i>

204
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,380
<i>No, I need to go and check.</i>

205
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:42,780
Heng'er, it won't be long before everything belongs to our Xiao Family.

206
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,470
When the time comes, you won't have to suffer anymore.

207
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,380
I promise.

208
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,119
<i>I have to tell His Majesty about this at once.</i>

209
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,900
<i>No, I can't tell.</i>

210
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,440
<i>Xiao Quan, that bad man, with such a sanctimonious face.</i>

211
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,379
<i>How dare he be disrespectful to Her Majesty, a crime worthy of death.</i>

212
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,960
<i>He deserves death, but Her Majesty is innocent.</i>

213
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,119
<i>If this royal scandal gets out,</i>

214
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,900
<i>not only would His Majesty lose dignity, but Her Majesty's life would also be in danger.</i>

215
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,800
What are you skulking around for?

216
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,500
<i>Who is skulking?</i>

217
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,910
Don't tell lies about me just because you're jealous of my good relationship with Her Majesty.

218
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,830
Don't tell lies about me just because you're jealous of my good relationship with Her Majesty.

219
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,680
<i>I'm jealous of you?</i>

220
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,870
Fine, let's just say I am.

221
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:37,400
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

222
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,839
Her Majesty got drunk last night and isn't feeling well.

223
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,699
I was worried about her, so I came to see her.

224
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:47,119
Who knew that just as I arrived, before I could go in, I was berated by you.

225
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,839
I feel aggrieved in my heart.

226
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,500
You have the nerve to say that?

227
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,480
Isn't Her Majesty unwell because of you?

228
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,300
You were the one insisting on her drinking heavily.

229
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,880
Lord Xiao, you're here too.

230
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,580
That's just perfect, you can judge who's right.

231
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,880
Her Majesty was feeling downhearted, I kindly accompanied her for a chat.

232
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,820
How did it end up being my fault?

233
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,840
Xue Ru, as a personal attendant to Her Majesty,

234
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,400
your every word and action represents Her Majesty's dignity.

235
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,519
How can you speak like this?

236
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,876
I know my mistake.

237
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:17,940
Leave.

238
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,584
Yes.

239
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,380
Since Eunuch Qiang is here, why not go in and see how Her Majesty is doing?

240
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:33,740
Lord Xiao, I just arrived at the door and ran into Xue Ru, who gave me an earful.

241
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,960
So, I haven't had the chance to go in and pay my respects yet.

242
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:42,200
<i>Xiao Qiangzi, you're here. Come in and chat with me.</i>

243
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,599
I'm coming right away.

244
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,720
<i>[Yunshao Bureau]</i>
<i>Young Master, please come inside.</i>

245
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,240
<i>Miss Lifen, did you miss me?</i>

246
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,544
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

247
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,620
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

248
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,799
<i>Come often.</i>

249
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,920
<i>You're willing to come back?</i>

250
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,160
<i>Haven't seen you in a few days, your hands have become more delicate.</i>

251
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,119
<i>Please come inside quickly, please come inside.</i>

252
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,140
When Chancellor Xiao was alive, we were always under his control.

253
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,220
Now, the sword hanging over our heads is broken.

254
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,119
What intentions do you gentlemen have?

255
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,180
With Chancellor Xiao gone, I am full of worries.

256
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,559
His Majesty is weak now.

257
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,599
The court is like a group of dragons without a head; a plate of loose sand.

258
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:54,599
This is not a long-term plan.

259
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,380
If you trust me, gentlemen, I'm willing to take this responsibility.

260
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,519
The power and status of all you gentlemen,

261
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:06,920
of course, are beyond question.

262
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,619
All the girls, get out.

263
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,392
Yes.

264
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,120
Lord Xiao.

265
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,640
Master Song, no need for excessive courtesy. Please sit down.

266
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,840
- My dear nephew…
- Sit down.

267
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:33,859
Inside, it says that you all formed factions, and evidence of corruption and bribery.
<i>[Liu Qingshan]</i>

268
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:35,100
<i>Evidence?</i>

269
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,504
I wonder, gentlemen, do you like the gift I brought today?

270
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,559
<i>[Liu Qingshan]</i>

271
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:48,379
Dear nephew, do you really think you can control us with this thing?

272
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:50,659
Isn't your thinking too simplistic?

273
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:56,480
Xue Ying, bring up the gift meant solely for Lord Liu.

274
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,932
Yes.

275
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,119
The honorable lady's jade ring is quite beautiful.

276
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:18,039
It's a pity it's stained with a bit of blood.

277
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:24,040
<i>You gentlemen must know what to do now. Right?</i>

278
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,940
Who was that girl?

279
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,740
The top courtesan here, Miss Chu Yue.

280
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,356
Chu Yue.

281
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,050
Yan Changyun's woman?

282
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,920
Go and check it out.

283
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,240
Commander, this kind of pastel comes from Wanhong County in Qingzhou.

284
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,960
It's top-quality among pastels, especially upscale.

285
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,280
Only three shops in the capital city sell it.

286
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,880
Some of the women in the harems of some high-ranking officials also use it.

287
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:06,240
The powder on Xiao Wanli should be this kind of pastel.

288
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,160
But there are still some subtle differences.

289
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,639
It seems to be mixed with something.

290
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,920
Is this kind of pastel a tribute?

291
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,519
Indeed, Qingzhou offers a tribute to the Imperial Palace every year.

292
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,039
Ladies of each palace will also receive a share.

293
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:24,200
If this case involves the imperial harem, I'm afraid it will be difficult to investigate.

294
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,580
Tianjiao, the Great Empress Dowager is your great-aunt.

295
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,340
It's more convenient for you to come and go from the imperial harem.

296
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,759
Investigate secretly who in the imperial harem is using this kind of pastel.

297
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,200
Yes.

298
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,000
Boss, Chu Yue has an urgent matter and wants to meet with you.

299
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,888
Young Master.

300
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,780
You're in such a rush to find me, what happened?

301
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,919
Today, I saw Liu Qingshan and several officials in Yunshao Bureau.

302
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,559
They were plotting how to take over the power of the Chancellor.

303
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,839
Later, Xiao Quan suddenly arrived.

304
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,680
I don't know what he said.

305
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,880
Those officials then backed down.

306
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,400
It seems that this Xiao Quan is really not simple.

307
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
I had underestimated him before.

308
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,260
Rest assured, Young Master, if they come to Yunshao Bureau again in the future,

309
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,880
I'll definitely keep an eye on them for you.

310
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,560
No, you must pretend to know nothing.

311
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,880
And don't get close to them again.

312
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,960
You must ensure your own safety, understand?

313
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,599
Then, I'll go first. Take care of yourself.

314
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,172
Be careful.

315
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,840
Sir, Chu Yue indeed went to see Yan Changyun.

316
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,079
I have also investigated; Chu Yue is the daughter of Lei Bao.

317
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,259
Yan Changyun.

318
00:26:55,259 --> 00:27:00,160
In the imperial court, he speaks in defense of the remnants of Guanyou at every turn.

319
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,140
The courtesan he takes care of in private is also the daughter of Lei Bao.

320
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,400
It seems that Yan Changyun is not simple at all.

321
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,680
Keep a close watch on Chu Yue for me.

322
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,028
Yes.

323
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,759
Sir, this is…

324
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,060
According to the coroner's report from the Thousand Feather Guards.

325
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,739
When my father was murdered, he had this kind of white colored powder on his body.

326
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:37,370
Currently, Wei Tianjiao is investigating this powder throughout the city.

327
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,580
However, to my knowledge, this type of powder,

328
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,459
besides being supplied to the royal family and the inner residences of the nobility,

329
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:48,459
has also appeared within Yunshao Bureau.

330
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,220
Yunshao Bureau?

331
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,030
Sir, do you suspect Chu Yue?

332
00:27:54,499 --> 00:28:00,264
If it's her, then consider it revenge for my father.

333
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:02,900
If it's not her,

334
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,599
then use this as a pretext to eliminate the remnants of Guanyou.

335
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,170
Yes.

336
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:16,919
Court officials nominate Minister Xiao for promotion and to ascend to the position of Ministry of Justice.

337
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,319
Minister Xiao, what are your thoughts on this?

338
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:26,244
Replying to Your Majesty. My father has just passed away.

339
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:28,659
My heart is filled with unspeakable sorrow.

340
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:33,359
Your Excellencies' expectations of me are also a sign of your grief for the former Chancellor.

341
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,119
I hereby express my gratitude.

342
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:46,260
Your Majesty, I believe the death of the Chancellor is murky and unclear.

343
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,656
Perhaps it is better for Your Majesty to decide after I have solved the murder case.

344
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:52,472
Your Majesty.

345
00:28:54,784 --> 00:28:57,764
Commander Yan's words are completely nonsensical.

346
00:28:57,764 --> 00:29:01,616
After the Chancellor passed away, not only is there a burden of heavy state affairs,

347
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:04,839
but it also leaves the vermilion silver powder a mystery.

348
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:08,920
Only by having Lord Xiao take over the Chancellor's unfinished matters,

349
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,520
can we console the spirit of Chancellor Xiao,

350
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,960
and rid Your Majesty of this great worry.

351
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,419
All the court officials believe so?

352
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:25,340
I humbly request Your Majesty's gracious approval.

353
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,920
<i>I earnestly request Your Majesty's gracious approval.</i>

354
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,000
<i>Minister Liu's recent remarks were truly brilliant.</i>

355
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,160
<i>My Lords flatter me.</i>

356
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,359
<i>I still have much to learn from Minister Liu.</i>

357
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,960
Secretary Xiao, congratulations.

358
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,720
<i>[All Under Heaven in Peace]</i>
I'm devoted to the country, despising private gain.

359
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,160
What is there to congratulate me for?

360
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,900
The Chancellor made a great fuss over investigating the vermilion silver powder,

361
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,800
yet died suddenly.

362
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,000
Aren't you afraid now that you're taking over?

363
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,400
Commander Yan and my father fought over the right to handle cases many times.

364
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,200
After which my father died in an unexplained manner,

365
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,500
and now you are obstructing me again.

366
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,720
The one who should be afraid...

367
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,700
is you. Am I right?

368
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,900
The vermilion silver powder case has led to consecutive murders in the Southern Kingdom.

369
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,200
If the Thousand Feather Guards can't find any results,

370
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,400
then I ask you to return the criminals taken from the Ministry of Justice back to me.

371
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,900
Since the Chancellor died,

372
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,300
Thousand Feather Guards' investigations have become unimpeded.

373
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,600
Now I need to go back and reward my brothers with a few jars of good wine.

374
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,000
Secretary Xiao, would you like to join?

375
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,100
- Your Majesty, all the officials are advocating for the country's uncle.
- Really?

376
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,900
Absolutely true! All the officials are advocating for the young master to take over the powers of the Chancellor.

377
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,700
Your Majesty, why are you not happy?

378
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
If the young master's position in court is secure,

379
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,100
can't you also reign supreme over the harem?

380
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,300
I fear that once my brother assumes a high position and wields great power,

381
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,700
he'll treat His Majesty the same way my father did.

382
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,000
Your Majesty, with the young master's strength,

383
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,300
he could already support half the realm of the Southern Kingdom.

384
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,500
Xue Ru, one must not speak carelessly.

385
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,400
How can the realm be divided into halves?

386
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,800
The Southern Kingdom has but one realm, and all of it belongs to His Majesty.

387
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,400
Xiao Qiangzi is right.

388
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,000
All of us in the Xiao Family belong to His Majesty.

389
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,800
I, myself, am even more so a person of His Majesty.

390
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,200
Your Majesty, since you already know, then…

391
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
What do you want to say?

392
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,400
Your Majesty, you are the empress of the harem.

393
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,000
Even if your elder brother, Lord Xiao, is close to you, he is still an outsider.

394
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,800
How bold of you, a mere eunuch, dare to incite discord between Her Majesty and the Uncle of the Nation.

395
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,500
Why do you become so talkative as soon as I mention Lord Xiao?

396
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,600
- I…
- Enough.

397
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,700
Why do you two start quarreling as soon as you meet?

398
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,500
Your Majesty, you should still avoid close contact with Lord Xiao.

399
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,200
It would not be good if His Majesty were to see.

400
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,200
The frequent comings and goings of Lord Xiao to the harem are already irregular.

401
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,500
And yet, you continue to associate closely with him regardless.

402
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:46,000
Even though you are siblings, you can't disregard the rules and ettiquette.

403
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,000
Lord Xiao.

404
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,600
You've seen it all.

405
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,300
Seen what?

406
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,100
I don't know what Lord Xiao is speaking of.

407
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,500
His Majesty has summoned me for matters, I shall leave now.

408
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,800
In this Imperial Palace, you've seen things that you shouldn't have seen,

409
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,900
and have said things you shouldn't have said.

410
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,000
Lord Xiao, I'm a person by His Majesty's side.

411
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,100
Commander Yan also holds me in great favor.

412
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,500
If I go missing, they will surely worry and come looking for me.

413
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,100
You should know, for me to kill a petty eunuch

414
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,600
is as easy as flipping my hand.

415
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,200
Murder is against the law.

416
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,700
The laws of the Southern Kingdom were all revised by my family.

417
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,800
Even if I break all the laws,

418
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,400
what can be done to me?

419
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,400
Lord Xiao, I admit I have seen it all.

420
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,000
But I assure you, I won't speak of it.

421
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,400
Why should I believe you?

422
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,200
Her Majesty is my friend.

423
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,400
I know that speaking of this matter will have a great impact on her.

424
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm a person who values loyalty and righteousness.

425
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,300
I would not do anything to harm my own friends.

426
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,500
If you don't believe me, I can swear an oath.

427
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,470
All right,

428
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,800
I will believe you this time.

429
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,800
However, you must keep this secret.

430
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,300
Thank you, Lord Xiao.

431
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,310
Fu Xiao.

432
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,800
Fu Xiao. Fu Xiao.

433
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,300
I too had no other choice.

434
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,800
When you wake up, you are free to beat or scold me as you please.

435
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,000

Come, quickly! Imperial Physician Qu, hurry!

436
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,600
Okay.

437
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,400
Here.

438
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,199
- Boss.
- Boss.

439
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,900
Boss, Imperial Physician Qu has arrived.

440
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,000
A'Cheng, you stand guard at the door.

441
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,400
Tianjiao, go to the place where Xiao Qiangzi had the incident and see if there are any clues.

442
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

443
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,300
Imperial Physician Qu, please examine and treat promptly.

444
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,300
Okay, rest assured! I have brought the best healing ointment.

445
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,900
Wait...

446
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,200
You're the smartest person in this palace.

447
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,000
You know what should and shouldn't be said.

448
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,800
Remember, today you are treating the injury for a eunuch.

449
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,700
Even if Your Majesty asks,

450
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,400
she too is a eunuch, do you understand?

451
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,100
Understood.

452
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,480
Your Majesty, Eunuch Qiang has had an accident!
