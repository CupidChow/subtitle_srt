00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,280
Let me introduce to you. This is Xiao Qiangzi.

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,620
Starting today, he's a member

23
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,980
Hello, everyone, I'm Xiao Qiangzi.

24
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm grateful for the care of Commander Yan.

25
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,620
He personally promoted me to join the Thousand Feather Guards.

26
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,100
Please look after me in the future.

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,000
Why is he so short?

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,600
He looks effeminate, not at all like a man.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,700
Exactly! Our Thousand Feather Guards are selected through a rigorous process.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,300
Clearly, someone like him doesn't qualify.

31
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,100
He couldn't possibly be here just to make up the numbers, could he?

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,700
Report, I was once a minor eunuch.

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,519
That explains it.

34
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,108
- All right, Xiao Qiangzi. Back in line.
- I'm here. Okay.

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
To accommodate Xiao Qiangzi,

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,940
let's start with the basics today.

37
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,280
Start with a rapid 30-li march with a heavy load.

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,088
<i>Okay!</i>

39
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:43,579
Quickly follow!

40
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,132
- Xiao Qiangzi.
- I can't do it.

41
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:51,650
You can't disgrace the Thousand Feather Guards.

42
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,380
Keep up!

43
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,670
If I keep running like this, I'll lose my life.

44
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,200
You guys go on.

45
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,800
Boss, there's a deserter from the Thousand Feather Guards!

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,970
Your Majesty!

47
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,200
Your Majesty!

48
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:18,740

<i>[Miaoyin Pavilion]</i>
Xiao Qiangzi, Your Majesty isn't here.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,400
How is that possible?

51
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,616
You're here; how could he possibly not be?

52
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:27,379
- Your Majesty. Your Majesty...
- It's true.

53
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:30,399
Where else would you hide?

54
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm not hiding.

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,000
I was so worried when you were ill the other day.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,500
You worried about me?

57
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,670
Do you not hate me?

58
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,570
That day, I did nothing to save you.

59
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:49,100
I knew it! Why would I hate you?

60
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,339
You have it much harder than me in this Imperial Palace.

61
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:54,700
You have to manage the court and look after the harem.

62
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,760
And also deal with numerous officials.

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,220
Plus, I know that your throne seems comfortable, but it's a restraint.

64
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,000
I understand, I'm not such a petty person.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,799
Xiao Qiangzi, you're too kind.

66
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,939
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Commander Yan, what brings you here?

67
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,900
I heard someone left without permission to avoid training.

68
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,600
Commander Yan, indeed, how could there be such a person?

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I came here to catch that person.

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,100
If I catch that person, I'll certainly beat him to death.

71
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,700
Once found, beat him to death.

72
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,079
Your Majesty, he wants to kill me.

73
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,500
Misunderstanding, Commander Yan. I allowed Xiao Qiangzi to come over.

74
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:54,940
Your Majesty, what if I tell everyone that Xiao Qiangzi left on his own to avoid training,

75
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,340
and it was permitted by Your Majesty.

76
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,500
Then, how should I lead the Thousand Feather Guards from now on,

77
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,000
and how do I protect Your Majesty?

78
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,930
That...

79
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,288
Xiao Qiangzi, I can only wrong you.

80
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:11,676
- Your Majesty.
- I'll come to see you.

81
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:18,340
Commander Yan, I can explain.

82
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,800
I really didn't mean to avoid the training.

83
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,420
Then, it was intentional.

84
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,100
Commander Yan, it's only my first day. Give me a break, will you?

85
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Then I can be in a good mood, and it would make training more enjoyable for me.

86
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,380
Moreover, I find the training of the Thousand Feather Guards

87
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,804
to have many unreasonable aspects.

88
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:44,739
- For example?
- For instance, running 30 miles in one go,

89
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:48,520
you'd have a broken waist and a fractured leg.

90
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,759
And it depletes one's energy, making the body stink.

91
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,660
How can everyone continue training after that?

92
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,180
You do have a point.

93
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,800
Right? So, I think the training of the Thousand Feather Guards

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,900
should mainly aim to enhance the soldiers' cohesion. Emphasizing love.

95
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,639
Well, if that's the case,

96
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,499
then why not show some love and dedication to your colleagues?

97
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,700
You eat after you finish washing.

98
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,620
No, it's too much. What a tired a fool.

99
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,680
If you can't finish washing, you'll be punished by military law.

100
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,880
Anyway, he just told me to wash the clothes.

101
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,199
He didn't say they had to be clean.

102
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,060
At night, I'll just wet the clothes, and give them to him.

103
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,070
He won't know if I washed them or not.

104
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,400
I'm so clever.

- Stop right there,

00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,720
Can you give me another one?

172
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,939
I've only taken one; I'm still far from being detoxified.

173
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:46,510
I always feel particularly uneasy.

174
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,730
Of course, I do.

175
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:49,520
Really? That's great.

176
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,740
Ten taels of silver per pill.

177
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,160
Commander Yan, you're the commander of the Thousand Feather Guards.

178
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,519
You shouldn't be short of this amount of money. Right?

179
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,800
If you don't have the money, you can also take it on credit.

180
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,779
Fifteen taels of silver each.

181
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,200
The money you owe me incurs three percent interest daily.

182
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:15,100
Then I'll just find my own way to make money.

183
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,028
Whatever suits you.

184
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:26,200
<i>[Duke Wei Mansion]</i>

185
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,160
It's just a bowl.

186
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,410
Sailing across the ocean to Ning Kingdom,

187
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,020
and it can sell for three hundred taels.

188
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,340
With such scrutiny now, are you not concerned for your life?

189
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,479
Rest assured; my route is guaranteed to be foolproof.

190
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:46,600
On the surface, it all looks like ordinary business.

191
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,799
You provide the funds, and I provide the effort.

192
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,340
This undertaking will definitely yield a lot of money.

193
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,620
The brave will die of overeating, and the timid will die of starvation.

194
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,480
I provide the funds, and you provide the effort,

195
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,224
but this profit…

196
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:02,920
You take 70 percent, and I'll take 30 percent.

197
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,920
Master, the young master has returned.

198
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,920
- Okay, then I'll be leaving.
- Go on.

199
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,539
Dad, I'm back.

200
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,372
- Son.
- Dad.

201
00:16:23,372 --> 00:16:26,920
Son, I missed you so much, you're finally back.

202
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,710
It's strange that you haven't been drinking today.

203
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:34,920
- Can't I have some serious matters?
- Of course.

204
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,280
What are you conspiring now with Aunt Chen's cheap brother?

205
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,919
My boy.

206
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,159
You're the only one who dares to joke with me like this.

207
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,200
By the way, the city hasn't been very peaceful lately.

208
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,840
Yan Changyun is making a big fuss, searching here and there.

209
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,419
Don't you foolishly follow him.

210
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,600
Our commander is always at the forefront.

211
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,479
Of course, the Thousand Feather Guards must be invincible wherever the sword points.

212
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,740
The usual rule, 500 taels.

213
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,160
If the Thousand Feather Guards are so good,

214
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,940
why are you still coming home for money?

215
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,332
Let me tell you. I kept a lucrative position for you in the Ministry of Revenue.

216
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:13,340
You should be well aware.

217
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,580
Dad, I don't care about any of that.

218
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,680
What I care about is establishing achievements and making a name for myself.

219
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,279
Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

220
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:22,359
Remember to pack the money, I'm leaving.

221
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,080
Tianjiao.

222
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,168
<i>[Yunshao Bureau]</i>

223
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,240
Brother Chen, the amount is quite large this time.

224
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,350
Can you handle it?

225
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,419
Are you afraid I can't pay?

226
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:50,980
That's not what I meant.

227
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,924
My brother-in-law is Duke Wei.

228
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:55,488
Do I look like someone who lacks money?

229
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,500
Take away Fang You and Chen Juncai.

230
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,340
<i>- Who are you guys?
- What are you doing?</i>

231
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,950
Let's go!

232
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,170
- Behave!
- Let me go!

233
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,859
Be good for me, move it.

234
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:11,060
You've got the wrong person, haven't you?

235
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,900
On what grounds are you arresting me?

236
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,160
Do you know who I am?

237
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,060
Where did this vermilion silver powder come from?

238
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,390
What vermilion silver powder?

239
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,650
I know nothing about it.

240
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,659
It seems you don't know where you are.

241
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:35,648
- Yan Changyun, what are you going to do?
- Boss.

242
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,820
Are you going to beat me until I confess?

243
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,330
Don't come any closer!

244
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,280
What are you going to do? Don't be like this.

245
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,699
Do you know who I am?

246
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,319
I'll confess, I confess everything.

247
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,900
I partnered with Duke Wei'sbrother-in-law on this.

248
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,512
The vermilion silver powder is in Drinking Horse Alley.

249
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:06,730
<i>[All Under Heaven in Peace]</i>

250
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:18,240
Your Majesty, this is my investigation into the clues of the vermilion silver powder.

251
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,680
The imperial treasury silver was found in Drinking Horse Alley.

252
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,599
By law, the imperial treasury silver can't be circulated in society.

253
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,620
Today, it appears in the den of vermilion silver powder seller.

254
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,639
Yan Changyun, don't talk nonsense.

255
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:34,780
You need to understand. How can this be treasury silver?

256
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,240
That is clearly a set-up.

257
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,460
Duke Wei makes a valid point.

258
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,619
Since the case is significant and involves a lot of people,

259
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:47,380
Your Majesty should do a thorough examination of the imperial treasury and the silver,

260
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,020
and restore Duke Wei's innocence.

261
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,599
Innocence?

262
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,139
The imperial treasury silver has always been managed by Duke Wei's Ministry of Revenue.

263
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:59,699
How did it end up in the transaction of vermilion silver powder?

264
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:04,260
Your Majesty, in my opinion, his innocence cannot be restored.

265
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,860
What do you mean by that?

266
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,699
How could I possibly use treasury silver to deal in vermilion silver powder?

267
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:11,560
This is embezzlement.

268
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,519
Even if I were foolish, I couldn't be foolish to this extent.

269
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,980
Upon investigating the vermilion silver powder, it led straight to me.

270
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,140
You say this without thinking it through.

271
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,739
This is clearly an act of personal spite.

272
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:25,500
Your Majesty. Honorable officials.

273
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,540
Many years ago, Duke Ding and Qin Wenzhong,

274
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,050
also widely used vermilion silver powder in the army.

275
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,479
Thus, the more unlikely a person seems on the surface, the greater the suspicion.

276
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:42,390
Your Majesty!

277
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,510
I'm innocent!

278
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,259
All of them want to harm me.

279
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:52,140
I request Your Majesty to conduct a thorough investigation.

280
00:20:57,459 --> 00:21:01,720
Your Majesty, the duke has always been diligent and earnest,

281
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,040
and devoted to the Southern Kingdom without a second thought.

282
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,000
Baseless speculations in court could distress the ministers.

283
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:14,140
I respectfully request Your Majesty to order an investigation before deciding.

284
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,540
Your Majesty, please instruct Commander Yan to investigate,

285
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,820
and I'll fully cooperate.

286
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,088
Since this is the case, Commander Yan,

287
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:26,239
I order you to thoroughly investigate this matter as soon as possible

288
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,248
I accept the decree.

289
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,590
Boss, why are you doing this?

290
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,250
Where's Xiao Qiangzi?

291
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,684
Don't worry about him for now.

292
00:21:52,684 --> 00:21:55,599
- How is the investigation on Duke Wei's side going?
- Duke Wei was quite cooperative.

293
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,000
I checked all his cash transactions and found no connection with vermilion silver powder.

294
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,230
- Have the account books been checked?
- We weren't allowed to inspect the account books at his residence.

295
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,040
- Have the account books been checked?
- We weren't allowed to inspect the account books at his residence.

296
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,400
Then we'll have to find a way to search his residence.

297
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,259
You mean to sneak into Wei Mansion?

298
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:14,060
Wei Mansion is heavily guarded; it's going to be tough.

299
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,368
Come here.

300
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:26,420
Xiao Qiangzi? I won't go and say it.

301
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,820
Aren't you on good terms with the commander?

302
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,840
- If you don't speak up, who will?
- I won't go.

303
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,180
- I won't go.
- If you don't go, then forget it.

304
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,259
What are you guys talking about?

305
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,000
The military pay for this month can't be issued again.

306
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,499
It's been three months without military pay.

307
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:43,559
There's no pay for the Thousand Feather Guards?

308
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,630
Then...

309
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,120
Does this mean Yan Changyun has embezzled it?

310
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,260
I knew he wasn't a good person.

311
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,959
He embezzled even the military pay, right, Chang Sheng?

312
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:56,920
That's not right.

313
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,140
Commander Yan is upright and cares for his subordinates.

314
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,760
- He has always scorned money.
- Yes.

315
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,800
- He is definitely not that kind of person.
- True.

316
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,880
Nonsense! You've all been deceived by him.

317
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,560
People like him…

318
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,480
What's wrong?

319
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,520
Commander Yan, besides being upright,

320
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,720
he's also talented, handsome, and charming.

321
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,259
Why don't you all mention that?

322
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,219
Commander Yan, when will the military pay be issued?

323
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,060
The military pay is managed by the Ministry of Revenue, I'm powerless here.

324
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,800
However, I can think of a way to help you, and have it distributed to you guys as soon as possible.

325
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,659
However, I can think of a way to help you, and have it distributed to you guys as soon as possible.

326
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:40,340
Since you are so anxious, then how about this?

327
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,979
Let's have a small contest today.

328
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:45,800
If you can withstand ten moves from me,

329
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,860
I'll reward 100 taels of silver.

330
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,810
<i>A hundred taels?</i>

331
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,400
<i>That's enough to buy antidotes for at least a year.</i>

332
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:57,590
What do you say?

333
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,860
A'Cheng, 100 taels.

334
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,400
I heard but who can defeat the boss? Can you?

335
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,490
That's true.

336
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,510
Who among you will fight me?

337
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,380
Since none of you dares to challenge, then I'll leave.

338
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,460
Commander Yan!

339
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,860
Commander Yan, aren't you deliberately avoiding paying out the money?

340
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,019
Who can last ten moves against you?

341
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:23,880
All right then,

342
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,580
five moves should be okay.

343
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,400
I'll fight with you.

344
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,890
Three moves. Three moves to decide the winner.

345
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,640
How about it?

346
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:39,279
Three moves, huh?

347
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,760
If you're still on the stage within three moves, then you win.

348
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,584
Come on.

349
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,039
- Aren't you being a rogue?
- Exactly.

350
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,840
This is my technique of movement, you wouldn't understand.

351
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,400
One move.

352
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,536
Two moves now.

353
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,120
Three moves.

354
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,020
Pay up.

355
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,759
Wait until the military pay is issued, then go to the accounting office to collect it.

356
00:25:42,072 --> 00:25:45,290
<i>[Thousand Feather Guards]</i>

357
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:48,640
Next.

358
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,100
Next.

359
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,720
Next.

360
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,659
Just two taels.

361
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:02,000
Thousand Feather Guards Xiao Qiangzi's military pay is two taels, with a bonus of 100 taels.

362
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,259
In total, 102 taels.

363
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:06,104
All gone.

364
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,759
- What does that mean?
- Gone means gone.

365
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,140
The national treasury is empty now, and the military pay is insufficient.

366
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,939
102 taels, there's not even two taels left.

367
00:26:15,939 --> 00:26:18,740
What do you mean? Why is it all gone when it comes to me?

368
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,300
- What are you doing? Let go.
- I won't.

369
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,979
- Let go!
- I…

370
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:24,960
What do you think this place is?

371
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,340
You want money, right?

372
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,040
Fine! If you have the guts, go and ask Duke Wei.

373
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,580
You think I don't dare. Duke Wei?

374
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,560
Wei Tianjiao.

375
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,510
Leave it.

376
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,559
Duke Wei is your father.

377
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,759
You have to give us an explanation for this.

378
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,816
A father is a father, a son is a son; if there's an issue, don't come to me.

379
00:26:46,816 --> 00:26:48,580
- If we don't come to you, who do we go to?
- Exactly.

380
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,350
If it weren't for your father having embezzled all the money,

381
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,919
how could it be possible that we can't get paid for 3 months?

382
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,860
<i>- That's right.
- Definitely.</i>

383
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,500
If you ask me, Xiao Qiangzi, this money should be claimed from Duke Wei's residence.

384
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,979
Exactly! Xiao Qiangzi, we support you.

385
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:01,599
<i>- We support you!</i>
- Thank you, brothers.

386
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,100
100 taels, that's enough for several years of your military pay.

387
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,960
Exactly!

388
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,639
Maybe just forget it, Xiao Qiangzi surely wouldn't dare.

389
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:12,120
- After all, it's Duke Wei.
- Duke Wei.

390
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,380
Xiao Qiangzi, I think you should just accept it.

391
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,959
- Right, there's nothing to be done about it.
- Exactly.

392
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:21,000
No way! Why should I have to suffer this loss?

393
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,960
I am laying it out here today.

394
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,200
I must get this money back today.

395
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
Brothers, let's stick together.

396
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,184
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- You guys…

397
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:31,219
Xiao Qiangzi, stop fanning the flames here.

398
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:33,240
Did I say something wrong?

399
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,560
We brothers train so hard every day and work hard.

400
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,740
Yet our pay is still unfairly withheld.

401
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,620
I can hardly make ends meet.

402
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,440
All the brothers have families to support.

403
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,960
- Can we afford to have this money delayed?
<i>- We can't.</i>

404
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,000
We can't delay. Not a single payment of our salary in three months.

405
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,508
Even when paid, so much is deducted.

406
00:27:52,508 --> 00:27:54,140
- Is it fair?
<i>- No, it's not fair.</i>

407
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,699
- Do we want this money or not?
<i>- We do.</i>

408
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:57,160
- Let's go and get our money.
<i>- Let's go.</i>

409
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,208
- Get out of the way.
- Xiao Qiangzi.

410
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,599
- Move away.
- Let's go.

411
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,332
Let's go.

412
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,200
- Yan Changyun.
- What do you want?

413
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,150
What do I want?

414
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,010
You tell me why we're here today…

415
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,260
Come here.

416
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,104
Yes, I saw it just now too.

417
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:28,240
That's what you just mentioned.

418
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,319
It's that one? Yes.

419
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,359
Where did it fly off to?

420
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:34,750
Commander Yan.

421
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,780
Boss.

422
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,240
Nothing much, just wanted to report something to you.

423
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,040
It's about the military pay.

424
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,639
You see, our brothers have been bullied to this extent.

425
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:50,559
You can't just ignore it.

426
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:56,159
The treasury is empty. How can I get so much silver?

427
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,410
I've tried my best.

428
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,079
They all say that the money was taken by Duke Wei.

429
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,820
Then you should go and demand it back.

430
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,559
Duke Wei is all-powerful,

431
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,839
but he can't eat the meat and leave us without even the bones.

432
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,920
I can't do anything about this matter.

433
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,300
If any of you want money,

434
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,240
then you can ask Duke Wei for it yourselves.

435
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:28,840
Look! Nobody is going.

436
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,879
I can't step in either; after all, it's Duke Wei.

437
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:34,159
I think you should give up on your money for now.

438
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,359
Or wait until the treasury is replenished, and I'll fight for you then.

439
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,479
Don't, Boss.

440
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:44,640
Settling today's business today is a fine tradition of our Southern Kingdom.

441
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,044
Then, how about this?

442
00:29:46,044 --> 00:29:48,840
Just give the order, and I'll take our brothers to demand it.

443
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,939
We'll surely get the military pay back.

444
00:29:51,939 --> 00:29:53,480
About this…

445
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,640
Believe me, I can take it back.

446
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,740
I can do it.

447
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:02,720
All right then, I'll have A'Cheng fully cooperate with you.

448
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,939
But you mustn't cause trouble, and avoid getting yourself hurt.

449
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:08,519
Rest assured, I always persuade others with reason.

450
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,559
What about Wei Tianjiao?

451
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,140
Don't worry, I'll have Tianjiao carry out other official duties.

452
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,110
I will definitely not let him hinder you.

453
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,000
Thank you, Commander. I'm off.

454
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,059
Brothers, let's go!

455
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:24,759
<i>Let's go!</i>

456
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:28,619
Why did you arrange for Xiao Qiangzi to make trouble?

457
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:32,840
He is the indispensable leader. He has His Majesty as his backing.

458
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,140
Even if something goes wrong, His Majesty can save his life.

459
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,880
We can't let the brothers of the Thousand Feather Guards take risks.

460
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,860
You're so wise. I'll be leaving then.

461
00:30:43,768 --> 00:30:47,380
<i>[Duke Wei Mansion]</i>

462
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,160
Brothers, we must follow orders later.

463
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,580
Follow my arrangements, try to persuade others with reason.

464
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,940
Return the military pay owed to Thousand Feather Guards.

465
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,580
- Come to cause trouble?
- No.

466
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,010
Today, we mainly want to meet with Lord Duke.

467
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,460
Please report this.

468
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,780
Just say that the soldiers of the Thousand Feather Guards are here.

469
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,539
Today, we are here to seek justice for the Thousand Feather Guards.

470
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,340
How dare you!

471
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,720
My Duke is not to be discussed recklessly by you.

472
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,359
Do you think you can bully the Thousand Feather Guards?

473
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,979
- Erniu.
- Spit out what you've eaten from us.

474
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,700
Give back what you owe us. Tell Duke Wei to come out here.

475
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,739
<i>Come out!</i>

476
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,659
All of you, quiet down.

477
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,640
We agreed to come and state the facts and make our case.

478
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,419
How can you guys be so reckless?

479
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,880
Who dares to cause trouble in front of my residence?

480
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,200
Do you not want to live anymore?

481
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,710
I pay my respects to Lord Duke.

482
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:43,090
I'm Xiao Qiangzi, His Majesty's personal eunuch.

483
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:46,260
I currently serve in the Thousand Feather Guards.

484
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,900
We don't intend to cause trouble.

485
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:53,920
We just want to discuss the Thousand Feather Guards' military pay

486
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,800
Who are you to discuss matters with me?

487
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,300
Drive them all away.

488
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,804
Get out!

489
00:32:00,804 --> 00:32:03,159
<i>- They're hitting people!</i>
- They didn't!

490
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:05,019
- Come on.
- Brothers, avenge Xiao Qiangzi.

491
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:07,540
Don't go!

492
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,339
Don't go!

493
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:12,550
Oh, my goodness!

494
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:16,310
Calm down a bit!

495
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,080
<i>Come here, someone!</i>

496
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,219
<i>[Exhausting Loyalty and Wisdom]</i>
Go, quick. There's trouble in the mansion.

497
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:21,979
- Hurry over there.
- Quick, follow up!

498
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:24,050
<i>- Go, let's head over there.
- This way, come with me that way.</i>

499
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,110
<i>- We'll split up.
- Go!</i>

00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,690

<i>[Ceramic Jade Vase, one; Colored Glaze Jade Bowls, a pair]</i>

504
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,720
- There's no vermilion silver powder?
- No.

505
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:47,720
Could it be that Duke Wei really has no connection with the vermilion silver powder?

506
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,200
However, I found a large amount of stored silver in the secret room.

507
00:33:56,932 --> 00:33:59,784
Where's Xiao Qiangzi? He must have run away during the fight.

508
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:01,799
I'm afraid he won't come back.

509
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,260
No, he still needs to get the antidote from me.

510
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,530
He'll come back obediently.

511
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,219
Boss! Boss, something's wrong!

512
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:16,759
Chang Sheng and the others fought Duke Wei and got caught.

513
00:34:16,759 --> 00:34:19,660
Now they're all saying that you instigated it.

514
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:23,919
What? Didn't you solemnly assure me that there would absolutely be no trouble?

515
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:25,710
I tried to persuade them at that time.

516
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,200
I told them they must reason with others.

517
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,170
Best to use our mouths than to use our hands.

518
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,070
But they wouldn't listen to me.

519
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,280
They were particularly aggressive and started fighting right away.

520
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,719
I couldn't stop them at all.

521
00:34:41,028 --> 00:34:42,559
Is that so?

522
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,260
A'Cheng was there too; you ask him.

523
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:49,480
It was chaotic with so many people around;

524
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,190
I only saw him running away.

525
00:34:52,196 --> 00:34:54,052
I mean…

526
00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:57,860
How can you talk nonsense like that?

527
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,900
Boss, I really did try to stop them, but I couldn't.

528
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,099
I ran back because I came to tip you off.

529
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:07,920
I know only you can save our brothers.

530
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,560
How come you ran back, too?

531
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,880
I also came back to tip him off.

532
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,680
Boss, please save our brothers quickly.

533
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,920
Lives are at stake.

534
00:35:18,996 --> 00:35:20,419
<i>[Imperial Spring Palace]</i>

535
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:24,640
Auntie, your nephew is aggrieved.

536
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,540
The Thousand Feather Guards are so arrogant.

537
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,580
They are nothing more than simply bandits.

538
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,288
At my mansion, they beat people

539
00:35:33,288 --> 00:35:36,240
without asking any questions and were extremely cruel.

540
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,060
Auntie, you must stand up for me.

541
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,860
How preposterous!

542
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,780
Even the Thousand Feather Guards can't disregard the law.

543
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,679
Who told you to do this?

544
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,019
Grand Empress Dowager, I know my mistake. Grand Empress Dowager, spare my life.

545
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:05,779
Guards, take the ringleader, Xiao Qiangzi, out and behead him.

546
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:09,020
I… Commander Yan, please save me!

547
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,439
Imperial Grandmother, Xiao Qiangzi really did go too far this time,

548
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:15,979
but his crimes do not warrant death.

549
00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:20,440
I'll have him apologize to Duke Wei, and his death penalty will be spared.

550
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,640
Reporting to Grand Empress Dowager.

551
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,300
This matter can't be entirely blamed on Xiao Qiangzi.

552
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,439
The Thousand Feather Guards haven't received their military pay for three months.

553
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:32,499
Each time we report, the reason given is that the national treasury is empty.

554
00:36:32,499 --> 00:36:35,780
Everyone was forced to cause a disturbance at Duke Wei's mansion.

555
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:40,900
The emptiness of the national treasury isn't the sole responsibility of Duke Wei,

556
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:46,140
nor is it a reason for you to condone your subordinates to resort to violence at his doorstep.

557
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,440
Yan Changyun, as the leader of Thousand Feather Guards,

558
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,099
your subordinates doing such things shows your lack of supervision.

559
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:57,660
Grand Empress Dowager is right.

560
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,420
In that case, punish only me.

561
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,059
Please spare Xiao Qiangzi and the brothers of Thousand Feather Guards.

562
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:06,820
Yan Changyun and the Thousand Feather Guards were also left with no choice.

563
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:12,499
Auntie, having no choice doesn't justify sending people to cause a scene at my mansion.

564
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:15,840
Then if the civil and military officials have even a slight inconvenience,

565
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,219
can they come to my mansion to beat and scold me at will?

566
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:24,460
A punishment of 100 canes to serve as a warning to others.

567
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,039
If it happens again, there will be no leniency.

568
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,199
Thank you, the Grand Empress Dowager.

569
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:41,700
<i>Yan Changyun actually took the blame for me.</i>

570
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,960
<i>He is bearing such a heavy punishment alone.</i>

571
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,570
<i>Should I find a way to make it up to him?</i>

572
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,919
<i>How could they be so ruthless?</i>

573
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:05,000
Your Majesty, I believe Commander Yan committing such an outrageous offense

574
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,270
has disgraced the position of the leader of the Thousand Feather Guards.

575
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,240
Why don't we appoint a Military Governor to properly rectify his military discipline?

576
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,830
Your Majesty's insightful opinion.

577
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,630
My son Tianjiao is most suitable for the position of Military Governor.

578
00:38:18,636 --> 00:38:20,352
Your Majesty, this is inappropriate.

579
00:38:20,352 --> 00:38:24,220
My son Xiao Quan is best at ideological work, he's the most suitable one.

580
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:29,019
Xiao Quan is good, but my son Tianjiao is even better.

581
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:31,380
- Please decide, Your Majesty.
- Please decide, Your Majesty.

582
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,979
Letting me decide?

583
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:37,940
Okay, I think...

584
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,730
Xiao Qiangzi is suitable for the position of Military Governor.

585
00:38:44,192 --> 00:38:45,280
No!

586
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,559
- Your Majesty.
- Xiao Qiangzi!

587
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,680
I'm here.

588
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,010
Go back and properly educate Commander Yan.

589
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,600
Xiao Qiangzi do you underdtand?

590
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,984
Yes, Your Majesty.

591
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,800
You asked me to decide.
