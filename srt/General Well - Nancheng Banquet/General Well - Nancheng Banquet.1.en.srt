<i>Fu Xiao,</i>

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,260
our Wanshi Pavilion has always been committed to eradicating evil and treachery.

23

<i>You have been learning skills for 15 years.</i>

24
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,680
<i>This time as you descend the mountain, I have two tasks for you.</i>

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,619
<i>First: the border guard general Guo Zhen.</i>

26
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:05,540
<i>This person has been guarding the border for many years.</i>

27
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,280
<i>He has committed atrocities at the border, wantonly killing the innocent.</i>

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,180
<i>Now, he is returning to the capital to report on his duties.</i>

29
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,939
<i>I need you to clear the names of the souls wronged by his blade,</i>

30
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:20,180
<i>and return justice to the people.</i>

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,276
<i>Second: this person is the commander of the Thousand Feather Guards, who has the honor of entering the palace armed.</i>

32
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,199
<i>He holds heavy troops.</i>

33
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,580
<i>For many years, he's controlled the government in the capital,</i>

34
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,199
<i>bringing disaster to the area, and letting the people suffer indescribably.</i>

35
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,120
<i>Fu Xiao, you are Wanshi Pavilion's most skilled disciple.</i>

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,639
<i>Only you have the ability to eliminate this scourge.</i>

37
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,800
<i>What's his name?</i>

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,679
<i>Yan Changyun.</i>

<i>This person is different from Guo Zhen,</i>

41
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,619
<i>he has high skills, and strikes with cruel ferocity.</i>

42
00:02:57,619 --> 00:03:02,160
<i>I've already found out that he has been taking care of a courtesan in the Yunshao Bureau for many years.</i>

43
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,039
<i>Her name is Chu Yue.</i>

44
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,679
Commander Yan, you haven't been here for a long time.

45
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,350
You're here for Chu Yue, aren't you?

46
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,150
She thinks of you day and night.

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,319
<i>Chu Yue, Commander Yan is here.</i>

48
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,160
Is it Commander Yan?

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,392
You're not Chu Yue.

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,479
Sister Chu Yue is unwell today,

51
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,119
and specifically asked me to serve you in her stead.

52
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,920
Is that so?

53
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,959
Then I must take a good look.

54
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,519
The one who can serve me in place of Chu Yue

55
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,360
must surely possess

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,490
a stunning beauty.

57
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,600
Don't rush.

58
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,270
Commander Yan,

59
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,340
you'll make me shy if you do that.

60
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,720
Then I must take an even closer look.

61
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,879
A moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold.

62
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,299
Commander Yan, it's getting late.

63
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
What are you doing?

64
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,240
What Chu Yue can do; I can do too.

65
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,470
What Chu Yue can't do;

66
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,580
I can do too.

67
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,600
Many people want to kill me.

68
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,500
But it's the first time I've ever met a young lady as sincere and willing to pay the price as you.

69
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,759
But it's the first time I've ever met a young lady as sincere and willing to pay the price as you.

70
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,420
However, your biggest problem is impatience.

71
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,720
Soft indeed, but you still lack strength.

72
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,600
- Commander.
- Commander, are you all right?

73
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,976
I'm fine.

74
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,060
Miss Chu Yue.

75
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,040

76

84

I have sent people to look everywhere, but there is still no news.

85
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:27,160
He Sanyuan followed Guo Zhen for many years,

86

87
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,920

Aren't you looking for Guo Zhen?

94
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:47,800
He died under my sword, and now, I'll send you to meet him.

With these treasures stolen from the palace,

96

Sir, I got this injury while hunting in the mountains.

115

- Hold on.

Since it is a routine matter,

138

Then, what's this?

Doctor, I don't remember who I am or the things I've experienced.

It's not like I've gone foolish.

149
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,639
The back of your head is injured; blood is congested and meridians are blocked.

150
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,100
This is amnesia.

151
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,560
Amnesia? What will happen?

152
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,759
You will forget the people and events you have experienced.

153
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,119
Of course, your temperament, words, and behavior

154
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:30,320
might also become different.

Then, can I recover?

156
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,179
I can't cure amnesia.

157
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:37,540
I'll prescribe you a decoction for activating blood circulation and dissipating blood stasis.

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,100
Your Majesty, with Guo Zhen's death, the border cannot be left unguarded.

176
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,279
Please immediately decide on a successor for Guo Zhen.

177
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,679
Your Majesty, the Cavalry Commandant He Wei is brave and good at fighting.

178
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:56,960
He is definitely skilled at leading troops into battle.

179
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,299
Your Majesty, He Wei merely has the courage of an ordinary man and lacks the talent of a general.

180
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:04,620
I believe that Yang Xiong, the Vice Minister of Personnel, is most suitable.

181
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,859
Yang Xiong has no experience, he only knows how to be an armchair strategist.

182
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:09,519
Please, Your Majesty, think carefully before acting.

183
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,759
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

184
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,740
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

185
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,764
Your Majesty.

186
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,499
His Majesty has run away again!

You little rascal, hiding here and sneaking food, huh?

192
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:30,210
Who's been sneaking food?

193
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,240
I'll have a meal from you today, and repay you tenfold in the future.

194
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,230
How generous of you.

195
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,300
You like opera, too?

196
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,720
Of course. They sing well, and the lyrics are decent too.

197
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,119
The Thousand Feather Guards are carrying out official duties.

198

You go first.

205
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:27,540
Just that person outside, I don't know why

206
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,260
I get scared as soon as I see him.

207
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,640
Me too.

208
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,459
A kindred spirit.

209

This place is no longer safe, let's go.

210
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,120
We're surrounded, how can we escape?

211
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:49,100
Brother, how about we make a feint to the east and attack in the west?

212
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,960
How do we make a feint to the east and attack in the west?

213

Watch me!

214
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,270
Commander Yan, what a coincidence.

215
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,550
You've come to listen to the opera, too?

216
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,140
Brothers share roots, yet in crisis, they fend for themselves.

217
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,440
I'm sorry, Brother.

218
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:27,179
- Steamed bun!
- I'm starving.

219
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:30,040
Steaming hot steamed buns.

220
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,060
Hold on.

221
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,360
Dear customer, fancy some steamed buns? Get five for one wen.

222
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,519
<i>[Xiao Qiangzi]</i>
Exchange for two steamed buns?

223
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,400
I should be able to exchange one, right?

224
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,316
Where did you get that token?

225
00:21:58,756 --> 00:22:01,940
- It's mine.
- Nonsense, where is Xiao Qiangzi?

226
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,340
I'm Xiao Qiangzi.

227
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,820
Stop it. Take me to the real Xiao Qiangzi.

228
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,659
Brother, let me tell you the truth.

229
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:15,179
This token is indeed not mine.

230
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,100
I woke up to find it on me.

231
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,360
I don't know the Xiao Qiangzi you mentioned, and I also don't know where he is.

Brother, please let me go.

233
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,800
You're the boss, please let me go.

234
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,720
If you don't take me to Xiao Qiangzi today, then I'll die.

235
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,519
Let me tell you; if you push me too far,

236
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,680
then I'm capable of anything.

237
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,820
Brother, calm down. I'm telling you the truth.

238
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,259
I bumped my head, and I can't remember anything.

239
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:40,480
The doctor said it's amnesia.

240
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,079
If I'm lying to you, then I'm a dog.

<i>This guy has delicate features, too bad he's not that bright.</i>

242

<i>Why not let him take Xiao Qiangzi's place first?</i>

243
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:53,680
<i>Let's get through this moment first and then see.</i>

244
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,739
So, that means you're also a pitiful person.

245
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:59,860
Do you have a place to go?

246
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,340
How about this? Brother Dao will find you a place for you to live and with food,

247
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,780
and you can get paid monthly. Okay?

248

<i>That's sounds good.</i>

<i>Maybe I should fill my stomach first, take the money and then leave.</i>

00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,540
<i>Anyway, it's not late.</i>

251
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,279
<i>Moreover, this guy doesn't seem smart.</i>

Why have you tied me up?

266

What are you doing here?

324
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,200
I… I also work in the palace.

325
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,540
I'm a eunuch.

326
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,599
It's obvious. Where are you going?

327
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,259
Don't tell anyone else if I tell you.

328
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:09,220
Actually, I want to leave the palace.

329
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,260
You want to leave the palace?

330
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,499
I want to leave the palace too; take me with you.

331
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:17,660
Really? Do you have any money on you?

332
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,680
No.

333
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,540
If neither of us have any money, once we leave the palace,

00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,580
we can't even afford a steamed bun.

335

Your Majesty!

339
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,360
Your Majesty, don't hide from me.

340
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,379
Commander, I took the Thousand Feather Guards patrolling outside the palace today,

341
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:45,119
and found a small boat by the river five miles outside the city.

342
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,760
There are clear signs of a struggle inside the boat,

343
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,180
and there are also garments, a long sword, and a dagger with bloodstains on them.

344
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,839
Exactly like the assassin from the Qin Residence you described.

345
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:54,660
I sent people to search along the riverbank for the assassin's tracks,

346
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,679
and a eunuch's body was found by the riverbank.

347
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,780
This is the long sword found in the boat.

348
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,740
It really was him.

349
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,079
Commander, the strangest thing is that a young eunuch died outside the palace.

350
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,619
I checked the eunuch registry, and not a single one is missing.

351
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:24,632
<i>[Miaoyin Pavilion]</i>

352
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,220
Don't worry, no one's here.

353
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,600
Let's go!

354
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,359
Where is this?

355
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,559
Miaoyin Pavilion. The place where the emperor comes.

356
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,700
Then what about the treasure you mentioned?

357
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,219
Follow me! Come on.

358
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,179
It's good to be the emperor, having so many treasures.

359
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,780
I suppose this emperor must be quite formidable.

360
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,620
That should be about enough, right?

361
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,960
It's rare to come here, how can we say enough is enough?

362
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,064
Besides, don't you own half of the things here?

363
00:32:05,064 --> 00:32:07,820
- You're really generous.
- I know. Come on, let's go.

364
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,060
Let's go. Be careful.

365
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,179
Why are you so familiar with the palace?

366
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:17,100
I entered the palace earlier than you.

367
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,960
Stop! Who is there?

368
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,979
Brother, you go first, and I'll hold them off.

369
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:25,620
Hold off what? I'm more familiar with this.

370
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,540
I'll just say a few words to them and they'll let me go.

371
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,960
You go wait for me by the South Gate, and I'll be right there.

372
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,860
- I owe you one again.
- Go quickly.

373
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:43,080
<i>Greetings to Your Majesty.</i>

374
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,312
<i>[The Imperial Household Department]</i>

375
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,692
<i>[Roster of Names]</i>

376
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:58,680
<i>[Ten Newly Appointed Eunuchs]</i>

377
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,480
Eunuch Liu, you have ten young eunuchs in the Imperial Household Department,

378
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,839
and why are there only nine left now?

379
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,000
Where's the other one?

380
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,960
The other one…

381
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,672
Speak!

382
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,979
That one, he…

383
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:17,680
Xiao Qiangzi.

384
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,319
Commander Yan, please spare me.

385
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,160
<i>From where are you a eunuch?</i>

386
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,580
<i>I'm new to the palace today.</i>

387
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,099
<i>What's your name?</i>

388
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,300
<i>Xiao Qiangzi.</i>

389
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,179
Assemble all the Thousand Feather Guards to search for the eunuch Xiao Qiangzi.

390
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:40,760
- Search.
<i>- Understood.</i>

391
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,504
Let's go.

392
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,219
Xiao Qiangzi is a fake eunuch?

393
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:52,659
That's right! He first killed Guo Zhen then stabbed me at the old house.

394
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:55,600
I didn't expect someone would dare to sneak into the palace to kill me now.

395
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,799
- We need to capture him and interrogate thoroughly.
- No.

396
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:01,000
He might know my real identity.

397
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,220
Just kill him.

398
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,632
Okay.

399
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,960
Search. Commander Yan said that if Xiao Qiangzi is found, kill him immediately.

400
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,672
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

401
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,420
Brother, I'm sorry.

402
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,659
If I don't leave now, then my head will be chopped off.

403
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,500
I finally found you.

404
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,459
Eunuch Xiao Qiangzi from the Imperial Household Department

405
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:48,410
is to be executed on the spot,

406
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,940
for stealing royal assets.

407
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,119
- Save me!
- Stop right there.

408
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,080
<i>Greetings to Your Majesty.</i>

409
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,360
I'll stop pretending and reveal myself. I'm the emperor.

410
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,380
Your Majesty, this person is an impostor eunuch.

411
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,360
He assumed a false identity to enter the palace with ulterior motives.

412
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,180
Commander Yan, you can't just say things.

413
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,180
Your Majesty, I have found a eunuch dead outside the palace,

414
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,440
yet the Imperial Household Department has no shortage of people.

415
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,420
Just now, Xiao Qiangzi tried to flee the palace, I suspect…

416
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,960
That doesn't prove that Xiao Qiangzi is an impostor.

417
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,239
I still trust Xiao Qiangzi.

418
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:38,980
Your Majesty, whether he is genuine or not, just verify his identity and you'll know.

419
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,736
No!

420
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:46,759
I mean that though I'm a eunuch,

421
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:48,930
I still have dignity.

422
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:52,430
How can you just verify me like that?

423
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,239
What Xiao Qiangzi said makes sense.

424
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,219
Your Majesty, if there truly is a thief who has infiltrated the palace,

425
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,590
it's not just about your safety,

426
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,510
but there is also Empress Dowager and all the ladies of the court.

427
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,679
This matter must be taken seriously.

428
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,619
Commander Yan also has a point.

429
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:17,979
Xiao Qiangzi, you'll just have to bear with it, since you've done nothing wrong.

430
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:20,799
Summon the body-checking eunuch.

431
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:23,360
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

432
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:31,639
Reporting to Your Majesty. Xiao Qiangzi has indeed been purified.

433
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,119
Commander Yan, look! It's a misunderstanding.

434
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,559
Even though we have verified his identity,

435
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:47,739
he should still be punished severely for stealing royal assets.

436
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,700
No, Your Majesty.

437
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,910
I didn't steal, Your Majesty.

438
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,680
It's all a misunderstanding. Commander Yan, you've misunderstood again.

439
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,539
These things weren't stolen by Xiao Qiangzi.

440
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:04,659
They were rewards from me.

441
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:09,219
Exactly. Your Majesty is wise and sees through the smallest details.

442
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:12,079
Flawless as heavenly garments, like a deity descending to earth.

443
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,600
Since Your Majesty says they were rewards, then I have no more to say.

444
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,370
I'll be leaving now.

445
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,040
Let's go.

446
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,760
- Your Majesty.
- Commander Yan.

447
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,719
He doesn't need to leave. He's my personal attendant.

448
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,900
When did Your Majesty make this decision?

449
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,390
Just now.

450
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,300
That won't do.

451
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,340
On what grounds?

452
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,199
His Majesty has agreed, on what grounds do you disagree?

453
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,280
Indeed, someone unknown has infiltrated the palace, Your Majesty.

454
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,260
Before the suspect is found, he can't stay by your side.

455
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,760
How dare of you, Yan Changyun!

456
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,019
You've already verified his identity and yet you're still causing a scene.

457
00:38:58,019 --> 00:38:59,679
Is this how I usually teach you?

458
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:01,436
Your Majesty.

459
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,079
I have already given my word.

460
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,880
I'll lose all my dignity if I take it all back.

461
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,959
Leave me some dignity, will you?

462
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,440
It's good that you realize your mistake.

463
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,619
I need to rest now, you may leave.

464
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:28,960
I'll take my leave.

465
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:40,960
All right, all right! Get up now.

466
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,430
I never expected you to really be the emperor.

467
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,110
Then we are truly fated to meet.

468
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,219
We first met at the opera house and became brothers, then we met again in the palace.

469
00:39:51,219 --> 00:39:53,740
It seems I am destined to serve Your Majesty.

470
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,719
Since it's destined by heaven, let's cherish this bond.

471
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,840
From now on in the palace, I've got your back.

472
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,000
Once outside the palace, you'll have to cover for me.

473
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,100
Let's not forget each other in prosperity.

474
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,200
Okay, rest assured.

475
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,100
Even in wealth, a dog must not forget his brothers.

476
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,700
Then I must be even more honorable.

477
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,600
You are quite an interesting person.

478
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,500
Commander, what should we do with this Xiao Qiangzi?

479
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,200
We can't afford any mistakes at this time.

480
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,000
Better to wrongfully kill than to let go.

481
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,400
Understood.

482
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,700
But he's now in the hands of Your Majesty.

483
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,200
We cannot leave any leverage.
