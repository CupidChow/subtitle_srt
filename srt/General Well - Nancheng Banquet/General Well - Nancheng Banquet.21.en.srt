<i>[Episode 21]</i>

21
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,439
Xiao Quan already knows my true identity,

22
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,060
and he has admitted it himself. He's the mastermind behind the Guanyou incident.

23
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,520
This time, he failed to frame me by using the princess's death.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,620
He'll surely take new actions next.

25
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,599
Young Master, shall we kill this despicable villain,

26
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,619
and avenge the deceased Qin Family and subordinates?

27
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,939
A'Cheng, calm down.

28
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,879
Killing Xiao Quan is not difficult.

29
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,160
But the injustice suffered by the Qin Family can no longer be redressed.

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,720
It would be more loss than gain.

31
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,420
Uncle Lei is right. Xiao Quan's death is not enough.

32
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,760
But first, we must vindicate the Qin Family.

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,840
Now, I'm nothing but a commoner.

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,540
Dealing with Xiao Quan is even more difficult.

35
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,400
So, if necessary, I will meet with His Majesty.

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,320
Young Master, isn't this too risky?

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,060
After all, the Guanyou incident was decreed by His Majesty.

38
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,300
If he finds out your identity, it would be dangerous.

39
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,740
His Majesty has long been aware of Xiao Quan's ambition.

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,720
Now, for His Majesty,

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,380
only I can help him against Xiao Quan.

42
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,620
So, even if he knows my identity, His Majesty might not necessarily kill me.

43
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,919
Young Master, that's the best outcome you're talking about.

44
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:04,400
I aimed to spark a conflict betweenthe countries with the princess's demise.

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,320
So, I could accomplish a great task amidst the chaos.

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,800
And at the same time, eliminate Yan Changyun.

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,019
I didn't expect him to luckily escape again..

48
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,480
and ruining our big plans.

49
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,000
Hasn't he already been dismissed?

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
Although he has been dismissed,

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,940
but who knows when His Majesty might reinstate him?

52
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,399
When that time comes, he will be able to control the military power of the Southern Kingdom once again.

53
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,680
What do you plan to do?

54
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,700
Yan Changyun has always cared deeply for the Qin Family's former subordinates.

55
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,800
I just need to strike at the Qin Family's former subordinates.

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,139
Bind his hands and feet, and distract his attention.

57
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,780
By then, we can initiate the plan.

58
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,100
Rest assured, the grudge for crippling your legs,

59
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,400
I will certainly find a way to help you avenge it.

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,560
But now there's something more important.

61
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,759
That requires action by you.

62
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,508
It's your turn.

63
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,380
Guo Zhen's jade ring is in your beloved disciple's hands.

64
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,980
Inside, there may be hidden the tripartite agreement that you, I, and Guo Zhen signed back then.

65
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,160
That is the evidence of the Guanyou incident.

66
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:38,680
Wasn't the tripartite agreement destroyed that year?

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,759
And both you and I were present.

68
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,199
I'm afraid we were played by Guo Zhen.

69
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,140
What if the agreement that was burned that year was a fake?

70
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,800
Now, while your beloved disciple still hasn't recovered her memory,

71
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,619
let's get rid of her directly.

72
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:03,399
This way, the tripartite agreement will never see the light of day.

73
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,839
Only then will you and I have no further worries.

74
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,160
How come, Sir, you can't bear to part with your precious disciple?

75
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,000
You must understand, once this jade ring falls into Yan Changyun's hands,

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,600
then he'll know about the Guanyou incident.

77
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,100
That the entire Qin Family's execution was orchestrated by you and me.

78
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,820
And I will die when the time comes.

79
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,199
And the Ning Kingdom won't have peace either.

80
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,140
If you're unwilling to do it, then I'll go.

81
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,088
There's no need.

82
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,700
If you act, you'll inevitably alert the enemy.

83
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,384
I'll do it.

84
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,160
Then I'll have to trouble you, Sir.

85
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,519
<i>Xiao Quan, that old fox, has always been using me.</i>

86
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,540
<i>As long as I get hold of this tripartite agreement,</i>

87
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,600
<i>then I can use it against him and make him obey me.</i>

88
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,240
Why haven't you gone to sleep yet?

89
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,279
You've come to see me about something.

90
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,340
Actually, there is something.

91
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,320
- I was thinking—
- You want to talk about Princess Jiayang's case. Right?

92
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,859
I've heard about it from A'Cheng. You checked the princess's wounds while I was in prison.

93
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,979
The murder weapon was identified as a plum blossom tri-edged short blade.

94
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,820
It's very likely the weapon of your senior sister, Qing Li.

95
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:33,412
That's right.

96
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:40,099
So, that means, the murderer is the woman who tried to assassinate you in Beggar's Alley.

97
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,679
I'm not certain, I've asked my master.

98
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:50,040
My master said that my senior sister has never been to the capital.

99
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Your master?

100
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:56,780
Yes, my master came to see me.

101
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,179
Even though I still haven't recovered my memory,

102
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:02,839
but when I see him, I feel a special sense of closeness.

103
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,239
He also said he wanted me to leave with him.

104
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:11,839
But I can't bear to leave you.

105
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,519
Let me accompany you to meet your master in a couple of days.

106
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,499
He is your elder, so he is also my elder.

107
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:22,340
<i>Turns out you're more anxious about it than me.</i>

108
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,640
If you want to see him, then go ahead and meet.

109
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,580
Actually, by all rights, my master is like a father to me.

110
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,320
Whether you meet him or not, our relationship stays the same.

111
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,580
But if you really want to see him, then go ahead.

112
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,519
My master is a particularly good person.

113
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,879
He'll definitely like you once he meets you.

114
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,060
Do you believe what your master says? Princess Jiayang was not killed by Qing Li.

115
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,320
No, that's not the case.

116
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,680
But Master said he would ask Senior Sister to clarify.

117
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,959
If she did it, there would be no favoritism.

118
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,970
And I firmly believe my master is a good person.

119
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,399
I believe you are a good person, too.

120
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,164
Thank you.

121
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,719
Tired? Come on, lie down and rest well.

122
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:21,079
Previously, you were always occupied with official duties. There was no time.

123
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:26,940
Take this opportunity to take a good leave and enjoy it.

124
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,160
True,

125
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,979
finding the assassin is just the first step.

126
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:38,620
The most important thing is still to find the real mastermind behind the scenes.

127
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,919
But let Tianjiao, that cheap commander, do all these.

128
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,679
Right now, my task is to rest well.

129
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,180
Really getting a good rest?

130
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:09,880
<i>[Yan Residence]</i>

131
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,272
Good morning.

132
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,600
How did I end up sleeping here?

133
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,700
Yesterday, I was thinking to watch over you for a while

134
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,460
after you fell asleep and then leave.

135
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,879
I didn't expect I would just…

136
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,060
Open my eyes and being able to see you,

137
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,890
that's really nice.

138
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,120
Why are you still keeping this smelly pouch?

139
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,340
I'm taking it away. Didn't I embroider a new one for you?

140
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,440
I'm keeping the new one.

141
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,180
The pouch I embroidered is a token of love.

142
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,640
Whoever takes my pouch is mine.

143
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,399
All right, it's a deal.

144
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,519
I was just kidding.

145
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,919
But I'm serious.

146
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,708
Fu Xiao.

147
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,240
If there are things I haven't told you, would you mind?

148
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,560
Would you feel that two people who truly love each other shouldn't lie?

149
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,200
Sometimes, lies are told to protect the ones who are important.

150
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,379
Honesty is just a matter of time, after all.

151
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:26,080
Perhaps because the time is not right.

152
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,820
Or perhaps it's a matter of life and death.

153
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,160
It's hard to fulfill both love and righteousness.

154
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,939
But what I just said doesn't include hiding private money.

155
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:46,300
If I find out you are hiding private money, then no mercy.

156
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,440
I wouldn't dare.

157
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,179
What's wrong, Fu Xiao?

158
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:04,020
Fu Xiao? Fu Xiao.

159
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,092
Fu Xiao!

160
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,612
How is she?

161
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,320
Commander Yan, the poison in Miss Xiao's body is getting deeper and deeper.

162
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,990
Without the antidote, I'm afraid she won't last much longer.

163
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,039
Boss, someone came claiming to be Fu Xiao's master.

164
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,080
Quick, the antidote.

165
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,260
How can I trust you?

166
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,420
If she doesn't take the antidote soon,

167
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,560
I fear it may cause irreversible damage to her body.

168
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,420
Master is here to save Senior Sister. Why are you still stopping him?

169
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,059
How do I know if you are here to save her or harm her?

170
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,679
There's no time left, are you going to wait?

171
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,919
Commander Yan, let's give it a try.

172
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,700
You know Fu Xiao's purpose for getting close to you.

173
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,559
I know, those who are unaware are not guilty. I don't blame her.

174
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,140
And it's not your place to blame her.

175
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,659
Up to now, in my heart, you're still an utterly unforgivable sinner.

176
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,639
I don't care how you see me.

177
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,000
As long as Fu Xiao believes I'm a good person, that's enough.

178
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,380
I won't let Fu Xiao stay with you. I'll take her away.

179
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,940
I won't let her go with you. After all, she is the safest with me.

180
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,419
One day as a teacher, a lifetime as a father.

181
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:52,100
Whether you can keep her or not, still depends on Fu Xiao's choice between us in the end.

182
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,959
If you really cared about Fu Xiao,

183
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,240
then you wouldn't be eager to take her away from my side.

184
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,499
But should instead thoroughly cure the poison in her body.

185
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:05,619
Xiao Quan provides us with the antidote every month.

186
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:08,719
However, this antidote can only relieve the symptoms,

187
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,360
but can't completely eradicate the poison in her body.

188
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,739
So, you've known Xiao Quan for a long time.

189
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:17,840
Xiao Quan, this despicable person,

190
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,120
uses poison to coerce Wanshi Pavilion.

191
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,300
I'm also helpless, that's why I obey him.

192
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,260
Is it coercion...

193
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,270
and not collusion?

194
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,259
I know you don't believe it.

195
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,640
But it doesn't matter, you just need to know one thing.

196
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,260
If Fu Xiao doesn't kill you, then she will die instead.

197
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,880
Moreover, the two of us are both unable to cure the poison in her body.

198
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,960
And now you're just a commoner.

199
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,759
How can you possibly resist Xiao Quan, who now has immense power?

200
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,480
Master.

201
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,232
Fu Xiao.

202
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,580
You're awake.

203
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,820
Master, why are you here?

204
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,759
I was worried about you and came to check on you.

205
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,460
Master, your legs must not be exposed to the cold.

206
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,160
- I'll take you back to rest.
- It's alright.

207
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,880
You just took the antidote; your body is still weak.

208
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,656

Bai Yi has already gone to meet Yan Changyun.

213
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,460
There's no news for the moment.

214
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,600
Do you think Bai Yi is really willing to kill his disciple?

215
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,770
No matter who he's going to kill,

216
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,030
it's to our advantage.

217
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,440
If Yan Changyun is the one who dies, that would be ideal.

218

If it's that Fu Xiao who dies,

219
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,980
then we'll just repeat the old trick.

220
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,200
Use Qin's old faction to force Yan Changyun to comply.

221
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,759
As long as the two of them die,

222

your Majesty Zhao Yuan will be isolated and at our mercy.

Understood.

226
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,190
Bai Yi, as a man of the martial world,

227
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,240
yet has connections with Xiao Quan.

228
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,139
The prime suspect in the murder of Princess Jiayang,

229
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:25,759
is also his disciple, Qing Li.

230
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,960
This person is not simple.

231
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,720
Go check out Bai Yi's background.

232
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,260
Also, don't tell Fu Xiao about this.

233
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,500
I don't want her to be harmed.

234
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,032
Yes.

235
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,100
Master!

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,710
Fu Xiao.

237
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Master, isn't dipping watermelon in spices a Ning Kingdom's way of eating?

238
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,860
I traveled to the Ning Kingdom to study in my youth, and was influenced by the customs there.

239
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,419
I grew fond of it over time.

240
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:25,440
Master, you've studied in the Ning Kingdom, too?

241
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
In that case, the wind is strong here.

242
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,420
Let me push you back to the room, and you can tell me all about it.

243
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay.

244
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,252
Could it be him?

245
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,980
It's indeed you, Ning Kingdom's Second Prince, Yi Heng.

246
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,319
Unharmed as ever, Qin Yan?

247
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,760
15 years ago, you pushed me off a cliff.

248
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,300
I survived by a hair's breadth.

249
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,300
It's time to settle that account now.

250
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,079
It's been 15 years.

251
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,120
Back then, you crippled my legs,

252
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,619
and made me spend the rest of my life in this wheelchair.

253
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:48,079
This account also ought to be properly settled.

254
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,079
Then it depends on whether you have the ability to do it.

255
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,559
If you kill me, Fu Xiao will never get the antidote.

256
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,600
15 years ago, even if the Ning Kingdom did not make a move,

257
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,000
with the Qin Family's power and influence, and achievements overshadowing the master,

258
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,600
Southern Kingdom's emperor would not have spared you either.

259
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,500
Even to this day, as a descendant of the Qin Family,

260
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,200
you still can't escape the fate of being hunted down.

261
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,000
So, why must you implicate Fu Xiao as well?

262
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Only if you die, can Fu Xiao live.

263
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
The poison in Fu Xiao's body is only temporarily suppressed.

264
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,900
If the medication cannot be continued,

265
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,700
she'll surely die within ten days.

266
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,060
As long as you die,

267
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,800
I'll ensure her life is without worry.

Go ahead.

276
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Xiao Quan visited when I was in the Ministry of Justice's prison.

277
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,500
He admitted in person, that he himself is the mastermind behind the events 15 years ago.

278
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,400
This time, Princess Jiayang's death is also related to him.

279
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,000
And the second prince of Ning Kingdom was also involved.

280
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,900
Xiao Quan's intentions are deserving of death.

281
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,200
Starting from when he wanted to execute the old followers of Guanyou,

282
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,200
I felt he could no longer restrain himself from coming out from behind the scenes.

283
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,100
Exactly, so, Xiao Quan can't be left alive.

284
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,600
Then, do you have a way to deal with this?

285
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,700
Since Xiao Quan returned to the capital city,

286
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,800
and has tried several times to kill me.

287
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,600
Now, he is even using Fu Xiao's life to threaten me.

288
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,200
Therefore, I want to fight him with his own strategy this time.

289
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,300
Use my life to lure Xiao Quan out of hiding.

290
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,400
Then, Your Majesty, you can capture Xiao Quan, and clarify the truth behind the Guanyou incident.

291
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,200
Changyun, this is unacceptable.

292
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,900
The Thousand Feather Guards can't afford to lose you.

293
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,400
I can't lose you either.

342
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What's the matter with Miss Chu Yue? You look so unhappy.

343
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,800
Lord Xiao, why haven't you taken action to kill Fu Xiao yet?

344
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,400
As for me, killing Fu Xiao would certainly eliminate future troubles.

345
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,200
But when I think of your original intention, Miss Chu Yue,

346
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,200
I feel that the matter can't be settled like this.

347
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,500
Lord Xiao, what do you mean?

348
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,200
Miss, think about it.

349
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,000
Right now, Yan Changyun and Fu Xiao are in the midst of a loving relationship.

350
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,100
If Fu Xiao dies,

351
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,500
then Yan Changyun will certainly be devastated.

352
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,200
And his heart still lies with Fu Xiao.

353
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,000
What you have gained, is none other than Yan Changyun's empty shell.

354
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,700
Moreover, based on my understanding of Yan Changyun,

355
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:13,000
you might not even get that empty shell in the end.

356
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,700
According to your meaning, sir, Fu Xiao can't be killed?

357
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,400
Miss, you have misunderstood my meaning.

358
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,400
I mean, you need to make Yan Changyun and Fu Xiao

359
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,300
turn against each other, and part ways like the swallows.

360
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,600
That is truly breaking up a pair of lovers.

361
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Only then can you win Yan Changyun's heart.

362
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,839
Lord Xiao, what do you want me to do?

363
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,800
Getting up so late, the sunrise is already gone.

364
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
It's all your fault.

365
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,500
I did get up early, though.

366
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,400
Then why didn't you wake me up?

367
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,200
Seeing you sleep so soundly, I couldn't bear to wake you, and wanted to let you sleep a bit more.

368
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,100
Those are all excuses.

369
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,800
Fine, it's all my fault.

370
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,400
Nonetheless, we didn't catch the sunrise.

371
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,300
But coming out for a walk is also nice, it's fine.

372
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:39,000
It does matter. If the first small affair in our love doesn't go well from the start,

373
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,800
then it means that our love will face many trials ahead.

374
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,500
Rest assured; I won't let you go through hardships again.

375
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,700
You'll always be happy.

376
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,100
I'm very happy right now.

377
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,400
I really wish time would stop at this moment.

378
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,000
But then again, it is really too cold here.

379
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,300
Perhaps we should go home.

380
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,200
All right, then I will take you to a place.

381
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,800
Let's go.

382
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,700
You seem very familiar with this area.

383
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,800
As a child, I often sneaked out to play here,

384
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,200
and practiced martial arts here as well.

385
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,100
Practicing from a young age, no wonder your martial arts are so good.

386
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,200
Even with great skills, there're times one can make a mistake.

387
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,200
When facing an expert, it's either a fatal move,

388
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,300
or you must quickly escape.

389
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,000
Even Commander Yan has times to flee?

390
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,300
I'm talking about you.

391
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,940
The martial arts I taught you must be diligently practiced,

392
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,600
no slacking off.

393
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,200
I'll definitely practice the martial arts you've taught me, and never slack off.

394
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,400
Also, don't act rashly and put on a show of bravery.

395
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,000
Such a beautiful view.

396
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Can't you just stay quietly by my side?

397
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,000
Dad.

398
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,800
How could you go to Xiao Quan?

399
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,600
Do you realize how important that ring is to us?

400
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,800
If Fu Xiao is killed,

401
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,400
the thing inside the ring is concealed,

402
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,800
then our 15 years of effort will have been in vain.

403
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,600
It's been so long, yet Fu Xiao still hasn't regained her memory.

404
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,400
Why still pin our hopes on her?

405
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
I think she's just been playing dumb all along.

406
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,500
She just doesn't want to hand the ring over to the young master.

407
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,800
But you can't do something as foolish as that.

408
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,600
She was the one who stole Brother Yan away first.

409
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,000
If it weren't for her, Yan and I would have been together long ago.

410
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
She deserves to die.

411
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,720
Chu Yue,

412
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,600
how have you become like this now?

413
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,500
15 years.

414
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,200
I've been in Yunshao Bureau for a full 15 years.

415
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,900
All these years, I haven't had a single complaint.

416
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,700
Because I know that Father gave up saving me to save the young master.

417
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,600
For him, I'm willing.

418
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,800
I know that one day in the future, I'll marry him.

419
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Then all the suffering I've been through these years,

420
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,000
will turn sweet in that moment.

421
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:12,600
Dad, I've never asked you for anything over the years.

422
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,400
But now, I just have this one wish,

423
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,700
which is to marry Brother Yan.

424
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm begging you, Dad. Please accompany your daughter to act out a play.

425
00:33:27,684 --> 00:33:28,970
<i>[Civil and Military Strategies]</i>

426
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,400
Today, I missed both the sunrise and the sunset.

427
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
But I'm still very happy.

428
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,400
I hope you will continue to do even better, and fulfill one of my small wishes every day.

429
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,400
What's the matter, you don't want to?

430
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,700
No.

431
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,000
Fu Xiao.

432
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,700
I've deposited some silver in the bank, here is the passkey.

433
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,800
For me?

434
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,200
Take good care of it, there are still many days ahead.

435
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,400
Remember, steady streams last long.

436
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,500
Isn't this too sudden?

437
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,760
You're letting me keep house?

438
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,800
I'm not prepared yet.

439
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,800
I have already prepared everything that needs to be.

440
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,000
You just need to accept it.

441
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,400
It's getting late.

442
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,900
You've been tired all day, rest early.

443
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,000
I can't bear to part with you.

444
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,800
Be good.

445
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:12,328
Your Majesty.

446
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,200
Look what this is?

447
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,200
What's this that makes you so happy?

448
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
This is the key to the bank account.

449
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,400
Yan Changyun personally gave it to me.

450
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,000
He said I would be in charge of his money from now on.

451
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,400
From now on, I must start taking charge of the household.

452
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,700
Your Majesty, you are my best friend.

453
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,000
That's why I want to tell you my good news first.

454
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,300
Do you love Yan Changyun?

455
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,800
He is the one for me in this life.

456
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,300
Then, does Yan Changyun love you?

457
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,200
Of course.

458
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
That's wonderful…

459
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,000
to know what it feels like to be loved.

460
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,500
Your Majesty.

461
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,900
Actually, there has always been an unresolved issue between us.

462
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,400
I never wanted to bring it up again in my life.

463
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,700
But now I must tell you.

464
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,600
Go ahead.

465
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,700
I have never been pregnant with His Majesty's child.

466
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,500
Then you and His Majesty…?

467
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,500
It was all lies he told to save me.

468
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,500
Moreover, I have no affection for His Majesty.

469
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,000
Yan Changyun has always been the one in my heart.

470
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,600
It was all fake.

471
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,200
Then, you have never had a miscarriage.

472
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,200
Then, why was the miscarriage incident blamed on my brother?

473
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,800
Isn't that because of Xiao Quan…

474
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,400
Her Majesty, there are some things I can't tell you.

475
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,600
But what I want to say to you

476
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,400
is you should try to stay away from Lord Xiao.

477
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,000
Your elder brother is no simple man.

478
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,600
Your Majesty, please don't mind me telling you these things.

479
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,700
I sincerely wish for your happiness.

480
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,100
I know you care about me.

481
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,400
You don't need to worry about me.

482
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,600
I'm looking forward to having a drink at your and Yan Changyun's wedding.

483
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:24,352
<i>[Yan Residence]</i>

484
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,700
<i>What is she sneaking off to do?</i>

485
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,400
Dad.

486
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,200
You're here, come in quickly.

487
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,800
<i>Isn't this the person who wants to kill me?</i>

488
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,000
<i>He is Chu Yue's dad.</i>

489
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,800
Dad, are your injuries better?

490
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Much better.

491
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,300
I've brought you some food, here.

492
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,100
Don't rush, sit down.

493
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Yesterday was your birthday, Chu Yue.

494
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,900
Dad, I should have come to see you.

495
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,900
But now, it's inconvenient for me to visit Young Master's residence.

496
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,639
I'm sorry.

497
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,200
Did Young Master accompany you on your birthday yesterday?

498
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,400
He went to accompany Fu Xiao.

499
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,000
Don't feel wronged either.

500
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,200
Changyun had no choice.

501
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,500
He's just doing this to gain Fu Xiao's trust.

502
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,800
He did it on purpose for her to see. Don't blame him.

503
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,300
Of course not, Father. I understand Brother Yan's intentions.

504
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,400
Very good! Young master played this game well.

505
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,500
Now Fu Xiao has fallen in love with him,

506
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,600
and she trusts him completely.

507
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,800
As long as Fu Xiao can help Young Master get that jade ring,

508
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,400
then she'll just be a useless person in the future. Right?

509
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,300
Father, I'm still a bit worried about him.

510
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,200
What are you still worried about?

511
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,600
I'm worried that he'll take the pretense too seriously,

512
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,100
and then won't be able to go through with it.

513
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,000
Don't worry about that.

514
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,800
