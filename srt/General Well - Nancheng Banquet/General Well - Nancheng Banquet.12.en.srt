Yan Changyun. Yan Changyun, save me.

24
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,840
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

25
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,676
So cold.

26
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,364
You're awake.

27
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,639
Yan Changyun.

28
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,159
Yan Changyun, I just had a nightmare.

29
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,940
I dreamed that I was about to die.

30
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,199
I thought I would never see you again.

31
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,479
Yan Changyun. Yan Changyun!

32
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,299
Don't be afraid, you're safe now.

33
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,900
This person is really bold.

34
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,900
Daring to commit a crime in broad daylight.

35
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,340
And there's Yan Changyun.

36
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,020
How is he protecting the Imperial Palace?

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,820
- Brother.
- Heng'er.

38
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,739
Why are you still in the palace?

39
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,439
I came to talk to His Majesty about some state affairs.

40
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,639
He's not there, so I'm about to leave.

41
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,019
It's so cold, why are you wearing so little?

42
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,319
Don't blame Xue Ru, I came out in a hurry.

43
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,759
No matter how urgent, you have to take good care of yourself.

44
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,059
Come, put this on.

45
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,819
Why are you in such a hurry? Where are you going?

46
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:46,620
Xiao Qiangzi has been stabbed, we don't know who he has offended.

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,939
I was just about to go see him.

48
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:50,719
His Majesty should have arrived by now. Right?

49
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,439
What? Is Xiao Qiangzi okay?

50
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,779
I just got the news myself; I don't know yet.

51
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,879
Heng'er, are you very close to him?

52
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,910
Of course, he's my best friend in the palace.

53
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,852
Okay, then don't worry.

54
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:09,600
Let's go and see him together. Come on.

55
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,500
Come here. Be careful, it's hot.

56
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,180
My... My clothes.

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,559
You'd lost a lot of blood, so I had to change your clothes.

58
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,940
Stay here and recover for a while.

59
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,779
Otherwise, you'll be discovered by others.

60
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,820
But rest assured, I won't tell anyone about your situation.

61
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,179
And I won't let you stay here indefinitely.

62
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:18,060
Once you've healed, I will send you away.

63
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,348
Drink the medicine.

64
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,420
Xiao Qiangzi.

65
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,700
Quick.

66
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,430
Xiao Qiangzi.

67
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,944
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Where are you hurt?

68
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:45,179
- Let me see.
- Your Majesty.

69
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,399
Doctor Qu has just applied the medicine. He cannot be exposed to the wind yet.

70
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,979
Does it hurt? Is it serious?

71
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:00,460
I'm fine. Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

72
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,700
Commander Yan, how could there be an assassination attempt in the palace?

73
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,240
I have already sent people to investigate.

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,179
Xiao Qiangzi, did you see the assassin?

75
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,680
Your Majesty!

76
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,920
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

77
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,908
Dispense with the formalities.

78
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,359
How are you?

79
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:25,219
Who is behind this? Tell me.

80
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,399
Yes, Xiao Qiangzi, don't be afraid.

81
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,359
Boldly say who it is.

82
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,839
I will definitely not spare him.

83
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,499
Your Majestyies, you must seek justice for me!

84
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:38,120
It's Xiao Quan. He wants to kill me.

85
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,379
Lord Xiao wants to kill you? Why does he want to kill you?

86
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:49,259
Because I know his secret.

87
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:53,479
I saw him committing acts of insubordination, offending Her Majesty.

88
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,100
He wants to kill me to silence me.

89
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,372
- How audacious, Xiao Quan.
- Your Majesty.

90
00:07:00,372 --> 00:07:02,100
It's simply unforgivable.

91
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,279
Commander Yan, execute him on the spot.

92
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,260
Her Majesty will be put into the cold palace, never to be forgiven.

93
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,140
Your Majesty, I'm wronged! I do not wish to be sent to the cold palace.

94
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,120
How dare you claim to be wronged after committing such a disgrace to the royal family.

95
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,419
Fine! If you are unwilling to enter the cold palace,

96
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,540
then you shall die.

97
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,580
No, Your Majesty!

98
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,300
<i>It won't do. Killing Xiao Quan would also implicate Her Majesty.</i>

99
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,900
<i>Her Majesty is innocent. This matter cannot be revealed.</i>

100
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:40,120
Your Majesties, you must seek justice for me!

101
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,379
It was Lord Xiao who wanted to kill me.

102
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:46,040
Lord Xiao wants to kill you? Why does he want to kill you?

103
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,040
Your Majesty, I have been wronged!

104
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,019
I have no grudge against Xiao Qiangzi. Why would I want to kill him?

105
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:56,919
And you, Xiao Qiangzi, don't rely on Your Majesty's favor to act willfully, and do whatever you want.

106
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,439
You are framing a loyal official.

107
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,880
Xiao Qiangzi, I treated you as a friend. You actually framed my brother.

108
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,480
Xiao Qiangzi, I truly misjudged you.

109
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,859
Xiao Qiangzi, I am out of options.

110
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:10,959
I can't let down the hearts of two loyal officials.

111
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,580
<i>Either they both die, or I die myself.</i>

112
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,620
<i>It won't do. This won't do either.</i>

113
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,700
The assailant struck from behind.

114
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,820
I did not see clearly what he looked like.

115
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,980
Rest assured, with Commander Yan here,

116
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,740
he'll definitely find the assailant to avenge you.

117
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,360
Xiao Qiangzi, come and stay with me.

118
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,279
There are many servants in the palace to take care of you conveniently.

119
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:46,320
No need, Your Majesty.

120
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,100
Commander Yan takes good care of me, very attentively.

121
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,879
How does Commander Yan take care of you?

122
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,740
He has to pursue the murderer.

123
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,559
Be obedient, I'm doing this for your own good.

124
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,819
Your Majesty, Xiao Qiangzi's wounds have just been dressed; he shouldn't move.

125
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:03,679
He mustn't move about at this time.

126
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,820
Yes, Your Majesty, I don't dare to move at all right now.

127
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,500
Even a slight movement causes great pain.

128
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,639
I am just a bit tired now and wish to rest properly.

129
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,420
All right. Commander Yan, I'll leave Xiao Qiangzi in your care.

130
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,839
Also, apprehend the person who harmed Xiao Qiangzi as soon as possible.

131
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,688
I accept the decree.

132
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,100
I respectfully see off Your Majesty.

133
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,819
Then you should rest well first.

134
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:39,819
Your Majesty.

135
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,430
Quickly cover yourself with the quilt; cover up well.

136
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:15,080
<i>[Imperial City]</i>

137
00:10:18,428 --> 00:10:21,400
My Lord, what happened?

138
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,699
Fu Xiao didn't die, Yan Changyun saved her.

139
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:29,380
I'm afraid it will lead to much trouble in the future.

140
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,699
Shall I find an opportunity to make a move again?

141
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:36,600
No need. Since he hasn't disclosed that I am the murderer,

142
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,279
it indicates he still has some reservations in his mind.

143
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,000
Although this person suffers from amnesia,

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,500
he is somewhat intelligent.

145
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,200
But for each day he lives longer, it will certainly bring you more danger.

146
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,620
After all, he is Bai Yi's person.

147
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,699
If he were to truly die by my hand,

148
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,260
Bai Yi would surely hold a grudge against me.

149
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,200
Spare his life for now; he might be useful later on.

150
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,600
What about Yunshao Bureau?

151
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,740
We have already assigned people to monitor Chu Yue as per your instructions.

152
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,300
Good, we'll set up a good show tomorrow.

153
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,059
I actually want to see Chu Yue's true face.

154
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,740
<i>Boss!</i>

155
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,920
- Keep it down.
- I'm telling you…

156
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,720
He is sleeping.

157
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,399
Also, remember to knock before entering in the future.

158
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,600
All right! A'Cheng and I just checked the place where Xiao Qiangzi had an incident.

159
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,840
I personally reenacted it.

160
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,900
Xiao Qiangzi was stabbed in the lower back, but the wound isn't deep.

161
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,600
There are no signs of struggle or scuffle on the ground.

162
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,340
This makes me suspect that Xiao Qiangzi was attacked by someone he knew.

163
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,719
He is definitely hiding something.

164
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,000
Understood.

165
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,200
- Is there anything else?
- Yes, there's also the matter of Xiao Wanli's murder.

166
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,900
Currently, aside from concluding that the murderer has colored powder on them,

167
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,000
nothing of any value was found.

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,700
However, ever since Xiao Wanli died, Xiao Quan seems to have changed.

169
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,319
He often goes to various officials' homes for drinks and tea.

170
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:22,259
Do you think there's something wrong with Xiao Quan?

171
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,700

Do you know the person who stabbed you?

181

I don't want to talk about it. Can you please not ask?

182

You can't even tell me?

183

You have your reasons, and I respect your thoughts.

184
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,159
However, if you encounter any danger next time, you must be more cautious.

The jade whistle I gave you must be kept with you at all times.

186

Don't worry. I have the jade whistle on me.

187

But I will definitely find an opportunity to avenge this.

188

the fact that I am a woman?

191

As the commander of Thousand Feather Guards,

193
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,420
it's my dereliction of duty

194
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,340
that I let a woman disguise as a eunuch and enter the palace.

195
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,260
If the censor were to report this,

196

I fear that my position as the commander of Thousand Feather Guards would not be secure.

197
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,719
Isn't it because you were worried about me?

The medicine has been applied. Go to sleep now.

199

It's because you were worried about me.

That's why you helped me hide the fact that I'm a girl.

Xiao Wanli's disciples and former officials are all over the court.

He has as many enemies. Such a complex relationship.

227
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,900
It's too difficult to find clues to Xiao Wanli's murder.

Have you ever thought about who benefits the most after Xiao Wanli's death?

229
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,200
From this perspective, his son Xiao Quan seems to be the most suspicious.

230
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,600
I have questioned the servants of the Xiao residence. They indeed had an argument that day.

231
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,900
Ever since Xiao Wanli died,

232
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,500
Xiao Quan is indeed very suspicious.

There's a situation with Chu Yue.

Uncle Lei just sent a message. Saying that the Ministry of Justice's secret agents have been active lately.

239

To ensure safety, temporarily hide and cancel contact.

240

But it seems that Chu Yue has been targeted by Xiao Quan.

241
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,760
We underestimated Xiao Quan before.

242
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,540
This person was previously so perfect that it was a bit abnormal.

243
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,420
Should we think of a way to take care of him this time?

244
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,400
We must not act rashly.

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,720
it would be safer for you to leave the capital as soon as possible.

344
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,519
Then, when can I return?

345
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:52,519
Don't come back again.

346
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,500
I'll take this opportunity to arrange a new identity for you.

347
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,960
From now on, you can escape from servitude.

348
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,459
I won't go; I will not leave.

349
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:09,739
The whole city knows that I'm your woman.

350
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:15,359
Moreover, my sudden disappearance would arouse even more suspicion.

351
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:22,119
Rest assured, I'll come up with an infallible plan.

352
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,920
Brother Yan,

353
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,940
wait.

<i>Young Master, please.</i>

<i>After you, please.</i>

<i>Good wine, come on.</i>

<i>Come, let me fill it up for you again.</i>

360
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,060
This is something I've just made for you, give it a try.

361
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,696
Chu Yue.

362
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:11,240
This... doesn't seem to fit quite right.

363
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,480
How did you come to a place like this?

364
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,100
Why have you come to a place like this?

365
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,980
Is that old problem of yours acting up again?

366
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,559
Do you have too much money and nowhere to spend it?

367
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,200
Chu Yue is inside, right?

368
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:46,820
Whatever it is, we'll talk about it when we get back.

369
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,000
Look at you, all guilty like a thief.

370
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,220
How many disgraceful things have you done, exactly?

371
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,719
Don't talk nonsense here.

372
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,640
Brother Yan.

373
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,179
I've thought it through, you're right.

374
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:12,440
But whether this overcoat fits well,

375
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,119
we won't know until you try it on.

376
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,699
Even if it doesn't fit, you can still keep it.

377
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:24,279
Keep it! Come on, I'll keep it for him.

378
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,720
Didn't you say we should talk at home?

379
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,820
Let's go, back home.

380
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,088
I'll come to see you again in a few days.

381
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:40,079
He must be a woman.

382
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:43,499
Chu Yue, you have to be careful.

383
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:47,999
Make sure you don't lose Commander Yan, this cash cow.

384
00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:54,760
This overcoat is nice and warm.

385
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,359
With this, Commander Yan won't fear even the coldest weather.

386
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,659
Aren't you tired?

387
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:02,000
Not tired. Look. We're already at the doorstep.

388
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,739
Let's go back and have some water, I can keep talking.

389
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:05,728
Xiao Qiangzi.

390
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,739
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

391
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:14,799
Xiao Qiangzi, I'm free today and came to see you especially.

392
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,480
Are your wounds healed?

393
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,879
Much better! Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

394
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:22,279
I'm not at ease with you recuperating here.

395
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:24,120
Maybe you should return to my side.

396
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,960
The conditions at my place are better, more convenient for your recovery.

397
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:30,776
That seems reasonable.

398
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:33,260
- That won't do.
- Why?

399
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:38,820
After all, her status is lowly.

400
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,519
Your Majesty is kind to show concern for Xiao Qiangzi's severe injuries.

401
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,160
But outsiders who see this will inevitably talk. They'll accuse Xiao Qiangzi of being spoiled and arrogant.

402
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,020
It could also affect Your Majesty's reputation.

403
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,359
Your Majesty, I was just about to report to you.

404
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:54,020
Recently, I've noticed some issues with the lifestyles of Thousand Feather Guards.

405
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,220
And there's also this issue with their ideology.

406
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,880
It's a fundamental problem.

407
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,120
But rest assured, as one of Your Majesty's people,

408
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,000
I will certainly be able to help you solve this problem at its root.

409
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,459
- But the wounds on you…
- Your Majesty, it's getting late.

410
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:10,599
As the ruler of a nation, busy with countless state affairs, Your Majesty needs rest.

411
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:12,820
Once my injury is healed, I will come to see you immediately.

412
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,920
- I respectfully see off Your Majesty.
- I respectfully see off Your Majesty.

413
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,836
Very well, I shall take my leave now.

414
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,240
Can we now talk about the issue between the two of us?

415
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,739
It's getting late, I'll go look for Tianjiao and the others.

416
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:40,839
Yan Changyun, you've become quite capable, haven't you?

417
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,376
Don't move.

418
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:58,399
Your body hasn't fully recovered, don't be reckless.

419
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:02,480
Commander Yan, are you lecturing me?

420
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,039
I am concerned about you.

421
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:07,039
Why bother? Why do you care about me?

422
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,079
You should care for the delicate Miss Chu Yue.

423
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,100
Look, she can sing and dance.

424
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,259
And she can make overcoats.

425
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:18,880
Commander Yan, why aren't you wearing your overcoat today?

426
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,079
Show Jiaojiao what you are wearing.

427
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,799
- I don't want to.
- What overcoat?

428
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,140
You probably don't know, do you?

429
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,459
Miss Chu Yue has madean overcoat for Commander Yan.

430
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:30,259
The embroidery is as big as this.

431
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:32,520
It's just an overcoat, nothing so impressive.

432
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,319
Any woman with hands can make one.

433
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,219
Boss, we must not be swayed by these small favors.

434
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:39,960
After all...

435
00:30:46,739 --> 00:30:49,479
Tianjiao, what you said just now made a lot of sense.

436
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:52,699
But I say, even if our leader is very wise,

437
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:54,499
it would be hard for him to pass this test.

438
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:57,759
No, I have to buy an overcoat for Boss.

439
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,120
<i>[Sewing and Tailoring Tutorial]</i>
Actually, being with Yan Changyun is pretty good.

440
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,119
He looks quite all right.

441
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,299
The job, it's not bad either.

442
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:14,519
He's also Thousand Feather Guards' Commander. It's not a loss by any means.

443
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,439
No matter how you calculate it, it's not a loss.

444
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:21,200
Even if it's a loss, he's destined to meet me, which is a disaster in his life.

445
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:26,239
Moreover, Yan Changyun has long known that I am a woman.

446
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:29,159
And he deliberately helped me conceal it.

447
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Isn't it just because he's afraid that after everyone knows,

448
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,219
and there will be too many men pursuing me, and you'd feel insecure?

449
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:39,920
Men, I understand.

450
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,799
This book is of no use.

451
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:48,519
This man clearly likes me but intentionally doesn't say it.

452
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:51,219
Such a grown man, yet he's so timid.

453
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:53,700
Never mind, I will forgive him.

454
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,880
All right then.

455
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,160
In that case, I will grudgingly make an overcoat for you.

456
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:05,079
It's not like I have to make an overcoat.

457
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:08,979
What matters is the thought, changing the approach is not out of the question.

458
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:10,792
Quite good.

459
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,640
Truly ingenious and skillful.

460
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:53,019
The relationship between Xiao Qiangzi and Commander Yan has been getting closer recently.

461
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:55,680
Lately, he doesn't seem to care much about me.

462
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:00,939
From now on, in his eyes what place could I possibly have?

463
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,420
No, go and call Xiao Qiangzi here.

464
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,880
Your Majesty, someone was sent to call him this morning.

465
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,600
Xiao Qiangzi is busy making a cloak.

466
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,110
If I tell you to go, then go.

Sick, seriously?

469
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,400
Your Majesty, I heard that you were ill.

470
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,600
The illness is so serious?

471
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,480
Help me up.

472
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,152
Come.

473
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,279
Ever since you went to Thousand Feather Guards, you haven't associated with me,

474
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,400
and even less so to come and see me.

475
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,640
I'm busy, aren't I?

476
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,620
I feel upset inside.

477
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,700
Your Majesty, if you say you're sick, then here I am.

478
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,140
I know you're busy with the guards, I can't bear to disturb you.

479
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,500
What are you talking about? We're friends.

480
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,039
Didn't I come as soon as I was told?

481
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

482
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,160
Why has Commander Yan come?

483
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,660
I heard that Your Majesty is ill and I was worried.

484
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,960
I have specially brought Imperial Physician Qu to check Your Majesty's pulse.

485
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:23,760
I am well aware of my own body.

486
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,199
I'll just rest. Imperial Physician Qu, please return

487
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,220
Your Majesty, you are the pillar of the Southern Kingdom.

488
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,932
Your body must not have the slightest problem.

489
00:34:33,932 --> 00:34:35,740
- Imperial Physician Qu.
- Yes.

490
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,300
- Check his pulse.
- Yes.

491
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,280
Your Majesty.

492
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:03,660
Your Majesty, you…

493
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,599
It must be very serious, right?

494
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:11,660
Very serious, extremely serious.

495
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,760
Your Majesty, you seem to have caught a chill.

496
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,560
Too severe.

497
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,700
That serious? What should we do then?

498
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,940
Your Majesty, shall I go and stew some warm soup for you?

499
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,040
Your Majesty, with a chill you should rest in bed and recuperate.

500
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,660
It's not suitable to have too much contact with outsiders.

501
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,860
Firstly, it affects the dragon's body recovery.

502
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,560
Secondly, if by any chance the chill spreads,

503
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,400
it could affect the entire imperial harem.

504
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,060
- Eunuch Feng.
- Yes.

505
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,508
Give the orders.

506
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:48,340
No one shall approach His Majesty to disturb his rest.

507
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,400
It can't be that serious, can it?

508
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,560
Your Majesty, you must still consider your health.

509
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,519
Me and Xiao Qiangzi shall take our leave.

510
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,760
Your Majesty, please take good care of yourself.

511
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,419
- I will come to see you again in a few days.
- Your servant also takes his leave.

512
00:36:04,419 --> 00:36:07,020
Come, lie down.

513
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,700
Come, good, lie down.

514
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,760
Cover up, off I go.

515
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,119
Xiao Qiangzi! Xiao…

516
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:27,779
You're worried about me?

517
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:32,440
I just feel that your injury hasn't healed yet.

518
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,800
Don't run around to avoid troubling others.

519
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,160
Rest assured, my wound has long since healed.

520
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,439
It was Eunuch Feng who said His Majesty was seriously ill.

521
00:36:40,439 --> 00:36:41,920
Do you trust him that much?

522
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,480
It's not a matter of trust.

523
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,259
Look, Your Majesty is so weak.

524
00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:50,900
His face is still so pale. Could it be that he has applied powder?

525
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,840
It's not impossible.

526
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,360
How could a man use rouge and face powder?

527
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,080
How could a man not use rouge and face powder?

528
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,720
Yan Changyun, His Majesty is the ruler of the nation.

529
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,719
If he summons me due to illness, can I disobey the order?

530
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,519
Am I right?

531
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,519
Is it not our duty to protect His Majesty?

532
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:17,320
You want to protect His Majesty, don't you?

533
00:37:18,212 --> 00:37:20,280
<i>[Training Ground]</i>

534
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,000
What are you doing at the training ground this late at night?

535
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,652
Draw your sword.

536
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,900
Draw your sword.

537
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,800
For what?

538
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,660
Training.

539
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,560
Right now?

540
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:54,599
Aren't you supposed to protect His Majesty?

541
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,699
How can you protect His Majesty if you don't master martial arts?

542
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:01,120
Isn't he your best friend?

543
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,519
Commander Yan, I find you rather petty.

544
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,039
I don't understand what you are saying.

545
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,079
Alright, don't be angry.

546
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,679
You are also my best friend.

547
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:25,880
Really?

548
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,712
Of course.

549
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,380
Then, as your best friend, help me out.

550
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,460
No problem, what do you need help with?

551
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:37,360
<i>[Yunshao Bureau]</i>
Sir, please come inside.

552
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,760
Well done, Yan Changyun.

553
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,059
Secretly meeting with an old flame,
while making me stand guard here.

554
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm not jealous.
What have I got to be jealous about?

555
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,530
How can Chu Yue compare to me? I'm not jealous.
