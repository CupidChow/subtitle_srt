Of course, go ahead and ask.

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,399
Why do you like Yan Changyun?

131
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,600
He's different from others.

132
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,500
Because there's light in his eyes.

133
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,800
Your Highness,

134
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,700
you already have so many young men around you.

Why are you still not satisfied?

136
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,500
Besides, forcing men to like you is not good. Right?

137
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,200
I have never forced anyone.

138
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,519
They are all willing.

There are some things you might never understand.

The world is not only about love.

141
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,300
The reason they are willing to follow me one after another

142
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,000
is not only because of my charm but also because of my power.

143
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,800
I wonder if it's because I've been dieting and exercising a lot recently

144
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,700
that I always feel especially tired and lack energy.

145
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,500
Since you're not feeling spirited,

146
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,200
how about I send you some more incense?

147
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,800
Smelling it more will make you feel much better.

148
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,400
Sure.

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,700
Your Highness, what exactly is this incense made of?

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,400
It's a royal secret recipe of our kingdom.

One of a kind in the world.

152
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,100
If I tell you,

153
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,600
when the two kingdoms start trading in the future,

154
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,600
how would we make money?

155
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Yes, that makes sense.

156
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,900
I actually have something else that would suit you better.

157
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,300
Wait a moment.

158
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,700
Go and get the thing.

00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,200
Yes.

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
This is our kingdom's exclusive face cream.

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,400
This is plum blossom ointment, orchid cream, and osmanthus oil.

162
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,000
Look at the wrinkles you've got at such a young age.

163
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,600
You surely don't take good care of your skin.

I guarantee that after you use them, your face will be radiant.

Men will fall in love with you when they see you.

168

Thank you, Your Highness.

169
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,800
This one is for daytime use, and this is for nighttime.

170
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,750
Both.

171

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,100
Yes.

180
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,000
What's different?

181
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,500
Look at my skin.

182
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,100
And my hair.

183
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,200
My spirit and…

184
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,000
my complexion are all better now.

185
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,000
Why did he leave? Isn't it enough?

186
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,700
<i>[Imperial Spring Palace]</i>

187
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,800
Your Majesty, this is the trade agreement that was discussed by me and several officials.

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,600
If we open trade,

189
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,500
our kingdom will definitely reap huge profits.

190
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,800
Within three years, the national treasury will be filled.

191
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,730
Very good.

192
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll have to trouble you, Official Xiao, with the trade agreement.

193
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,100
As you command. Your Majesty, I will take my leave.

194
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,800
All right.

195
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,000
This is the draft trade agreement prepared by Xiao Quan with the other ministers.

196
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Read it.

197
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,000
There are no issues with these clauses.

198
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,800
But, Your Majesty, have you noticed?

199
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,000
In all the accompanying conditions, the Dark-Green Imperial Incense is included.

200
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,000
This incense is a precious thing of the Ning Kingdom.

201
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Xiao Quan seems to have done it for our kingdom's good.

202
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,100
But I feel like he has other motives.

203
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,600
Have you checked the incense?

204
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,900
Yes, and I found no issues with it.

205
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,200
But I've recently discovered

206
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,400
after excessive use of that incense, some people find it hard

207
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,700
to control themselves and are overly excited.

208
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Your Majesty, please give me more time

209
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,700
to further investigate the incense.

210
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,700
I will delay the cooperation and give you time.

211
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
It's just that you'll have a hard time

212
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,900
because you can only start the investigation with Princess Jiayang.

213
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm starving to death.

214
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,100
How come there's no effect after exercising so hard for several days?

215
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,400
Good morning, Brother Qiang.

216
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,000
Morning.

217
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,600
Xiao Daozi, how come I feel like you've lost weight these days?

218
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,700
Probably because I've just not been resting well lately.

219
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,600
Brother Qiang, do you have any Dark-Green Imperial Incense?

220
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Don't get me started. It was all taken away by Yan Changyun.

221
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,700
He didn't leave any for me.

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,800
Are you okay? Maybe you should see an imperial physician.

223
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,700
I'm fine; just a bit under the weather.

224
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,700
I better save the money.

225
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,800
All right then. Get some good rest for the next couple of days

226
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,000
and don't come to serve me.

227
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,200
Thank you for your understanding. I'll go back.

228
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,800
- Go.
- I'm so sleepy.

229
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,700
So poor.

230
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm starving to death.

231
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,100
That's not right. I've been exercising so hard these days.

232
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,800
How come I've still gained three jin?

233
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,600
- Silver.
- Three taels.

234
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,100
It's three taels each, you know.

235
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,000
This isn't fair.

236
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,700
You all eat well every day.

237
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,000
Diced rabbit meat, twice-cooked pork, and barbecue.

238
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,420
I was drooling just looking at you.

239
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,800
Can I not give you?

240
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,000
Don't put on a pitiful act.

241
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
A bet's a bet.

242
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,300
Nine taels of silver. Not a tael less.

243
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,039
Thousand Feather Guards are prohibited from gambling.

244
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,400
Violators will be fined ten taels of silver.

245
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,300
- Commander.
- Hand it over.

246
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,200
Commander, she started it.

247
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,400
That's right.

248
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,100
So you can't accept it?

249
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,200
Have you forgotten Article 96 of the Thousand Feather Guards regulations?

250
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,000
Hurry up.

251
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You're really giving it?

252
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,100
I didn't earn anything.

253
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,000
Let's go.

254
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Come on.

255
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
Oh, well.

256
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm hungry. Go and buy me something to eat.

257
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,800
What do you want to eat?

258
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,400
Diced rabbit meat, twice-cooked pork, and barbecue.

259
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,800
Keep the change as an errand fee.

260
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,700
All right. I'll even make 21 taels.

261
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,600
Changyun.

262
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,900
Your Highness.

263
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,800
Changyun, you're really smart.

264
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,400
I really like your attitude of feeling at a loss if not taking advantage.

265
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
You must be joking.

266
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
You're such an excellent person.

267
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Staying in the Southern Kingdom is beneath your talent, isn't it?

268
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,700
Why not come with me to the Ning Kingdom?

269
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,400
I will give you everything you want.

270
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,500
I will surely provide you with a better future.

271
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,300
Thank you for your appreciation.

272
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,800
It's just that I'm a subject of the Southern Kingdom.

273
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,200
I cannot just leave as I wish.

274
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,930
Don't worry about this.

275
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,000
As long as you say yes, I have my ways.

276
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,100
From now on, if you want to eat something, go and buy it yourself.

277
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,300
I don't have time.

278
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Disappointed, sad.

279
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,300
Crisis lurks everywhere.

280
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,000
Can you understand my music?

281
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,800
I don't understand, but I feel this tune

282
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,200
seems to have plucked at my heartstrings.

283
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,600
Sister Chu Yue, you stay in the house every day,

284
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,200
so you don't know what Yan Changyun is doing now.

285
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,500
Your current situation is very critical, extremely unfavorable.

286
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:01,459
I think the one who's anxious is you.

287
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,939
It's us. She has bewitched Yan Changyun

288
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,879
to such an extent that he can no longer tell north from south, nor smell good or bad.

289
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,020
I have heard of the reputation of Princess Jiayang.

290
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,600
But at best, they are just some petty tricks.

291
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,800
- They're nothing.
- That's great then.

292
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,699
Hurry up and use whatever tricks you have.

293
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:28,060
Tell me what's special about her.

294
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,240
That is no matter what she says to you,

295
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,479
she always finds an opportunity to touch you.

296
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:37,840
She raises her eyebrows

297
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,759
and gives you the glad eye

298
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,639
as if she wants to devour you.

299
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:45,500
From what you say, she's really got something.

300
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,060
For such an outstanding man like Yan Changyun,

301
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,740
of course, he would like an excellent woman. There's nothing wrong with that.

302
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,540
Besides, Jiayang is a princess.

303
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,419
If one day he rises to great heights,

304
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:00,680
why would I stop him?

305
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,939
No, Yan Changyun is not the type

306
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:07,800
to marry Princess Jiayang out of vanity.

307
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,319
I won't let him go to the Ning Kingdom.

308
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,500
My Lady.

309
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,520
Wangyou, how did you get here?

310
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,400
Boss had me redeem her at the Yunshao Bureau to take care of you.

311
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,899
After all, Wangyou has been by your side for so many years.

312
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:26,660
With her here, Boss wll be relieved.

313
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,020
Thank him for me.

314
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,120
All right, I'll be leaving.

315
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,520
- Wangyou, come here.
- Okay.

316
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,320
<i>[Barracks]</i>

317
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,520
Fu Xiao,

318
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,939
- what are you doing?
- Where is Yan Changyun?

319
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:44,580
He must be with Princess Jiayang now.

320
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,200
Let's go and bring him back.

321
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,560
You? Can you get him back?

322
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,379
How can I not? In what way am I inferior to her?

323
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:58,179
In terms of figure, looks and intelligence…

324
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,580
<i>Doesn't Princess Jiayang like strong men?</i>

325
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,579
<i>Aren't these men strong?</i>

326
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,500
A'Cheng, your boss is in danger.

327
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,859
As if I don't know what you really think.

328
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:15,640
Think about what kind of woman Princess Jiayang is.

329
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,300
Yan Changyun is so close to her every day.

330
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,299
Sooner or later, he will be taken away.

331
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:21,740
Do you hope for him to be taken away?

332
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,360
What are you talking about, Xiao Qiangzi?

333
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,200
So, to protect your boss,

334
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,960
to help Yan Changyun escape danger,

335
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,919
would you like to take a risk?

336
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,840
You all disappoint me too much.

337
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,339
Boss is so good to you.

338
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:42,999
But at the crucial moment, not one of you stands up.

339
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,959
Chengcheng, when I was speaking just now, you agreed the most.

340
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,940
Come up.

341
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,279
Aren't you afraid that I will be taken away?

342
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,740
Useless.

343
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,279
Erniu, it's time to repay the boss.

344
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,039
How could I possibly handle such a stunning beauty like the princess?

345
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,459
I can't.

346
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:11,048
Crap.

347
00:23:11,048 --> 00:23:12,160
Jiaojiao.

348
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,580
I can't.

349
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:17,340
I might look strong, but I'm actually just flabby.

350
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,020
This is what you've trained for.

351
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,640
There are so many of you, and none of you can do it?

352
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,500
Who said that?

353
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:37,079
At the critical moment, it still has to be me.

354
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,179
Good.

355
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,680
<i>- Good.
- Good.</i>

356
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,360
Brave.

357
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,440
When Princess Jiayang comes out,

358
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,020
you three will scare her.

359
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,379
Then Chang Sheng will step out to save her.

360
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,020
Don't worry. I used to have a nickname.

361
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,179
Casanova.

362
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:06,980
To win over a strong-willed woman,

363
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,640
one must use his strong arm

364
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,899
to wrap around her waist

365
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,460
and then look down at her

366
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,640
with a condescending look, making her completely fall for him.

367
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,050
I'm counting on you, Casanova.

368
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,119
<i>[Azure Garden]</i>

369
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,880
Miss, are you alone?

370
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,739
Why not join us guys for some fun?

371
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:35,960
- What are you going to do?
- Stop!

372
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,139
Come on, don't be shy.

373
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,440
The condescending look.

374
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,419
The mature and charming smile.

375
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,119
<i>I don't believe I can't charm you.</i>

376
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,920
Help me!

377
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,060
I'm just a lackey. I'm not the mastermind!

378
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,279
You think I don't know this is your trick?

379
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,600
If you don't like it, just tell me. Why hit me?

380
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,239
No more hitting or I'll be angry. Stop hitting!

381
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,536
Keep acting.

382
00:25:50,536 --> 00:25:51,240
I was wrong.

383
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,980
I'm sorry, bro.

384
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,040
Not the face!

385
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,520
<i>[Azure Garden]</i>

386
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,210
Your Highness, are you asleep?

387
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,200
<i>It's me.</i>

388
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,820
Your Highness.

389
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,384
<i>I'm asleep!</i>

390
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,719
How can one talk if they're asleep?

391
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:25,279
<i>I have a huge secret to tell you.</i>

392
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,200
It's about Yan Changyun.

393
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,340
The truth about Yan Changyun.

394
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,910
Go ahead.

395
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,970
What are you going to tell me?

396
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:08,320
Your Highness, you have no idea how utterly vile Yan Changyun is.

397
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,759
Tell me.

398
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,920
He has a severe propensity for violence,

399
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,079
ready to draw his sword at the slightest provocation.

400
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,440
And when he does draw, he kills people with every strike.

401
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,340
Changyun is surprisingly brave.

402
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,640
But it sounds like there are many villains in your kingdom.

403
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,600
Otherwise, Changyun wouldn't have been so exhausted.

404
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,252
No.

405
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,640
Yan Changyun is despicable, shameless, and scheming.

406
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,359
He especially likes to play dirty tricks.

407
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:42,200
Your Highness, you might have been set up by him without realizing it.

408
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,880
So it seems he is not only skilled in martial arts but also smart.

409
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
He's just perfect.

410
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,619
No, his character is not good.

411
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:55,500
Previously, in the Thousand Feather Guards Camp, when I shared a room with him,

412
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,020
he made me sleep on the ground and even threatened me with a sword.

413
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,200
I wasn't wrong about him.

414
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
He is a chaste man.

415
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,440
No, I was a man then. I was not a woman.

416
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,699
No wonder he made you sleep on the floor.

417
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,380
He is ruthless and vicious. It was he who brought down Duke Wei.

418
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,479
Who knows? Maybe Xiao Wanli was also taken down by him.

419
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,410
Decisive in killing. A real man.

420
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,400
Actually, I just admired Changyun before.

421
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,059
But hearing you say this, I have fallen in love with him.

422
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,100
No, you really don't have to.

423
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,840
Master Xiao, since you dislike him so much,

424
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,719
wouldn't it be just what you want if I take him away?

425
00:28:35,719 --> 00:28:39,100
No, I…

426
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:45,040
You are still too young.

427
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,360
As a woman,

428
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,039
I advise you to keep your options open.

429
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,519
Men are just an adornment.

430
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:57,460
Women need to learn to seize opportunities for themselves.

431
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,759
Your Highness, please forgive me.

432
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,719
I have failed to guard and allowed someone to disturb you.

433
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,920
Why are you still sitting there? Get out of here!

434
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,816
Stop there.

435
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,419
I just heard someone saying I was despicable, shameless,

436
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:45,200
scheming, sarcastic,

437
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,780
ruthless and vicious.

438
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,120
Yes, I was talking about you.

439
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,559
You seduced me in a despicable and shameless way.

440
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,620
You made me fall in love with you through your schemes.

441
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,039
You wanted to obstruct me in a sarcastic manner.

442
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,840
You pushed me away ruthlessly and viciously.

443
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,340
Yan Changyun, do you find me revolving around you every day

444
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:19,020
amusing and satisfying?

445
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,840
If it's so painful,

446
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,890
why persist?

447
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,240
Who's persisting? The princess is right.

448
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,279
A woman should keep her options open.

449
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,980
She has got four young men around her named after four seasons.

450
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:40,040
Can't I have my own 24 solar terms?

451
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,020
<i>You have had a hard time.</i>

452
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:57,280
<i>I got close to Princess Jiayang just to investigate her connection with the vermilion silver powder case.</i>

453
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,440
<i>After everything comes to light, I definitely will be done with her.</i>

454
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,190
<i>Do you believe me?</i>

455
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,920
<i>I believe you, Yan Changyun.</i>
<i>[Azure Garden]</i>

456
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,419
<i>- Mr. Wang, you're here.
- Yes.</i>

457
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:15,419
<i>Please come in.</i>

458
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:20,972
<i>[Yunshao Bureau]</i>

459
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:22,600
Look.

460
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,700
This is it. Follow me.

461
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,500
Let's go.

462
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:40,680
This is a well-known spot for amusement in our kingdom.

463
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,759
Today, let's eat and drink freely.

464
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,880
My treat.

465
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,479
Thank you, Master Xiao.

466
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,940
Let's go.

467
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,899
I must admit I have not done enough as an official.

468
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:59,410
I should have taken you out to have fun earlier.

469
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,270
Let's drink.

470
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,880
- Thank you, Master Xiao.
- Thank you, Master Xiao.

471
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,800
<i>If Princess Jiayang is fishy,</i>

472
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,179
<i>her four personal guards must know something.</i>

473
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,400
<i>Let me help Yan Changyun to probe them.</i>

474
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,519
By the way, actually, I have a question to ask you.

475
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,639
Feel free to ask us.

476
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:25,939
Today, you performed really well.

477
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,220
It's you.

478
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,570
It's been a long time since we last met in the Ning Kingdom.

479
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,620
<i>It's him.</i>

480
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,780
Let's have a good drink today.

481
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,440
You've mistaken me for someone else. I've never been to the Ning Kingdom.

482
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,560
I clearly saw him there.

483
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,450
Strange.

484
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,700
Come on. Let's drink.

485
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,920
Come on.

486
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,079
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

487
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,520
Here.

488
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,740
What on earth is it?

489
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,600
Keep your voice down. I have a major discovery.

490
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,620
I took the four young men of the Ning Kingdom to the Yunshao Bureau just now.

491
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,388
Guess who I ran into.

492
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:33,879
- You took them there!
- Keep it down.

493
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,400
Why did you take them there?

494
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,340
No, why is your focus point so strange?

495
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,039
The issue with me going to the Yunshao Bureau, compared with what I've found out, is nothing at all.

496
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:52,600
The biggest issue right now is the four young men of the Ning Kingdom are really fishy.

497
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,340
Do you actually understand what the problem is?

498
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,612
What's the problem?

499
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:12,159
Okay, you remember the manager of Xiao's embroidery workshop. Right?

500
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,460
I found out that he knew the four young men a long time ago

501
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,259
and that they had met in the Ning Kingdom long before.

502
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,559
So what?

503
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,399
- Why aren't you excited at all?
- Why should I be excited?

504
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,280
This shows Xiao Quan had already colluded with the Ning Kingdom

505
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,180
and that Princess Jiayang came with bad intentions.

506
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,840
<i>She approached the four young men because of me.</i>

507
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,020
<i>No, this is too dangerous.</i>

508
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,079
Your speculation is groundless.

509
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,280
The embroidery workshop manager can have 100 reasons to refute you.

510
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,039
If he accuses you of framing him, what will you do?

511
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,030
- Then I will—
- You are not allowed to approach the princess

512
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,770
and those around her in private.

513
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:52,020
Don't meddle in other people's business. Do you hear me?

514
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,090
Fine, I'm nosy.

515
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,640
My kindness only got me criticism.

516
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,360
I will never meddle in your affairs again.

517
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,899
And don't meddle in mine either.

518
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,679
What happened?

519
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,999
Nothing. Have someone keep a close watch on the princess

520
00:35:17,999 --> 00:35:20,440
and especially those four young men around her.

521
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,920
Yes.

522
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,760
Are you sure you were not recognized by Fu Xiao?

523
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,800
<i>[Bright Moonlight]</i>
No, I told Chunri he made a mistake

524
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,400
and then I left.

525
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,840
The Yunshao Bureau is a mix of people.

526
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,119
Your careless words may be used by others.

527
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,939
Be careful and don't run around everywhere in the next few days.

528
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:47,159
If any slip-up happens,

529
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:50,639
even the lives of your whole family won't compensate for it.

530
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:52,340
I understand.

531
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,708
You may leave.

532
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,230
Yes.

533
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,700
My Lord.

534
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,320
The emperor has yet to sign the trade agreement.

535
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,539
He might be suspicious of us.

536
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:11,520
The trade agreement must be signed soon in case of unexpected problems.

537
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,660
I have a secret letter here. Give it to Princess Jiayang.

538
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,019
Tell her she must not lose the big picture for the sake of small matters.

539
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:22,040
No matter what the emperor asks for tomorrow, she must agree.

540
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,400
Only after we sign the trade agreement can we proceed to the next step of the plan.

541
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,080
Yes.

542
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,320
<i>[Bright Moonlight]</i>

543
00:36:43,979 --> 00:36:49,260
Your Majesty, any problems with this trade agreement?

544
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,880
Your goods are of good quality and cheap.

545
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,559
Once they enter, they will surely be in great demand.

546
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:03,280
I'm afraid our merchants will have to endure a significant impact.

547
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,999
Your Majesty, feel free to say it.

548
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:12,199
If you can accept a 50 percent tariff,

549
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,720
I will agree to open trade.

550
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,119
Let's settle on the 50 percent tariff.

551
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,079
You are quite straightforward.

552
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,520
Since you're so sincere,

553
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,999
let's finalize this matter after the New Year.

554
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,790
As you wish.

555
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:36,030
Your Majesty, I will comply with the tariff increase.

556
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:40,519
But you must agree to a condition.

557
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,240
What condition?

558
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,979
I want to appoint Commander Yan as my consort.

559
00:37:46,979 --> 00:37:49,140
Your consort?
