21
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,940
My Lord, please calm down.

22
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,950
I have heard about what happened today.

23
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,740
Yan Changyun is really too arrogant.

24
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,200
Yan Changyun, what a good trick.

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,439
Making Song Ting become the scapegoat for the Qin Family's crimes.

26
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,880
But he also exposed himself.

27
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,740
My Lord, what should we do next?

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,519
Next...

29
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,960
It's time for Princess Jiayang to show up.

30
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,559
Brother Yan, wipe your sweat.

31
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,484
Thanks.

32
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:25,080
Yan Changyun has taken Chu Yue back to his mansion, hasn't he?

33
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,010
He just pities her.

34
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,660
He's not that kind of man.

35
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,640
Look at you! You just don't understand men.

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,740
Nine out of ten men are fickle,

37
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,880
with only one remaining faithful and devoted.

38
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,004
- Which one?
- Me.

39
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:47,500
- I knew it. I shall take my leave.
- Fu Xiao!

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,420
Come back to me.

41
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,950
Stop scrubbing squat toilets.

42
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,800
I'll appoint you as a court official.

43
00:03:56,499 --> 00:04:00,179
Your Majesty, you need to report this matter to Grand Empress Dowager.

44
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:03,720
If Grand Empress Dowager finds out you allowed Fu Xiao to return

45
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,520
from the Washery Lane without her consent,

46
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,460
I-I-I will have to take a beating for you again.

47
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,456
Your Majesty, my buttocks can't withstand it anymore.

48
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:17,700
Your Majesty, you haven't mentioned it to Grand Empress Dowager?

49
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,140
Am... I not busy?

50
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,640
Understood. Then, Your Majesty, don't bother.

51
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,280
I am quite content at the Washery Lane.

52
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,700
Your empty promises aren't even as pleasant as squat toilets.

53
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,199
- I shall take my leave.
- You…

54
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,759
I'm going to scrub squat toilets.

55
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,960
What does she mean by that?

56
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,619
Why do I feel like she was mocking you?

57
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,840
I was wrong.

58
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,700
Your Majesty, next month, Princess Jiayang of the Ning Kingdom will come to visit

59
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,280
to discuss opening up trade between the two kingdoms.

60
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,120
Okay. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should prepare for the reception.

61
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,160
Your Majesty, we do not have female officials.

62
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,650
We're all men.

63
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,430
It may not be appropriate.

64
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,079
As if you've never hosted female guests.

65
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,879
What's the problem?

66
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,280
Your Majesty, this time, it is different.

67
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,960
Why?

68
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,659
Princess Jiayang has a very high status in the Ning Kingdom,

69
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:33,400
on equal footing with their king.

70
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,759
She appears to be coming here to open the trade between the two kingdoms,

71
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,219
but in reality, it is very likely that she's coming to select a husband.

72
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:44,280
<i>Selecting a husband?</i>

73
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,979
<i>Princess Jiayang is going to select a husband?</i>

74
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,444
Selecting a husband? Good.

75
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:50,900
Our land abounds with excellent young men.

76
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,299
Let her choose if she likes.

77
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:57,960
Any of you who catches her eye will be handsomely rewarded.

78
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,879
Your Majesty, you may not know.

79
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,539
Princess Jiayang has married three times

80
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:06,480
and has brought about the death of four husbands.

81
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,530
Please show mercy and assign a female official to receive her,

82
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,750
Your Majesty.

83
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,944
Are you overthinking it?

84
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:17,660
Lift up your head.

85
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,199
Look at yourself. Your belly is bigger than your head.

86
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,080
Even I can't stand the sight. Do you think the princess would fancy you?

87
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,419
That's hard to say.

88
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,740
All right.

89
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,539
- Mr. Li.
- Here.

90
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,319
Your wife is a First-Class Imperial Lady.

91
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,460
Let her be the one to receive Princess Jiayang.

92
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,060
Your Majesty, please don't.

93
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,020
You've just heard it.

94
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,959
Your Majesty, I earnestly request you to rescind the order.

95
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,539
Fine.

96
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,604
Thank you, Your Majesty.

97
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:53,544
Zhang Wuyong.

98
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:56,920
Your Majesty.

99
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,960
I remember your sister is the granddaughter of Grand Empress Dowager's sister.

100
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,859
With such a status, it's reasonable for her to go.

101
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:09,539
Your Majesty, my sister is still unmarried.

102
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,239
If word gets out that she mingles with such a woman,

103
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:15,960
how could she marry off, Your Majesty?

104
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,080
Okay! Everyone,

105
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,759
who can receive Princess Jiayang?

106
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,079
<i>Well…</i>

107
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,439
So none of you officials can take on this important task?

108
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,150
None of them are useful!

109
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,160
All of them are trash!

110
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,439
What is that smell on you?

111
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,024
What smell? The smell of squat toilets.

112
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:48,712
- Stay away from me.
- Come on, Your Majesty.

113
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:51,580
I can't stand scrubbing squat toilets anymore, Your Majesty.

114
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,519
Your Majesty, when exactly can I stop scrubbing?

115
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,039
You can stop when Fu Xiao stops.

116
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:02,280
- Your Majesty.
- Go out.

117
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,700
I have an idea.

118
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,919
Let Ms. Fu Xiao be in charge of receiving Princess Jiayang.

119
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,799
This way, she can not only escape the drudgery of scrubbing squat toilets,

120
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,660
this is still an opportunity to distinguish herself.

121
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,800
As long as she does it well for our kingdom,

122
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,360
you might even be able to persuade Grand Empress Dowager

123
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,020
to grant her the title of a concubine.

124
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,840
Not bad, Feng Shixi. Quite smart.

125
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,799
Thank you for the compliment, Your Majesty.

126
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,460
What are you waiting for?

127
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,750
Go get her.

128
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,719
Ms. Fu Xiao.

129
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,800
You are the reception official specially appointed by His Majesty.

130
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,040
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

131
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,930
Don't mention it.

132
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,000
Fu Xiao,

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,840
now you know who is really good to you, don't you?

134
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,260
I moved you out of the Clean Room as promised.

135
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,740
Your Majesty, you're great this time.

136
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,120
Of course. I specially had someone design

137
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,880
the clothes you are wearing.

138
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,359
Don't they all say Princess Jiayang is beautiful?

139
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,919
I'll let them see

140
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:30,000
what a gorgeous woman is like.

141
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:31,920
Don't cry.

142
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,080
This is just the beginning.

143
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:40,660
Four.

144
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,832
Good, retract.

145
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,100
How do I look? Is this outfit nice?

146
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,800
From today on, I am a sixth-rank female official

147
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,320
responsible for receiving Princess Jiayang.

148
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:06,599
You are the first sixth-rank female official who started as a squat toilet cleaner in history.

149
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,100
Congratulations.

150
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,419
Don't mention squat toilets anymore.

151
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:13,220
My origins don't matter. It's all in the past.

152
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,700
Don't mention squat toilets in front of me again.

153
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,740
Take off this outfit. You mustn't take this position.

154
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,619
On what grounds?

155
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:22,440
Haven't you heard the rumor

156
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,120
that Jiayang has been hanging out with a lot of men?

157
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,520
All the more reason to take the position.

158
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,432
You can hide a beauty in your house, but I can't have handsome men around?

159
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,980
Xiao Daozi.

160
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,636
Let's go.

161
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,890
Master, look.

162
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,552
She is having an affair with Yan Changyun. That traitor.

163
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,779
Don't talk about your junior sister like that.

164
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,140
Don't jump to conclusions before everything is confirmed.

165
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,640
How else can we be sure?

166
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,900
Look at the way she looks at Yan Changyun.

167
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,800
If not betrayal, then what is it?

168
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,880
Last time, you went behind my back to kill her.

169
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,120
I have not yet settled this matter with you.

170
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,110
Don't speak like this again.

171
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,280
I don't want to hear it.

172
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,759
<i>Here they come. Look.</i>

173
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,920
<i>This is Princess Jiayang of the Ning Kingdom.</i>

174
00:11:39,844 --> 00:11:42,470
<i>[Brilliance]</i>

175
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,479
<i>She's coming out.</i>

176
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,164
I'm Fu Xiao, the female reception officer of the Southern Kingdom.

177
00:12:03,164 --> 00:12:07,899
I'm responsible for all matters concerning Princess Jiayang's trip to the Southern Kingdom.

178
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,639
<i>Commander Yan, I told you all.
</i>

179
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,779
<i>Look at my hands. Those who have long-term contact with the vermilion silver powder</i>

180
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:24,459
<i>will get silver-grey marks on the root of their fingernails.</i>

181
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:26,432
<i>The vermilion silver powder.</i>

182
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,872
Please be careful.

183
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,760
I am Yan Changyun, the commander of the Thousand Feather Guards,

184
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,140
responsible for your safety during your stay in our kingdom.

185
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:49,760
Then I'll have to trouble Commander Yan this time.

186
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,200
Princess, you don't have to be polite.

187
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,120
Please feel free to make any requests.

188
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,539
I shall take care of you with utmost attention.

189
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:59,440
Please head to the Imperial Palace.

190
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,359
This way, please.

191
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,960
Thank you, Commander Yan.

192
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:20,940
Li'er, you and Fu Xiao

193
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,650
are my best disciples.

194
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,760
Sooner or later, I will leave this world before you.

195
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,359
By then, the two of you will be the closest people to each other in this world.

196
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:36,280
I have always hoped that both of you

197
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,559
can take care of and love each other.

198
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,700
I understand.

199
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,140
Master, do you want to see Fu Xiao?

200
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,779
It is not yet the time.

201
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,799
Princess Jiayang has arrived.

202
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,160
Greetings, Your Majesty. Wishing you fortune and longevity.

203
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,679
Princess, you don't have to be polite.

204
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,479
Our two kingdoms have lived in harmony.

205
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,240
It's about time we shared our resources.

206
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,679
This time, I've come as a representative of my kingdom

207
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,520
to discuss the opening of trade routes.

208
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,599
For the benefit of the people of both kingdoms, we hope you will consent.

209
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:35,939
This matter is of great significance.

210
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:39,260
We must discuss it thoroughly. No need to rush.

211
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,959
Tonight, I'm hosting a banquet for you.

212
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,000
- Please take a seat.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

213
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,959
The dance of the ladies is too delicate compared to the robustness of the men.

214
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,579
If you don't mind it,

215
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:45,640
four young men from my kingdom will present a dance for you.

216
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,040
Sure. That's a good idea.

217
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,860
Put on a good performance.

218
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,520
If you disgrace our kingdom, there's no need to return.

219
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,368
<i>Yes.</i>

220
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,916
Take them down.

221
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,400
I'm incompetent. We disturbed you.

222
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,699
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

223
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,899
Commander Yan, take it easy.

224
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,760
I believe Princess Jiayang has no intention of assassinating anyone.

225
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,720
Leave.

226
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:20,910
Your Majesty is wise.

227
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,800
It was my fault that I scared everyone.

228
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:27,328
To express apologies, I will present the newly-developed Dark-Green Imperial Incense

229
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:30,040
which I brought from my kingdom to everyone.

230
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,560
The incense has the effect of refreshing and invigorating the body.

231
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,200
Long-term use can also prolong life.

232
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,528
All along, they are exclusive to the nobles in our kingdom.

233
00:17:54,979 --> 00:17:57,599
So fragrant.

234
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,440
It's heartwarmingly delightful. It really has a revitalizing effect.

235
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,219
The scent is long-lasting.

236
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:11,419
Smelling it makes one feel exhilarated and relaxed.

237
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:14,359
It smells so good.

238
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,280
Commander Yan, everyone is full of praise for the Dark-Green Imperial Incense.

239
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,360
Commander Yan, why do you furrow your brows?

240
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,699
Are you dissatisfied with the incense?

241
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:34,699
Since it is a precious gift from you, how could I be dissatisfied?

242
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:37,300
It seems you're not only skilled in martial arts

243
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,780
but also have a way with words.

244
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,119
As the saying goes, a young hero emerges.

245
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,152
You're flattering me.

246
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,219
In a few days, it will be New Year's Eve in our kingdom.

247
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:55,280
You have come from afar. Why not stay for a few more days?

248
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,559
Commander Yan is highly skilled in martial arts.

249
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,419
With him here, I'm very much at ease.

250
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,499
I wonder if Commander Yan

251
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:05,699
could personally protect me during my time here.

252
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,600
Your Majesty, Commander Yan is a man.

253
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,219
Personal protection might be inappropriate.

254
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,680
<i>If Princess Jiayang takes a liking to Yan Changyun,</i>

255
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,759
<i>Fu Xiao will be mine.</i>

256
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,140
Your Majesty, I think it's inappropriate too.

257
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,339
Commander Yan is upright and exceptional.

258
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,419
With his close protection, I believe Princess Jiayang

259
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:40,359
will have some wonderful days in our kingdom.

260
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,030
Thank you, Your Majesty.

261
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,260
I think so too.

262
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,900
Are you all right, Your Highness?

263
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,040
I'm fine, Commander Yan. Your wines are so extraordinary.

264
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,760
I feel a bit dizzy.

265
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,484
Don't worry. Outside the palace, the residence arranged by His Majesty for you is very close.

266
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:20,200
Just hold on a little longer and we'll arrive.

267
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:27,044
All right. Can you escort me back to my room?

268
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,839
I'm willing to help.

269
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,580
<i>Chu Yue hasn't been dealt with yet, and now here comes Jiayang.</i>

270
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,584
<i>[Azure Garden]</i>

271
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:58,140
Your Highness, your room is here. Please go to bed early.

272
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,592
- Changyun.
- Changyun.

273
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,720
Didn't you promise the emperor to protect me closely?

274
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,260
Shouldn't you escort me back to my room?

275
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,820
Your Highness, I'll stay close,

276
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,580
while he protects you outside.

277
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,800
But you are so far away from my bed.

278
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,839
If I'm in danger, how will you protect me?

279
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,540
I've already dispatched guards to protect you outside.

280
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,739
I will not let villains get close to you.

281
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,300
You're so thoughtful.

282
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,470
But...

283
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,340
the night is too long.

284
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:48,419
Why is there a unique fragrance on you?

285
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,979
It's from the Dark-Green Imperial Incense.

286
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,820
I often burn it in my room,

287
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,580
so its fragrance will linger on me.

288
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,200
Changyun, if you like it,

289
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,930
you can have a sniff.

290
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,000
Let me have a sniff.

291
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:06,939
Yes, there is a fragrance.

292
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:09,580
But it is pleasant at first sniff,

293
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,940
and if you smell it for too long…

294
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,400
- I'm sorry.
- Ms. Fu, I have always disliked being close to women.

295
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,939
Please be aware of this.

296
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,359
Changyun, if you like it, I can give you some.

297
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:28,692
Chunri.

298
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,852
Your Highness.

299
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:40,459
Thank you. I will be staying in this residence.

300
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,680
You can order me anytime if there's anything needed.

301
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,559
Changyun, I may trouble you often from now on.

302
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,839
You must come when I ask.

303
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:54,239
Your Highness, I will live here too.

304
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,319
If you need anything,

305
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,308
as a reception lady, I will be at your service immediately.

306
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,000
With Changyun here, why bother others?

307
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,160
Isn't that right, Changyun?

308
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,499
Your Highness, it's getting late. Please go to bed early.

309
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:13,799
Go to bed early.

310
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,810
Changyun,

311
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,010
go to bed early.

312
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,519
- What?
- The incense.

313
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,340
You want it?

314
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,000
Cut the crap.

315
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,240
Go get it yourself.

316
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,804
You…

317
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,860
With so much offered to the palace already, I don't need yours.

318
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,808
You won't give it to me, fine.

319
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:10,852
<i>[Lying in Clouds, Listening to Springs]</i>

320
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:13,564
<i>[Minister's Mansion]</i>

321
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,279
Sir, you've had a tiring journey.

322
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:39,979
Try the tea I've specially prepared for you.

323
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,140
Why must it be Jiayang?

324
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,019
- Don't you know she is—
- I know she's your sister.

325
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:54,400
And I even know

326
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,720
when you were ousted from the Ning Kingdom,

327
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,380
she did not help you.

328
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,759
Now that you mention it,

329
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:05,759
you and your sister haven't seen each other for over a decade. Right?

330
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,519
This is a good opportunity to catch up.

331
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,340
Xiao Quan,

332
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,300
don't take things too far.

333
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,319
Otherwise, I'll turn against you.

334
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,960
You should understand, sir.

335
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,960
This matter is not for you or me to decide.

336
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,400
We are just pawns in this game of chess.

337
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,119
And so is Princess Jiayang.

338
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,060
We are both in the game.

339
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,119
How could there not be any risks?

340
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,200
But don't worry.

341
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,310
As long as we cooperate well,

342
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,160
we will certainly win this game.

343
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,820
Don't you just want to kill Yan Changyun? I can help you.

344
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,360
No,

345
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,210
times have changed.

346
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,570
Yan Changyun cannot die now.

347
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:10,740
What I need is to stabilize the situation.

348
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,400
Then I can carry out my plan.

349
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,640
As long as my plan proceeds smoothly,

350
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,200
getting rid of Yan Changyun

351
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,000
will just be a matter of convenience.

352
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:25,930
By the way,

353
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,759
your dear disciple has caused me quite a lot of trouble recently.

354
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,119
I hope you will discipline her strictly.

355
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,320
Fu Xiao is my disciple.

356
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,510
It's none of your concern.

357
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,920
You just value relationships too much.

358
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,000
But that's why I made friends with you.

359
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,680
Brother Qiang, even if you like the Dark-Green Imperial Incense,

360
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,839
you don't have to use it this way. It's too strong.

361
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:16,319
You don't know. I have studied it.

362
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:18,799
The reason men are so attracted to Princess Jiayang

363
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,160
is because, from head to toe, she smells of this incense.

364
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,719
So I must have the same scent as hers to keep a man's heart.

365
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:29,600
Light it for a bit longer. Add some more.

366
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,480
- Add more?
- Do it. Come on.

367
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,480
You're right. This scent is really enticing.

368
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,520
Right? Together.

369
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,084
Come on.

370
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,979
More.

371
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:58,160
Today, I noticed Princess Jiayang's nails have a silvery hue.

372
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,839
This is a symptom of long-term consumption of vermilion silver powder.

373
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,799
And the tattoo on her hand

374
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,899
is identical to the one on the person who chased me during the Guanyou Incident.

375
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,240
If I follow this clue of the tattoo,

376
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,016
perhaps I can find out the true culprit behind the incident.

377
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,840
That tattoo on Princess Jiayang's hand

378
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,479
is a unique mark of the Ning Kingdom's royal bloodline.

379
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:37,920
It was marked on her as soon as she was born.

380
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,019
Made by mixing cinnabar with pigeon's blood and tattooing it into the skin.

381
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,779
Normally, it's hidden beneath the skin.

382
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,459
It only becomes visible when the body temperature rises.

383
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:48,319
Today, Princess Jiayang must have had some wine.

384
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,639
It showed up with the rise in her body temperature.

385
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,219
This indicates the mastermind behind the Guanyou Incident

386
00:28:57,219 --> 00:29:00,459
must be related to the royal family of the Ning Kingdom.

387
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:03,660
Send our people to the Ning Kingdom to investigate the tattoo

388
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,220
and find the person who attempted to assassinate you back then.

389
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,520
Send a cautious person.

390
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,659
Yes.

391
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:14,079
<i>Changyun, you blockhead!</i>

392
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:19,100
Yan Changyun, where are you? Come out!

393
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,380
You two hurry up and take her back.

394
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,440
We can't handle this.

395
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,979
Boss, you guys talk. We're getting out of here.

396
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,260
Yan Changyun, come out here!

397
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,720
Yan Changyun, you've finally come.

398
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,360
Yan Changyun.

399
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,080
- Commander Yan.
- What is this thing?

400
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,800
The Dark-Green Imperial Incense. Brother Qiang asked me to light it.

401
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,140
It smells so good.

402
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,079
Hurry up and throw all this messy stuff out.

403
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,220
She said she wanted happiness and to surpass Princess Jiayang. Brother Qiang is doing it all for you.

404
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,720
Go!

405
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,919
You don't like it. Fine, let me light it.

406
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,659
Yan Changyun, where are you taking me?

407
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:08,240
Put me down. My head is spinning.

408
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,559
I feel much better like this.

409
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,379
Why is my head spinning so much?

410
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,500
Come.

411
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,300
Yan Changyun, what is this?

412
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,780
I don't want this.

413
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,380
I have something to ask you.

414
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,000
Listen. I'm talking to you.

415
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,100
Stop moving.

416
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,720
Will you leave this place with me?

417
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,799
Without Princess Jiayang. Just the two of us.

418
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:51,628
I'm asking you.

419
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,720
Do you really like me or not?

420
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,050
<i>I'm sorry, Fu Xiao.</i>

421
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,340
<i>I'm afraid of bringing you danger,</i>

422
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,919
<i>but I keep hurting your heart because of it.</i>

423
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:11,130
<i>How much I want to be close to you, to hold you,</i>

424
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,300
<i>and to bring you happiness.</i>

425
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:20,004
<i>Once this is all over, I will surely give you an answer.</i>

426

It's been years. Are you okay in the Southern Kingdom?

431
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,320
I'm a crippled man now.

432
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,960
It's all the same wherever I go.

433
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,200
It's my fault for not being able to take good care of you back then.

434
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,920
That's why you've been alone and helpless for so many years.

435
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,039
I'm sorry.

436
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,130
It was not your fault back then.

437
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,720
It's all my destiny.

438
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,559
The Southern Kingdom is a place of strife. You should not stay long.

439
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,079
Return to the Ning Kingdom soon.

440
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,119
After all these years, only you truly care about me.

441
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:25,370
It's just that I'm now an envoy of the Ning Kingdom.

442
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,900
I still have duties to fulfill.

443
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,759
Once the trade agreement is signed, I will go back.

444
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,680
When the time comes, will you come back home with me?

445
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,779
The Ning Kingdom of today is different from the past.

446
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:41,300
I can take good care of you.

447
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,880
I can't go back.

448
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,400
I'm already used to it here.

449
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,640
There are also people and things here that I can't let go of.

450
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,720
Brother Qiang, you didn't return all night and were only brought back at dawn.

451
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,660
Tell me. What did you do last night with Commander Yan?

452
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,580
I…

453
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,350
Don't inquire about these things. It's of no benefit to you.

454
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,959
Yan Changyun won't misunderstand me as a flirty girl. Right?

455
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,652
Aren't you?

456
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:03,780
No, I can't let him misunderstand me like that.

457
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,820
Commander Yan, in the Dark-Green Imperial Incense, I've only identified borneol, purple sandalwood, and cinnamon.

458
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,639
All these are beneficial to the human body.

459
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,840
Imperial Physician Qu,

460
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,719
are you sure these are the only ingredients?

461
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:20,440
Think it over before you answer me.

462
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,519
How about leaving the incense here

463
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:28,199
for me to study more carefully?

464
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,970
Imperial Physician Qu,

465
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,700
this matter is of the utmost importance.

466
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,099
I will assign a few more perfumers to assist you.

467
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,200
Report to me immediately if you find anything.

468
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,119
Yes.

469
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,660
Yan Changyun, last night, although I started it, it was worth it for you.

470
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,679
Let's consider it settled between the two of us.

471
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,800
What am I saying?

472
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,199
Yan Changyun, you had a tough night yesterday.

473
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,900
I made you breakfast. Do you want me to feed you?

474
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,160
What am I thinking? This is good.

475
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,239
Yes, just like this.

476
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,980
Yan Changyun, have breakfast.

477
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,530
Yan Changyun.

478
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,220
Where is he so early in the morning?

479
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,480
Where has he gone this early?

480
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:01,499
The food here is really delicious.

481
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:05,679
Especially with your company, it becomes even more delightful.

482
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,979
Changyun, do you think I've gained weight these days?

483
00:36:09,979 --> 00:36:14,239
You worry too much. You still have a graceful figure.

484
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,960
Changyun, you've been working hard these days. Eat a lot.

485
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,840
You should eat it yourself.

486
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,740
Master Xiao.

487
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,199
Master Xiao, have you had your meal? Would you like to join us?

488
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,916
I'm not hungry.

489
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,119
<i>Last night, you were all lovey-dovey with me,</i>

490
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,416
<i>and today you're being affectionate with the princess.</i>

491
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,919
<i>I knew you were a two-timing rat.</i>

492
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,920
I'm not hungry,

493
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,619
but I can serve you two at mealtime.

494
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:07,039
By the way, Changyun, I wonder if you like someone.

495
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,032
- No.
- Yes.

496
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:16,400
Then, what kind of girl do you like, Changyun?

497
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,060
Surely someone intelligent and rational like you.

498
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,520
You spared no effort to travel thousands of miles to get here just to facilitate trade between the two kingdoms.

499
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,459
Who in this world would not love a woman

500
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:30,780
like you who cares about the people?

501
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,359
As the eldest princess of the Ning Kingdom, it is naturally my duty to serve my people.

502
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,039
Moreover, the Southern Kingdom is rich in resources and strong, as everybody knows.

503
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:44,379
Right, I haven't been here for long. I haven't had the chance to have a walk around.

504
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:47,200
How about you accompany me for a walk?

505
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:57,359
- Yes, I'd like to.
- I'll go too.

506
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,260
Great, your coming will be very useful.
