<i>[Episode 23]</i>

21
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,840
It's you.

22
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,619
15 years ago, you killed my parents and slaughtered my entire village.

23
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:57,259
I've searched for you for 15 years.

24
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,560
Today, I will avenge my parents.

25
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,700
Then today, I will send you to meet your parents.

26
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,290
Kill her!

27
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,599
Xiao Quan.

28
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,120
Master.

29
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,720
You are in league with Xiao Quan.

30
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,199
Fu Xiao, give me the ring.

31
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,099
I won't give you the ring.

32
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,580
I can't just watch Yan Changyun die wrongfully.

33
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,720
Even less can I allow you to destroy the Southern Kingdom.

34
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,230
Fu Xiao,

35
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,020
you can't continue in your delusion.

36
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,299
The Qin Family deserved to die.

37
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:22,420
Back then, on the battlefield, Qin Wenzhong killed countless people of the Ning Kingdom.

38
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,179
Qin Yan even caused me to lose both legs and become a cripple.

39
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:30,180
Now, I can finally fulfill the grand undertaking of the Ning Kingdom.

40
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,660
Return in glory to the royal family.

41
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,779
Fu Xiao, I promise you.

42
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:42,099
After the matter is done, I will take you back to the Ning Kingdom.

43
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:46,659
Master, you're the one who is stubbornly ignorant.

44
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:50,560
How can you, for your own selfish desires, reignite the war between the two countries?

45
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,600
Shut up!

46
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,779
Uncle Lei.

47
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,572
Be careful!

48
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,464
Qing Li.

49
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:57,320
Uncle Lei.

50
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,020
Uncle Lei.

51
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,428
Retreat!

52
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,620
Qing Li.

53
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,920
Master, I…

54
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,980
Am I not better than Fu Xiao?

55
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,939
You won't be biased anymore, will you?

56
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,299
My Lord, Fu Xiao has taken the ring back.

57
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,310
We're probably not able to return to the capital city.

58
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,270
Let's leave now.

59
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,779
Heng'er is still in the palace.

60
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:58,820
Now that everything has come to light, Zhao Yuan will surely harm Heng'er.

61
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,019
The young lady, after all, is a country's future consort.

62
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:03,219
That dog of an emperor won't touch her easily.

63
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:06,559
Let's preserve our strength first, then find an opportunity to save her.

64
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,659
We've been tracking Xiao Quan all the way here.

65
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,279
Fortunately, we caught up.

66
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,400
A'Cheng.

67
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:55,659
You tell the young master that the wrongdoings I've committed.

68
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:58,900
Ask him not to hold a grudge against me.

69
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,679
Uncle Lei.

70
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,079
Fu Xiao.

71
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,280
I lied to you.

72
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,220
I have wronged you.

73
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,240
I have failed the young master.

74
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,320
Uncle Lei, please don't say anymore.

75
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,100
I know you had your difficulties.

76
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,128
Hang in there a bit longer, Changyun is still waiting for you to come back.

77
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:26,784
That's right.

78
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:33,440
I'm afraid I can't make it.

79
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:40,620
If the item inside the ring can be kept safe,

80
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,770
then can exonerate us,

81
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,450
and I will die without regrets.

82
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:55,299
It's just that there is one thing I can't let go of.

83
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,159
I want to tell you.

84
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,740
Go ahead.

85
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:05,080
The only person that I can't rest easy about is Chu Yue.

86
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,370
In this lifetime, I have not fulfilled my responsibilities as a father.

87
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:18,079
I understand. Chu Yue's greatest wish

88
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,760
is to marry the young master.

89
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,664
Fu Xiao.

90
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:30,820
I hope you can help Chu Yue...

91
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,080
Okay, I promise you.

92
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:46,500
Uncle Lei.

93
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,550
Uncle Lei.

94
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
Your Majesty,

95
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,830
Qin Yan should have been executed 15 years ago.

96
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,579
He has been hiding for many years, and even remained close to Your Majesty.

97
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,179
He has ulterior motives

98
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:13,400
Now that he has been captured,

99
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,680
I believe there is no need for a trial;

100
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,930
execute him immediately.

101
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,260
Your Majesty, if Qin Yan was solely set on revenge,

102
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,299
then why would he disguise himself as Yan Changyun to protect Your Majesty.

103
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,579
Yan Changyun's loyalty is unswerving; we have all witnessed it.

104
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,379
We should thoroughly investigate this case before making a final decision.

105
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,120
<i>That's right.</i>

106
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,140
<i>Makes sense.</i>

107
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,759
<i>- We really need to investigate thoroughly.
- Yes, indeed.</i>

108
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,059
Your Majesty, Yan Changyun is innocent.

109
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

110
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,320
- Rise.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

111
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,260
Your Majesty, Qin Yan is innocent, and so is the Qin Family.

112
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,570
This is the evidence.

113
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,300
<i>What is this?</i>

114
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,040
This jade ring originally belonged to General Guo Zhen.

115
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,940
But the silk cloth hidden inside

116
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,920
is the tripartite agreement from the Guanyou incident 15 years ago.

117
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,040
Back then, it was Xiao Quan who colluded with Guo Zhen and the Ning imperial family.

118
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,020
They secretly spread vermilion silver powder among the military.

119
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,260
Together, they framed Duke Ding, Qin Wenzhong.

120
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,299
Creating the so-called Guanyou incident.

121
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:36,620
With this, they deceived Your Majesty into ordering the execution of the Qin Family.

122
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,240
The mastermind behind this affair is indeed Xiao Quan.

123
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,360
<i>What? Xiao Quan? It was him?</i>

124
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,020
<i>Truly nefarious!</i>

125
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,679
What is the meaning of this?

126
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,120
<i>How did it get broken?</i>

127
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,980
<i>There's a hidden meaning.</i>

128
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,320
This is the evidence.

129
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,279
Please, Eunuch Feng.

130
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:12,296
<i>[Signatories: Xiao Quan, Ge Heng, Guo Zhen]</i>

131
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:16,340
No wonder I didn't see him at the court session today.

132
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,620
Where is Xiao Quan now?

133
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,400
Your Majesty, knowing his plot has been revealed,

134
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,319
he has already fled in fear of his crimes.

135
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:26,180
- Commander Wei.
- Here.

136
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,579
Take the Thousand Feather Guards and surround the Xiao residence immediately.

137
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:31,819
- Issue a nationwide order to arrest Xiao Quan.
- I shall carry out the order.

138
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,000
Your Majesty, nine clans of the Qin Family were executed 15 years ago.

139
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,760
Their old subordinates were implicated and suffered for 15 years.

140
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,579
Qin Yan hid his identity and endured humiliation

141
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,839
just to find evidence to clear the injustice.

142
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,059
I beseech Your Majesty to grant them justice,

143
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,000
and give Qin Yan a chance to live.

144
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,740
Your Majesty, the evidence is now irrefutable.

145
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,796
Qin Yan's reputation as a fugitive

146
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,664
can naturally be pardoned.

147
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:05,139
Convey my decree, release Qin Yan from the Sky Prison.

148
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:06,976
Wait!

149
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,020
- Greeting to Grand Empress Dowager.
- My beloved ministers, rise.

150
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,200
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager.

151
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,559
Your Majesty, Qin Yan can't be released.

152
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:26,380
Grand Empress Dowager, why is this?

153
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,160
The disturbance of the Guanyou incident

154
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,830
was a case decreed by Your Majesty himself.

155
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,100
Now, based on an agreement of unknown origin,

156
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,380
Your Majesty is accused of framing the Qin Family.

157
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,180
Wouldn't that make Your Majesty's decree empty words?

158
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,579
Can a case be overturned just because someone wishes it?

159
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:52,759
Grand Empress Dowager, is it that an obvious injustice can't be overturned?

160
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,740
How dare you!

161
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,580
Back then, Qin Yan fled, fearing his crimes.

162
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,439
He hid his identity and lurked beside His Majesty.

163
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:05,280
Such a great crime of deceiving the emperor, his heart is worthy of death.

164
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,340
It's ridiculous that you still want to defend him.

165
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,800
Your Majesty, the one who truly committed the crime of deceiving you

166
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,840
is Xiao Quan, who created the miscarriage of justice.

167
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,980
You are the ruler of the land, the ultimate honorable one.

168
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,339
Your words are the golden decree.

169
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,419
I implore you to spare Qin Yan and grant the Qin Family justice

170
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:26,400
to vindicate the Qin Family and uphold justice.

171
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,020
Silence!

172
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,900
What right do you have to meddle in this imperial court?

173
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,140
Empress Dowager, rest assured.

174
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,360
I'm well aware of Qin Yan's matter.

175
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,260
- Your Majesty.
- Enough!

176
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,959
We will discuss Qin Yan's matter another day.

177
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,779
Court is adjourned.

178
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:52,260
<i>- Long live the Emperor.
- Long live the Emperor.</i>

179
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,579
Greetings, Your Majesty

180
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,059
- Open the gates.
- Yes.

181
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:10,740
You may leave.

182
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,472
Yes.

183
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,259
She came back for you after all.

184
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,080
She shouldn't have come back.

185
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,359
Do you have the heart to let her watch you be executed?

186
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,679
Isn't this the very outcome you wanted?

187
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,220
If she could truly give up hope…

188
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,079
perhaps it would be a release for her.

189
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,959
That was originally my thought as well.

190
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:58,579
But the moment she returned,

191
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:00,600
seeing her eyes,

192
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,510
I knew that even if you died,

193
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,010
she wouldn't become my woman.

194
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,200
You aren't aware, are you?

195
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,750
She has regained her memory,

196
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,160
and found this.

197
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:26,780
This is the truth you've been desperately searching for, isn't it?

198
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:30,779
- What about Xiao Quan?
- He has already fled out of fear of punishment.

199
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:35,180
Since Your Majesty already knows the truth, then why are you still keeping me here?

200
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,419
I'm also without choice.

201
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:41,699
If I release you, how will I explain to the officials of the Southern Kingdom?

202
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,780
It concerns the dignity of the imperial family.

203
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,899
Before the state and the ancestral temple,

204
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,960
right and wrong are sometimes not so important.

205
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:54,179
What do you mean, Your Majesty?

206
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:58,960
Qin Yan, you must die.

207
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:09,620
- Your Majesty.
- Did you find out any news about my brother?

208
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,900
The eunuchs and maids in the palace hide when they see anyone from the Phoenix Rite Palace.

209
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,180
I can only secretly listen to their discussions.

210
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,300
It is said that Xiao Quan is the mastermind behind the Guanyou incident.

211
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,759
He has already fled out of fear of punishment.

212
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,520
So, my brother had ambitions all along.

213
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,300
Why did he deceive His Majesty?

214
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,939
Why would he do such a thing?

215
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:31,419
Your Majesty, if something happens to Xiao Quan,

216
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:34,380
what will you do in the palace from now on?

217
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,060
How will His Majesty deal with my brother?

218
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,660
According to them,

219
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,739
His Majesty has issued a decree to arrest your brother.

220
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:47,159
Your Majesty, you must think of a way to protect yourself.

221
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,040
What's left in my life to protect?

222
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,499
- I'll beg His Majesty.
- There's no need.

223
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,940
Your Majesty.

224
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:09,100
I know my brother's crimes are unforgivable.

225
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,380
If Your Majesty must punish someone, then punish me.

226
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,540
Members of the harem must not interfere with politics.

227
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,580
Xiao Quan's affairs have nothing to do with you.

228
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,140
He is my brother and my kin.

229
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,340
I only wish to atone for my brother's sins.

230
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,179
What if the crime he committed is punishable by death?

231
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,860
As long as his life can be spared,

232
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,500
I'm willing to die for him.

233
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,880
You're not just his sister,

234
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,759
you're also my wife.

235
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,979
What right do you have to atone for his sins?

236
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:06,860
- Greetings, Grand Empress Dowager.
- Grandmother.

237
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,259
Married to His Majesty for four years without any children.

238
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:16,530
Even if we execute the entire Xiao family,

239
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,070
it wouldn't be too much.

240
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,080
Your Majesty, doesn't she wish to die?

241
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,780
Then grant her wish.

242
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:28,580
Grandmother, Xiao Quan's crimes are unforgivable,

243
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,599
but Her Majesty is innocent.

244
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,820
Innocent?

245
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,140
The sister of a treacherous official?

246
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,780
What qualifies her to be the empress?

247
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,610
Even if she doesn't die,

248
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,540
send her to the Cold Palace for life.

249
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,704
Grandmother, there's no need for you to say more.

250
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:50,856
I have made my own decision.

251
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,780
Your Majesty has grown up.

252
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,280
Wanting to make decisions on everything by yourself.

253
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,019
I should have taken charge myself long ago.

254
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:04,030
Grandmother, you're old.

255
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,780
There's no need for you to trouble yourself.

256
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,384
- Your Majesty, you…
- Guards!

257
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,520
The Grand Empress Dowager is tired. Escort her back to rest.

258
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,640
- Your Majesty.
- Can you not hear my words?

259
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,079
- Empress Dowager, please.
- Empress Dowager, please.

260
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:31,319
- Your Majesty.
- There's no need for you to say more.

261
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,499
I'm well aware.

262
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:37,179
You just take good care of yourself.

263
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:40,312
I'll leave first.

264
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:53,828
<i>[Yan Residence]</i>

265
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:56,760
<i>[Spiritual tablet of late father, Lei Bao]</i>

266
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,890
<i>[Memorial]</i>

267
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,419
If it hadn't been for you, my father would not have died.

268
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:08,739
If it hadn't been for you, he wouldn't have been thrown into the Sky Prison.

269
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:13,520
If you had not appeared, I could have been with him for a lifetime.

270
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,979
The whole world knows he's my man.

271
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:21,419
Why did everything change the moment you appeared?

272
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,480
Rest assured; I'll leave Yan Changyun.

273
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,280
But I will not forgive you,

274
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,480
nor will I wish you well.

275
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,680
I just pity you.

276
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,459
Because your love is selfish.

277
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:43,179
You only care about yourself.

278
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:45,900
A selfish person like you

279
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,979
doesn't deserve true love at all.

280
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:58,856
<i>[Yan Residence]</i>

281
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,480
Miss Fu Xiao, what you are doing is illegal.

282
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,639
Listen to me, and let's go back.

283
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:14,559
If something really happens, even His Majesty can't protect you.

284
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,979
I will confess to His Majesty after the deed is done.

285
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:19,359
I also request your cooperation, sir.

286
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,760
The heavenly prison is forbidden; no one is allowed to enter.

287
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,219
You really are blind.

288
00:24:28,219 --> 00:24:30,600
Eunuch Feng is here by His Majesty's order to announce the decree.

289
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,590
Move.

290
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,919
Xiao Yanzi, the prison's aura is ominous;

291
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:42,340
I won't go in. I'm leaving this task to you.

292
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,020
Yes.

293
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:10,559
Open the door.

294
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,172
Yes.

295
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,319
I'm about to read His Majesty's secret edict, stand aside.

296
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,984
Yes.

297
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,499
Yan Changyun, heed the decree.

298
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,579
The imperial edict says,

299
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:58,720
"Yan Changyun is indeed the remnant of a criminal minister.

300
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,460
Bearing guilt, he fled in secret, deceiving his emperor and betraying his superiors.

301
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,960
Yet, with a kindly and generous heart,

302
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,540
in consideration of Yan Changyun's many merits in protecting me,

303
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,040
I authorize him to have his merits offset his crimes.

304
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,408
Expel Yan Changyun from the capital. He shall never return to the capital city.

305
00:26:12,408 --> 00:26:14,400
Respect this."

306
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,104
Come with me.

307
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:34,620
What's wrong?

308
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:40,760
The imperial edict is fake,

309
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,340
isn't it?

310
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:48,980
How could that be? This is the edict personally issued by His Majesty, with his seal.

311
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:52,419
His Majesty would never let me go.

312
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:54,919
Otherwise, how could he explain to the world?

313
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:56,950
He need not explain to anyone;

314
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,900
he's the emperor.

315
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,850
Fu Xiao,

316
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,550
are you still going to lie to me?

317
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,100
Do you know how dangerous it is to forge an imperial edict?

318
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,520
No matter how dangerous,

319
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:15,079
Yan Changyun, I just want you to be all right.

320
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:20,740
If you died, I wouldn't want to live in this world either.

321
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,040
Why are you so foolish?

322
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,760
- Is it worth risking your life to save me?
- Yes.

323
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,080
Come with me.

324
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:38,490
I can't implicate you.

325
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,880
Leave.

326
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:20,340
I let Yan Changyun go.

327
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,839
I know I can't hide it from you.

328
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,939
You coerced Eunuch Feng.

329
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:28,380
Faking the edict, freeing Yan Changyun, and burning the Sky Prison.

330
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,340
Every single matter is an unforgivable crime, do you know that?

331
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,620
Please, Your Majesty, punish me.

332
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,130
You...

333
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,300
You're just taking advantage of my favor towards you,

334
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,659
and time and again, you challenge me.

335
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:44,060
You're insulting me.

336
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:50,459
Guards, issue the decree; hunt down Yan Changyun.

337
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:52,116
Yes.

338
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,279
What are you doing?

339
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,060
Your Majesty,

340
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,380
if you still refuse to spare Yan Changyun,

341
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,580
I will die before your eyes.

342
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,480
Are you threatening me?

343
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,000
If you are willing to give him a chance to live,

344
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:30,380
then I'm willing to marry you...

345
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,350
and serve you for the rest of my life.

346
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,330
To save him,

347
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,200
you would sacrifice everything.

348
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,200
Is that so?

349
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,208
Yes.

350
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,790
Fine.

351
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,300
Since you have made up your mind,

352
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,780
then I'll grant your wish.

353
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,840
But from this moment on,

354
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,799
you must stay by my side for the rest of your life.

355
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:18,939
Issue the decree, order the Ministry of Rites.

356
00:30:18,939 --> 00:30:22,380
I decree to bestow upon Fu Xiao the title of consort.

357
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,100
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

358
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,430
Young Master.

359
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,080
A'Cheng,

360
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,500
where is this?

361
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,340
- Where is Fu Xiao?
- We have already left the capital.

362
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,410
Fu Xiao stayed in the Imperial Palace;

363
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,490
she didn't come with us.

364
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,230
What did you say?

365
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,596
She forged the imperial edict to save me.

366
00:31:25,596 --> 00:31:27,116
She can't stay in the palace.

367
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:29,780
- Turn around and go back immediately.
- No, Young Master,

368
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,520
Fu Xiao will be fine.

369
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,060
She is going to marry His Majesty.

370
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,924
What did you say?

371
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,880
His Majesty has issued a notice.

372
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,860
Proclaiming that you died in the heavenly prison fire.

373
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,340
<i>[Decree]</i>
Enthronement set for February 2nd.

374
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,060
Fu Xiao is to be the Imperial Noble Consort.

375
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,260
Young Master, it would be of no use for you to return now.

376
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:04,199
It would only void everything that Fu Xiao has done.

377
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,700
This is what Fu Xiao asked me to give you before she left.

From now on, I'll never come here again.

423
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,260
Nor will I touch anything related to him.

00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,240
No matter,

425
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,780
you will soon marry me.

I will give you happiness.

Your Majesty, I have one last request.

428
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,580
On the day of my marriage,

429
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,340
I want to marry from the residence of Yan Changyun.

430
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,400
All right,

431
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,340
I agree to your request.

432
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,524
<i>[Civil and Military Strategies]</i>

433
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,979
Miss Xiao, the emperor has decreed that no one is to enter or leave Phoenix Rite Palace.

434
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:34,099
Fu Xiao, how did you come here?

435
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:36,239
Your Majesty.

436
00:37:39,419 --> 00:37:42,880
Your Majesty, why do you look so pale?

437
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,180
Are you feeling unwell?

438
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,720
It's a sickness of the heart.

439
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,240
The fact that you could come to see me, I'm all better now.

440
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,900
Your Majesty,

441
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,920
I came today to tell you...

442
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,260
that I'm going to marry His Majesty.

443
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:12,260
What about Yan Changyun?

444
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:17,740
He was burned to death in the heavenly prison.

445
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,740
Do you think I'm particularly heartless and unfaithful?

446
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,860
I only feel sorry for you.

447
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,619
Like me, you are also a person with a miserable fate.

448
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:46,839
I once thought I was the happiest woman in the world.

449
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:50,099
With a brother who loved me and a father.

450
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:53,420
I also married the man I loved the most.

451
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:56,860
But in the end, I realized...

452
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,340
that I am merely a pawn.

453
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,770
And you,

454
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,440
you must have your own difficulties, too.

455
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,900
Fu Xiao, since you are destined to marry His Majesty,

456
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,150
forget Yan Changyun...

457
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,610
and take good care of His Majesty for me, will you?

458
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,939
Your Majesty, I have already made up my mind.

459
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:35,080
Even if I really marry His Majesty,

460
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,059
I'll never step beyond my bounds.

461
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:40,560
His Majesty still belongs to you, Your Majesty.
