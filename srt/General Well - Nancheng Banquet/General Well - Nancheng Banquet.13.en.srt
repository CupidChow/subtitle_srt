Tianjiao will come to pick you up in three days.

22
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:38,840
You are just performing at the Wei Mansion, return at the time between 9:00 to 11:00 p.m.

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,440
Our people will meet you on your way back.

24
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,419
All the routes after leaving the city have been handed over to Uncle Lei.

25
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:47,120
Uncle Lei will escort you away.

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,700
Then everyone will just think that you were kidnapped by bandits on your way back to the city.

27
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,580
The body will be discovered in the suburbs of the city ten days later.

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,772
Chu Yue.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,480
I won't go.

30
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,230
You're chatting.

31
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,700
Boss, I was afraid you'd get hungry from talking too much.

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,580
So, I brought some snacks over for you.

33
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,779
There's some already here, I didn't even notice.

34
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:22,330
Get out.

35
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,080
Get out.

36
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,132
Okay.

37
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,120
Having you evacuate is for your own good.

38
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,339
In the past, when you came to see me, A'Cheng was always with you.

39
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:53,560
Now, such an important matter.

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,000
Why entrust it to an outsider?

41
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,800
You really treat him differently.

42
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,180
Since you already know, I won't hide it from you.

43
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,639
He indeed stands out from the rest; he's different from everyone else.

44
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,680
Brother Yan, is there really no room for discussion?

45
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:19,560
The wine today is really good, isn't it?

46
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,180
As long as you're happy.

47
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,560
You are always so good.

48
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,590
What were you talking about?

49
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,120
Tell me about it.

50
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,560
The courtesan of Yunshao Bureau.

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,039
I think she's not as beautiful as me.

52
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,119
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Commander Yan, why did you only just arrive?

53
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,480
Does Your Majesty need me for something?

54
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,940
A matter, a big matter.

55
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,450
Then let's talk inside.

56
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,010
No, it's alright to talk here too.

57
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,864
Okay.

58
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,160
Xiao Qiangzi's injuries are almost healed, right?

59
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,560
Almost.

60
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,399
Commander Yan, what do you think of Xiao Qiangzi?

61
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,660
Your Majesty, why do you suddenly ask?

62
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,620
Do you suspect something wrong with Xiao Qiangzi?

63
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,160
No, I'm just asking casually.

64
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,160
Why would Your Majesty be so concerned about a minor eunuch?

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,879
No, it's just that I feel…

66
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,860
Right, Commander Yan, do you think Xiao Qiangzi

67
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,940
is different from the other eunuchs?

68
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,740
<i>Has the Emperor discovered Fu Xiao's secret?</i>

69
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,240
Does Your Majesty think he is different from the other eunuchs?

70
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,120
No, they are all the same.

71
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,879
Your Majesty, what is it?

72
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,340
I have had many troubles recently.

73
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,839
Why don't you accompany me for a walk?

74
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,064
Okay.

75
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,339
<i>No wonder His Majesty asked that just now.</i>

76
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:35,800
Don't let your hair down when you're in the room.

77
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,779
What if someone else sees you?

78
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:40,299
There's no one else here.

79
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,560
Aren't we in the room?

80
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,060
Even in the room, you shouldn't let your hair down.

81
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,160
All right, I'll listen to you.

82
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,639
I have a small question for you.

83
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,339
Who is prettier, me or Chu Yue?

84
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,616
Chu Yue.

85
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,460
What if I wear women's clothes?

86
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,920
Even if you wear women's clothes, Chu Yue is still more beautiful than you.

87
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,544
Don't go.

88
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,040
Who embroidered this?

89
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,739
Give it…

90
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,419
Why are you so nervous?

91
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,900
Chu Yue embroidered it, right?

92
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,519
You always carry it with you?

93
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,000
Give it back to me.

94
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,120
You keep it even though it's burned.

95
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,088
Shut your mouth.

96
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,820
Yan Changyun, I've been so good to you.

97
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,040
Now I'm not even as good as this purse, right?

98
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,959
It's even better.

99
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,199
<i>You can embroider?</i>

100
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,219
<i>My mother insisted that I learn.</i>

101
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:11,560
<i>She said that a girl who doesn't learn needlework can't get married when she grows up.</i>

102
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,720
<i>What did you embroider here?</i>

103
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
<i>Yam flowers.</i>

104
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,820
<i>Yam purse.</i>

105
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,260
<i>This truly is one of a kind in the whole world.</i>

106
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,620
<i>What's wrong with Yam?</i>

107
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,960
<i>Don't you find the Yam I give you delicious?</i>

108
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,659
<i>Of course.</i>

109
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:30,040
<i>Then that settles it.</i>

110
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,579
<i>Once I am done embroidering it, I will give it to you as a betrothal gift.</i>

111
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,140
<i>Okay.</i>

112
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,520
<i>Once you accept my betrothal gift, you will belong to me.</i>

113
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,740
<i>[Account Scroll]</i>

114
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,100
He's a woman.

115
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,779
It's very inconvenient to have a woman stay with the Thousand Feather Guards.

116
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,840
Perhaps I should issue an imperial decree to bring her into the harem.

117
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,410
No. No.

118
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,660
Xiao Qiangzi is already unpopular in the palace.

119
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,799
Grand Empress Dowager also has her reservations about her.

120
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:18,699
What if Grand Empress Dowager sets her sight on her again?

121
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:23,480
She probably wouldn't believe that her entering the Imperial Palace disguised as a man was an accident.

122
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,720
Still, let's keep her with the Thousand Feather Guards. Right?

123
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,240
A girl has gone to great lengths to come to the Imperial Palace.

124
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,039
Coming to my side, accompanying me, taking care of me,

125
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,380
dispelling my worries, and silently protecting me.

126
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,919
What is this?

127
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,860
This is love.

128
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,090
That's right, this is love.

129
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,019
It's so heavy. Is there anyone who can help me?

130
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,000
Is there anyone who can give me a hand?

131
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,279
Xiao Qiangzi, I'll help you.

132
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,719
- No need.
- Don't mention it.

133
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,720
You've worked too hard. Is there anything else to do?

134
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,620
No.

135
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,212
<i>Try this.</i>

136
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,320
<i>Tasty, give me more.</i>

137
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,120
<i>Delicious.</i>

138
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,180
<i>- Do you want more?
- No.</i>

139
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,559
<i>Bring the plate here, I'll give you some.</i>

140
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,452
<i>Why don't you try this one?</i>

141
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:39,059
I'm full.

142
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,679
This isn't like you, Xiao Qiangzi.

143
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,760
Don't you usually eat three steamed buns?

144
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,659
Who said that? My regular food intake is just this little.

145
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:49,340
Moreover, I don't like to eat steamed buns.

146
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,920
Moreover, I don't like to eat steamed buns.

147
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,120
I like to eat buns with thin skin and lots of filling.

148
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,559
I know.

149
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,819
<i>Greetings, Your Majesty!</i>

150
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,892
Dispense with the formalities.

151
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:02,690
Thank you, Your Majesty.

152
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,860
Xiao Qiangzi, you must dislike the Thousand Feather Guard's food.

153
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,280
So, I have specially prepared your favorite dish.

154
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,240
Bring it here.

155
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,610
Is there more?

156
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,150
Xiao Qiangzi, have a taste.

157
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,020
It's delicious, isn't it?

158
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,619
It's really sweet. You try it, too.

159
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

160
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,080
You're welcome. Eat more.

161
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,099
<i>Raise your hand higher, quickly.</i>

162
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,930
<i>Faster, go.</i>

163
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,900
<i>Put some strength into it.</i>

164
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,040
<i>Again, stand firm in horse stance, hand raised high.</i>

165
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,130
<i>Once more.</i>

166
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,416
Are you all right?

167
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,710
How…?

168
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,670
<i>Stop.</i>

169
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,520
<i>You should punch like this. Watch.</i>

170
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,620
<i>The center of gravity is stable now.</i>

171
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,900
Your Majesty, I have something very important to tell you.

172
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,179
But could we have Commander Yan help keep watch for a bit?

173
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,700
What matter?

174
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,020
How can we talk about such an important matter here?

175
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,100
We must go to your bedroom.

176
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,120
Commander Yan, do me a favor.

177
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,260
<i>Yan Changyun had me guard the door for him and Chu Yue a few days ago.</i>

178
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,100
<i>Today, I'm making you stand guard as well, to annoy you.</i>

179
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,400
<i>Let's see if you dare ignore me.</i>

180
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,290
Xiao Qiangzi, don't you have a secret you wanted to tell me?

181
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,399
What's the matter?

182
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,310
Xiao Qiangzi.

183
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,860
Your Majesty, I have been training with the Thousand Feather Guards these days,

184
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,380
and haven't had time to accompany you.

185
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,500
That's why I want to be with you today.

186
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,740
Then why did you have Commander Yan stand guard at the door?

187
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,710
With Commander Yan outside, it's safe.

188
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,730
You're so thoughtful.

189
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,300
It's so hot; have someone remove the stove.

190
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,920
Someone, come.

191
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,259
Your Majesty, today I just want to be alone with you.

192
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,000
Okay.

193
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,140
It's really too hot; I'll take off my cloak.

194
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,870
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

195
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,970
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

196
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,679
It's unseemly.

197
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,648
Xiao Qiangzi, wipe your sweat.

198
00:16:01,648 --> 00:16:03,336
- No need.
- Aren't you hot?

199
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,340
I'm not hot.

200
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,459
Let me wipe it for you.

201
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,190
What are you doing?

202
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,090
Xiao Qiangzi!

203
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,180
We're having a friendly competition.

204
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,120
I'm freezing to death.

205
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,570
Too much water boiled; it's wasteful if not used.

206
00:17:12,328 --> 00:17:13,319
Not eating again?

207
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,940
Tired of this; I want to eat steamed buns.

208
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,100
"Tired of it; I want to eat steamed buns."

209
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,859
- There are actually still steamed buns left?
- If you want to eat, take them yourself.

210
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,179
Quick, take a few more.

211
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,490
- Where are the buns?
- They're gone.

212
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,350
- Where are the buns?
- They're gone.

213
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,720
No steamed buns today.

214
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,980
Boss, where did you get those steamed buns?

215
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,540
Commander Yan, what do you mean by this?

216
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,440
It's cold; I'm afraid you'll catch a chill.

217
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,580
Aren't you cold?

218
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,000
No.

219
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,990
Commander Yan, are you cold?

220
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,200
No.

221
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,360
Are you playing the ploy of "injuring yourself to gain the enemy's trust" with me?

222
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,060
Aren't you ignoring me?

223
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,279
Then why are you covering me with a quilt and still caring for me?

224
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,019
Because you are…

225
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,710
Because of what?

226
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,900
Because you are a member of the Thousand Feather Guards.

227
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,279
Wrong.

228
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,470
I'll give you one more chance.

229
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,659
Because you're mine.

230
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,464
You're not angry anymore?

231
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:35,200
When have I, such a magnanimous person, ever gotten angry?

232
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,259
I just can't stand your pretense; what are you pretending for?

233
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,839
<i>[Yunshao Bureau]
Boss, please wrap these two up for me.</i>

234
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,580
<i>All right.</i>

235
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,359
<i>Come and see these sachet pendants.</i>

236
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,840
Mom, rest assured.

237
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,540
This time, going to Duke Wei's residence, I shall return from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m.

238
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,760
Take good care of the young lady.

239
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,580
Yes.

240
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,288
Go ahead.

241
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,539
You are not from Duke Wei's residence.

242
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:16,419
My Lord Xiao invites you to come to his house for a chat.

243
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,580
I have been invited by the Wei Residence.

244
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,380
Changing the itinerary is indeed improper.

245
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,240
My lord will not take up much of your time.

246
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:32,359
Mom, please convey to Lord Wei that the Xiao residence extends an invitation.

247
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,179
- Are you ready?
- Everything is ready.

248
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:42,000
Uncle Lei, I still have some worries.

249
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,079
No need to worry; the young master has already made arrangements for Chu Yue.

250
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,100
This is bad; Chu Yue has been taken away by Xiao Quan.

251
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,724
What?

252
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,736
Quick, dispense with the formalities.

253
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,019
In recent days, I, Xiao, have been unwell.

254
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:08,170
The doctor has advised against going out.

255
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,420
But I miss the sound of Miss Chu Yue's zither very much.

256
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,659
Therefore, I have specifically invited you to come and visit my residence.

257
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:19,380
I am also thankful that you're willing to honor us with your presence.

258
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,340
It is Chu Yue's honor to be favored by Lord Xiao.

259
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,780
It would not be too much for Chu Yue to play the zither for you for three days.

260
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:33,259
It's just that Lord Xiao's invitation today is indeed rather sudden.

261
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:36,760
Moreover, since Chu Yue has already agreed to Duke Wei's residence, if I don't go…

262
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,039
Not going to the Duke Wei Residence is of no harm.

263
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,680
Miss Chu Yue is skilled in zither music.

264
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,419
There is an ancient zither in my residence that does not sound quite right.

265
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:49,472
I would like to ask you to take a look.

266
00:22:49,472 --> 00:22:51,260
- Servants!
<i>- I'm here!</i>

267
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,359
Lead her there.

268
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,800
Yes.

269
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,972
Please.

270
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:13,280
Xue Ying,

271
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,999
Lei Bao was indeed a famous general under Duke Ding, Qin Wenzhong.

272
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:25,300
Now, his biological daughter is in my hands.

273
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,440
The remnants of Guanyou will inevitably come out to rescue her.

274
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,820
<i>[Yunshao Bureau]</i>

275
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,840
- Young Master Wei, you have arrived.
- Where is Chu Yue?

276
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,499
Chu Yue was just taken away by Lord Xiao's men.

277
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:43,659
This is bad. Let's go.

278
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:57,459
Your servant pays respects to the Grand Empress Dowager.

279
00:23:57,459 --> 00:24:00,060
Grand Empress Dowager, may you be forever joyous and boundless.

280
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,860
Where is His Majesty?

281
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,079
I don't know.

282
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,900
Look at my craftsmanship, it truly is impeccable.

283
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,599
It's much better than that shabby sachet hidden by Yan Changyun.

284
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:42,699
Look how harmonious these colors are.

285
00:24:42,699 --> 00:24:45,939
Look how innovative this idea for the Yam is.

286
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:48,519
These thread ends…

287
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,240
Aren't they just gone like this?

288
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:55,979
Yan Changyun.

289
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:59,720
Once you take my sachet, then you belong to me.

290
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,540
From now on, you are not allowed to spend money on other young ladies.

291
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,540
Otherwise, I will…

292
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:14,399
Nanny Xi, what brings you here?

293
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,480
Grand Empress Dowager requests your presence.

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,939
Xiao Qiangzi, come with me,

295
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:21,759
so we don't have to take action.

296
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,120
If the Grand Empress Dowager has summoned, naturally, I must go.

297
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,660
Allow me to tidy up first.

298
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,519
No need to tidy up. Take her away!

To report to the Grand Empress Dowager, she indeed is a woman.

Bold and insolent slave, disguised as a eunuch, infiltrated the palace.

00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:37,920
Right! It was during those days, I was with Xiao Qiangzi in the study.

350
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,800
A lone man and a single girl, alone in one room.

351
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,219
I couldn't hold back for a moment.

352
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:51,060
Grandmother, I had wanted to give you a surprise.

353
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,419
I didn't expect you to find out so soon.

354
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:57,160
Such a big matter! What's there to keep secret?

355
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,219
You're right. I failed to consider it thoroughly.

356
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,140
Xiao Qiangzi is already carrying my royal heir,

357
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,350
what if…

358
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,939
Since it's so, then let's keep her in the imperial harem for now.

359
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:15,499
Wait until the child is born, and then we'll make arrangements.

360
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:17,900
Thank you, Grandmother.

361
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,559
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager.

362
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:25,039
I will surely take good care of the royal child in my belly.

363
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,340
Not letting the royal child suffer even the slightest harm.

364
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,340
You may leave.

365
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,050
Yes.

366
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:35,120
<i>My life is saved this time.</i>

367
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,959
<i>But where to find this royal child?</i>

368
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:23,519
Chu Yue.

369
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,459
Oh no! We've been tricked, run fast!

370
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,690
Audacious scoundrel, daring to break into my Xiao Residence.

371
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,510
Seize him!

372
00:32:06,739 --> 00:32:08,410
Uncle Lei.

373
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,032
- Don't mind me, go quickly. Go!
- No.

374
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:16,344
- Let's go together.
- Go.

375
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,399
Tell us who your mastermind is.

376
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,660
I don't know. If you have the guts, just kill me.

377
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,940
I don't know. If you have the guts, just kill me.

378
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,880
Thinking of dying?

379
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,200
It's not that easy.

380
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,140
Commander Yan, you're late.

381
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,499
You missed the big show tonight.

382
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:21,920
These traitorous rebels brazenly broke into my residence to abduct people.

383
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,440
It's truly outrageous.

384
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,380
Just look at these bodies lying all over the ground.

385
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,880
They are the followers of the rebel Duke Ding, Qin Wenzhong.

386
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,620
There's still one left.

387
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,659
Would you like to interrogate him for me,

388
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:38,440
and ask about the whereabouts of the mastermind?

389
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,939
This is a private matter of the Xiao Residence, Lord Xiao.

390
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:44,960
I have no intention of prying.

391
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,019
I came here to fetch Miss Chu Yue.

392
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:50,820
I kindly ask Lord Xiao to return her to me.

393
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,139
I really didn't expect Commander Yan to also be here for Miss Chu Yue tonight.

394
00:33:56,139 --> 00:34:00,219
Do you know that Chu Yue is colluding with the remnants of the Qin Family?

395
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:03,940
She is a suspect in the murder of my father.

396
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,100
If you take her away just like that, then I have reason to suspect

397
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,799
that you are involved with the remnants of the Qin Family.

398
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,780
Yan Changyun, you cur of an official.

399
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,600
You and Xiao Quan are in cahoots.

400
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,579
We, the remnants of the Qin Family, will surely kill you both.

401
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:26,440
How dare you brazenly slander me and the commander of Thousand Feather Guards.

402
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,944
Kill!

403
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:46,780
Commander Yan, you're not aware, are you?

404
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:52,339
Miss Chu Yue is the biological daughter of Lei Bao, the remnant of the Qin Family.

405
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,180
So, what if she is a remnant of the Qin Family?

406
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,920
Over the years, Chu Yue has always abided by the rules in Yunshao Bureau.

407
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,499
She has never had any ulterior motives.

408
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:08,620
As the Ministry of Justice, Lord Xiao, shouldn't detain people without real evidence.

409
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,220
Isn't it against the rules?

410
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,380
Since Lord Xiao is unwilling to release the person,

411
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,960
then I'll have to search for her myself.

412
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,560
- Search!
- No need,

413
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,070
Xue Ying.

414
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:30,920
Chu Yue.

415
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,939
Commander Yan, there's no need for you to go to such lengths for me.

416
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:39,220
I'm well aware that my lowly life is not worth sparing.

417
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,340
I am deeply grateful for Commander Yan's affection towards me.

418
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,220
I'm immensely thankful.

419
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,220
I know that those who are innocent will prove their innocence.

420
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,900
But I truly can't bear to see Commander Yan

421
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,800
accused of bending the law for love's sake over this matter.

422
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,019
I'm willing to die

423
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:03,320
to repay the years of kindness I've received from Commander Yan.

424
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,099
Chu Yue,this matter has nothing to do with you.

425
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,719
It's all because someone used the identity of the lady to frame Yan,

426
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,000
and causing you to suffer humiliation.

427
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:19,439
But as for a woman of mine, you are not someone who can be bullied by anyone.

428
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:24,260
That being said, Commander Yan is determined to take Miss Chu Yue away.

429
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,760
Then don't blame me for being impolite.

430
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:36,412
Chu Yue.

431
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,539
I don't recognize any of these people on the ground.

432
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:48,459
However, I'm willing to cooperate with Lord Xiao to prove my innocence.

433
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:54,760
I also believe that Commander Yan will definitely vindicate me.

434
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,780
- Thousand Feather Guards, heed my command.
- Yes.

435
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,939
The Xiao Residence is the primary crime scene of the chancellor's death.

436
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,300
Effective immediately, the Xiao Residence will be sealed.

437
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,059
All must cooperate with the investigation and are not allowed to enter or leave at will.

438
00:37:19,059 --> 00:37:20,239
<i>Yes!</i>

439
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,840
Yan Changyun, who gave you the authority?

440
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,836
Your Majesty.

441
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,920
<i>[Wind on the Terrace]</i>

442
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,220
Lord Xiao, based on the evidence I have,

443
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,159
the murderer is someone familiar with the chancellor.

444
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:38,800
All those in the Xiao Residence must be thoroughly investigated.

445
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,180
Only by finding the murderer as soon as possible

446
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,239
can we console the spirit of the chancellor in heaven.

447
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,780
Keep close surveillance on everyone in the Xiao Residence,

448
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,920
until the real culprit is found.

449
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,292
<i>Yes!</i>

450
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:55,399
Someone, come!

451
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:59,340
Take the bodies of these treacherous officials and throw them into a mass grave for the dogs.

452
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,159
Remember!

453
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:06,080
You must see the wild dogs eat their corpses with your own eyes before you can come back.

454
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,964
<i>Yes!</i>

455
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:22,500
Your Majesty, when did you find out I was a woman?

456
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,640
No matter how good the acting, can it deceive me?

457
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,790
No, I pretended to be a eunuch;

458
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,410
was it that obvious too?

459
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:34,880
Now that you mention it, it is indeed quite obvious.

460
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,239
I don't know how I was fooled by you at that time.

461
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,579
Your Majesty, I nearly died today and you're still teasing me.

462
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:45,900
So, you acted as a little eunuch and stayed by my side, isn't that teasing me as well?

463
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,000
I had no choice.

464
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,860
I lied to you to save my life, right?

465
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,320
All right. Now, the most important thing is to take good care of the baby,

466
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,039
and give birth to a prince for me soon.

467
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,239
Where am I supposed to give birth for you?

468
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,260
Couldn't you have lied about something else?

469
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,740
You had to claim I was pregnant.

470
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,960
What was I supposed to do? If I hadn't said that, would you still be alive?

471
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,019
You know full well that my words carry no weight.

472
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:11,619
Then it's only by relying on a prince that we can bluff the Grand Empress Dowager.

473
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:14,380
No, what am I to do if word of this gets out?

474
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,159
What about my reputation?

475
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:21,780
How so? Are you ashamed of carrying my child?

476
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,192
I, a mere eunuch, am carrying His Majesty's child.

477
00:39:24,192 --> 00:39:26,499
Should I be immensely honored?

478
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:28,800
Are you not honored?

479
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:39,520
Your Majesty, things are not as you believe.

480
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,840
- I…
- Your Majesty, don't get too worked up,

481
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,619
Xiao Qiangzi is pregnant.

482
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,892
- She shouldn't get too excited either.
- Please stop talking.

483
00:39:46,892 --> 00:39:49,019
You lied to me. Your identity is fake.

484
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:51,720
Your gender is fake, even your name is fake.

485
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,360
Fu Xiao, I considered you a friend, yet you carry my man's child.

486
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,679
That's not it.

487
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:01,412
Me and you are just like this handkerchief.

488
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:02,440
YourMajesty.

489
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,559
Let's end it here.

490
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,580
<i>He's not a bad person. Xiao Qiangzi would definitely not steal.</i>

491
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,839
<i>Don't harm him.</i>

492
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:30,539
Your Majesty.

493
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:34,639
Go after her!

494
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,248
Go!

<i>Your Majesty, please open the door.</i>

498
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,199
<i>Your Majesty, you open the door first.</i>

499
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,800
Even if it's Your Majesty, I will not open it.

500
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,140
If you do not wish to see me, then I will not enter for now.

501
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,480
<i>But later on, I will give you an explanation.</i>

502
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:26,812
Your Majesty, don't be like this.

503
00:41:26,812 --> 00:41:30,020
She is not worth your sorrow, nor is His Majesty.

504
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,340
Taking care of yourself is what's most important.

505
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,799
You may leave now.

506
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:36,600
