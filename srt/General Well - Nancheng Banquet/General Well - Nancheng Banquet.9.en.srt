The Yunshao Bureau is in the business of making ourselves visible.

23
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,640
How can you make money without showing yourself?

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,039
Young Master Wang is a wealthy merchant in the city.

25
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:50,720
He specifically asked for you, and I have already agreed.

- He'll be here soon.
- He'll come?

Commander Yan's monthly stipend has not yet been delivered.

I'm afraid he has already forgotten about you.

Chu Yue is my woman.

32
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,499
It is up to me to decide what she should and shouldn't do.

00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,679
I'll have Young Master Wang choose another beauty right away.

38
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:36,240
Chu Yue, take good care of Commander Yan.

39
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:41,099

40
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,900
Sorry, I got busy and forgot about the stipend.

Brother Yan, I knew you would come to find me.

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,740
Yan Changyun, you accuse me of indecency outside.

43
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,039
Yet here you are, keeping a beauty in a golden house,

Does this befit your status as a commander?

47

- How did you get here?
- Why can't I come?

If you can come, why can't I?

51
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,900
<i>That's right.</i>

52
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,339
I came to see the woman I care for,

53
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:22,190
who are you, a eunuch, to judge me?

54
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,560
Get out!

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,639
<i>How is it that a eunuch is meddling in Commander Yan's affairs?</i>

56
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,180
<i>Exactly.</i>

57
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,480
Fine!

58
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:38,759
- Brother Yan.
- Eunuch? No matter how you look at it, he looks like a woman.

59
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,879
He is…?

60
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,800
Just a little eunuch.

Don't you know?

83
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,020
I was originally sent to kill you.

84
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,836
Do you remember now?

85
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:57,460
No. But a few days ago, someone from my sect found me,

86
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,099
and said that if I didn't kill you, I would be considered a traitor.

87
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,600
Who is your sect?

88
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,439
I can't say, but I can assure you

89
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,399
that the people of my sect are all chivalrous and uphold justice.

90
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,959

How can you be sure their words are true or false?

93
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,960
You still remember the poison within me, right?

94
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,220
I only just found out, that not just myself, but the entire sect has been poisoned.

95
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,379
Moreover, that villain is blackmailing us with the antidote.

96

97
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,800
If I kill you, then we will all be saved.

98
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,360
Then you could have killed me. Why did you change your mind?

99
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,040
Don't you want to survive?

100
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,900

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,760
Besides, you saved my life.

That feeling when neither choice is right.

127
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:27,760
No way. Xiao Qiangzi, who thrives in any situation, could have such a day?

128
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,719
It's not me, it's a friend of mine.

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,260
Fine, your friend.

130
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,770
So, tell me. What's up with your friend?

131
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,920
First of all, her job is quite special.

132
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,040
How special? An assassin?

133
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,930
Not an assassin, but a chivalrous hero,

134
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,550

Forget it, these things are not important.

Anyway, she is now faced with a choice.

137
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,860
If she chooses to please herself, she would betray a friend.

138
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,180
But if she chooses her friend, she would feel aggrieved.

139
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,679
Of course, choose herself.

140
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,270
Then what about the friend?

141
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,760

142
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,719
So, what do you plan to do?

143
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,220
If it were me, I would choose the friend.

144
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,420
Then you're quite loyal.

145
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,800
Of course, for a friend, one must be ready to take a knife in the ribs.

146
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,539
Let's just say. If Xiao Wanli came to me and wanted to promote me to a higher rank,

147
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,779

I want to ascend to immortality!

172
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,020
I will kill you all! Kill!

173
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,888
<i>Kill!</i>

174
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:53,799
- Let's go.
<i>- Kill!</i>

175
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,500
Kill!

176
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:10,240
- Get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

177
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:13,988
Fang You.

178
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,699
- Quick, carry the body away.
<- Yes.

179
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,320
Put it down! Lawless.

180
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,620
Who allowed you to move the body?

181
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,440
The Ministry of Justice can't interfere with Thousand Feather Guards' case handling

182
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,000
Now it's under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice.

183
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,720
The Thousand Feather Guards has no say in this matter.

184
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,719
Let's see who dares to stop me.

185
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
Me.

186
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,059
Can eliminating Fang You really prevent future troubles?

187
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:57,740
It seems Yan Changyun won't easily let things go.

188
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,160
It's not up to him.

189
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:03,340
Master will handle it.

190
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,099
Commander Yan, you're quite imposing.
<i>[Sacrifice for the Country]</i>

191
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,440
The guards may not enter the palace without an imperial decree.

192
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,180
Does Lord Xiao not know or are you challenging the imperial authority?

193
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,260
I'm the chancellor; why would I need to use a knife to kill?

194
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,599
I'm asking you. The Ministry of Justice has been ordered to investigate,

195
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,320
on what grounds

196
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,340
does the Thousand Feather Guards have to seize Fang You's body in the street?

197
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,040
Someone died suddenly on the streets of the Southern Kingdom.

198
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,280
This is where the Thousand Feather Guards' duty lies.

199
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,299
You're openly defying the order of the Ministry of Justice.

200
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,679
That is to disregard me.

201
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,539
All land under heaven belongs to His Majesty.

202
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:56,300
All within the land owe allegiance to His Majesty.

203
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,740
I'm His Majesty's subject, I only take orders from His Majesty.

204
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,640
I obey the responsibilities that His Majesty has assigned to the Thousand Feather Guards.

205
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,499
Fine, the one who only obeys His Majesty.

206
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:12,440
You, come with me to see His Majesty.

207
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,200
I'd like to see what His Majesty has to say about this.

208
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,040
My Lord.

209
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:27,600
Both of you, My Lords. As I said before, His Majesty is truly not here.

210
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:42,908
<i>[Phoenix Rite Palace]</i>

211
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,799
Stand your ground, I will not see anyone today.

212
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,208
Okay.

213
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,699
How come Your Majesty has suddenly come to Phoenix Rite Palace?

214
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:05,419
You manage the harem for me, so I've come especially to see you.

215
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:07,460
Xue Ru, go prepare dinner quickly.

216
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,119
Your Majesty will stay at Phoenix Rite Palace tonight.

217
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,900
- Okay.
- Hold on!

218
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,619
Actually…

219
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,160
Actually, Your Majesty didn't come on purpose.

220
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,400
I'm here to avoid Chancellor Xiao and Commander Yan.

221
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,759
The two of them are endlessly quarreling and insisting that I make a decision.

222
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,140
I really don't know what to do.

223
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,500
That's nothing much.

224
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,159
Your Majesty, shall I take you out through the back door?

225
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,780
No rush at this moment.

226
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,939
I haven't seen you for many days.

227
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,519
I'll join you for a cup of tea.

228
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,180
Commander Yan, I must take Fang You's body away today.

229
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,299
The right to investigate vermilion silver powder must remain with the Ministry of Justice.

230
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,620
Lord Xiao, please do as you wish.

231
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,360
My Lords, His Majesty is resting inside.

232
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,039
Eunuch Feng, can you afford to delay important matters?

233
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,560
- No, Chancellor.
- Get out of the way!

234
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,124
Hold on.

235
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,279
Chancellor Xiao, Eunuch Feng just said that His Majesty is resting inside.

236
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,180
If you don't believe it, Chancellor Xiao, please do as you see fit.

237
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,060
But if you disturb His Majesty favoring Her Majesty,

238
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,419
this crime…

239
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,979
Your Majesty.

240
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:46,459
Chancellor Xiao, please take your time.

241
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,880
Commander Yan!

242
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,950
Commander Yan!

243
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,540
Please don't be angry with me.

244
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,979
Let's be like we used to be.

245
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:07,179
I was wrong, please don't ignore me.

246
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:09,080
Killing you…

247
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,930
My intention to kill you was wrong.

248
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:14,340
I apologize to you.

249
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,839
How do you want me to make it up to you? Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.

250
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,019
Some things can't just be resolved with an apology.

251
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,979
If you want to kill me, I'm always ready.

252
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:33,559
If not, then stay away from me.

253
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,820
Fortunately, I blocked the door.

254
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,739
I fought to the death to stop Commander Yan and the chancellor.

255
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:45,444
This allowed Your Majesty to escape disaster.

256
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:47,170
Reward!

257
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,690
Reward Xiao Qiangzi with triple his monthly silver for this month.

258
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:55,359
This kid is really clever.

259
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,940
I actually regret having transferred him away.

260
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,660
Indeed.

261
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,420
Your Majesty,

262
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,140
the vermilion silver powder case is important and can no longer be delayed.

263
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,760
Please grant me an imperial decree today, Your Majesty.

264
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,000
Chancellor, this blank imperial edict is…?

265
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,780
Please have Your Majesty use the seal.

266
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,580
I'll fill in the names of the people involved myself.

267
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,120
Additionally, I beseech Your Majesty,

268
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,359
to grant me the power to execute before reporting.

269
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,480
Chancellor, you're pressuring His Majesty.

270
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,200
Does a eunuch also wish to meddle in politics and bring disaster upon the government?

271
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:48,760
Your Majesty, the vermilion silver powder is a disaster for the nation and the people.

272
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,540
In the past, Qin Wenzhong was implicated because of the vermilion silver powder,

273
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,240
and was executed along with all his family.

274
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,020
Now, the vermilion silver powder once again brings trouble to the Southern Kingdom.

275
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,459
It must be the Qin Family who have come back to cause trouble.

276
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:01,160
Attempting to overthrow the Southern Kingdom's regime.

277
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,659
<i>Your Majesty, you can't hesitate any longer.</i>

278
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:07,320
<i>Otherwise, the Qin Family will truly start a rebellion.</i>

279
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,679
<i>The late emperor said that Duke Ding has always been loyal and devoted.</i>

280
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,820
<i>I don't believe he would mislead the country with vermilion silver powder.</i>

281
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,620
<i>Your Majesty, you have just ascended to the throne and are still young.</i>

282
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,920
<i>You are completely deceived by him.</i>

283
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,939
<i>If he is not eliminated, the Southern Kingdom will have endless troubles.</i>

284
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:31,179
Your Majesty, I gave myself to the people, exhausting all my thoughts and energies.

285
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:34,480
Only by completely eliminating those associated with vermilion silver powder,

286
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,019
can we ensure that the Southern Kingdom remains secure forever.

287
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,010
Your Majesty, the situation is urgent.

288
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,550
Please use the royal seal as soon as possible.

289
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

290
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,140
I shall proceed according to Your Majesty's command.

291
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,070
I'll leave.

292
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:42,400
<i>Xiao Wanli, I will never be manipulated by you again.</i>

293
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:49,224
<i>[Chancellor's Residence]</i>

294
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:55,020
<i>[Imperial Edict]</i>

295
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:03,519
Father, on this list

296
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,640
are the names of all the people related to vermilion silver powder.

297
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,659
They are all on it?

298
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,132
Yes.

299
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,100
You are the only son of our Xiao Family.

300
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,199
To protect you, I can only do this.

301
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,019
Quan'er, I'm old.

302
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:31,179
Sooner or later, I must step down.

303
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:33,124
I want to pave the way for you

304
00:22:33,124 --> 00:22:36,419
and clear obstacles to elevate you to the position of Chancellor.

305
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:41,499
Father, the position of Chancellor is like the highest dome for you.

306
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:45,179
Below one person, and above ten thousand people. I don't care.

307
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,860
Zhao Yuan, that foolish ruler, what right does he have to be above me?

308
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,520
What does he possess that makes him worthy of my assistance?

309
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,659
While I possess virtue and talent, and the ability to bring peace to the country.

310
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,620
If I'm to sit, then I must sit in the highest position.

311
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,390
That is treason!

312
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,410
You dare to harbor an untrue heart.

313
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:06,072
Father,

314
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,219
nowadays, a change of dynasties isn't necessarily a bad thing.

315
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:20,072
I absolutely forbid you to destroy my Xiao Family's reputation for generations of loyalty and integrity.

316
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:23,640
Father, you manipulate power and coerce His Majesty.

317
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,428
Who in the world does not know, who is not aware?

318
00:23:26,428 --> 00:23:30,599
And where does our Xiao Family derive its reputation for loyalty and integrity?

319
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,899
You are just worried that I will bring trouble upon our Xiao Family, upon you. Right?

320
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:38,660
Don't forget, you also bear the surname Xiao.

321
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:43,639
I will carefully heed Father's teachings.

322
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,060
You…

323
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,380
<i>I'll say it once more.</i>

324
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,079
<i>Stay out of matters regarding vermilion silver powder!</i>

325
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:18,960
<i>[Miaoyin Pavilion]</i>

326
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,180
Life is but a dream in this dusty world.

327
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,560
How many times does life turn cold in autumn?

328
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:36,680
The golden powder has not yet faded away.

329
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:43,499
Ends of the earth sever the heartstrings.

330
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,259
My life has been nothing but a tragedy.

331
00:24:56,979 --> 00:25:00,259
Yet the onlookers laugh.

332
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:05,079
I have been overthrown by them time and again.

333
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:10,100
I don't know when I can truly stand up again.

334
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:18,319
Perhaps I was wrong from the very beginning.

335
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,399
If I had not been so weak back then.

336
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,330
If I didn't let Xiao Wanli execute Duke Ding,

337
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,410
then I wouldn't have been a puppet for all these years,

338
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,279
and even be regarded as a feeble-minded emperor.

339

Brother Yan, will your spirit in heaven...

340
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,919
hate me?

341
00:25:58,464 --> 00:26:00,796
<i>Brother Yan,</i>

342
00:26:00,796 --> 00:26:07,540
<i>the people in the imperial palace are very respectful in front of me.</i>

00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,680
<i>But behind my back, they look at me differently.</i>

344
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,319
<i>Although I am the emperor,</i>

345
00:26:15,939 --> 00:26:18,580
<i>I don't even have a single good friend.</i>

346
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,900
<i>I'm here for Your Majesty.</i>

347
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,680
<i>I'm willing to accompany you for life and protect you in every way.</i>

348
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,820
<i>It's a promise.</i>

349
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,599
<i>It's a promise.</i>

350
00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:45,359
As long as Your Majesty does not give up,

351
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,860
there will always be a chance to reclaim all that belongs to you.

352
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:15,459
<i>Brother Yan, if I do wrong in the future,</i>

353
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:17,640
<i>will you still play with me?</i>

354
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,800
<i>My father told me, that to know one's mistake and to correct it is the most virtuous.</i>

355
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,679
<i>This is the etiquette of conduct.</i>

356
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,379
<i>Your Majesty, no matter what you do in the future, I will never blame you.</i>

357
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:31,611
<i>This is called the rites between sovereign and subject.</i>

358
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,800
Your Majesty, Her Majesty has arrived.

359
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,200
She has been looking for you everywhere.

360
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:00,039
I do not wish to see her.

361
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,759
Your Majesty, then I shall take my leave first.

362
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,780
Your Majesty, what are you doing here?

363
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,580
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

364
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,960
Look what I prepared for you.

365
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,699
This is the divine medicine for fertility.

366
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:33,840
My father specially requested it from Mount Ling.

367
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,820
Father said it never fails.

368
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,680
Your Majesty, please follow me back to the sleeping quarters.

369
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,219
Fine, I will indulge you.

370
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,344
Undress.

371
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,340
Your Majesty, what are you saying?

372
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,060
I am telling you to undress.

373
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,860
Aren't you the one who wants to sleep together?

374
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,319
I've taken the medicine for fertility.

375
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,559
Let's sleep here right now, right here.

376
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:43,880
Why are you standing there? Undress.

377
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,499
Your Majesty, perhaps you and Her Majesty should return to the sleeping quarters.

378
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:51,059
No, I want it to be here.

379
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,879
Undress, are you defying my order?

380
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:00,230
Or do you want to oppose me, just like they do?

381
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,950
Undress!

382
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,900
Undress!

383
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,600
A'Cheng, have you gone mad? I'm really frustrated.

384
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,400
Who isn't frustrated? I'm frustrated, too.

385
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,480
When have the Thousand Feather Guards ever suffered such humiliation before?

386
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,160
What are you two arguing about?

387
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,960
Commander, Fang You's body is an important clue.

388
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,519
You're not angry that Xiao Wanli just snatched it away?

389
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,350
What's there to be angry about?

390
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,550
Both of you, don't be too anxious.

391
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:35,999
That old fox's tail is about to be exposed soon.

392
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,628
<i>Don't use brute force, use skillful strength. Come on.</i>

393
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:54,440
How did you get here?

394
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,659
How did I get here?

395
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:01,820
Your Majesty, you were so drunk last night.

396
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,140
I'm afraid you don't remember what you said or did.

397
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,639
Her Majesty hasn't slept all night.

398
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:11,240
And early in the morning, she sent me to greet you.

399
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,800
Was I perhaps a bit…

400
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,070
excessive to Her Majesty?

401
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,040
Excessive. Very excessive.

402
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,519
Your Majesty, Chancellor Xiao that old rascal is at fault, he deserves to be sliced 1000 times.

403
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,559
But what fault does Her Majesty have?

404
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,720
You're right.

405
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,080
I know that Her Majesty was somewhat wronged.

406
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,764
Somewhat?

407
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:42,259
Your Majesty, last night you had Her Majesty undress in public.

408
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:43,979
Not to mention Her Majesty,

409
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:48,140
even for any woman, it's such a humiliation.

410
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,900
<i>[To rule with virtue]</i>
Your Majesty, you're the ruler of our kingdom.

411
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,560
What's most important for you is magnanimity.

412
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,620
Her Majesty entangles you all day.

413
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,320
Is it not because she likes you?

414
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,540
Yes, you might not like her, but you can't humiliate her.

415
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,119
Then, what do you suggest I should do?

416
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,340
Apologize.

417
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:15,980
No, I am the emperor.

418
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,920
I can't apologize.

419
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:23,959
That's right! You are the revered one, above all others. As a servant, my words carry little weight.

420
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:25,430
Why should I meddle in your affairs? I'll be leaving.

421
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,690
Why should I meddle in your affairs? I'll be leaving.

422
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:28,504
Wait!

423
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,640
Although I can't apologize, I can make it up to Her Majesty.

424
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,979
How about gold, silver, jewels, and the like?

425
00:32:39,979 --> 00:32:44,300
Gold and jewels? You would think of that. Who cares for those?

426
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,699
You.

427
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:50,900
It's true I like those, but she's Her Majesty.

428
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,150
If you really want to express your intentions,

429
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,360
then can you show a bit of sincerity?

430
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,520
Sincerity?

431
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,860
Like this, please think carefully.

432
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,040
On regular days, has Her Majesty ever asked you for anything?

433
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,690
She asked me for a child,

434
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,110
I can't give it to her.

435
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,780
Right! She mentioned to me that she wanted to visit her family.

436
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,839
I refused.

437
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,540
How about we let Her Majesty return home to visit her family?

438
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:28,200
<i>[Promoting the Virtuous]</i>

439
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:43,540
Then why didn't you say so earlier?

440
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,559
On what grounds does Xiao Wanli seize the right to investigate the vermilion silver powder case?

441
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,619
We have to think of a way to fight back.

442
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:53,060
Be quiet! Boss said Xiao Wanli must be related to the vermilion silver powder.

443
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,320
Then he must have the list of conspirators.

444
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,450
We will take action tonight.

445
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,532
Jiaojaio, come and support me at the back door of Xiao's mansion tonight.

446
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:05,540
- What are you going to do?
- Helping you steal the list.

447
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,740
But don't tell Yan Changyun about this. I'm planning to give him a surprise.

448
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,240
It's too dangerous!

449
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,220
I am no better than you in dealing with the Her Majesty.

450
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,839

He'll be guarding the gate of the Xiao Mansion all night; ready to coordinate with us at any time.

454
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,499
How come Xiao Qiangzi has also gone?

455
00:34:36,499 --> 00:34:40,039
I heard Her Majesty took him. What's the matter?

456
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,520
It's nothing.

457
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,560
Remember the layout of the Xiao Mansion and the routes for entry and retreat,

458
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,419
and support me from the outside.

459
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:53,700
I'll enter the Xiao Mansion myself to get the list.

460
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,100
Boss, the guard at the Xiao Mansion is strict,

461
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,360
it's too difficult to get in.

462
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,180
Even if it's a dangerous place, I still need to go.

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,879
or what he is doing now

467
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,560
Your Majesty, His Majesty must be thinking of you.

468
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,839
Thinking of you so much...

469
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:33,720
that he has become sleepy.

470
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,419
It's getting late, you should rest early.

471
00:35:37,419 --> 00:35:41,839

00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,499
I do.

481
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:17,819

00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:31,380
I didn't expect you to have kept it so well for me.

486
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,730
You're my little sister.

487
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,540
Of course, I have to take good care of your things.

Brother, let's just keep it at home.

490
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,800
Initially, it was because His Majesty didn't like the scent.

491
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,960
That's why I didn't wear it.

492
