Fu Xiao.

23
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,820
You are Qin Yan.

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,964
That's right.

25
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,880
I saved you 15 years ago,

26
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,819
yet you ordered my parents' death.

27
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,540
<i>Her parents died because of you.</i>

28
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,119

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,684
That's right.

32
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,990
Impossible.

33
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,750
Yan Changyun,

34
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,680
just yesterday, you said you loved me.

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,524
Was it all a lie?

36
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:59,179
- Why?
- You should already know the reason.

37
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,000
From the very beginning, you came to kill me, didn't you?

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,619
How could I possibly fall in love with you?

39
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,360
From start to finish,

40
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,090
I just wanted to obtain the jade ring.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,500
Now that it has come to this.

42
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,879
Tell me. Where is the jade ring?

43
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,159
<i>I've finally found you.</i>

44
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,499
<i>Tell me. Where is the jade ring?</i>

45
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,199
Where exactly is the jade ring?

46
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,159
Now that you know my identity,

47
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,759
and can't produce the jade ring,

48
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,260

56
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,824
Boss.

57
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,264
Senior Sister.

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,220
I hope you keep your promise.

60
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,480
Yes, Master.

61
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,720
Your Majesty.

62
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,879
It's a cool day today, take care of yourself.

63
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,520
What's wrong?

64
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,700
Your Majesty, if I hadn't been born into the Xiao Family,

65
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:48,659
would it have been possible for you to fall in love with me?

66
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,430
It's difficult to obtain sincerity in this position of mine,

67
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,560
and difficult to love someone else.

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,439
I'm grateful for the tenderness you've given.

69
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,079
And thank you for the warmth you've provided.

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,680
But that's not love.

71
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,840
Yes.

72
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,079
Since you already know, why do you have to be this way towards me?

73
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,670
I'm willing to sacrifice my all for you,

74
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,670
without any regrets.

75
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:35,060
Your Majesty!

76
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,720
Your Majesty, something has happened. It's not good.

77
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,199
Fu Xiao killed Yan Changyun.

78
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,416
Let's go.

79
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,100
How is he now?

80
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,639
To report back to Your Majesty. Young Master Yan is gravely injured.

81
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,299
His pulse is like a thread, and it's extremely critical.

82
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:04,680
Rest assured, Your Majesty. I'll do my utmost to treat him.

83
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,320
I don't care what you do,

84
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,160
you must save his life.

85
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,424
- Do you understand?
- Understood.

86
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,519
What about Fu Xiao?

87
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,000
Your Majesty, she has already been taken away by her master.

88
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,419
Why would she kill Yan Changyun?

89
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,340
<i>Fu Xiao, take this antidote,</i>

90
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,819
<i>and the poison in your body will be completely neutralized.</i>

91
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,720
Fu Xiao, you're awake.

92
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,779
Master.

93
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,879
Where is this?

94
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,759
This is Wanshi Pavilion, you're safe here.

95
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,196
Where are you going?

96
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,420
I want to go back and have a look.

97
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,220
Fu Xiao,

98
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,260
have you not let go of him yet?

99
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,560
No,

100
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,720
the grudge I have with him is irreconcilable.

101
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,890
I just want to go back and see if he's dead.

102
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,060
Let everything go.

103
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,680
You should also let go
of all the grudges between you and him.

104
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,412
Forget him.

105
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:21,700
<i>[Yan Residence]</i>

106
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,600
I'm sorry, Brother Yan.

107
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,000
I just wanted her to stay away from you.

108
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,600
I didn't expect…

109
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,180
I'll be with you from now on.

110
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,070
Although...

111
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,100
you've never had feelings for me.

112
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,300
Fu Xiao.

113
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,770
Fu Xiao.

114
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,500
Brother Yan, you're awake.

115
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,260
Brother Yan has woken up.

116
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,680
Brother Yan.

117
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,419
Fu Xiao won't be coming.

118
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,599
She stabbed me...

119
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,500
because of you. Right?

120
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,500
Brother Yan, I…

121
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,740
The young master has awoken.

122
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,100
Young Master, I've wronged you.

123
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,559
Young Master, it's all my fault for being foolish.

124
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,559
For having slandered you, it's all my fault.

125
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:20,839
Young Master, please don't blame Chu Yue.

126
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,159
No, Brother Yan, it was all my idea.

127
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,330
You can go.

128
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,690
I don't want to see you again.

129
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,279
Young Master, Chu Yue has suffered so much.

130
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,240
The reason she did this was to be with you.

131
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,720
Uncle Lei, for so many years,

132
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,200
I have owed you too much.

133
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,210
I will give you, and everyone, an explanation.

134
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,124
<i>[Minister's Mansion]</i>

135
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,560
My Lord.

136
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,799
Fu Xiao attempted to assassinate Yan Changyun, but Yan Changyun is not dead.

137
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,319
Bai Yi took Fu Xiao away.

138
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,460
<i>What does Bai Yi want to do?</i>

139
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,960
What if I go and kill Fu Xiao?

140
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,420
How are things with the Ning Kingdom?

141
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,940
Everything is arranged and ready for action at any time.

142
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,159
Then let our old friend invite Qin Yan to show himself.

143
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:42,399
I want to see if Qin Yan dares to come out.

144
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,039
Or will he watch those old members of the Qin Family die for him.

145
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,020
Shameless! The Ning Kingdom simply has no integrity whatsoever.

146
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,799
The envoy has just returned to the country,

147
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,720
and he has actually declared an open war on the Southern Kingdom.

148
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,439
Is it because they think the Southern Kingdom has no one left?

149
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:03,860
Or is it because they think I'm scared of them?

150
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,136
<i>- This is too much.
- Isn't it?</i>

151
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:13,779
Your Majesty, the Ning Kingdom cavalry is now assembling at the border.

152
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:17,220
They demand that Yan Changyun must die.

153
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,179
We need to give an explanation quickly.

154
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,480
Yan Changyun, I won't kill him.

155
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,599
He is someone I have chosen to protect.

156
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,600
If I were to satisfy Ning Kingdom's unreasonable demands,

157
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,300
wouldn't it mean that we would be at the mercy of others in the future?

158
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:35,592
- Commander Wei.
- Here.

159
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:39,100
I command you to lead troops to reinforce the border and set out in three days.

160
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,140
Yes.

161
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,700
Your Majesty, Southern Kingdom has many soldiers and generals.

162
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,500
Naturally, we are not afraid of the Ning Kingdom's war.

163
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,639
But for the sake of the country, and for the sake of the people,

164
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,120
if war erupts between these nations, it would spell disaster for all living beings.

165
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,359
<i>Indeed, the people are innocent.</i>

166
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,080
Indeed, Your Majesty.

167
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,620
Ning Kingdom's hundred thousand cavalries shouldn't be underestimated.

168
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,640
Can you bear to let the Southern Kingdom fall into years of warfare once again?

169
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,699
Your Majesty, you must consider the overall situation.

170
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:17,080
Whether to fight or to have peace, Your Majesty, you must think carefully.

171
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,860
<i>Please, Your Majesty, think carefully.</i>

172
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,680
If we can't go into war, and peace…

173
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,850
I'm not willing to accept it.

174
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,500
What exactly do you want me to do?

175
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,360
If Yan Changyun can't be killed,

176
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,819
then we can find someone else to be the scapegoat.

177
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:39,360
Someone else? What do you mean?

178
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,200
The remnants of Guanyou.

179
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,639
<i>The remnants of Guanyou.</i>

180
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,039
<i>This is a good proposal.</i>

181
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,759
15 years ago, they fought against the elite forces of the Ning Kingdom.

182
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,919
There have long been old grudges.

183
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,059
After the emperor dealt with the Qin Family, it added new hatred for them.

184
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:09,020
And now the Southern Kingdom is about to engage in trade with the Ning Kingdom.

185
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,750
They harbor resentment in their hearts.

186
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,180
Thus, they provoked a dispute between the two nations.

187
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,360
The biggest suspect in the murder of Princess Jiayang,

188
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,960
is the remaining evil of Guanyou.

189
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,559
<i>That's right, Lord Xiao is correct.</i>

190
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,920
<i>- Lord Xiao is right.
- This proposal is good.</i>

191
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,080
Your Majesty, as long as we eliminate the remaining evil of Guanyou,

192
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,220
then we can give the Ning Kingdom an explanation.

193
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,240
And also root out future troubles for the Southern Kingdom.

194
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,159
This is the best strategy.

195
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,280
<i>We agree!</i>

196
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,300
Young Master, Ning Kingdom used the death of Princess Jiayang to gather one hundred thousand cavalries at the border.

197
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:11,559
They demand the court to give an explanation for Princess Jiayang's death and are proposing to execute you.

198
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,200
His Majesty is unwilling to be controlled and also doesn't wish to start a war now.

199
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,880
So, he heeded the advice of Xiao Quan.

200
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,579
In order to prevent the Ning Kingdom's invasion, the old members of the Qin family were convicted and all will be executed.

201
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,364
What?

202
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,039
Help me change my clothes, I want to see His Majesty.

203
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,100
Young Master, Xiao Quan has always intended to use this to eliminate you with His Majesty's hand.

204
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,720
- If you go now…
- Change my clothes.

205
00:17:37,852 --> 00:17:40,068
<i>[Imperial Spring Palace]</i>

206
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,440
You already know the court's decision.

207
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,160
All right, go back.

208
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:08,480
Your Majesty, the former members of the Qin Family are innocent.

209
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,060
If Your Majesty must give Ning Kingdom an explanation,

210
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,520
then in exchange for the Southern Kingdom's peace,

211
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,440
I can die.

212
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,900
Commander Yan, I can't possibly kill you.

213
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,659
If you die, then who will protect me?

214
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,040
Then what if…

215
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,359
I'm that person who has been hiding for 15 years with a capital crime.

216
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,490
The only son of Duke Ding, Qin Wenzhong,

217
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,440
Qin Yan?

218
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,690
15 years ago,

219
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,920
Your Majesty gave orders to kill the entire Qin Family.

220
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,259
Only I survived, and lived on with a hidden identity.

221
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,119
Later, I joined the army, fought the enemy, and earned distinctions.

222
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,360
Step by step, I became the leader of the Thousand Feather Guards,

223
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,960
and lurking by Your Majesty's side.

224
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,559
I originally intended to clear the unjust accusations against the Qin Family.

225
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:26,490
But I never expected things to evolve to this point today.

226
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,279
Now, I, Qin Yan, am willing to turn myself in.

227
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,720
I only hope that Your Majesty can spare those innocent people.

228
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,019
You revealed your identity before me,

229
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:41,860
then aren't you afraid that I will kill you?

230
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:45,799
Your Majesty, in fact, you have long guessed my identity.

231
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,410
If you really wanted to kill me, why wait until today?

232
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,000
You're allergic to shrimp shells.

233
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,720
After I saved you with the juice of perilla leaves that time, you began to suspect me.

234
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,759
You taught Fu Xiao the Nine Heroes stabs on purpose.

235
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,300
It was actually to test me.

236
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,979
You have never dismissed your suspicions of me.

237
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:14,019
You have never exposed my identity.

238
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,860
But I knew that sooner or later,

239
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,459
I would stand before you as Qin Yan.

240
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,440
Do you know why I kept this secret?

241
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,660
You've been by my side for so many years, and never harmed me,

242
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,259
but instead, you protect me at all costs.

243
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:48,680
I know that you still care about the brotherhood of those years, and so do I.

244
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,340
But the Southern Kingdom encountered this great disaster,

245
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,880
and I agreed to Xiao Quan's approach due to the situation.

246
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,360
I'm willing to bear all the charges alone.

247
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,279
You're intent on seeking death.

248
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,359
I have no more cares left.

249
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,559
What about Fu Xiao?

250
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,580
Fu Xiao doesn't belong here.

251
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,860
I can't give her a future,

252
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,279
nor can you give her happiness.

253
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:17,820
Yan Changyun, Fu Xiao is much braver than you.

254
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,639
At least she dares to love and hate, daring to do anything. And you?

255
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:30,699
I just don't want to implicate anyone else again.

256
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:33,140
Especially her.

257
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,100
Fine! Since you seek death with all your heart, I'll grant your wish.

258
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,772
Guards!

259
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,480
Imprison Yan Changyun in the Sky Prison.

260
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,279
Strictly guard him. No one is allowed to approach him.

261
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,752
- Yes.
- Yes.

262
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:28,312
Eunuch Feng.

263
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:32,820
I'm here.

264
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,400
I wish to draft an imperial edict

265
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,380
and tell all that Yan Changyun is imprisoned in the Sky Prison and will be executed soon.

266
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,856
Yes.

267
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,839
My Lord, Yan Changyun has revealed his identity.

268
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,788
His Majesty has already thrown him into the Sky Prison and will be executed soon.

269
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:54,240
<i>[Qingya]</i>

270
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,010
Qin Yan.

271
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,960
You've finally appeared and surrendered yourself.

272
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,560
After all these years, if it hadn't been for Qin Yan by Zhao Yuan's side,

273
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,440
I wouldn't have been restrained by him at every turn.

274
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,640
Heng'er would not have been trapped in the deep palace without freedom.

275
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:18,820
Now it seems this Zhao Yuan has finally done one thing right.

276
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,659
Without Yan Changyun, the Southern Kingdom is like a tiger without teeth.

277
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:28,900
By then, we'll be able to lead our troops through the pass.

278
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,580
That's right! As soon as Yan Changyun dies,

279
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,440
we'll take action immediately.

280
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,380
Your Majesty, just as you expected, Lord Xiao has indeed started to make his move.

281
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,080
It seems he can no longer restrain himself.

282
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:06,519
Brother Yan, I have no choice but to reveal this trump card now.

283
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,844
I hope our hearts are one.

284
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:14,470
<i>[Wanshi Pavilion]</i>

285
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:22,279
Master, you said that once a person develops real feelings,

286
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,459
do they really stop distinguishing right from wrong?

287
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:34,279
A man's indulgence can still be cast aside,

288
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:38,810
but once a woman is enthralled, it can't be shed.

289
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,979
Once a woman develops real feelings,

290
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:46,179
she may be blinded by love.

291
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:49,659
By then, whether it's good or bad,

292
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:53,279
she might not even be able to distinguish it herself.

293
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:56,480
Everything is in the past.

294
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,920
It's time for you and him to end.

295
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:07,160
Since you have returned,

296
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,470
it's better to think carefully,

297
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:14,960
about what that thing he always asked you to find actually is.

298
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,519
And what sort of mystery lies within it?

299
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,919
The jade ring.

300
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,620
Master, why does he want to find that jade ring?

301
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,264
That's right. Why does he want to find the jade ring?

302
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:40,880
Fu Xiao.

303
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,419
Do you know where the ring is?

304
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:54,900
<i>Before I returned, I specifically had a jade roller made.</i>

305
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,860
<i>That's why it took a little bit of extra time.</i>

306
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,780
<i>From now on, you can use it to massage and promote blood circulation.</i>

307
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,140
<i>It's very beneficial for your legs.</i>

308
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,519
<i>This is made of the finest mutton-fat white jade.</i>

309
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,979
Master, I still can't remember anything.

310
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:23,240
My head hurts terribly as soon as I think about these things.

311
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,839
Don't force it if you can't remember.

312
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,399
Your health is the most important right now.

313
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,300
You should rest well first.

314
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,130
Thank you, Master.

315
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,270
I'll take my leave now.

316
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,650
Senior Sister.

317
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,170
Did you kill Princess Jiayang?

318
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:19,839
I warn you, don't make baseless accusations.

319
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:29,939
This plum blossom dagger was a special weapon given to you by our master.

320
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:34,160
The fatal wound on Princess Jiayang's body came exactly from this,

321
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,200
yet you still won't admit it?

322
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:41,100
I killed her. What can you do about it?

323
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,920
Why did you do this?

324
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,659
We were going to kill Yan Changyun anyway.

325
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:49,090
Since killing Jiayang could eliminate Yan Changyun,

326
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,200
why not go through with it?

327
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,340
Does Master know about this?

328
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:03,880
What we do in Wanshi Pavilion must all be permitted by the master.

329
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,759
So, what do you think?

330
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,379
<i>Are you suspecting Qing Li killed Princess Jiayang?</i>

331
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:20,000
<i>Do you think that I gave orders?</i>

332
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,239
But isn't Wanshi Pavilion always devoted to punishing the wicked and eradicating evil?

333
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,419
Killing Jiayang was originally a deed of punishing the wicked and eradicating evil.

334
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:30,699
Just like killing Yan Changyun.

335
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:35,599
It's just that some can't complete these tasks,

336
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,680
and I'm the only one who can complete them.

337
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,750
Do you understand?

338
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,820
I just look down upon you kind of people.

339
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,039
Casting aside important affairs for the sake of romantic attachment.

340
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,539
Just like Yan Changyun.

341
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:52,120
He knew that only with his death could you live,

342
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,419
yet he really went on to endure that sword strike of yours, willing to die.

343
00:28:56,419 --> 00:28:58,659
Truly foolish.

344
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,499
Luckily, he died by my hand.

345
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:06,259
Not as you wished.

346
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:08,519
You're truly overestimating yourself.

347
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,659
Yan Changyun wasn't killed by you at all.

348

However, he won't live long.

349
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:17,219
The court is going to execute him soon.

350
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:20,620
He is Qin Yan who has been on the run for many years.

351
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,759
He has been thrown into the Sky Prison, to be executed on a chosen day.

Fu Xiao,

the poison in your body has been removed.

370
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,880
The stagnant blood in your body is also gradually dissipating.

371
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,019
Feel it yourself.

372
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:15,559
Can you remember the past?

373
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,880
Master,

374
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,160
I still can't remember anything.

375
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,610
If you can't remember, then let it be

376
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,739
There's still a long road ahead.

377
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:39,240
I'll certainly try every possible way to get you back to your former self.

378
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,140
I'm sorry, Master.

379
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,860
Silly child, you did nothing wrong.

380
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,440
I never blamed you.

381
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,080
Master,

382
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,300
sometimes I think

383
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,759
if I hadn't gone to assassinate Yan Changyun,

384
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:04,499
hadn't left Wanshi Pavilion, and hadn't lost my memory,

385
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:06,980
we would have always stayed here.

386
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,699
I would still be me who loves to cause a stir and laugh.

387
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:16,120
And you would still be that righteous master who punishes evil and promotes good.

388
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,800
As long as you come back safely, that's good.

389
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,580
We'll still return to our former ways.

390
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:31,900
Right now, I still have things to do.

391
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,060
After all this is over,

392
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:38,259
we will leave this place of trouble.

393
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:42,400
Life will surely get better from now on.

394
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,710
Okay.

395
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,500
Master, let me massage your legs again.

396
00:33:03,236 --> 00:33:06,684
Senior Sister, since you returned, you have been constantly by master's side, taking care of him.

397
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,340
Take a break, let me do it.

398
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,900
Junior brother, after I left Wanshi Pavilion,

399
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,299
it has always been you and Senior Sister who have cared for Master.

400
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:17,160
It's also time for me to fulfill my filial duties.

401
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,559
No harm. It'll be fine with some repair in a few days.

402
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,039
I'll go and repair it right now.

403
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,940
Master,

404
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,350
I'm sorry.

405
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,359
Get some rest early.

406
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,700
<i>Yan Changyun is also looking, and my master is also searching for this.</i>

407
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,059
<i>What secret does this ring hold exactly?</i>

408
00:34:30,059 --> 00:34:32,960
<i>Why is it so important?</i>

409
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:51,988
<i>[Signed as proof: Contract parties - Xiao Quan, Ge Heng, and Guo Zhen]</i>

410
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,459
Qing Yun.

411
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:10,180
Why isn't Fu Xiao here?

412
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,616
Senior Sister must still be resting.

413
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:15,680
Early this morning, I saw the repaired jade roller placed on the table.

414
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,760
Senior Sister must have stayed up all night fixing it.

415
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,239
What's wrong?

416
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:30,200
Nothing much, it's just that the jade roller seems lighter.

417
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,440
It doesn't handle as smoothly as before.

418
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,780
<i>No harm. It'll be fine with some repair in a few days.</i>

419
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,360
<i>I'll go and repair it right now.</i>

420
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,150
<i>Master,</i>

421
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,510
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

422
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,340
Go check if Fu Xiao is still in the room.

423
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,419
- Master, what's wrong?
- Go quickly!

424
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,000
Yes.

425
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,400
Master, Senior Sister isn't in the room. A few fellow disciples also haven't seen her.

426
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,300
Notify Qing Li to go after her quickly.

427
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,910
Yes.

428

<i>Stop!</i>

434
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,740
<i>The child has already left.</i>

435
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,570
<i>We truly don't know where he went.</i>

436
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,820
