You're still not asleep yet?

23
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,439
Why have you returned so late?

24
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,980
You already made the bed for me.

25
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,250
Thank you, Commander Yan. Let's go to bed early then.

26
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,040
Don't change the subject!

27
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,810
Tell me why you're back so late.

28
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,819
His Majesty was teaching me swordsmanship.

29
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,440
I lost track of time, so I came back late.

30
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,260
His Majesty was teaching you swordsmanship?

31
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,059
Did you ask him or did he offer to teach you?

32
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:31,319
Of course, he offered to teach me.

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,060
- What can he teach you?
- Sword techniques.

34
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,390
Don't think that your martial arts are invincible.

35
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,720
We have already found a way to defeat the enemy.

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,119
His Majesty said that as long as I use the sword techniques he taught me, I'd surely defeat you.

37
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,180
<i>His Majesty is teaching you swordsmanship?</i>

38
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,899
<i>Did you ask him or did he offer to teach you?</i>

39
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:03,090
<i>Of course, he offered to teach me.</i>

40
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,180
<i>We have already found a way to defeat the enemy.</i>

41
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,900
<i>And I have learned two moves just within today.</i>

42
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,000
<i>In a few days, I'm sure I'll be able to learn them all.</i>

<i>Knowing to use perilla leaf juice to save me.</i>

00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:27,479
<i>What reward do you want?</i>

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,059

Please rise.

49
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,520
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

50
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,240
Your Majesty seldom visits the Thousand Feather Guards training grounds. Why the sudden visit today?

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,260
I heard there were assessments today, so I came specially to observe.

52
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,200

<i>Brother Yan, this move is awesome! What's it called?</i>

<i>- Except for us of the Qin family.
- Why is that?</i>

59
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,300
<i>Because our Qin family has a hereditary technique to counter it.</i>

- Boss, are you okay?

64
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,260
- A'Cheng, quickly take Commander Yan back.
- Yes.

65
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,380
I'll go and call the imperial physician.

66
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,480
Boss, careful.

67
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,400
How did you get wounded so badly?

68
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Here, let me tend to your wounds.

69
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,300
I dare not trouble Your Majesty. I'll wait for the imperial physician to take care of it.

70
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,900
Commander Yan, my safety is entirely in your hands.

71
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,800
Let me see. Be careful not to injure any vital part.

72
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,620
<i>How to break this? Teach me quickly.</i>

73
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:55,140
<i>Brother Yan, what's wrong with you?</i>

74
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:57,660
<i>Imperial physician.</i>

75
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,060
Commander Yan, Imperial Physician Qu has arrived.

76
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,179
Greetings, Your Majesty.

77
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:15,380
Your Majesty, Commander Yan's sword wound was, after all, caused by me.

78
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,299
So, with me and Imperial Physician Qu here, you can rest assured.

79
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,419
Report Commander Yan's injuries at any time.

80
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

81
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,144
Take good care of him.

82
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,160
- I respectfully see off Your Majesty.
- I respectfully see off Your Majesty.

83
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,580
Commander Yan's endurance is truly astonishing.

84
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,559
This wound is quite deep.

85
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:54,079
This medicine, Xiao Qiangzi,

86
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,180
then you shall change it for Commander Yan daily.

87
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,990
Remember, three times a day.

88
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,620
Three times a day. Got it!

89
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,199
Good, thank you for your efforts.

90
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,280
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,170
It's all my fault; I've caused your injury.

92
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,236
Don't blame yourself, you have improved quickly.

93
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:17,260
It was my underestimation.

94
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,260
A'Cheng, you go ahead.

95
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:33,360
Commander, with your martial skills, how could you lose to Xiao Qiangzi?

96
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,039
Do you know what move he used to stab me?

97
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:41,632
Nine Heroes Stab.

98
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,652
When we were little, it was the one with the greatest lethality

99
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:48,419
from the Falling Petals Sword Technique that I practiced with His Majesty.

100
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:51,580
He deliberately taught this sword technique to Xiao Qiangzi,

101
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,290
and wanted to test whether or not I was Qin Yan.

102
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,840
Therefore, I had to lose.

103
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,980
His Majesty suspects you? What do we do now?

104
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,220
Just now, he confirmed that I have no other scars on my chest.

105
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,760
Hopefully, he won't suspect me any further.

106
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,839
It turns out it's not him.

107
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,800
Since it's not him,

108
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,560
why does he keep coming to my mind?

109
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,000
Your Majesty,

110
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,699
that is because you haven't been to see Her Majesty for a long time.

111
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,800
You know who I am speaking of.

112
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,390
Your Majesty,

113
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,170
he has been dead for 15 years.

114
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,060
<i>[The Orchid Fragrance Follows the Wind]
Duke Ding has committed fraud and deception.</i>

115
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,870
<i>Conspired rebellion and misled the country.</i>

116
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,060
<i>The whole family is to be executed. Thus decreed.</i>

117
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,520
Yes, it's been 15 years.

118
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,220
It was still I who personally affixed the imperial seal.

119
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,419
Your Majesty, the affairs of that year weren't really your fault.

120
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,319
You weren't in control of your destiny. About your Brother Yan…

121
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:36,919
Your Majesty, I spoke out of turn.

122
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,740
Your Majesty, forgive me.

123
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,220
Enough, rise.

124
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,259
It's also good that it's not him.

125
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,760
If he really appears before me,

126
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,220
I also don't know how to face him.

127
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,160
Let's go.

128
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,608
Yes.

129
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,980
A'Cheng, how's Boss?

130
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,859
Xiao Qiangzi, you really went too far this time.

131
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:41,944
What's wrong?

132
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:46,800
Has the medicine been applied?

133
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,559
I'm sorry, Commander Yan.

134
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:56,740
I admit, I wanted to win too much.

135
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,380
Because I want to stay in the Thousand Feather Guards.

136
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,000
But I really didn't intend to hurt you.

137
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,659
I thought your martial arts were so good,

138
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,320
that I would not be able to harm you.

139
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,539
<i>I'm sorry, I've used you once again.</i>

140
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,880
It's inevitable for martial artists to get some minor injuries.

141
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,220
Don't take it to heart.

142
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,459
Rest assured; I have thought it all through.

143
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:31,779
From today on, I'll take care of your life in every aspect.

144
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,240
Until you have recovered from your injuries.

145
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,380
Here, rest well.

146
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,380
Then, you rest well.

147
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,500
I'll be right outside, I'll appear whenever you need me.

148
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,559
Speaking of Yan Changyun,

149
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,199
he's the sort of person who feels at a loss if he doesn't take advantage.

150
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,120
What if Xiao Qiangzi doesn't agree to it?

151
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,839
I would get scolded by him once again.

152
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:10,520
Maybe we should just forget it.

153
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,699
Your Majesty is right.

154
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:14,300
It's really not worth getting scolded over Xiao Qiangzi.

155
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,156
Let's go back.

156
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,920
After all, I'm the head of the harem.

157
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,844
He is just a minor commander.

158
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:28,260
He must give me the person I want, whether he wants to or not.

159
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,800
Your Majesty, perhaps you should think it over.

160
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,580
That Yan Changyun is quite frightening.

161
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,412
Even Grand Empress Dowager dares not provoke him.

162
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,536
- If you force the issue…
- I don't care.

163
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:40,219
The earlier Xiao Qiangzi is by my side, the earlier I can keep His Majesty by my side.

164
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,024
So that, I can bear an imperial heir sooner.

165
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:44,679
- But…
- There are no buts.

166
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:48,880
Today, even if I have to break heads and bleed, I must get Xiao Qiangzi.

167
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:53,572
Boss, you haven't given me the new list of arrests.

168
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,380
Boss, what's been with you lately? Is it because of Xiao Qiangzi?

169
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,859
Did he leave you with some kind of psychological trauma?

170
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:16,320
I did say that this person should not stay.

171
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,960
Let's just go all in on this.

172
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,372
Greetings, Your Majesty.

173
00:14:21,372 --> 00:14:22,459
You may leave first.

174
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,048
Yes.

175
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:29,079
- Your humble servant pays respect to Her Majesty.
- Commander Yan, please, no need for formalities.

176
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,160
Have a seat.

177
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,184
Thank you, Your Majesty. Please, go ahead

178
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,780
Your Majesty, your coming here must be for an important matter.

179
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,559
I heard that Commander Yan has been injured.

180
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,700
So, I came especially to pay a visit.

181
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,460
And also, I have a small favor to ask incidentally.

182
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,860
You needn't be polite, Her Majesty. Please give your command.

183
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,499
Her Majesty's palace is short-staffed.

184
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:57,559
We've come to ask Commander Yan for someone to be dispatched for use.

185
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,159
Commander Yan, I know the business of the Thousand Feather Guards is busy.

186
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:05,480
But this matter for Commander Yan was specially arranged by His Majesty himself.

187
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:09,559
Your servant obeys the decree.

188
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:13,939
Commander, I'm begging you, I really don't want to go.

189
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,520
Let's go, Xiao Qiangzi.

190
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,120
Thank you, Commander Yan.

191
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,304
<i>[Civil and Military Strategies]</i>
You bad man, after all I've done for you.

192
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:28,460
<i>[Phoenix Rite Palace]</i>

193
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,072
Your Majesty.

194
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:41,480
I brought you here is actually because I need to ask you something.

195
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,939
Your Majesty, you flatter your servant too much.

196
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,979
Considering your noble birth, and your beauty,

197
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,540
not only does it bring nations to their knees,

198
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,100
but also, your knowledge of poetry, music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

199
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,740
You excel in all of them.

200
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,860
There's nothing from ancient to modern times, domestic or abroad, that you do not know.

201
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,819
You have read more books than the meals I've had.

202
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:00,679
If even you do not understand,

203
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,880
then there's no one in this world who would.

204
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,020
Indeed, my appearance is quite fine.

205
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,620
But my knowledge is not as formidable as you describe.

206
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,179
Be more honest, no flattering or fawning over your master.

207
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,379
Miss Xue Ru, listen to what you are saying.

208
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:22,140
Don't you think Her Majesty is beautiful?

209
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,592
I…

210
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,640
Tell me. What exactly is the method you used?

211
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,779
Your Majesty, this is all a misunderstanding.

212
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:34,620
I have no special talent.

213
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,520
It's all due to HIs Majesty's approachability.

214
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,120
How dare you talk back to Her Majesty.

215
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,940
Whatever you are told to do, you should just do it.

216
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,240
Before dawn tomorrow, write down every method you know without missing a single one,

217
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,110
and present it to me.

218
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,980
Your Majesty, I just arrived at the Phoenix Rite Palace and am not used to it.

219
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,480
Finish it in one night, is that too…?

220
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,919
The task is too heavy. Can we slow down a bit?

221
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,779
You do make some sense.

222
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:03,600
In that case, not too many, 100 will do.

223
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,000
Remember to include illustrations with the text.

224
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,556
Yes.

225
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:12,716
<i>[Phoenix Rite Palace]</i>

226
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:59,724
You scared me to death.

227
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:10,140
Your Majesty,

228
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,219
this is the secret manual I've worked on overnight for your review.

229
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:30,236
This is good, turning from guest to host.

230
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:32,300
Immediate results can be seen.

231
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,540
I will go to try it out with His Majesty right away.

232
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,120
Your Majesty, please don't act impulsively. What if it fails?

233
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,379
Who knows if this is a trap meant to make Your Majesty fall out of favor?

234
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,000
It's not like that, Your Majesty.

235
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,839
I really didn't think that way.

236
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,920
If Your Majesty does not believe,

237
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,720
then I will test it myself.

238
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,760
If it works, you can go then.

239
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,199
Your Majesty, look! His true colors are finally showing.

240
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:58,519
He just wants to take the opportunity to ingratiate himself with His Majesty.

241
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:04,440
No, really, I didn't, Your Majesty.

242
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,820
If you want to kill me, just say it.

243
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,399
Stop torturing me.

244
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:15,499
I have thought of a foolproof plan.

245
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,319
Go quickly. As long as it works with Yan Changyun,

246
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,340
I'll immediately go to His Majesty.

247
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,160
Hurry.

248
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,368
Gentle.

249
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:54,220
<i>Changyun, it's me, Xiao Qiangzi.</i>

250
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,960
Please open the door quickly.

251
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,839
<i>Changyun, it's me. Open the door.</i>

252
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,859
<i>Open the door, I'm here.</i>

253
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,400
Boss, please don't leave me in the Phoenix Rite Palace. I'm begging you.

254
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,400
Don't be upset, one failure doesn't mean anything.

255
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,119
This turning from guest to host won't work.

256
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,970
Let's just try another approach.

257
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,350
Come on.

258
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,820
I think this one is very good.

259
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,000
How about we try again?

260
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,120
Your Majesty, can we not switch to a method that's less painful?

261
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,840
Must we use a self-harming ruse to hurt others first?

262
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,340
Look on the bright side.

263
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,839
If you get hurt, Yan Changyun will feel sympathetic.

264
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,620
He'll immediately want you back in the Thousand Feather Guards.

265
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,880
And you won't have to suffer here anymore.

266
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,219
But what if he doesn't protect me?

267
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:22,916
Then it means this move is not effective, change to another one.

268
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:40,979
If you really can't bring yourself to do it,

269
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:43,580
then I'll have Xue Ru help you out.

270
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,200
Boss, I'm begging you!

271
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,519
Please transfer me back to the Thousand Feather Guards.

272
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,659
I can't stay with Her Majesty even for a single day.

273
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,580
Transfers between the palaces can't be changed on a whim.

274
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,260
Look how Her Majesty has been tormenting me.

275
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,659
I beg you, Commander, please save me.

276
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,500
If your arm is injured, then go to the imperial physician. I can't help you.

277
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,279
Today, it's on the arm.

278
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,340
Who knows, tomorrow it might be on the head.

279
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,580
Do you really not care about my wellbeing?

280
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,580
What does your wellbeing have to do with me?

281
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,400
From now on, you're no longer my boss!

282
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,980
How did it fail again?

283
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,400
Your Majesty, Xiao Qiangzi has personal motives.

284
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,780
He deliberately hides his trump card and doesn't tell you.

285
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,879
He wants to monopolize His Majesty's favor.

286
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:49,079
It's an injustice!

287
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,000
Why are you targeting me like this? Did I offend you?

288
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,030
It seems you really are incorrigible.

289
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,580
Guards, administer punishment.

290
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,720
Your Majesty, please spare me.

291
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,240
This is too cruel.

292
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,959
If you don't show your real skills, then I will not spare you.

293
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:30,979
Let go of him too early; he hasn't taken his last breath yet.

294
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:35,319
He doesn't like white flowers; he likes shiny silver.

295
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,350
Do you like having a son?

296
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,100
I have taken care of everything outside the palace for you.

297
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,440
I'll bring it back to you.

298
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,710
That works.

299
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,590
He can even see me off in the end.

300
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,200
What did I tell you?

301
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,780
I understand Xiao Qiangzi's thoughts the best.

302
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,540
Don't be so pessimistic. Give the boss some time to think of a solution,

303
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,440
and get you back in the Thousand Feather Guards.

304
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:58,259
Did Yan Changyun send you to see me?

305
00:23:58,259 --> 00:23:59,800
I knew he wouldn't ignore me.

306
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,500
No, it's not. It's because your screams made us feel

307
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,859
that we should come and check.

308
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,179
All of you go back. I'll fend for myself.

309
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:27,780
<i>I thought you would be unable to part with me.</i>

310
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,319
<i>It seems I was just being sentimental.</i>

311
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:42,630
<i>Stupid whistle, I don't care anymore.</i>

312
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,280

00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:11,940
She scared me to death.

327
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,900
Fortunately, it was just a nightmare.

328
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,000
It's already dawn.

329
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,260
What shoddy dye is this?

330
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,380
It all rubbed off in just one night.

<i>Xiao Qiangzi! Xiao Qiangzi, get up quickly.</i>

You must appear before Her Majesty within the time it takes to brew a cup of tea.

<i>Do you hear me? Hurry up, quit dawdling.</i>

334
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:55,879
<i>Are you asking to be punished again?</i>

335
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,960
Yan Changyun doesn't care about me, and Her Majesty tortures me every day.

336
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,720
If this continues, I'll be driven mad by the torture.

337
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,919
No, I have to go.

338
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:20,640
<i>No, it's not obvious enough.</i>

339
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,299
Xiao Qiangzi, you're here too.

340
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:35,140
Chang Sheng, I'm about to leave.

341
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,040
Do you have any farewell words you want to say to me?

342
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,328
Yes.

343
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:41,319
What?

344
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,760
I'm now the strongest of the Thousand Feather Guards.

345
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,500
But Boss just told me to read more,

346
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,020
and replenish my mind and become number one in intelligence.

347
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,480
That's good.

348
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,140
It's a shame I won't see you become the number one in intelligence.

349
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,240
You take care.

350
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,820
Strength number one plus intelligence number one, and plus, this face of mine.

351
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,939
Better study some more.

352
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,740
Xiao Qiangzi, what do you think?

353
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,839
So impolite.

354
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:18,584
<i>[Eternal Strength Gate]</i>

355
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,359
I've reached the final gate.

356
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,939
How come there's not a single acquaintance stopping me?

357
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,900
Are you going out?

358
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,080
I'll think about it.

359
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,459
What's there left to think about?

360
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:54,839
If you're going out, hurry up and don't get in the way.

361
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,676
Xiao Qiangzi.

362
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,460
It's Chang Sheng. Did Commander Yan send you?

363
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,720
Yes. How did you know?

364
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,540
What don't I know about?

365
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,640
Okay then, let's go back.

366
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,020
Where are you going?

367
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,120
What do you mean by "Where am I going"?

368
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,800
Didn't Commander Yan send you to find me?

369
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,040
What do you mean "come find you"?

370
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,100
Boss asked me to go and interrogate a prisoner.

371
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,540
I'm off, Xiao Qiangzi. See you.

372
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,139
Not a single person in the entire Imperial Palace cares about me.

373
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:37,960
None in the Thousand Feather Guards cares about me either.

374
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,820
Then why should I stay here?

375
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,219
I wanted to leave anyway.
