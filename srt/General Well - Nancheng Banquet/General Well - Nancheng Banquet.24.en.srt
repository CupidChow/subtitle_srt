My Lord, the imperial prison has caught fire.

22
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,219
Yan Changyun has perished in the fire; no remains were left.

23
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:49,660
It seems the time has come; we can make our move.

24
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,759
The imperial prison caught fire. No remains were left.

25
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,719
Such a trivial trick can still deceive me.

26
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,120
Furthermore, His Majesty has taken Fu Xiao as his Imperial Concubine.

27
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,280
Fu Xiao and Yan Changyun's love is stronger than gold.

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,619
If Yan Changyun is not dead,

29
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:10,239
then Fu Xiao would not marry His Majesty.

30
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,560
So, is it possible that Yan Changyun is really dead?

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,280
Besides, the young lady has been kept in Phoenix Rite Palace by Zhao Yuan.

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,840
I heard she has fallen quite ill recently.

33

And she doesn't have a single person to take care of her.

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,599
I'm afraid Heng'er has been implicated by me.

No, I can't wait any longer.

Yan Changyun is dead, and Fu Xiao will be conferred as concubine in a few days.

But now that the moment is here,

46
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:32,670
I don't know whether what I did was right or wrong.

47
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:36,560
I personally gave the order to kill my sister.

I don't care what outcome you wanted.

53

I've been lying in wait for this moment for many years.

Write a letter right now, and have the Ning Kingdom cavalry press on the borders.

176
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,800
I fear there's no longer a place for us here.

177
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,800
Master, to just leave like this?

178
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,100
Won't we see Senior Sister Fu Xiao anymore?

179
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,150
No.

180
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,500

182
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,800
Everything here was prepared for you by Her Majesty.

183
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,400
This is the orchid she planted herself.

184
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Together with sandalwood, it was ground into powder bit by bit,

185
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,900
and made it into an orchid fragrance.

186
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,800
Because she was afraid that you wouldn't sleep well.

187
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,100
<i>What urgent matter do you have?</i>

188
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,200
<i>Your Majesty, it is the orchid fragrance</i>

189
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,800
<i>that I made with dew from the early morning.</i>

190
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,800
<i>Try it and see if it's different from before.</i>

191
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,300
<i>What is the difference?</i>

192
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,484
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

193
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,759
<i>Your Majesty, do you see any difference in my makeup today?</i>

194
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,799
<i>No.</i>

195
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,779

This matter has already been settled.

202
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,200
But I found that among the officials there are many

203
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,680
who are insider agents for Xiao Quan.

204
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,759
The list is in my hands.

205
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,660

I have decided not to pursue this matter further.

209
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,200

211
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,660
I have already decreed to reduce taxation,

212
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,980

00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:13,699
There's no need to say more about Qin Yan.

221
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:16,400
We have already drafted the imperial edict.

From now on,

Both of you deserve the highest merit. What reward would you like to wish for?

245

Your Majesty, having the Qin Family's name cleared and pardoning those implicated from the Qin family,

246
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:27,400
is already the greatest reward to me.

What about you, Fu Xiao?

248

Your Majesty, I would like a courtyard, jewels, gold, and also…

I'm just joking, Your Majesty.

What are your plans for the future?

253
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,400
Will you enter the court as officials or become wealthy landlords?

254
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,920
I can grant you any of these.

255
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,384
There is one thing I would ask Your Majesty to permit.

256
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:11,580
Go ahead.

257
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,499
The Ning Kingdom's cavalry still threatens our Southern Kingdom.

Of course, I'll go to the frontier with him.

264
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,640
I never want to be parted from him in this life ever again.

265
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,580
Enough!

What? Can't I make a joke now?

269
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,660
However, I have a question that both of you must answer seriously.

270
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,319
When did you plan this self-sacrificing ruse?

271
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,979
Why didn't I know anything about it?

272
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,460
<i>It concerns the dignity of the royal family.</i>

273

<i>What do you mean, Your Majesty?</i>

275
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:21,540
<i>Qin Yan, you must die.</i>

276
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:37,219
<i>If Your Majesty truly wished to kill me, why come to find me?</i>

277
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:39,880
<i>What do you really mean?</i>

278
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,000
<i>Xiao Quan, conspiring with the Ning Kingdom, will soon rebel with an army.</i>

279
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,440
<i>He has now fled, fearing his crimes, like a tiger retreating into the mountains.</i>

280
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:55,100
<i>The matter of the rebellion hangs over my heart like a sharp sword.</i>

281
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:00,040
<i>So, as long as I die, Xiao Quan, without any worries, can rise in rebellion.</i>

282
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,480
<i>Then, at that time, you can capture them all at once.</i>

283
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,079
<i>That's right. You hold the command of millions of the Thousand Feather Guards.</i>

284

<i>Each one loyal and devoted.</i>

285
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,840
<i>If you are still alive, he would certainly not dare to make a rash move.</i>

286
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,160
<i>But if you died, it would be different.</i>

287
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,240
<i>Brother Yan, I need your cooperation to stage a ruse.</i>

288
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,080
<i>With a formidable enemy ahead,</i>

289
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,680
<i>I am prepared to die if necessary.</i>

290
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:49,219
Then, if it's all an act, why did you still marry me?

291
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:51,039
You are the one who suggested that I marry you.

292
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,060
I had to just go along with the plan.

293
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,420
But it's all thanks to you.

294
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,819
If it weren't for you, how could we have convinced Xiao Quan, that old fox?

295
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:00,740
Then it is indeed my contribution.

296
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,540
So, it seems that your acting skills have reached perfection.

297
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,720
- Deceivingly authentic, so real.
- Of course.

298
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,219
It's me you're talking about.

299
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:12,459
All right, it's getting late. We should set off now.

300
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:15,000
Fu Xiao, you go out and wait for me.

301
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,900
I have a few words to say to His Majesty.

302
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,080
Okay.

303
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,480
Your Majesty, then I shall take my leave.

304
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,012
No rush.

305
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,799
You may fool Fu Xiao, but you can't hide it from me.

306
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:37,120
You really took advantage of the situation when you married Fu Xiao.

307
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,290
I think you just seized the opportunity to benefit yourself.

308
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,219
Isn't it better to see through and not say anything?

309
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:47,220
She's already left with you.

310
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,800
Fine, let me remind you once more.

311
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,980
In this vast world, there's only one Fu Xiao.

312
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,119
She will always be my woman.

313
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,799
No one else can covet her.

314
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:59,584
Not even Your Majesty.

315
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,036
You have your Fu Xiao, and I'll have my empire.

316
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,580
Is that okay?

317
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,340
I'm telling you. Take good care of her.

318
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,979
And you must assist me well.

319
00:32:09,979 --> 00:32:12,119
I have no room for personal affection in my heart.

320
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:17,440
My heart is filled with the land and the people.

321
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,580
Your Majesty's words are to be treasured; I shall remember them well.

322
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,356
I'll take my leave.

323
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,979
Take care.

324
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:37,079

326
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:21,480
Suddenly leaving like this, I still feel reluctant.

327
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,119
Let the past take care of the past.

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,940
Now,

00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:38,350
