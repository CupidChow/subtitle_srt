21
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,619
Your Majesty, I've been waiting for you for a long time.

22
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:43,740
Your Majesty, it's getting late.

23
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,659
Let me help you undress and rest.

24
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,700
Wait!

25
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,280
Let me have a good look at you.

26
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:54,779
Is there something displeasing about me?

27
00:01:54,779 --> 00:02:00,200
No, I vaguely remember how you looked when we first met.

28
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,340
Four years have passed in a flash, and the affairs of the harem are complicated.

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,339
I have visited the harem infrequently, and have shown less concern for Your Majesty.

30
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:14,076
Your Majesty, you have finally understood my feelings for you.

31
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:15,899
Wait!

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,320
What is it now?

33
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,419
Your Majesty, everything has been prepared according to your instructions.

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,519
Your Majesty, what is this?

35
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:53,900
I want to paint a portrait of you to place in the Imperial Spring Palace.

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,460
So, I can see you whenever I think of you.

37
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:02,339
- Your Majesty.
- Wait!

38
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,520
<i>Her Majesty really can endure, can't she?</i>

39
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,999
<i>When can I sleep? I'm already tired.</i>

40
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:51,740
Your Majesty, it's been an hour. Is the painting done?

41
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,879
Almost.

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,319
<i>Even asleep, he looks so handsome.</i>

<i>[Phoenix Rite Palace]</i>

44
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:32,419
Why is there not even a bit of noise?

45
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,219
Your Majesty doesn't even have the freedom when having a child.

46
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,748
Don't make trouble!

47
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,620
Who are you?

48
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,820
Someone who helped you avoid the danger of the body examination.

49
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,680
I know that you have amnesia, and I also know that you're not Xiao Qiangzi.

50
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,680
If you want me to keep your secret, help me with something.

51
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:16,219
Okay.

52
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:20,496
Take it.

53
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,499
Put this into Your Majesty's food and make him eat it.

54
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:28,940
You want to poison Your Majesty?

55
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,179
I won't do it. I could be beheaded.

56
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:33,580
It won't kill anyone.

57
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,599
Moreover, this medicine is actually a good thing for Your Majesty.

58
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,739
I don't believe you. If it's so good, why don't you take it yourself?

59
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:42,900
I will never harm His Majesty.

60
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,024
Show me your wrist.

61
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,779
You're still in the early stages of poisoning.

62
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:55,280
However, once the poison spreads throughout your body,

63
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,860
within 100 days, this red line will surely pass through your earth line.

64
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,020
By then, you'll be dead.

65
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,380
- How do you know that?
- I was the one who administered the poison.

66
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,339
Cut the chatter and make sure His Majesty eats this.

67
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:15,280
Wait! If you're the one who poisoned me, then you must know who I am.

68
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,080
Then who am I, and where do I come from?

69
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,179
What am I supposed to do?

70
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:21,120
Also, why did you poison me?

71
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,960
Don't ask so many questions, just do what you should do.

72
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,840
She sounds very reasonable.

73
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,720
It doesn't seem fake, either.

74
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:35,920
Am I poisoned?

75
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,419
Why did you lie to me last time saying it was just excessive internal heat?

76
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:39,959
Eunuch Qiang, where did you hear that from?

77
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,879
Don't worry about where I heard it.

78
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,339
Just tell me the truth.

79
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,820
- If you don't tell me the truth, then I'll have His Majesty behead you tomorrow.

80
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,320
Okay. Okay. Okay.

81
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,099
Then, why didn't you tell me last time?

82
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:51,999
Commander Yan…

83
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,200
You said it was Yan Changyun who told you to keep it from me.

84
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,800
I never said that, you guessed it yourself.

85
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,040
Yan Changyun, that liar!

86
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,700
Look at this. What medicine is this?

87
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,979
Where did you get it?

88
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:19,860
Never mind where it's from, don't ask what you shouldn't.

89
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,560
This medicine causes mental languor and weakness all over the body.

90
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,800
It's mainly used to suppress desires.

91
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,580
In simple terms, it's a drug that causes extreme mental listlessness.

92
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,839
His Majesty has been so good to me. I can't harm him.

93
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,079
If you don't drug him, you'll die.

94
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,092
He can't blame you, either.

95
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:48,399
Really? Really.

96
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,980
Besides, after you have the antidote,

97
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,170
you can go tell him the truth and ask for his forgiveness.

98
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,232
Let me think about it.

99
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,720
I'm exhausted.

100
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,279
What's wrong, Brother Qiang?

101
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:11,339
It's nothing. How are you?

102
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:14,820
I was asked to scrub the toilet again and it took me the whole day.

103
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,540
Brother Qiang, can you find a chance to ask Your Majesty, and let me be a eunuch as well?

104
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,700
Okay, leave it to me.

105
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,736
Thanks, Brother Qiang.

106
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,360
Yidao, how are you feeling?

107
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:45,059
Tired and weak. I feel like the whole world has collapsed,

108
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,419
and there's no hope left in life.

109
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:55,860
I don't want to cry either, but I can't control it.

110
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:03,240
Brother Qiang, thank you for always being by my side,

111
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,919
and calling me Brother Dao.

112
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,559
No one in the palace has ever called me Brother Dao.

113
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:18,039
You're the best friend I've ever had in my life.

114
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:20,299
Okay.

115
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:25,260
Draining one's vitality and suppressing desires.

116
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,699
Someone in the palace doesn't want His Majesty to have heirs.

117
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:33,940
But if I do this, I would be letting His Majesty down.

118
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,840
No, what His Majesty won't have is a child,

119
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,620
but what I don't have is my life.

120
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,520
Then, next time.

121
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,580
Just a little bit less should be fine

122
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,360
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

123
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,879
I don't usually read,

124
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,960
and I don't even know what others are talking about.

125
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,840
Not even greeting me when you see me?

126
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,700
Commander Yan, I'm used to walking with my head down.

127
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,380
I'm sorry for not seeing you, Commander Yan.

128
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,580
You are magnanimous; I'll take my leave.

129
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:49,820
Whether or not to join the Thousand Feather Guards is up to you.

130
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,240
Don't let go, Commander Yan.

131
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,919
I really want to go but I can't.

132
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,080
Hold on! Hear me out, Commander Yan.

133
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,860
His Majesty can't be without me for even a second.

134
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,980
He even requires me to stand guard when he uses the toilet.

135
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,759
I really have the will but not the power.

136
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,240
Commander Yan! Commander Yan, listen to me.

137
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,940
I... I'll definitely go.

138
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,820
I'll apply to His Majesty again, and he'll surely agree, Commander Yan.

139
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,179
Fine! Don't even think about playing tricks with me.

140
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:20,779
I wouldn't dare, please let me go.

141
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,299
You're asking me to let you go?

142
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:28,520
All right then, I'll let go.

143
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:34,979
Yan Changyun, sooner or later I'll tear you to pieces.

144
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,464
<i>[Imperial Medical Bureau]</i>

145
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:54,679
Your Majesty, do you need anything?

146
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,020
I noticed that His Majesty hasn't been in high spirits lately.

147
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,819
His body seems to be very fatigued.

148
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:07,908
- So…
- Understood.

149
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:18,512
Your Majesty, this is the tonic pill specially prepared for His Majesty.

150
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:21,200
Fine goods for replenishing blood and revitalizing the spirit.

151
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,248
Blood replenishment and revitalization. Is there anything even more enriching?

152
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:31,240
You understand, right? His Majesty worries about state affairs every day. He…

153
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,799
There is ginseng, deer antler, and fleece flower root.

154
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,119
How long does His Majesty need to eat these before they take effect?

155
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:45,020
Your Majesty can boil soup to extract them.

156
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,140
Concentrated is the essence.

157
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,819
I believe if His Majesty drinks this bowl of complete tonic soup,

158
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:53,920
he'll certainly become lively and vigorous.

159
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,840
Your Majesty will definitely be able to conceive a imperial heir as well.

160
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,300
It's all for His Majesty.

161
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,660
I understand.

162
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:20,479
Have you thought about the matter that you promised me?

163
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:23,519
I've changed my mind. I don't want to join the Thousand Feather Guards anymore.

164
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,399
If you can, then deal with me. After all, His Majesty is here.

165
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:31,080
You think His Majesty can protect you, right?

166
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,260
Your Majesty, Xiao Qiangzi is here!

167
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,060
Xiao Qiangzi, why did you just get here?

168
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,579
Your Majesty, I originally planned to come over early in the morning,

169
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,579
but I met a mad dog on my way.

170
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:45,460
The mad dog chased after me and bit me.

171
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,260
It kept biting and biting until it chased me into the lake.

172
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,940
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

173
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,240
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

174
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,100
Your Majesty, shall we start then?

175
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,539
Okay, come on.

176
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:02,859
You should be thrown to your death.

177
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,720
Be careful, Your Majesty.

178
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,000
<i>Yan Changyun is teaching me a lesson.</i>

179
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,220
<i>It's not enough to bully me, he's also venting his anger on His Majesty.</i>

180
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,520
<i>Then you can't blame me for what happens next.</i>

181
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,099
<i>I'll let you take this medicine first.</i>

182
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:38,280
<i>Yan Changyun, today, I'll settle both new and old scores with you.</i>

183
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,479
<i>I'll add something special for you.</i>

184
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,310
I don't believe I can't beat you.

185
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,750
<i>You...</i>

186
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,279
<i>Just wait and see.</i>

187
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,919
Stop, you…

188
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Your Majesty, please take a seat.

189
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,759
Here, have some tea and take a break.

190
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,384
Thank you.

191
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,600
Commander Yan, you've worked hard too.

192
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,390
Have some tea.

193
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,680
What's wrong, Xiao Qiangzi?

194
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,440
Your Majesty,

195
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,220
I'm fine. I just need to use the bathroom.

196
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,579
Eunuch Qiang, don't go.

197
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:00,120
Your Majesty, why don't I teach Eunuch Qiang how to wrestle?

198
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,839
He could protect you in the future, if he learns well.

199
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,039
- Your Majesty.
- Sure.

200
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,780
Xiao Qiangzi, you should practice with Commander Yan.

201
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,759
Your Majesty.

202
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:27,200
- You're fine.
- How can I be fine?

203
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,659
I was almost beaten to death, and you didn't come to save me.

204
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,120
This...

205
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,550
This is all Yan Changyun's fault; he's really too much.

206
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,459
Don't cry! What happened here?

207
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,960
Where are you hurt? Let me see, let me have a look.

208
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,819
I don't know what's wrong with me.

209
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:55,579
I just feel exhausted and weak.

210
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:58,139
I don't have the strength to lift myself.

211
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:02,060
I feel hopeless about life;

212
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,830
I'm too sad.

213
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,039
You can't hurt yourself.

214
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,100
How dare you! Is the dragon bed a place for you to stay?

215
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,680
What are you shouting for? I allowed him to sit.

216
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,340
Your Majesty, he's a lowly person.

217
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,400
How could he be allowed on the dragon bed?

218
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,300
I'm lowly.

219
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,480
You're the lowly one.

220
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,400
He's my brother. Why can't he sit here?

221
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,650
Leave!

222
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:24,620
- Your Majesty.
- It's okay.

223
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,480
Her Majesty had someone send you a most nourishing tonic soup.

224
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,419
No need. Wait! Tonic medicine?

225
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:34,900
Her Majesty heard you've been weak recently and specially made it for you.

226
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,300
There're many precious medicinal ingredients inside.

227
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,220
It's a good prescription for nourishing Qi and enriching blood.

228
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,459
Bring it over.

229
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,940
Lowly…

230
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,699
Come here, Xiao Qiangzi.

231
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,839
Xiao Qiangzi, here.

232
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,040
Drink up the tonic. Drink it to replenish yourself.

233
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,500
Careful.

234
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,680
How is it? Does it taste good?

235
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,960
This soup wasn't made for me, was it?

236
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,320
Here.

237
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:14,419
Your Majesty.

238
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,319
How did it go? Did His Majesty drink it?

239
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,680
Eunuch Feng said that His Majesty drank it all up, not a drop left.

240
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,768
Quickly.

241
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:29,140
I'm so uncomfortable, Your Majesty. I'm so hot.

242
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,880
Why is your hand so hot?

243
00:18:33,219 --> 00:18:34,459
I feel so uncomfortable.

244
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:37,159
Are you about to fall ill? Why is your face so red?

245
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,000
Hurry up.

246
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,079
Let me see. What's with you, how come…?

247
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:44,888
You…

248
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,759
You two…

249
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,639
Your Majesty, if there is anything, you can directly come at me.

250
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:59,200
Your Majesty, it's not what you think.

251
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,308
Someone, throw him out.

252
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,510
<i>[Barracks]</i>

253
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,050
<i>[Civil and Military Strategies]</i>

254
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,159
So handsome.

255
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,699
Xiao Qiangzi.

256
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:34,119
Commander Yan.

257
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,799
On the way back to the palace today, I heard that His Majesty and Xiao Qiangzi were acting intimately.

258
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,960
And also, they were caught by Her Majesty.

259
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,360
Commander, is this Xiao Qiangzi?

260
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,100
If my grandmother, Grand Empress Dowager, knew about this, he would be doomed.

261
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,920
I give you both the time it takes an incense stick to burn,

262
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,020
and let everyone in the palace know that His Majesty and Xiao Qiangzi were acting intimately.

263
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:02,880
Commander, what are you…?

264
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,020
Grand Empress Dowager places great importance on the imperial family's face.

265
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,000
If she knew, then she'd forbid Xiao Qiangzi from getting close to His Majesty ever again.

266
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,440
By then, Xiao Qiangzi will have nowhere to go,

267
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,759
and he'll have no choice but to turn to Thousand Feather Guards.

268
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,328
- Understood!
- Understood!

269
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:27,770
<i>[Civil and Military Strategies]</i>

270
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,440
Stop there.

271
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,140
Commander Yan,

272
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,100
I'm sorry. I know I was wrong.

273
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,900
I apologize to you with the utmost sincerity.

274
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,200
I'm sorry.

275
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,759
So, an apology is enough?

276
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:26,680
What are you doing, Commander Yan?

277
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,000
Let me tell you, Your Majesty is my friend now.

278
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,259
Whatever you do to me, he'll not let you get away with it.

279
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:35,440
Moreover, he has more than enough power to protect me.

280
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,552
You may go.

281
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,039
Then I'll really be going.

282
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,339
Rumors are clearly unfounded and maliciously harmful.

283
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,220
Your Majesty, they said that we're on intimate terms and that you like me.

284
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,220
Isn't this purely nonsensical talk?

285
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,939
I haven't even complained yet,

286
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:19,519
why do you look so aggrieved? Is it necessary?

287
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:22,500
It's not about whether I feel aggrieved or not, Your Majesty.

288
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,379
It's you who should feel wronged.

289
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:26,720
You're the dignified ruler of a nation.

290
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,860
They spread such malicious rumors about you behind your back,

291
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,860
placing you in what position?

292
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,839
You may endure it, but I, as an attendant, can't.

293
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,559
Xiao Qiangzi, you're so kind.

294
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,459
You're right. We can't tolerate this.

295
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:40,424
That's right.

296
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:45,739
What they say is not entirely wrong.

297
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,360
I do admire you. Look at how many virtues you have.

298
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,980
Righteous, forthright, and of good character.

299
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,899
And we play together well.

300
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:56,560
I truly do admire you.

301
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,680
- Are you all right?
- I have something in my eye.

302
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,659
Here, let me have a look. A little blow and it'll be fine.

303
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,880
No need.

304
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,239
What are you two doing?

305
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,759
<i>[Imperial Spring Palace]</i>
Grand Empress Dowager, it's all a misunderstanding.

306
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,420
Your Majesty and I are innocent. There's nothing between us two.

307
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,939
Is that right, Your Majesty? We're innocent.

308
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:33,039
Recently, the rumor has spread throughout the palace.

309
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,739
Seeing it today proves it to be true.

310
00:23:35,739 --> 00:23:40,179
Someone take this eunuch, who has seduced His Majesty and has corrupted morals.

311
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:43,400
Take him out and beat him to death.

312
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,279
Your Majesty, save me.

313
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,360
Your Majesty! Grand Empress Dowager! It's unjust.

314
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,000
Stop!

315
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,160
Imperial Grandmother, things are not what you think.

316
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,540
Your Majesty, you're the sovereign of the nation.

317
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,740
Could it be for this eunuch,

318
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,619
you'll neglect the Zhao Family's realm and altars of soil and grain (country)?

319
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:04,459
Grand Empress Dowager, it's a misunderstanding. I really didn't.

320
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:05,720
You dare talk back?

321
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,959
Imperial Grandmother, Xiao Qiangzi does not know manners,

322
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:11,119
but he truly is innocent.

323
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,180
If you must punish someone, then punish me.

324
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,750
The way you protect him, even selflessness seems biased.

325
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,760
Today, considering Your Majesty's feelings,

326
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,060
I shall grant him some dignity. Someone come.

327
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,939
Grand Empress Dowager. Your Majesty.

328
00:24:27,939 --> 00:24:30,440
Imperial Grandmother, I'm begging you.

329
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,020
I'm begging you, please let him go, Imperial Grandmother.

330
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,079
I'm begging you, please let him go, Imperial Grandmother!

331
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,319
Kill him.

332
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,400
Xiao Qiangzi!

333
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,380
I know martial arts?

334
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,319
Commander Yan, drag this eunuch out and behead him.

335
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:41,499
Grand Empress Dowager, this man cannot be killed.

336
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,179
Why?

337
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:45,779
Although Xiao Qiangzi is a eunuch,

338
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:49,799
he's actually trained in the Thousand Feather Guards as a secret guard to protect Your Majesty.

339
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,420
Secret guard? Who can prove it?

340
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,039
Reporting back to the Grand Empress Dowager. This matter was a secret.

341
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,759
If it weren't absolutely necessary, I wouldn't wish to speak of it.

342
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,939
Only His Majesty is aware of this in the palace.

343
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:04,839
If Grand Empress Dowager doesn't believe it, you may ask His Majesty.

344
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,440
Your Majesty, is it true?

345
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:19,000
Xiao Qiangzi belongs to Commander Yan.

346
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,570
You tell it yourself.

347
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,400
Are you or are you not my man?

348
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,240
Yes, I am Commander Yan's man.

349
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,100
How could it be? He's nothing but a mere eunuch,

350
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,959
how could he possibly protect His Majesty?

351
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:43,620
Your Majesty, you just witnessed Xiao Qiangzi's skills.

352
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,400
He truly is an elite I personally trained.

353
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,000
In that case, Your Majesty, what do we do with him?

354
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:58,359
Since Xiao Qiangzi is Commander Yan's man,

355
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:03,640
why not let Commander Yan deal with him?

356
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,040
I obey the decree.

357
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,219
<i>I actually know martial arts, who am I?</i>

358
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:25,820
<i>Why can't I remember anything?</i>

359
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,660
<i>Why does Yan Changyun want to save me again?</i>

360

<i>[Composed and Unhurried]</i>

361
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:36,260
Commander, are you really taking him into the Thousand Feather Guards?

362
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,400
This man's background is unknown; he's unsafe.

363
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,960
I even recruited you, Wei Tianjiao, so why can't I recruit him?

364
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,719
I am loyal to the Thousand Feather Guards and you. That is loyalty and courage.

365
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:47,300
You can't wrongly accuse me.

366
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,880
Who am I after all?

367
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,020
So pitiful.

368
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,359
Pitiful? What's there to pity about him?

369
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,260
He unexpectedly contracted amnesia,

370
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,400
and then put through such an ordeal by you.

371
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,039
Even I, a normal man, can't stand it.

372
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:11,100
Let alone an incomplete man whose heart is already fragile.

373
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,559
So heartless.

374
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,280
- Your Majesty.
- Xiao Qiangzi.

375
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,552

378
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,400

380

382
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:27,880
<i>Let go of me.</i>

383

Let go of me.

384

Xiao Qiangzi.

386
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,119
Your Majesty, you just need to take some medicine and it'll be fine.

387
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,659
What if the medicine can't be administered?

388
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:46,639
Your Majesty, His Majesty is having a nightmare.

389
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:49,500
- Your Majesty.
- Heart ailments require remedies of the heart.

390
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,960
It would be best if Xiao Qiangzi were here. Perhaps he could soothe Your Majesty.

391
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,768
No way!

392
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,100
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Call him here.

393
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,840
- Call who?
- Xiao Qiangzi.

394
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,460
Okay.

395
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,200

Commander Yan, this… isn't proper, is it?

00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,620
I'm His Majesty's chamberlain.

402
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,960
It's getting late anyway, I'll be leaving.

403

If I tell the grand empress dowager that you're not my shadow guard,

404
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,000
do you think she'll kill you?

405
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,959
Commander Yan, I've already joined the Thousand Feather Guards.

406
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:56,319
So, there's no need to live together. Right?

407
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:58,939
I think it would be better

408
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:02,040
to keep some distance between us.

409
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,516
How come? Do you have secrets you don't want me to know about?

410
00:31:05,516 --> 00:31:06,972
Absolutely not.

411
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:11,380
The greatest virtue I possess is acting upright and sitting straight.

412
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,100
Besides, Commander Yan, you're the honorable Grand Commander of the Thousand Feather Guards.

413
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,800
It's so inappropriate to share a bed with me.

414
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,970
You're overthinking it...

415
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,060
I'll sleep on the bed.

416
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,784
What about me then?

417
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:37,459
You can sleep on the floor.

418
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,080
I am honored that Commander Yan is willing to sleep in the same room with me.

419
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,400
But I must say that I'm a bit of a jinx.

420
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,310
Today, Grand Empress Dowager was wanting to kill me.

421
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,200
Tomorrow, it'll be Her Majesty wanting to kill me.

422
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:01,380
So, Commander Yan, to avoid getting you involved, please let me go.

423
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,900
Since it's like that, you can't leave my sight even more.

You do the feeding.

<i>If I want to live in peace in the palace during this time,</i>

445
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,160
<i>then I must find another backer.</i>

<i>He saved me today, after all.</i>

00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,080
Thank you, Commander Yan.

451
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,600
From now on, I'll face any danger for you without hesitation.

452
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,760
Your performance will determine if you get more antidote.

453
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,940
What do you mean by "more antidote"?

454
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,319
The antidote isn't a one-time treatment, and I need to take it over a long period?

455
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:43,040
You don't have to take it if you don't want to.

456
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,020
I'll take it, each pill counts.

457
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,600

00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,000
Who?

459
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,400
He watched you dying and did nothing to save you.

460
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,400
You mean His Majesty? Why should I hate him?

461
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,990
You put your fate in the hands of others,

462
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,300
and they can't save you, so you have to hate them.

463
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,230
What kind of logic is that?

464
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,900
And besides,

465
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,200
I think His Majesty is already pitiful enough.

466
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,700
He has no friends, no freedom, not even a self to call his own.

467
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,919
It's bad enough being restrained in the imperial court,

468
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:30,560
even matters of the harem are arranged crystal clear.

469
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,380
He's had a tough time making it this far already.

470
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,680
You don't expect him to save you?

471
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,940
Of course, I hope for it. Better to live in hope than die in despair.

472
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:43,080
But I also don't hope to place my fate in someone else's hands.

473
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,300
That's right.

474
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,559

00:41:07,344 --> 00:41:11,228
♫ <i>If I could truly fall in love with you</i> ♫

516
00:41:11,228 --> 00:41:15,588
♫ <i>Why should I be afraid of the wind and snow disturbing my heart?</i> ♫

517
00:41:15,588 --> 00:41:22,852
♫ <i>Never giving up, never forgetting, never regretting is my heartfelt wish for you</i> ♫

518
00:41:22,852 --> 00:41:26,656
♫ <i>If I could fill pages with my affection for you</i> ♫

519
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:31,004
♫ <i>Why fear the world's high mountains and long rivers?</i> ♫

520
00:41:31,004 --> 00:41:35,836
♫ <i>One thought, one dream, a lifetime</i> ♫

521
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:42,288
♫ <i>I place you in my heart</i> ♫
