23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,100
Maybe I should go back now.

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,899
No, I've already said those harsh words.

25
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,539
If I go back now, I'll be beatened to death.

26
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,780
Senior Sister.

27
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,200
Who are you? I don't know you.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,660
Senior Sister, it's me, your junior brother, Qing Yun.

29
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,419
Qing Yun? I don't recognize you.

30
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,880
And by the way, I'm a guy, don't call me that randomly.

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,348
Senior Sister, wait a moment.

32
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:15,579
Senior Sister, I know you have amnesia.

33
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:19,419
This is complicated, let's take a step outside.

34
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,819
Wasn't it just taking a step?

35
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,480
There's no need to take such a big step outside, right?

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,399
The walls have ears, but there's nobody here; it's safe.

37
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:37,559
Whatever you have to say, hurry up.

38
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:39,820
Do you remember our master?

39
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,700
- No.
- What about Wanshi Pavilion?

40
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:47,699
- No.
- Our master founded Wanshi Pavilion.

41
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,419
He adopted orphans and taught them martial arts.

42
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,460
With this, he carried out chivalrous deeds and eliminated evil to bring peace to the good.

43
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:56,340
And you, Senior Sister, are one of us from Wanshi Pavilion. The female knight with the highest martial prowess, Fu Xiao.

44
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,644
- My name is Fu Xiao?
- Right.

45
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:02,780
The heroine with the highest martial arts skill in Wanshi Pavilion?

46
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,320
Exactly.

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,000
Come off it. I'm well aware of what I'm like.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,940
Stop the nonsense.

49
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,720
Didn't someone try to kill you a few days ago? And it was Yan Changyun who saved you.

50
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,579
So many people on the street witnessed it at the time.

51
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,000
It's not surprising that you know.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,840
Look, Senior Sister.

53
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,739
- How did that happen?
- Wanshi Pavilion was poisoned by someone.

54
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,400
That person is controlling us with medicine.

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,799
Taking the medicine on time each month can alleviate the onset of the poison.

56
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,939
But if we don't do his bidding, he'll no longer provide us with the antidote.

57
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:38,280
So, that being said,

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,460
we're all severely poisoned and don't have long to live now.

59
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,980
Senior Sister, don't worry. Master was afraid of the poison acting up in you.

60
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,300
So, he specifically sent me to bring you medicine.

61
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,280
To be safe, I'll go back to Wanshi Pavilion with you now.

62
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,699
We'll kill the villain and snatch the antidote.

63
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:59,939
- No, Senior Sister, you shouldn't return to Wanshi Pavilion yet.
- Why?

64
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,696
The person who wanted to kill you the other day is Eldest Senior Sister.

65
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:04,340
After she returned, she claimed you were feigning amnesia,

66
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,140
and forgetting the mission to kill Yan Changyun.

67
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,340
- And you were being all lovey-dovey with him.
- Me?

68
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,699
All your fellow disciples believe you betrayed Wanshi Pavilion.

69
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:13,760
They all hate you to the bone and want to kill you to purge the sect.

70
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,039
That means I now must kill Yan Changyun to prove my innocence.

71
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:19,360
Only then can I return.

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,120
Yes.

73
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,600
But I don't think he's utterly irredeemable either.

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,460
Senior Sister, that Yan Changyun is sly and full of tricks.

75
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,144
- You must not be deceived by him.
- Understood.

76
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:35,260
How about I stay to lend you a hand in killing Yan Changyun?

77
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,136
Do you think if the two of us stay here,

78
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:43,959
- it might be easier to expose ourselves?
- That's true.

79
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,732
Leave this matter to me; trust me.

80
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:47,939
I have now fully gained his trust.

81
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:50,519
Killing him will be as easy as flipping a hand.

82
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,200
All right then. Here's a package for you.

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,959
This contains unique hidden weapons of Wanshi Pavilion.

84
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,739
Senior Sister, be very careful. I will go back and report to Master first.

85
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,256
Go then.

86
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,000
This junior brother doesn't seem very smart.

87
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,040
Boss, let's bring Xiao Qiangzi back.

88
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,959
He seems to be having a tough time with Her Majesty.

91
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,792
Take it away.

<i>Oh no! Xiao Qiangzi can't leave yet.</i>

101
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:15,460
Xiao Qiangzi usually loves to talk nonsense and is never serious.

102
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,120
It's dangerous outside the palace, and his mind doesn't work well.

103
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,739
If he encounters bad people, the consequences are bad.

104
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:22,539
You're still worried about him?

105
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:25,140
Boss, you've always been so good to him, and yet he writes letters cursing you.

106
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,360
Then I will write a poem to retort.

107
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,700
Ungrateful Xiao Qiangzi. Gluttonous, lazy, and loves money.

108
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,419
Turns his back without emotion and stabs with a knife.

109
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,839
Why am I so unlucky?

110
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,040
Amnesia is one thing, and now poison too.

111
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,179
I don't even know if Qing Yun's words are true. Can it actually be trusted?

112
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:51,020
So, I really know martial arts and am a heroine?

113
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,160
Or perhaps the one with the highest martial skill in Wanshi Pavilion?

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,820
How about taking a look at some secret scripts of love?

117
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,660
Such harsh words have been said.

118
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,000
How embarrassing it would be to go back now.

119
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,859
Her Majesty is secondary.

120
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:56,199
The most important thing is how I explain to…

121
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,530
Commander Yan, what a coincidence.

122
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you also leaving the palace to handle affairs?

123
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,819
I've read the letter; it is quite eloquent. And you know the seven-character quatrain, too.

124
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,764
Thank you.

125
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,879
Didn't you say if you came back, you'd be a little dog?

126
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,700
Don't be angry, Commander Yan.

127
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,720
I'm also leaving the palace to handle some matters for Her Majesty.

128
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,700
Once it's done, I'll return.

129
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,180
Is that so? What matters are you handling?

130
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,460
Handling…

131
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,700
- It's, well…
- Xiao Qiangzi.

132
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,648
What are you doing here? Her Majesty is looking for you. Hurry up.

133
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,580
You see, I'm not making up lies.

134
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,080

Your Majesty.

138
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:25,160
Your Majesty, according to the palace regulations, leaving the palace without permission merits 30 slaps.

139
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,139
Stealing your tokenwarrants 50 strokes of the cane.

140
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,259
No, Your Majesty, I did not leave the palace of my own accord.

141
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,460
I went to pray for a marriage match for Your Majesty.

142
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,440
I even specially brought back a marital talisman for you.

143
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,560
You're quite inventive. Her Majesty has been married for four years.

144
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,140
She doesn't need you to pray for her marriage.

145
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,739
Look at me, I misspoke.

146
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:54,720
What I prayed for was the 'Marriage Treasure Manual'.

147
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,659
You! How dare you!

148
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,404
Don't rush.

If His Majesty doesn't come tonight,

150
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,080
I will punish you for stealing the token.

151
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

152
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,499
Your Majesty, I wish to continue serving you.

153
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:33,599
You can't just stand by and watch me die.

154
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,979
It's not that I won't save you; is Her Majesty just anyone?

155
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:40,059
Phoenix Rite Palace is a den of tigers and wolves. Aren't you asking for my life?

156
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:42,139
No, Your Majesty, rest assured.

157
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:45,759
Listen to me. You don't have to do anything. All you need to do is visit her tonight.

158
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,979
I guarantee there's a way for you to emerge unscathed.

159
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:52,379

00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,120
Your Majesty, it's getting late.

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
<i>[Phoenix Rite Palace]</i>

171
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,260
Your Majesty, I apologize. You're the emperor.

172
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,280
Only if you two get along harmoniously, can the realm be stable.

173
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,679
I am also considering the well-being of the Southern Kingdom.

174
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,820
Your Majesty, I was wrong. I apologize to you.

175
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,659
Come out quickly. You've been inside for two hours already.

176
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:28,159
You may leave, I'd like some quiet time.

177
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,180
I really didn't mean to deceive you.

178
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,899
I was just thinking of fostering your marital relationship.

179
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:39,100
Besides, you are the Emperor of the Southern Kingdom.

180
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,340
You should therefore produce heirs for the Southern Kingdom.

181
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,719
The future of the Southern Kingdom is in your hands.

182
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,640
Do I not know that myself.

183
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,599
Anyway, even if I were to have children,

184
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:52,639
I would never have kids with Her Majesty.

185
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,820
Then I don't understand. Why?

186
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,700
Look! Her Majesty is the daughter of Chancellor Xiao.

187
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,180
She has a good family background and is also beautiful.

188
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,220
Wouldn't she be the best candidate to give birth to a prince?

189
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,700
It is precisely because she is the daughter of Xiao Wanli.

190
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,460
Xiao Wanli has been controlling the court for so many years.

191
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,279
As the emperor, I don't have a shred of dignity and freedom.

192
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,859
If the prince were born of Her Majesty,

193
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:19,179
then Xiao Wanli would use this child to make the Xiao family increasingly powerful.

194
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:22,320
And the royal family would forever be overshadowed by Xiao Wanli.

195
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,600
Do you understand now?

196
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,250
I understand.

197
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,680
Your Majesty, in that case,

198
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,139
you have it quite tough.

199
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,660
But to be honest with you, don't be angry.

200
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,480
Somehow, I feel even sorrier for Her Majesty.

201
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,739
She hasn't done anything wrong.

202
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:45,459
Just because she was born into the Xiao family, she has been used by her father and sent into the palace.

203
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:49,799
And then in the palace, she was treated coldly by you just to oppose the Chancellor.

204
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,180
Her Majesty, seemingly high and mighty,

205
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,619
is not loved by her husband.

206
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:57,820
And she cannot even have children to become a mother.

207
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,779
She is not even as well off as ordinary women.

208
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,120
At least they can be with their husbands and raise children.

209
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,459
In this deep palace, she is just as isolated and without support.

210
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,319
- Your Majesty.
- Xiao Qiangzi, you are a good friend.

211
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,232
You are a good friend who considers others.

212
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,460
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Let's go.

213
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,976
Let's go.

214
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:25,024
<i>[Moon and Bloom]</i>

215
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,760
The matter of Her Majesty and His Majesty has been resolved.

216
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,459
Next is Yan Changyun.

217
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,500
No way!

218
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,910
I've been too naive.

219
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,699
I believed whatever he said.

220
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,759
What if it's not an antidote but poison instead?

221
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,019
<i>Master is afraid that the poison will take effect on you. So, he specifically sent me to bring you medicine.</i>

222
00:15:57,268 --> 00:15:59,528
<i>[Do Not Disturb]</i>

223
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,488
Commander Yan, are you looking for Eunuch Qiang?

224
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:09,919
What's going on?

225
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,879
Ever since Eunuch Qiang returned from His Majesty's, he has locked himself up.

226
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:17,000
It seems he hasn't come out to eat.

227
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,180
You may leave now.

228
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

229
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,060
Xiao Qiangzi.

230
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,640
Xiao Qiangzi.

231
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,820
<i>He's actually a woman.</i>

232
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,300
<i>Commander Yan.</i>

233
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,459
<i>It must be very painful with so many injuries.</i>

234
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:33,960
<i>It'll stop hurting when I blow on it.</i>

235
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,260
<i>This is for you, a soothing balm.</i>

236
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,499
<i>Guaranteed to make your hands delicate and smooth.</i>

237
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:47,820
<i>If I hear you saying a single bad word about Yan Changyun,</i>

238
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,960
<i>don't blame me for being impolite.</i>

239
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,780
<i>I don't want others to think that you're a cruel person.</i>

240
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,324

How is it?

261

It seems the poison has taken effect.

262
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,699
But the pulse is somewhat strange.

263
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:12,859
The pulse is strong and forceful.

264
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:17,720
There seem to be signs that the toxins in the body are being dissipated.

265
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,500
Did Commander Yan give him any medicine?

266
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,920
No.

267
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,540
That's strange.

268
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,939
The red line on the wrist has actually faded.

269
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:33,699
The poison inside has not been cleared,

270
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:37,559
but it seems to have been suppressed.

271
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,400
Can her poison be completely cured or not?

272
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,220
I don't know what poison Eunuch Qiang was afflicted with.

273
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,279
I'm truly powerless.

274
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,480
I don't want to hear the words 'powerless'.

275
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,124
- If you can't cure his poison, you needn't live either.
- Yes.

276
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:55,859
Go ahead.

277
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:57,899
Your humble servant takes his leave.

<i>I'm not dead yet, I'm still alive.</i>

280
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,200
The poison has been cured.

281
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,800
So, that means everything Qing Yun said is true.

282
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,300
My name is Fu Xiao, and I have a master.

283
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,400
<i>If that's the case,</i>

284
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,800
<i>I did indeed intend to kill Yan Changyun.</i>

285
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,000
<i>But now, surely there aren't others coming to kill him. Right?</i>

286
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,600
<i>Though he's a bit despicable and shameless,</i>

287
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,300
<i>but anyhow, he saved my life.</i>

288
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,600
<i>Should I go and warn him?</i>

289
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,800
Come in.

290
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,300

<i>[Embroidery House]</i>
how did he get here?

Embroidery House?

Let's wait for the boss to come.

294
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,600
This is the private property of Xiao Wanli's residence.

295
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,400
Trespassing will cause trouble for the boss.

296
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,600
Why wait?

297
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,800
We've followed Fang You for so long and just found so many clues.

298
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,060
We can't let go. What if he runs away?

299
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,400
Then let's scout ahead first.

300
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,800
Let's go.

301
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,600
Please wait, you two.

302
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,000
What is it?

303
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,700
Please look.

<i>[Men and clawed animals are not allowed inside]</i>

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,700
What should we do? Neither of us can get in?

307
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,800
Not just the two of us, the Thousand Feather Guards can't get in.

308
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,000
<i>Hello, everyone, I'm Xiao Qiangzi.</i>

309
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,800
<i>Why are you so short?</i>

310
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,800
<i>You look so effeminate, not at all like a man.</i>

311
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,500
I have a way; you stay here and keep watch.

312
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,300
I was just looking for you.

313
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,100
Looking for me? What's the matter?

314
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,600
I want you to go into the Embroidery House dressed as a woman.

315
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,000
No way! I'm a real man.

316
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,400
You don't want to return to Thousand Feather Guards?

317
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,600
I…

318
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,500
Think aboutthe Thousand Feather Guards' salary.

319
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,900
Think about the great prospects of the Thousand Feather Guards.

320
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,700
Think about the brothers of the Thousand Feather Guards who share weal and woe.

321
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,800
You would willingly stay by Her Majesty's side, suffering as a slave or maidservant?

322
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,400
Can I really return to the Thousand Feather Guards?

323
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,200
If you perform meritoriously this time, then I'll definitely speak well of you to the boss.

324
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,400
I guarantee you'll be able to return to the Thousand Feather Guards.

325
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,600
<i>If I return to the Thousand Feather Guards, then I can protect him by his side,</i>

326
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
<i>and prevent him from being harmed.</i>

327
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,200
<i>It can also be considered as repaying the life-saving grace he granted me.</i>

328
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,800
Good, it's a deal.

329
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,900
Let's go.

330
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,500
So anxious.

331
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,799
How about it? His disguise is convincing enough, isn't it?

332
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,200
Isn't this going a bit too far?

333
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,300
You even pierced your ears.

334
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,100
You flatter me.

335
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,200
<i>There's still a lot more over there.</i>

336
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,700
<i>This color is quite pretty.</i>

337
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,400
<i>Yes, it really is pretty.</i>

338
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,600
<i>Maybe take a look at something else?</i>

I'm just looking around. Please don't mind me, go ahead with your business.

All right.

343

Miss, this is top-quality material.

- The patterns are quite attractive.</i>

Master, I haven't said a word about our business.

346
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,000
Master, you must believe me; I swear.

347
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,600
Even if I said a word, I would be killed by a carriage as soon as I leave the house.

348
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,800
You have been with me for so many years.

349
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,400
I still trust you on this matter.

350
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,300
It's just that recently things are unsettled, and the court is investigating strictly.

351
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,100
I think you should find a place to hide first.

352
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,200
After the storm settles, I'll find an opportunity to get you out of the city.

353
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,500
Thank you, Master.

354
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,400
Master, after this turmoil subsides,

355
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,200
I will continue to serve you.

356
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,800
Thank you, Master.

357
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Come on, get up quickly.

358
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,860
You've been working hard recently.

Come.

360
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,200
I'll toast to you.

361
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,000
My Lord, a large group of Thousand Feather Guards has arrived outside.

362
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,630
Master!

363
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,400
Master, save me.

364
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,800
Save me, Master.

365
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,200
Take Fang You to hide in the secret room.

366
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,600
Yes, let's go.

367
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,800

This incident must be related to Xiao Wanli.

376
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,800
We can't just break in; we must come up with a plan.

377
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,700
A way that neither startles the snake nor fails to catch Fang You.

378
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,200
Boss, don't worry. I've already found a solution.

379
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
What solution?

380
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,800
Let Xiao Qiangzi wear women's clothes.

381
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,400
He has delicate skin; he will surely pass.

382

Nonsense!

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,300
- But…
- No buts. Think of another way.

384
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,700
But, Boss, Xiao Qiangzi has already gone in.

385
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,200
Who allowed you to take matters into your own hands?

386

Go into the embroidery shop to rescue him immediately.

Exactly! Xiao Qiangzi really looks like a woman when he dresses up.

If Commander Yan is carrying out official duties, I'll certainly cooperate.

00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,200
It's one thing for you guys to bully me,

444

but to bully Lord Xiao, such a good person, too.

445
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,100
What? Are you close to him?

446
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,400
Even standing up for him.

447

Yes, very close, we have a particularly good relationship.

448
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,300
He is handsome, comes from a good family, and is educated. And he has a better character than you.

449
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,500
I did have a better relationship with him than with you.

450
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,000
Your attitude is really like that of a spoiled wife protecting her husband.

451
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
- Who are you calling a spoiled wife?
- Who are you calling a spoiled wife?

00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,800
I have a temper, too, all right?

454
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,500
Xiao Qiangzi, don't be angry.

455
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,800
I'll treat you to a meal at the most expensive restaurant in the capital.

456
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,400
Then I'll think about it.

457
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,880
Boss, it hurts.

458
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,400
From now on, all of you must keep your distance from her.

459
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,000
No one is allowed to associate with her.

460
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,200
Let alone act in an intimately close manner.

461
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,000
Yan Changyun, you despise me, don't you?

462
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,800
You just wait!

463
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,200
Boss, it hurts.

464
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,800
Boss, isn't this going a bit too far?

465
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,900
Boss, what about Fang You's matter?

466
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,800
Are you sure you didn't see wrong? Fang You entered the embroidery shop.

467
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,200
Absolutely no mistake. We saw it with our own eyes.

468
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,800
Fang You had just stepped into the embroidery shop,

469
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,600
and soon after, Xiao Quan appeared there, too.

470
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,800
Boss, regarding the vermilion silver powder,

471
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,200
could it be the work of father and son together?

472
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,600
Impossible.

473
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,000
Xiao Quan has been at odds with his father for many years.

474
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,600
It's well known among court officials that they don't get along.

475
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,800
Moreover, Xiao Quan is known for his integrity and humility.

476
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,400
A man who does not indulge in the company of women nor covet wealth and power.

477
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,500
Upright and modest, perfect without a single flaw.

478
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,000
Is he truly one in ten thousand in excellence,

479
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
or is it merely a facade he has cultivated intentionally?

480
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,500
Continue to monitor the embroidery workshop. It's imperative to catch Fang You.

481
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

482
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,400
This is too much bullying.

483
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,600
Yan Changyun actually dares to mess with me.

484
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,100
He must hate me for stealing the Thousand Feather Guards' investigation rights.

485
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,600
Exactly, it's retaliation.

486
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,900
I spend all day in the embroidery workshop, how could I have any suspects?

487
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,300
He's just looking for an excuse to cause trouble.

488
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,500
Even the young master can't stop him.

489
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,000
I think he doesn't regard the Chancellor at all.

490
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,870
You say Quan was there too.

491
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,400
What is he doing in the embroidery workshop?

492
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,900
The young master is helping you look after the embroidery workshop business.

493
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,600
Since when did he start to take care of the embroidery workshop business?

494
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,000
He just comes over occasionally.

495
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Then, I'll be leaving.

496
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,500
My Lord, it has already been arranged.

497
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,400
It's just that the incident was sudden.

498
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,200
The loose goods that have already flooded the market,

499
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
I'm afraid it will be difficult to retrieve them all.

500
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,100
Moreover, many people are inhaling vermilion silver powder.

501
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,600
If we cut off the supply abruptly, it may cause chaos.

502
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,500
Not a problem.

503
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,400
It's just that since Fang You has been targeted by Yan Changyun,

504
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,100
this person can't stay.

505
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,600
Understood.

506
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,300
Master.

507
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,800
Father.

508
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,300
When did it start?

509
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,500
Father, I have only just come into contact with vermilion silver powder.

510
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,680
What are you thinking?

511
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,700
You dare to touch vermilion silver powder?

512
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,000
Do you want to doom the Xiao Family to death?

513
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
You worry too much.

514
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,200
I will not put the Xiao Family in danger.

515
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,100
Back then, Duke Ding and Qin Wenzhong were exterminated because of vermilion silver powder.

516
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,700
What do you count for?

517
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,900
Tell me! 15 years ago,

518
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,600
the Guanyou Incident that was triggered by vermilion silver powder,

519
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,900
was it related to you or not?

520
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,800
Father, how could the Guanyou Incident be related to me?

521
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,200
Fine. I will tentatively believe that you are telling the truth.

522
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,300
From now on, do not have any involvement with vermilion silver powder.

523
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,230
I will handle the matter.

524
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,800
You should not interfere anymore.

525
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:02,000
<i>[Civil and Military Strategies]</i>

526
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,200
Commander Yan, you have returned.

527
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,200
Why have you come?

528
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,300
Didn't you say you would never play with us again?

529
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,900
That was just something I said in the heat of the moment.

530
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,400
How could you take it to heart?

531
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,800
Moreover, after what happened today,

532
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,300
I went back and thought about it carefully.

533
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,200
To work for the Thousand Feather Guards, I must learn some skills

534
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,500
to be prepared for any emergency.

535
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,700
Rest assured, I will never come to you again about Thousand Feather Guards' affairs.

536
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,400
Rest assured, I will never come to you again about Thousand Feather Guards' affairs.

537
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,500
Then I can protect you.

538
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,140
You?

539
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,400
You better take care of yourself.

540
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
Commander Yan is right.

541
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Then I should learn some skills even more.

542
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,100
Just in case it comes in handy when facing danger.

543
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,600
Okay, what do you want to learn?

544
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,200
Start with some hand-to-hand combat skills, the close-quarter combat type.

545
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,000
First, take an attacking stance.

546
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,300
Controlling the enemy from behind can prevent him from using his martial arts.

547
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,700
Commander Yan, don't touch me.

548
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,000
- You… You.
- This is indecent.

549
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,800
- What are you doing?
- Please let me go.

550
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,400
- Shut up.
- Commander Yan.

551
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
That'll annoy you. Let you taste what it's like to be slandered.

552
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You…

553
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,200
Boss, something has happened to Chu Yue.

554
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,100
A'Cheng, who is Chu Yue?

555
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,000
Boss's woman.

556
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,400
Boss's woman?

557
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,800
