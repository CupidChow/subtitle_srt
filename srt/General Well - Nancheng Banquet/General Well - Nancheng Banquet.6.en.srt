<i>[Military Governor]</i>

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,499
Who allowed you to leave the palace without permission?

24
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,000
His Majesty. Do you have a problem?

25
00:01:56,864 --> 00:02:01,060
<i>[Strategic Command]</i>

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,800
All right. I left the palace today for you too.

27
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,399
This is for you, a soothing balm.

28
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:24,759
Guaranteed to make your hands delicate and smooth.

29
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,780
Today, I went shopping with His Majesty. I liked it at first glance.

30
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,780
- I bought it especially for you.
- I don't want it.

31
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,640
I know I was wrong, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:38,040
Oh right! I have something important to tell you.

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,280
I think the Thousand Feather Guards should help the people.

34
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:51,179
Although the Thousand Feather Guards have the responsibility of protecting the imperial city,

35
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:52,500
but we are perhaps too imposing,

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,000
causing many misunderstandings among the people.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,828
I believe that we should not just circle the palace,

38
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:02,099
we should also pay attention to the people and serve the people.

39
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,296
So today, our main task is

40
00:03:05,296 --> 00:03:07,860
to sweep the streets and pick up trash.

41
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,100
Visit the lonely elderly and take care of the old, the weak, and the disabled.

42
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,600
What? You want us, the Thousand Feather Guards, to sweep the streets?

43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,860
Are you joking?

44
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,320
<i>- Exactly.
- Isn't this nonsense?</i>

45
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,970
Boss, you're just going to watch Xiao Qiangzi acting foolish?

46
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,200
You're the one causing a scene.

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,040
<i>[Military Governor]</i>
How is this fooling around?

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,160
Xiao Qiangzi is now the Military Governor.

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,510
His word is an order.

50
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,080
All right! Chang Sheng, you take a few brothers and clean up the rubbish at the East Street intersection.

51
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,600
All right, let's get moving.

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,100
Boss, as the Commander of the Thousand Feather Guards, you represent the image of the Thousand Feather Guards.

53
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,750
You should be closer to the people. Doing what small things you can.

54
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,610
Only then will they trust us.

55
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
What do you want me to do?

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,640
Don't run, stop!

57
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,919
You boy, not studying properly is one thing, but now you've even stolen the teacher's pen.

58
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,700
I'll beat you to death.

59
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,500
Yan Changyun, since when do you interfere with a father disciplining his son?

60
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,900
He was impulsive, it was a misunderstanding.

61
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,200
Yan Changyun, stop it! It's a misunderstanding.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,560
Being close to the people and loving the people.

63
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,900
How is it? Are you all right?

64
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,400
- Why did you steal the teacher's pen?
- I saw that the teacher's pen was broken.

65
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,419
So, I wanted to take it home and fix it for him.

66
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,399
But they wouldn't listen to me, they insisted I stole it.

67
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,300
You are doing a good deed, you didn't steal.

68
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,200
However, from now on, you should tell your dad. All right?

69
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,924
Okay.

70
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,779
You don't even believe your own son.

71
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:10,279
If I ever see you hitting your son again, you'll be dealt with by military law.

72
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,400
Dad, this person is crazy. Let's go back quickly.

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,900
Let's go.

74
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,664
Yan Changyun, you were quite gentle with the child just now.

75
00:05:21,664 --> 00:05:23,239
I was not.

76
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,339
You clearly were.

77
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,260
<i>Nice.</i>

78
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,444

<i>[Chancellor's Residence]</i>

80
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,380
Is there any movement from Yan Changyun's side regarding the Fang You case?

81
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,500
Yan Changyun and the Thousand Feather Guards are being tormented by the new Military Governor.

82
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,000
Every day, they help those in need.

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,519
They're only busy with trivial matters and have no time to deal with these things.

84
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,900
It's that little eunuch sent by His Majesty?

85
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,700
Exactly.

86
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:20,540
Good! Seize this opportunity while they are causing a commotion.

87
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,600
Immediately find Fang You.

88
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Crack the vermilion silver powder case as soon as possible.

89
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,400
I want to show them,

90
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,100
that the Southern Kingdom can't do without me, Xiao Wanli.

91
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,480
Only the true self can bring peace and prosperity to the country.

92
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,024
- Go on.
- Yes.

93
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:39,350
<i>[Bright Moonlight]</i>

94
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,619
Father, I heard you were looking for me.

95
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,827
I heard from the servants that you were going out again?

96
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:55,100
Where are you going? To the Imperial Palace again?

97
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,610
With that time, you might as well take a trip to the Ministry of Justice.

98
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:02,439
You needn't trouble yourself with my affairs, Father.

99
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,100
You just keep holding on to power by yourself.

100
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,600
Why bother with me?

101
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,400
If you don't hold power in your hands, who will control the situation in the Southern Kingdom?

102
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,000
And who else would let you be the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice?

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,770
Not everyone is as power-hungry as you.

104
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,380
You…

105
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:23,616
You ungrateful son!

106
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,140
Has there been any message from Fu Xiao?

107
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,919
Not yet, Master.

108
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,460
But Yan Changyun is still alive and well.

109
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,280
I'm sure Fu Xiao's mission has failed.

110
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,600
Master,

111
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,600
such an important task shouldn't have been entrusted to her in the first place.

112
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,120
Fu Xiao has martial arts skills but acts impulsively and recklessly.

113
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,200
So, what do you want to do, kill her?

114
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,159
- It's not out of the question if necessary.
- Enough.

115
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,120
Fu Xiao has now disappeared.

116
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,659
You aren't worrying about her safety,

117
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:01,800
and you act so recklessly here of all places.

118
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm wrong.

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But, Master, waiting for her news isn't a solution.

120
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,160
Can I go and look for her?

121
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,180
Master, I'm also willing to kill Yan Changyun.

122
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,200
To complete the mission that junior sister Fu Xiao left unfinished.

123
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:38,619
It's you.

124
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,600
You actually poisoned us secretly.

125
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,800
You and I had an agreement first.

126
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,650
I'll help you kill Yan Changyun,

127
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,500
and we'll have no further entanglements.

128
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,720
I didn't expect you to be so despicable.

129
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,759
Originally, I was not a gentleman either.

130
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,559
Moreover, Yan Changyun is still not dead to this day.

131
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
Sir, how do you explain this?

132
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,179
However, the disciple you sent to kill Yan Changyun

133
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:21,140
turns out to be quite a surprise to me.

134
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,779
She actually disguised herself as a eunuch and sneaked into the palace.

135
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,979
It's just a pity that she lost her memory.

136
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,820
What? She lost her memory?

137
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,459
No need to worry, she's now mixed in with the Thousand Feather Guards.

138
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:57,880
For me, it's actually a good thing.

139
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,000
What have you done to her?

140
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,759
She, like you, has been poisoned by me.

141
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,760
But I won't let her die just yet.

142
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,600
And neither will you.

143
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
Why do this?

144
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,230
I'm now a cripple.

145
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,079
I have no use to you.

146
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,039
Master Bai, there's no need to be overly modest.

147
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:32,000
There are still many important things waiting for us to do.

148
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,020
Rest assured; I have the antidote.

149
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,760
It can ensure you and your disciples' lives are safe.

150
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,859
If you don't take it, you'll die violently within 100 days.

151
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:00,480
Whether you want it or not is up to you.

152
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,900
Commander Yan, you performed well today.

153
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,579
Already more than ten people have come to praise you to me.

154
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,719
And moreover, five girls have expressed

155
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:18,520
their willingness to have a beautiful marriage with you.

156
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,920
What are the next arrangements that need my cooperation?

157
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,079
Next, all you need to do is…

158
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,179
Kind, sir, please give me something to eat.

159
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,440
Thank you.

160
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,819
These people all have arms and legs.

161
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:47,819
Why not find a job instead of begging here?

162
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:52,439
They were all former members of the Qin Family implicated in the Guanyou Incident 15 years ago.

163
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,920
The court condemned them to lifelong begging and eternal servitude.

164
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,280
Some of their family members either accompany drinkers in the pleasure quarters,

165
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,779
or serve as slaves in the homes of the wealthy.

166
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,700
What is the Guanyou Incident?

167
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,620
A case of clear evidence of wrongful conviction, and the downfall of a hero.

168
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,599
They probably haven't eaten in a long time, have they?

169
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,340
Jiaojiao, go and get some food.

170
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,264
- Sir.
- Okay.

171
00:13:14,264 --> 00:13:16,020
Are you all right?

172
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,620
<i>He is usually so clean.</i>

173
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,000
<i>Yet, entered this dirty and foul-smelling alley</i>

174
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,420
<i>to support me. He actually went to such lengths.</i>

175
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,720
- What good can the Thousand Feather Guards possibly do?
<i>- Please, have a seat first.</i>

176
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,679
If you ask me, Yan Changyun

177
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,020
is just putting on an act, and pretending.

178
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,500
That's right. It's said that this person is cruel and ruthless.

179
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,140
Doesn't even recognize his close kin.

180
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,340
Such high-ranking individuals could actually sympathize with us?

181
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,420
It's very likely just an act.

182
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,260
That's right.

183
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,179
Do you two know Yan Changyun?

184
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:56,220
No.

185
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,500
Has he ever arrested you?

186
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,756
No.

187
00:13:58,756 --> 00:13:59,996
- No.
- Right?

188
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:03,120
Then does he have a grudge against your family?

189
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,199
- No.
- No.

190
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,559
You talk about him like this,

191
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,059
I thought he must have stolen money from your family or desecrated your family's ancestral grave.

192
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,419
- How can you speak like that?
- How can you speak like that?

193
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,500
Then, how should I speak?

194
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,839
The two of you don't even know him, yet you gossip so recklessly.

195
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,220
If I hear you saying a single bad word about Yan Changyun,

196
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,359
don't blame me for being impolite.

197
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,539
Don't run away. I'll take you both on by myself.

198
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,600
Didn't you say the other day,

199
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,459
that we should not fight back when hit and not retort when insulted?

200
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:45,840
But that depends on the situation.

201
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,020
Those two deserved to be beaten and scolded.

202
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,540
They don't know you, why speak of you like that?

203
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,160
You're clearly not that kind of person.

204
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,459
You are someone who values relationships and is kind-hearted.

205
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:58,239
Sincere and responsible.

206
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,840
I thought you disliked me very much.

207
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,060
Well, you're quite annoying when you bully others.

208
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,000
<i>What happened? He actually smiled at me.</i>

209
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,559
They are too pitiful. I'll go and find some clothes.

210
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,180
I'll come again tomorrow to change your dressing.

211
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,500
Thank you.

212
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,619
There we go.

213
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:41,110
Okay.

214
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,400
Chu Yue, why are you here?

215
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,299
The whole capital is talking about it.

216
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:52,459
Commander Yan leads the Thousand Feather Guards to deeply serve the people.

217
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:56,179
The people now turn to the Thousand Feather Guards when in trouble.

218
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:58,299
How is it going? You've been busy all day.

219
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,819
Tired? You're sweating all over.

220
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:02,360
I'm fine.

221
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,340
I brought you something to eat.

222
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:11,939
I'm not hungry yet, better give it to the others.

223
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,999
- Here, have something to eat.
- Do you need any help?

224
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:18,579
- No need.
- Thank you.

225
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,820
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Miss Chu Yue, why are you here?

226
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,140
Here, everyone, have some food.

227
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,819
Boss is out doing serious business.

228
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:25,759
This place isn't suitable for you.

229
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,600
I didn't intend to disturb you. I just wanted to come and see Brother Yan.

230
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,268
Here.

231
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,579
Miss, are you looking for me?

232
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,839
Fu Xiao, stop pretending to have amnesia here.

233
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,880
You disregard everyone's life and death,

234
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,619
and flirting with that dog official Yan Changyun right here. Colluding shamefully.

235
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,319
Clearly coveting wealth and status.

236
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,319
I… What Fu Xiao?

237
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,940
How do you know I've lost my memory?

238
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,060
Do you know me? How should I address you?

239
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,920
Stop acting with me here.

240
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,440
Whether you've really lost your memory or not, come back with me now.

241
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:31,419
Why should I? How do I know if you're a good person or a bad one?

242
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:33,939
You indeed are a traitor.

243
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:36,280
Today, I will clean house for our master.

244
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,360
Prepare to die.

245
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,160
What about your martial arts? Stop playing the fool here.

246
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,440
What martial arts? I really don't know any martial arts.

247
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,520
Do you still remember this plum blossom dagger given by our master?

248
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,280
Once cut, and you won't stop bleeding.

249
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,039
Fu Xiao, you indeed betrayed our master.

250
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,179
I won't let you go!

251
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,600
Are you all right?

252
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,780
She knows me, go after her quickly.

253
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,040
She's already too far away, I can't catch up.

254
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,480
You're injured.

255
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,499
She hit my leg with a stone.

256
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,968
Can you still walk?

257
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,720
Let's go.

258
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,860
Come on up.

259
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,119
You... Then I'm really getting on.

260
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,559
Wait a moment. Then we have an agreement.

261
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,580
If you're going to carry me, then you must carry me all the way back.

262
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,000
You can't just say I'm too heavy halfway and drop me.

263
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,036
Understood.

264
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:31,620
Who is the person that Brother Yan is carrying?

265
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,976
He's Xiao Qiangzi from our Thousand Feather Guards, a eunuch.

266
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:36,979
Eunuch.

267
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:39,850
He was body-checked, no mistake.

268
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,510
Let's go.

269
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:56,840
- Brother Qiang, you seem preoccupied.
- You scared me!

270
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,210
Why did you just arrive?

271
00:20:58,219 --> 00:20:59,820
As soon as I heard you wanted to see me,

272
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,920
I hurried over without stopping.

273
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,340
What happened? Are you being bullied in the Thousand Feather Guards?

274
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,900
How could that be? I'm doing very well in the Thousand Feather Guards.

275
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,699
Xiao Daozi, let me tell you.

276
00:21:09,699 --> 00:21:13,240
Commander Yan always takes special care of me.

277
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,739
Every time I'm in danger, he comes over to save me proactively.

278
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:18,580
I give him trouble, but he doesn't get angry.

279
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,340
I think, maybe you're overthinking it.

280
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,280
Now, Commander Yan has already saved me twice.

281
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,740
I can't owe him such a big favor.

282
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,519
- If you ask me, this matter…
- I've already thought it through, so you don't need to think anymore.

283
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,520
I have to properly show my gratitude.

284
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,600
- It's not that, Brother Qiang, but…
- I've already 'but-ed' enough, you don't need to "but" anymore.

285
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,140
Then what did you want to see me for?

286
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:48,759
Right! If you're useless,

287
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:52,139
then step back, Xiao Daozi, I don't need you anymore.

288
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,919
What are you thinking?

289
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:58,540
Yan Changyun.

290
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,620
Just by hearing the three words "Yan Changyun," you start grinning foolishly.

291
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,639
It seems to me that you have fallen for Yan Changyun.

292
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:12,280
No, what are you saying, Xiao Daozi?

293
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,219
How could I possibly like him?

294
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:17,119
I'm not a woman.

295
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:29,459
The fragrant and crispy shrimp skin cakes, one bite and the taste lingers.

296
00:22:29,459 --> 00:22:31,599
I'm truly domestic.

297
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,379
Yan Changyun,

298
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:36,939
I didn't make them for you just to use you.

299
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:42,340
I simply did it because I'm your loyal and good subordinate.

300
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,580
Xiao Qiangzi.

301
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,979
Greetings, Your Majesty.

302
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:53,100
Haven't seen you for a few days, and I've missed you, where have you been?

303
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,739
I'm out doing good deeds every day with the Thousand Feather Guards at dawn.

304
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:58,880
Building up an image for Your Majesty.

305
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,119
What is this? It smells quite good.

306
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,000
Really?

307
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,259
It's a kind of cake that I frequently eat, which was made by myself.

308
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,820
I was thinking of taking it to Commander Yan to try.

309
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,839
It's made for Yan Changyun?

310
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,860
How come you didn't think of making some for me?

311
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,020
I've always been so good to you.

312
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,360
You should be grateful.

313
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,950
I want to eat it first.

314
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,739
Your Majesty, I've made just enough for one person.

315
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:27,219
If you want some, I can ask the imperial kitchen to make more later.

316
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:30,419
No, I want the ones you made.

317
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,812
- It's delicious.
- Really?

318
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:37,340
- I'll take it all.
- Your Majesty.

319
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,319
I'm just eating your cake, you're really stingy.

320
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,480
Go on, eat it.

321
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:49,820
What's going on? My throat feels itchy.

322
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,199
What is this made of?

323
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:55,619
Just regular flour and small shrimp skins from the Western Sea tribute.

324
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:00,220
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

325
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,660
- Someone come! His Majesty has fainted!
- Your Majesty.

326
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,699
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty! Quick, someone come!

327
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:06,780
- Your Majesty!
- What happened to you?

328
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,599
Someone come!

329
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,844
Commander Yan, quickly!

330
00:24:11,844 --> 00:24:14,560
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty, what happened?

331
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,799
He ate the shrimp skin cake I made and ended up like this.

332
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:22,580
Your Majesty.

333
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,360
Eunuch Feng, quickly fetch some perilla leaves and crush them into juice.

334
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,180
Go quickly!

335
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:34,540
Normally each of you boasts your own skills and abilities,

336
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,140
but at the critical moment, you're all of no use.

337
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,279
If His Majesty doesn't wake up, you will all be put to death.

338
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,420
His Majesty has awakened!

339
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,259
His Majesty has awakened!

340
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:50,900
Your Majesty, how are you? Are you all right?

341
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,096
I'm fine.

342
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,620
Drag Xiao Qiangzi out and beat him to death with a stick.

343
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,800
Your Majesty, I haven't done anything.

344
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,768
You still dare to argue?

345
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:03,868
Calm down, Your Majesty. The urgent task is to understand the situation first.

346
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:05,620
What on earth is going on with His Majesty?

347
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,380
Xiao Qiangzi is right.

348
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,140
It was I who wanted to eat the cake; it has nothing to do with him.

349
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,540
Your Majesty, Xiao Qiangzi almost killed you.

350
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,139
And yet you are defending him.

351
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:20,300
Everyone leave. Xiao Qiangzi, stay.

352
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,060
Yes.

353
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,939
Then, I'll take my leave.

354
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,820
Your Majesty, how are you? Are you feeling any better?

355
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,700
You scared me to death.

356
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,690
Fortunately, Commander Yan appeared just in time,

357
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:47,459
and saved you with perilla leaf juice.

358
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:50,839
Otherwise, the consequences would have been bad.

359
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,279
<i>Your Majesty, the perilla leaf juice is here.</i>

360
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:05,860
<i>Brother Yan, thank you.</i>

361
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,620
<i>There are shrimp shells in this pastry.</i>

362
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,900
<i>The matter of my allergy to shrimp shells,</i>

363
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,280
<i>you must not tell anyone else.</i>

364
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,119
<i>This is our little secret between us.</i>

365
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,520
<i>Qin Yan, could it be you?</i>

366
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,379
- How is His Majesty?
- Commander Yan.

367
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:37,140
He's all right now, thanks to you being here.

368
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,179
Otherwise, I would have caused such big trouble.

369
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,639
Grand Empress Dowager would surely want me dead again.

370
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:43,836
But rest assured, I didn't take credit for your deed.

371
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:46,348
His Majesty knows it was you who saved him.

372
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,380
You were also shocked; go back and rest earlier.

373
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,459
I owe you a favor this time. I'll definitely repay it in the future.

374
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:06,680
Boss, you saved Your Majesty today.

375
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,340
Will he suspect your identity?

376
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,019
Sooner or later, that day will come.

377
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:17,040
After all, we were too familiar with each other in childhood.

378
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,340
<i>Brother Yan, come and try the new pastries from the imperial kitchen.</i>

379
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,839
<i>Brother Yan, which move are you teaching me today?</i>

380
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,040
<i>Today, I'll teach you the most powerful move of the Falling Petals Sword Technique.</i>

381
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,359
<i>Brother Yan, why do opera singers paint their faces with patterns?</i>

382
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,180
<i>With painted faces, they are no longer themselves.</i>

383
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,880
<i>They're just opera singers.</i>

384
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,440
<i>That way, they can hide their true selves.</i>

385
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,319
<i>Do you still cherish the brotherhood with His Majesty?</i>

386
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:01,820
The investigation of the vermilion silver powder has now reached a deadlock.

387
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,872
Someone must break the stalemate,

388
00:28:03,872 --> 00:28:07,084
which is His Majesty.

389
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,380
Xiao Qiangzi is really more trouble than help.

390
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,220
If you ask me, this person can't stay.

391
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,660
Otherwise, once he recovers his memory,

392
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,179
your situation will become even more dangerous.

393
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:18,959
Do you really think you're a homicidal maniac?

394
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,540
I have a way to deal with this matter.

395
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,800
How is Fang You doing?

396
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,900
He has already escaped from prison, and I've arranged for someone to track him.

397
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,760
Whether we can find the source of vermilion silver powder,

398
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,140
depends on Fang You.

399
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,459
<i>You know I am allergic to shrimp,</i>

400
00:28:55,459 --> 00:28:58,540
<i>and you knew to save me with perilla leaf juice.</i>

401
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,739
<i>You must be Qin Yan.</i>

402
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:03,890
<i>Your Majesty is wise!</i>

403
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,830
<i>Indeed, I am Qin Yan.</i>

404
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,460
<i>You've been hidden by my side all these years.</i>

405
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,259
<i>What exactly is your purpose?</i>

406
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:19,920
<i>You clearly know that the Qin Family has been wronged.</i>

407
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,060
<i>Why haven't you exonerated the Qin Family all these years?</i>

408
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,720
<i>The Qin Family has always been loyal to you.</i>

409
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,979
<i>But in the end, it resulted in a calamity befalling the entire family.</i>

410
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,620
<i>Brother Yan.</i>

411
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,920
<i>Do you know how much I hate you?</i>

412
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:52,440
Greetings, Your Majesty.

413
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:02,488
Your Majesty.

414
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,200
Yesterday, Commander Yan rendered great service in rescuing me.

415
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,900
Knowing to use perilla leaf juice to save me.

416
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,319
What reward do you want?

417
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:18,760
Your Majesty, please punish my crime.

418
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,860
What crime do you have?

419
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,500
Yesterday, I didn't know whether Your Majesty was poisoned or unwell.

420
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,880
It was only once on the street, that I encountered someone with the same symptoms

421
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,000
who was cured by the perilla leaf juice.

422
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,010
So, I took the risk to try it.

423
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,240
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

424
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,179
You saved me and deserve a great reward.

425
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:51,200
Thanks, Your Majesty.

426
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:08,260
Your Majesty.

427
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,070
Your Majesty, the imperial meal is ready.

428
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,079
Call Xiao Qiangzi over to accompany me for the meal.

429
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,300
Your Majesty, you called me over for a meal,

430
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,179
just to watch me eat?

431
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:38,680
That's just one reason.

432
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,840
You've not been by my side lately.

433
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,919
I've lost my appetite for meals.

434
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:45,570
More importantly, I'm afraid you're not eating well in the Thousand Feather Guards.

435
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,920
I want to nourish you.

436
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,760
Rest assured; Commander Yan treats us very well.

437
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Though the meals there are not as exquisite as Your Majesty's,

438
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,340
but they still taste good.

439
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,039
Previously, you insisted on staying by my side at any cost, and were unwilling to go to the Thousand Feather Guards.

440
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:03,319
How come you've been won over so quickly?

441
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,720
How could he have won me over?

442
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,919
It's just that I feel we had misconceptions about him previously.

443
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,179
He's really not like what people say.

444
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:15,759
Cold-hearted, lewd, and bloodthirsty.

445
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,280
Last time on the street, when we were treating a beggar,

446
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,500
he took action personally without any disdain.

447
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,999
- He's a good person.
- Is that so?

448
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:26,019
It seems that I don't know Commander Yan well enough.

449
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:29,319
Had I known, I shouldn't have let you trouble him and serve the people.

450
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:32,140
His punishment injuries have just healed; let's not aggravate them again.

451
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,300
Your Majesty, his wounds are almost healed.

452
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,472
- The scabs are starting to fall off.
- You saw them?

453
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:40,540
Yes, I personally applied the medicine on him.

454
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,179
What about the wound on his chest?

455
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,040
Chest? What wound on his chest?

456
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,659
Wasn't he beaten on the back?

457
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,680
Right, I remembered it wrong.

458
00:32:57,259 --> 00:33:01,219
Your Majesty, if there truly isn't anything else, then I'll be leaving.

459
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:03,000
Commander Yan has been having me practice swordsmanship lately.

460
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,879
- I must be diligent about it.
- Hold on.

461
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:08,800
Practice swordsmanship? Why?

462
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,240
He complains that my martial arts are poor and insists on testing me.

463
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,939
He says if I can't last ten moves against him,

464
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:17,059
then he'll have no more use for me.

465
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,620
Do you want me to help you?

466
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,820
Don't think I never wield weapons;

467
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,840
- I have a unique set of sword techniques specifically to counter his.
- Really?

468
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,280
For the sake of our brotherhood, do you want to give it a try?

469
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:38,396
Then let's go. Stop eating, Your Majesty, this way.

470
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:39,979
Careful.

471
00:33:39,979 --> 00:33:44,880
In my opinion, Her Majesty, you shouldn't hasten to see His Majesty today.

472
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,720
Being too forward might displease His Majesty.

473
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,140
I know, but I miss him.

474
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,359
You always say that, Your Majesty.

475
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:59,140
Maybe this time, I should be a bit more proactive.

476
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,400
Next time, I'll be more reserved.

477
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,440
Let's hurry.

478
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,396
Your Majesty, you're quite something.

479
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:11,320
- What sword technique is this?
- Don't ask so many questions.

480
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,280
It's Xiao Qiangzi again.

481
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,479
His Majesty has never taught me to practice swordsmanship like this.

482
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:18,780
Your Majesty, why don't we ask the emperor's brother-in-law for a solution?

483
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,380
- Just kill Xiao Qiangzi.
- No,

484
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,780
that's a human life after all.

485
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,560
Xiao Qiangzi may be at fault, but his crime doesn't warrant death.

486
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,180
Then let's think of a way to expel him from the palace.

487
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:33,680
Expelling one Xiao Qiangzi will only lead to a second Xiao Qiangzi.

488
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,059
This can't go on forever.

489
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:41,820
Your Majesty, it might be better to bring Xiao Qiangzi into our palace.

490
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,980
You can always keep an eye on him, and prevent him from flirting with His Majesty.

491
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,800
And when he's unbearable, you can give him a good scolding.

492
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,820
Good idea. How did I not think of that?

493
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,139
Since His Majesty pays so much attention to Xiao Qiangzi,

494
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,280
it means Xiao Qiangzi must have a way to win His Majesty's favor.

495
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,770
Bringing Xiao Qiangzi to our side, firstly, will make His Majesty visit my chamber often.

496
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,460
Bringing Xiao Qiangzi to our side, firstly, will make His Majesty visit my chamber often.

497
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,924
And secondly, I can still draw wisdom from Xiao Qiangzi to win His Majesty's favor.

498
00:35:06,924 --> 00:35:10,220
Your Majesty, that's not at all what I meant.

499
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,280
I understand, killing two birds with one stone.

500
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,800
This way, Xiao Qiangzi can be kept away from His Majesty.

501
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,359
And I can use him to attract His Majesty's attention.

502
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:21,059
As long as I get to see His Majesty,

503
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:25,950
then I'll have the chance to capture His Majesty's heart.
