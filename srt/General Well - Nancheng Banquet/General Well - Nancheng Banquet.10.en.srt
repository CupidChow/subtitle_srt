- Split up and take action.
- Yes.

32
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,839
Boss, Xiao Qiangzi said he'd take care of the list.

She's going to steal the list?

34

Did you tell her to do that?

35
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,700
Yes.

36
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,579
I'll settle accounts with you when I get back.

- A thief?
- Yes.

Father, what's the matter?

44
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,219
He says it seems a thief has entered the courtyard.

45
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:20,504
If there's a thief, why not hurry up and search?

46

Yes, sir! Let's go.

47

Father, have you destroyed the list of vermilion silver powder?

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,632

<i>I knew it, you were worried about me.</i>

My residence is strictly guarded, how could thieves get in?

65
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,580
Father, I believe there must be a traitor among us.

66
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,220
Why not gather everyone in the Xiao Residence and see who is missing.

67
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,460
Good! This is a good idea.

68
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,319

69
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,659
- Has anyone seen Xiao Qiangzi?
<i>- Search carefully.</i>

<i>Xiao Qiangzi! All members of the Xiao residence, assemble.</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

72
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,380

74
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,299

82

Where did you go?

83
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,440
I just had a stomachache and went to the bathroom.

84
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,179
Sister Xue Ru gave me directions.

85
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,472
Sneaking around, there must be something wrong.

86
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:19,540

He is not a bad person.

90
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,299
Father! Brother! Xiao Qiangzi would definitely not steal.

91
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:34,879
He is still useful to me.

92
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,160

Rest assured, I'm here.

Are the Thousand Feather Guards defying the order?

128
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,640
The Thousand Feather Guards act according to national law, apprehending the criminals.

129
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,959
Anyone who obstructs us will be executed without mercy.

130

Kill all of the Thousand Feather Guards who defy the order and conspire against it.

I'm afraid it's not just about eliminating vermilion silver powder.

Boss, we owe a lot to Xiao Qiangzi this time.

145

He got the list in time.

146

Why not call him back, then?

147
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,159

You weren't caught by them, were you?

159

That's right. If you were caught, how could you be here?

161
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,759
Very useful. You've made a great contribution to the Thousand Feather Guards this time.

162
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,700
However, don't do this again in the future.

I know. How did you get the Jade Bone Whistle?

165
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:48,240

Why does he always have a conflict with my family?

00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,779
His interrogation methods are even more ruthless.

177
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:36,020
Now, half the people on the list are in his hands.

178
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,059
I really don't know what they will end up saying.

179
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:44,120
Father worries too much; they can't do anything to us.

180
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,659
What do you know?

181
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,059
Since he dares to openly oppose us,

182
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:52,080
His Majesty must be backing him.

183
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,620
Zhao Yuan has toughened up his wings now.

184
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,120
He even dares to scheme against me, both openly and secretly.

185
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,599
He wants to play the pig to eat the tiger.

186
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,720
And he thinks I can't see through it.

187
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,919
This coward Zhao Yuan can't stir up any trouble.

188
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:11,179
One Zhao Yuan is not a concern.

189
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:14,500
But when you add a Yan Changyun, it's hard to say.

190
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,399
With his strategies and malice,

191
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,539
he'll sooner or later become a formidable foe to my Xiao Family.

192
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,779
No, I must write a memorial to denounce him immediately.

193
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,439
Yan Changyun must die.

194
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:31,859
I'm afraid that Zhao Yuan won't execute Yan Changyun so easily.

195
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:36,700
That's not up to him.

196
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,900
I had Heng'er marry him, just to make him be of use to me.

197
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,480
But unexpectedly, this Zhao Yuan thinks too highly of himself.

198
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,620
But it doesn't matter.

199
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,540
As long as Heng'er can get pregnant with a prince,

200
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,059
then the older one can be deposed if he doesn't obey

201
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:58,459
and the younger one can be promoted to the throne.

202
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,780
Heng'er!

203
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,490
Heng'er!

204
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,159
Could it be that father had me marry His Majesty just for this?

205
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:21,559
You want me to have a child just so you can dethrone His Majesty?

206
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,539
So what?

207
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:27,240
Don't think that marrying Zhao Yuan means you bear the Zhao surname.

208
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,319
Don't forget, you're a Xiao.

209
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,520
If you don't obey, you'll be abandoned by the Xiao Family all the same.

210
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,760
Heng'er!

211
00:15:45,308 --> 00:15:48,920
Heng'er, listen to me.

212
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,640
You are not anyone's castaway; you're my sister.

213
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,439
And even more so, you are of the Xiao Family.

214
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:57,100
Father just spoke in anger for a moment.

215
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,159
Don't take it to heart.

216
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,920
Brother, are you going to be like Father?

217
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,779
Desiring the power from His Majesty's hands.

218
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:08,579
How could I? What I want is not any of this.

219
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,459
I feel so confused right now.

220
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,539
Suddenly, this place feels so unfamiliar.

221
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,179
I don't want to stay here anymore.

222
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:23,860
The Imperial Palace is my home now.

223
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,588
Heng'er...

224
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,128
My Lord.

225
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,812
What's the matter?

226
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,000
Right now, the master wants to fight with Yan Changyun.

227
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,839
Yan Changyun's gaze will surely shift to the Chancellor's residence.

228
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,779
This may not be to our advantage.

229
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,679
Actually, the people Yan Changyun captured are of no use.

230
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,480
Why don't you tell the master that the list is fake?

231
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,999
Letting my father make a fuss like this might not be a bad thing.

232
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:01,480
Only in this way can we truly deceive Yan Changyun.

233
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,280
When the fake passes for real, the real also becomes fake.

234
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,680
As long as we play this act more realistically,

235
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,000
our people will be safer.

236
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,879
How should we deal with the matter of the vermilion silver powder?

237
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:16,419
Of course, we can't stop.

238
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:21,539
Vermilion silver powder can trouble the Southern Kingdom and help me raise an army.

239
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,740
Why not do it, then?

240
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,820
I've been planning this for so many years.

241
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,200
How could I possibly allow it to be destroyed overnight?

242
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,699
This is just the beginning.

243
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,480
Understood.

244
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,599
Where is he? Gone?

245
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,300
Boss, how is it going?

246
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,019
<i>[Affidavit]</i>
These people have nothing to do with the powder.

247
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:38,639
But they all have some grievances with the Xiao Family.

248
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,739
The list is fake.

249
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:47,699
Fake? Then why did the Ministry of Justice kill them?

250
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:51,140
Xiao Wanli is using vermilion silver powder to eliminate his adversaries.

251
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,880
He also wanted to use vermilion silver powder to harm the loyal and good 15 years ago.

252
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,920
So many people died unjustly overnight.

253
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,380
With so many new and old grudges, his crimes are unforgivable.

254
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,800
Your Majesty, the memorial by the Chancellor requires your immediate attention.

255
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,160
They won't even let me rest during my period of rest.

256
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Your Majesty, Her Majesty has returned to the palace.

257
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,700
What? She's come back after just one day?

258
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
I don't know.

259
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,600
Her Majesty has returned to the palace, and locked herself alone in the room.

260
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,900
She looks as if she's not sick or troubled.

261
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,799
This is not like her. What happened?

262
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
<i>[Petition for Your Majesty to Eliminate the Treacherous Yan Changyun]</i>

263
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,500
Xiao Wanli wants me to kill Yan Changyun.

264
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,800
Good. It seems that Yan Changyun has caused Xiao Wanli quite a bit of trouble.

265
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,100
He was even forced to personally submit a petition asking me to execute someone.

266
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

267
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,800
My beloved minister, come and tell me.

268
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,500
What happened last night?

269
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Last night, Xiao Wanli, along with the Ministry of Justice,

270
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,700
killed many people under the pretense of investigating the vermilion silver powder.

271
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,000
I have snatched a few witnesses from the Ministry of Justice.

272
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
After investigation, it was found that these witnesses

273
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,400
had no connection with the vermilion silver powder.

274
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,800
I suspect Xiao Wanli intends to eliminate his opponents.

275
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,600
This Xiao Wanli.

276
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,900
Blatantly breaking the law; he's too arrogant.

277
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,359
I beseech Your Majesty to decree a thorough investigation into Xiao Wanli.

278
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,200
<i>[Emulating the Worthy]</i>

279
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,400
This is the petition he just submitted.

280
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,800
He accuses you and your people of not obeying orders, and wants me to have you executed.

281
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
If Your Majesty thinks that I have done wrong,

282
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,500
then you can do whatever you want with me.

283
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,600
What are you talking about?

284
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,200
Xiao Wanli manipulates the government and forms factions for personal gain.

285
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,700
Without you, I would truly become a lonely ruler,

286
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,200
and become his puppet.

287
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
If I agree to your thorough investigation of Xiao Wanli,

288
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,500
do you have full confidence in bringing him down?

289
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,900
I do not.

290
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Indeed, most of the court are now his supporters.

291
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,600
If there is not full confidence,

292
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm afraid this man cannot be touched.

293
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,600
But if you can find evidence,

294
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,300
then perhaps we can turn the situation around.

295
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:53,700
I will certainly try my best, I will die for you.

296
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,000
Good, I will permit you to investigate him.

297
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,100
But this matter must not be rushed.

298
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,200
Thus, you will personally visit the Chancellor's residence tomorrow.

299
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,400
Ask him to cooperate with the investigation of the murder case at the Ministry of Justice.

300
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,000
Then severely punish the ministry personnel involved in the case.

301
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,900
I obey the decree.

302
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,100
Your Majesty, I believe in Commander Yan.

303
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,200
He certainly has the ability to overthrow Chancellor Xiao.

304
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,800
Of course, I believe in him.

305
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:29,119
It's just that I can't wait any longer.

306
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,800
The food of the Thousand Feather Guards is still the best, no?

307
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,000
You think this food is good?

308
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,900
Try it. Is it good?

309
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,200
Quite good.

310
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,500
Really?

311
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,100
Does the Thousand Feather Guards have no bowls left?

312
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,300
What's with him?

313
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,000
Commander Yan, don't be angry.

314
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's really not bad, you try it.

315
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,100
I won't drink it.

316
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,200
Boss, the porridge today is really good.

317
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
You should try it quickly.

318
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
You are responsible for serving food to everyone.

319
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,600
There are not even enough bowls for our brothers.

320
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,100
You have neglected your duties and still speak so artfully.

321
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Go out; run 30 li as a punishment.

322
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,839
Get out of here quickly.

323
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,800
Yes.

324
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,400
Come on.

325
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,400
Commander Yan, I have something to ask you.

326
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,600
Speak your mind.

327
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,600
Were you scolded by His Majesty today?

328
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,700
He definitely got scolded.

329
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,200
His Majesty sings really well.

330
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,700
He is good at everything he does.

331
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,000
Why is His Majesty in disguise today?

332
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,400
And isn't he usually in the Miaoyin Pavilion?

333
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Perhaps it's for me.

334
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,400
From His Majesty voice to his demeanor,

335
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,700
it's really quite like a woman.

336
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,600
Your Majesty,

337
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,400
do you think a man can possess feminine charm?

338
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,920
Perhaps.

339
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,839
Then do you think I have it?

340
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,600
<i>It's over.</i>

341
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,100
<i>I've been pretending to be a man for so long, I've lost all feminine charm.</i>

342
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,300
<i>I won't always be like this, will I?</i>

343
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,000
Where are you going so late?

344
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,700
I am going to the palace to bring Heng'er the toys from her childhood,

345
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,800
and cheer her up.

346
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,600
As the only son of the Xiao Family,

347
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
you don't consider the grand plans of our Xiao Family.

348
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,800
Running to the palace all day, what kind of example is that?

349
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,000
Father, for the power of the Xiao Family,

350
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,800
you've forced me to learn so-called power from a young age.

351
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,500
When I didn't want to learn, you found ways to torture me.

352
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,400
When you beat me until I was bruised and battered,

353
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,800
it was Heng'er who applied medicine to my wounds.

354
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,700
When you locked me in the woodshed and left me hungry,

355
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,300
it was also Heng'er who stayed by the door and fed me.

356
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,400
It was then that I swore to myself,

357
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,600
I would protect Heng'er for a lifetime,

358
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,000
and never let her suffer the slightest grievance.

359
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,610
Are you foolish?

360
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,100
Is Heng'er or the Xiao Family more important?

361
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,200
Let me ask you, Father.

362
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,400
Heng'er is my sister and also a member of our Xiao Family.

363
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,900
If I can't even protect my own family members,

364
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,700
what's the point in pursuing power and status?

365
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,300
She is not even born of your mother.

366
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,000
I know.

367
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,799
You know?

368
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:03,599
I saw with my own eyes when I was young, after you were drunk,

369
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,300
you forced yourself on a girl who came to deliver flowers to the mansion.

370
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
You…

371
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,300
Afterward, she became pregnant.

372
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,200
To cover up the scandal, you imprisoned her in the mansion.

373
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,100
After the birth of Heng'er, you then plotted to kill her.

374
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:21,200
And then you put Heng'er under my mother's name.

375
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,700
I'm right, aren't I?

376
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
But what you don't know

377
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,200
is that she was already pregnant before she entered the mansion.

378
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,600
Heng'er is not your child at all.

379
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,700
She has nothing to do with the Xiao Family.

380
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,800
What did you say?

381
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:43,100
Let me tell you! Now I'm the only support Heng'er has.

382
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,000
As long as my plan unfolds step by step,

383
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,400
that dog emperor, Zhao Yuan, will have to abdicate in my favor.

384
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,500
And for Heng'er, only I can give her happiness and freedom.

385
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,800
You beast.

386
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,000
You actually defy your father for a wild child.

387
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,200
Don't you dare give it to her.

388
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,800
<i>[Chancellor's Residence]</i>

389
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,600
Commander Yan, please wait a moment. I'll report your arrival first.

390
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,500
No rush.

391
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,400
Commander Yan, what a rare guest.

392
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,000
Lord Xiao,

393
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,200
I'm here to probe a murder and injustice within the Ministry of Justice.

394
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,800
I need the Chancellor's cooperation.

395
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:05,480
Since it is Your Majesty's decree…

396
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,850
<i>[Chancellor's Residence]</i>

397
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:21,920
Father, Commander Yan is here.

398
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:26,676
Father.

399
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,540
Father!

400
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,079
- Master.
- Dad.

401
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:46,084
Dad, what's wrong?

402
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:47,399
- Dad!
- Lord Xiao.

403
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,920
- Dad!
- Lock down the scene immediately and help Lord Xiao away.

404
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,640
- Yes.
- Speak to me, Dad!

405
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,200
Lord Xiao.

406
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,339
- Dad!
- Lock down the scene.
- Yes.

407
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:57,267
- Yes.
- Who harmed you, Dad?

408
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:59,320
<i>[Guanyou]</i>

409
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,819
Dad!

410
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:06,599
Great winds arise and clouds soar.

411
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:11,160
With strength to pull mountains and a spirit that covers the world.

412
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,119
Xiao Qiangzi. Xiao Qiangzi.

413
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,459
Take a look at how well I play the role of the overlord.

414
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,179
Your Majesty, don't you always play Yuji?

415
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,440
Why are you playing the overlord today?

416
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,119
Starting from today, I will learn how to play the overlord well.

417
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:38,240
I have many roles to play in the future.

418
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,799
Something happened.

419
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,550
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

420
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:47,000
Your Majesty, Chancellor Xiao is dead.

421
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,096
What?

422
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,480
Half of the Southern Kingdom has collapsed.

423
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,100
Chancellor, you have left us,

424
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:06,659
then what about the court?

425
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,100
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

426
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,310
The dead cannot be brought back to life.

427
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:14,300
The Chancellor knows how much you value him,

428
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,180
then he must be grateful on the journey to the underworld.

429
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,860
He would also thank Heaven's grace, Your Majesty.

430
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,720
You must take care of your body, Your Majesty.

431
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,530
Who could be so cruel...

432
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,240
to murder the Chancellor?

433
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,079
Commander Yan, you must find out the murderer.

434
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,960
We must seek justice for the Chancellor.

435
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,068
I accept the decree.

436
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:47,400
Your Majesty, my father was killed in his own residence.

437
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,340
I would like to personally investigate this matter.

438
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,980
Lord Xiao, I'm sorry for your loss.

439
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,259
Since Your Majesty has already handed over this case to the Thousand Feather Guards for investigation,

440
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:56,960
then please stand back.

441
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,816
Yan will certainly uncover the truth.

442
00:32:58,816 --> 00:33:02,199
I'll give everyone an explanation, and give Lord Xiao an explanation.

443
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:06,396
Your Majesty, my father was killed while investigating the vermilion silver powder case.

444
00:33:06,396 --> 00:33:10,799
The words "Guanyou" have been found next to my father's body.

445
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,240
This must be related to Duke Ding's old case.

446
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,740
I believe it is definitely the old enemies of the Qin Family seeking revenge.

447
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,856
- Lord Xiao, what evidence do you have?
- The two characters "Guanyou" are the evidence.

448
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:24,759
Merely on the basis of the words "Guanyou," it is concluded that it was done by the old members of the Qin Family?

449
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:28,660
As the Ministry of Justice, Lord Xiao, aren't you being a bit hasty in concluding the case?

450
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,010
Commander Yan, what's your intention with these remarks?

451
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,559
Yan is simply speaking about the matter at hand.

452
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,379
Lord Xiao is so nervous like a man who fears the bow is a snake.

453
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,279
Could it be that you have a guilty conscience?

454
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:40,179
You defend the Qin Family so vehemently, perhaps you're the one guilty?

455
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:44,519
My beloved ministers, please stop the argument.

456
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,920
No matter if it was the work of the Qin Family or not,

457
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,200
the murderer must be thoroughly investigated.

458
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,899
A country's chancellor has been murdered just like that.

459
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,840
The killer is utterly lawless.

460
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,380
Where is the dignity of the Southern Kingdom?

461
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,379
Where is my dignity?

462
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,619
Such a major issue of defending the dignity of the Southern Kingdom,

463
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:14,260
is the responsibility of every citizen of the Southern Kingdom.

464
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,239
Not only the two of you can investigate,

465
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:21,039
all civil and military officials, state government offices,

466
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,039
anyone with clues can investigate.

467
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:26,270
No matter who it is,

468
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:30,230
as long as the murderer is caught, I'll reward heavily.

469
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,980
<i>It must be related to Guanyou's old subordinates.</i>

470
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,780
I can't figure it out.

471
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,379
Young Master, we've gone through untold hardships to find that Xiao Wanli is the man behind the vermilion silver powder.

472
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:46,159
How did he suddenly die and also write down the words "Guanyou"?

473
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,459
Who on earth did this?

474
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:52,679
It couldn't be Uncle Lei and the others acting on their own, could it?

475
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,680
Xiao Wanli held sway over both court and country.

476
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,039
Killing him would be an action that would affect everything.

477
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,239
Uncle Lei would never act recklessly.

478
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,244
Young Master, could it be that we have been investigating the wrong person from the beginning?

479
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,608
No.

480
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:13,060
It's precisely because we're getting closer and closer to the truth,

481
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,119
someone wants to confuse us.

482
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,360
This person...

483
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,520
knows Xiao Wanli better than we thought.

484
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,180
So, you're saying that the mastermind behind the Guanyou Incident isn't Xiao Wanli?
