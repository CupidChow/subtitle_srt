But you must agree to a condition.

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,380
What condition?

23
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,219
I want to appoint Commander Yan as my consort.

24
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,519
Your consort?

25
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,980
You want me to go to the Ning Kingdom to form a marital alliance?

26
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,380
I was like this, too.

27
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,980
I thought she was simply taken by your looks.

28
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,900
Who would have thought she had genuine feelings for you?

29
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,680
I don't care what she thinks. What are you thinking, Your Majesty?

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,140
Calm down. Don't get excited yet.

31
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,580
Trade is beneficial for the kingdom and the people.

32
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,839
If a trade can truly be achieved, the populace will live in prosperity,

33
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,980
and I would fulfill my responsibilities as the emperor.

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,140
Of course, you are equally important to the kingdom.

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,459
That is why I did not issue a decree.

36
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,740
I intended to discuss it with you.

37
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,870
There's no need to discuss.

38
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,180
I do not agree.

39
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,260
I have already agreed.

40
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,100
I had no other choice.

41
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,300
After all, Princess Jiayang even agreed to a 50 percent tariff.

42
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,199
Such a small request.

43
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,180
If I refused it, wouldn't that arouse suspicion?

44
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,379
Then, wouldn't your plan become useless?

45
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,619
- My plan does not involve a marital alliance with Princess Jiayang.
- This is but a minor issue.

46
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:54,040
I believe you can definitely uncover the trade conspiracy before the New Year.

47
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,890
I'll think about it.

48
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,400
- I'll take my leave.
- Changyun!

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,600
I beg you.

50
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:14,560
Please, for the sake of the Southern Kingdom.

<i>How should I explain this to Fu Xiao?</i>

52
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,819
<i>But if I don't, the trade conspiracy cannot be unraveled.</i>

53
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,379
<i>Moreover, Princess Jiayang is connected to the vermilion silver powder.</i>

54
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,900
<i>This is my only chance to uncover the truth</i>

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,700

59
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,639
Changyun, you truly are one with the sword.

60
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,120
You have danced out your state of mind.

61
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,659
Changyun, I have proposed marriage to the emperor for you.

62
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:28,340
After the New Year and the signing of the trade, I will take you back to the Ning Kingdom.

63
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,800
Then ask me for whatever you want. I will fulfill all of them.

64
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,020
Thank you for your affection. I am a subject of the Southern Kingdom.

65
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,299
I will heed all the emperor's arrangements.

66
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:41,660
What if I tell you this is not the emperor's arrangement

67
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,120
but the arrangement of fate?

68
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,520
I know you feel resentful in your heart.

69
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,380
You are a mighty eagle, but you have to come to the Ning Kingdom with me and get stuck in my harem.

70
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,779
Don't worry. After you come,

71
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,639
I will surely have you seated in the position of Great General.

72

00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:08,319
Your Majesty.

75
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,580
I have been physically and mentally fatigued lately.

76
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,339
I actually wanted to exercise with you,

77
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:17,939
but what a pity that it's raining.

78
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,659
Your Majesty, we can exercise in the rain.

79
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,800

80
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,979

You are not only clever and pretty

83

but are also skilled in shuttlecock kicking.

84
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,260
I'm all right.

85
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,780
- So happy?
- Not really.

86
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,900
Then why are you smiling?

87
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,159
Perhaps it has loosened up my limbs and made me sweat, so I feel good.

88
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,600
I feel good too, and so does Commander Yan.

89
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,359
- Why is he feeling good?
- One is happy in the face of joyful things.

90
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,296
What joyful thing?

91
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,399
You tell me.

92
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,419
In consideration of the bigger picture,

93
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,480
he's going to the Ning Kingdom and marrying Princess Jiayang.

94
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,920
You said you approached Princess Jiayang to investigate a case.

95
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,639
Then, what about the marriage alliance?

96
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,839
Someone forced you. Right?

97
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
No one forced me.

98
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,680
I agreed to the marriage alliance willingly.

99
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,220
Chu Yue, I guessed wrong.

100
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,580
He really is the kind of person who craves vanity.

101
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,480
Chu Yue, do you know?

102
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,600
He's going to marry Princess Jiayang.

103
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,830
He's going to the Ning Kingdom.

104
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,290
I don't believe it.

105
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,840
I'm going to talk to Brother Yan.

106
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,368
You don't understand him.

107
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:49,339
- Brother Yan.
- One can't know a person fully.

108
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:53,850
Yan Changyun,

109
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,040
why did you deceive me?

110
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,890
To marry Princess Jiayang,

111
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,720
you don't want me anymore?

112
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,180
He does.

113
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,299
Perhaps he has his own reasons.

114
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,380
This woman knows the young master's true identity.

115
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,659
And she has a very close relationship with the emperor.

116
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:43,332
If she leaks the secret, our years of planning may be destroyed in an instant.

117
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,360

No, I never even considered going.

195

- Of course not.

Actually, I mean,

212
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,300
since you still need to get close to the princess to investigate,

213
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,360
it's better to keep our relationship a secret for now.

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,840
I truly couldn't resist.

289
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,980
When I first began using the incense, it made me feel especially spirited.

290
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,020
But afterwards, if I didn't use it, I'd be without energy.

291
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,699
Then I thought, "The Dark-Green Imperial Incense

is not for someone of my status."

293
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,079

294
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,939

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,400
And it is just so.

344
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:32,580
You mean to say, the Ning Kingdom disguised the powder as the incense?

345
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,359
Exactly.

346
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:38,079
15 years ago, the powder almost destroyed our Southern Kingdom.

347
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,160
Now, under the guise of trade, Princess Jiayang has brought in

348
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,359
lots of Dark-Green Imperial Incense and distributed it among our court nobility.

349
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,559
Her intention is to ruin our Southern Kingdom.

350
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,179
Boss, if the princess knows Xiao Quan,

351
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:56,440
would it mean Xiao Quan is involved in the incense thing, too?

352
00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:01,479
Could it be that Xiao Quan is so bewitched by her that he is accepting bribes and committing treason?

353
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:04,400
Xiao Quan is not a greedy and lustful person.

354
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,960
No one knows how many secrets he is hiding.

355
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,559
If you want to find out the relationship between Xiao Quan and the princess,

356
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,719
wouldn't it be great to trick the embroidery workshop manager into spilling the beans?

357
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:18,079
How do we do it?

358
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,759
We need to find a man

359
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,839
with a vibe like that of the four young men of the Ning Kingdom.

360
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:32,580
Me?

361
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,880
<i>[Exquisite Craftsmanship]</i>

362
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,780
What are you here for? Last time, you almost made me slip up at the Yunshao Bureau.

363
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,240
Besides, Master has already told the princess, hasn't he? Don't act rashly.

364
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:03,160
Now, the situation is quite tense.

365
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,119
There are too many people around here. Hurry back.

366
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,839
I think you should come back with me.

367
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,240
You…

368
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,920
How did you know the four young men?

369
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,440
I don't know them at all.

370
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,980
You are setting me up!

371
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,759
I'm going to report you to the Ministry of Justice.

372
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,279
Boss, let's use torture.

373
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:34,119
It's useless. He's a servant of the Xiao Family.

374
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:36,880
His whole family is in Xiao Quan's hands.

375
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,279
No matter how we torture him, he will not confess.

376
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,279
Boss, Xiao Quan is a cautious person.

377
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,839
This manager probably doesn't know much.

378
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,039
As long as the manager is in our hands, Xiao Quan won't feel at ease.

379
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:57,079
We are waging a psychological battle with him.

380
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:01,000
Perhaps he will reveal his own mistakes.

381
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,639
My Lord, I had the manager's family write a letter.

382
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:22,559
After reading it, he will surely understand.

383
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,079
And he won't say anything inside.

384
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,960
Yan Changyun is ruthless and merciless.

385
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,400
If he really resorts to torture,

386
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,179
I'm afraid no one can withstand it.

387
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,240
I will sneak into the prison and kill him tonight.

388
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,480
They should have been prepared early on.

389
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,840
If you go, it's like walking into a trap.

390
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,079
But what if the manager confesses?

391
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,430
Xue Ying, take a look at this game of chess.

392
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,510
What are the odds of winning?

393
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:59,219
My Lord, the situation looks very critical.

394
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:02,319
He wants to check my army with a pawn.

395
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:08,119
Then I will sacrifice the chariot to save the general.

396
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:12,720
The kingdom is in turmoil.

397
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,580
I should share your worries

398
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,839
and devote myself to Southern Kingdom.

399
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:25,240
But now, other court officials are always gunning for me.

400
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,240
I've long grown tired of the traps.

401
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,000
I would rather resign and ask for your gracious approval.

402
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,720
I know you are devoted to Southern Kingdom and the people.

403
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,920
Certainly, you would not do anything disloyal.

404
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,260
The resignation must not be mentioned again.

405
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:48,619
Your Majesty, though I want to serve you,

406
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:51,559
But there are always people throwing dirty water on me.

407
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:54,580
How can I continue with it?

408
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,039
You mean Yan Changyun, right?

409
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:01,760
Commander Yan, your timing is perfect.

410
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,510
Say something.

411
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,140
Lord Xiao, I have obtained evidence of the manager colluding with the Ning Kingdom.

412
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,440
I suspect he is a spy for the Ning Kingdom.

413
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,940
The manager has been in my mansion for over a decade.

414
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,880
Accusing him of being a spy would be more like saying I am a spy.

415
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,960
Wouldn't it be better to just arrest me directly?

416
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:29,260
If the evidence is solid, you naturally cannot escape responsibility.

417
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:33,260
If you cannot find evidence,

418
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,920
and there is even a single injury on the manager,

419
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,580
it would mean you've tortured him into a confession.

420
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:43,480
Then, I will absolutely not spare you.

421
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:49,100
All right, all right! The two of you.

422
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,640
A mere servant.

423
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,010
Aren't you afraid of becoming a laughingstock?

424
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,980
Lord Xiao,

425
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,680
you and the chancellor are both pillars of the court.

426
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,440
The chancellor has passed away. Our Southern Kingdom cannot do without you.

427
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,039
Take back this letter of resignation.

428
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,800
I will definitely not betray your trust.

429
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,960
I shall take my leave.

430
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,199
Xiao Quan is even more cunning than his father.

431
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,960
Pity that his play was not convincing enough.

432
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,119
He is far too reluctant to give up power in his heart.

433
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,519
The one you just mentioned, the servant.

434
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:01,459
I'll handle it.

435
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,619
With the year-end approaching, how are things going with the princess?

436
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,880
In my opinion, Princess Jiayang is enamored with the incense,

437
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,320
but she does not know the true purpose behind the Ning royal family sending her for trade.

438
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,819
As for the conspiracy of the Ning Kingdom and Xiao Quan,

439
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:21,339
I need to get closer to the princess to investigate clearly.

440
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:23,139
Then get married as soon as possible.

441
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:27,380
Tell me your requests, and I will certainly fulfill them.

442
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,940
You just marry her at ease.

443
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,119
I will definitely take good care of Fu Xiao.

444
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,580
Your Majesty,

445
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,400
I'm just playing games with the princess. You don't need to take it seriously.

446
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,860
You need to make it more convincing.

447
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,840
Spend time with the princess these days.

448
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,000
Only by developing real feelings can the case be handled well.

449
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,440
Don't defy me.

00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,039

452
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,360
Not yet. Why aren't you asleep?

453
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,119
If you can't sleep, I won't either.

454
00:37:35,979 --> 00:37:40,740
Yan Changyun,

455
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,719
when can I fall asleep looking at your face?

456
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,299
You're a girl. Why are you thinking too much?

457
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:57,800
Don't you want to?

458
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:11,000
Yan Changyun, are you asleep?

459
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,496
I nodded.
