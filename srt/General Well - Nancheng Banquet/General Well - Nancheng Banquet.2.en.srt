21
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,259
You were originally a eunuch?

22
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,219
I have been verified. I'm indeed a eunuch.

23
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,340
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you were castrated?

24
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,040
Just now in the Imperial Spring Palace, when the body-checking eunuch pulled you out,

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,959
I was so scared that I broke out in a cold sweat.

26
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,840
I just lost my memory.

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,560
I forget everything when I'm scared.

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
You forget? It doesn't matter who you are.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,880
You're now Xiao Qiangzi.

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,180
His Majesty said you're Xiao Qiangzi, then you're him.

31
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,960
You are Xiao Qiangzi. You are Xiao Qiangzi.

32
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,280
- You are Xiao Qiangzi. You are Xiao Qiangzi...
- Stop making a fuss.

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,770
You are—

34
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,140
Xiao Qiangzi... no, you're Brother Qiang.

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,960
In this life, you are my Brother Qiang.

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,560
His Majesty favors you so much.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,080
Unconcerned with life, death, attire, or sustenance.

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,060
Right, His Majesty is my brother.

39
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,420
Brother Qiang, we've had our ups and downs today.

40
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,679
It was a life and death struggle.

41
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,760
Is it that exaggerated?

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,039
Of course, just look at your luck.

43
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,800
Initially, it was as terrible as imaginable.

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,359
But in the blink of an eye, you became lucky.

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,379
Not only did you gain His Majesty's favor,

46
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,200
but you also stayed by his side as an attendant.

47
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,020
If you are promoted and become wealthy,

48
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,599
don't forget that I brought you into the palace.

49
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,000
How could I forget that?

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,920
How could I ever forget you, Liu Yidao?

51
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,159
You almost stabbed me today.

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
Brother Qiang, from now on, you can call me Little Daozi.

53
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,199
Brother Qiang, are you tired? Then rest early.

54
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,060
Okay, you should also go back to rest.

55
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,880
Fine, have a good rest.

56
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,840

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,050

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,339
<i>Done with the examination. Leave.</i>

61
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,439
<i>Why did he help me?</i>

62
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,119
<i>Who is he? Do we know each other?</i>

63
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,100
<i>Stop overthinking it. Whatever his reasons are for helping me.</i>

64
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,720
<i>Anyway, I made it through.</i>

65
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
<i>Just take things one step at a time.</i>

66
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,219
I've completed all the tasks the lord had ordered.

67
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,960
The lord will fulfill the promised riches and glory.

68
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,656
Your reward.

69
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:44,260
<i>[All Under Heaven in Peace]</i>
Your Majesty, the situation is urgent.

70
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,800
Please make a decision, Your Majesty.

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,900
Chancellor Xiao is absolutely right.

72
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,859
I have just recommended He Wei to succeed Guo Zhen.

73
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,100
He Wei was attacked by villains and had his leg broken.

74
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,659
Your Majesty, how do you think we should handle this matter?

75
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,759
Minister Xiao.

76
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,299
Here.

77
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:08,339
Tell me. Who is suitable?

78
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:13,460
Your Majesty, I believe that the person who can take over General Guo's position,

79
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,000
must be brave and good at fighting, and loyal to Your Majesty.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,879
One who commands a mighty army must also not lose his resolve.

81
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,520
I recommend Yan Changyun.

82
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,600
<i>Yan Changyun?</i>

83
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:45,720
Commander Yan, all the ministers oppose you taking over Guo Zhen's position,

84
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,079
except Lord Xiao.

85
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
You may leave.

86
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,568
Yes.

87
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,959
Uncle Lei has sent word that they have found He Sanyuan.

88
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,060
They'll be able to return today.

89
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,700
Young Master, did anything happen today?

90
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:10,160
Earlier in the great hall, His Majesty wanted to grant me military authority.

91
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,100
All civil and military officials were opposed, except Xiao Quan.

92
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,880
Xiao Quan?

93
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,260
So, he is a loyal and good minister?

94
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,500
Human hearts are unpredictable, and outcomes are unforeseen.

95
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,360
Like the Qin Clan, safeguarding their land and earning merit through sweat and toil,

96
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,879
but they ended up with their family destroyed and members dead.

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,079
<i>Duke Ding colluded with enemies and abused his authority.</i>

100
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,260
<i>He distributed vermilion silver powder in the army barracks,</i>

101
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,740
<i>causing the soldiers of the Southern Kingdom to die in quick succession.</i>

102
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,739
<i>Duke Ding is judged guilty of usurping credit, deceit, and plotting against the state.</i>

103
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:54,499
<i>The entire family of Duke Ding shall be executed by order.</i>

104
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:00,279
We still don't knowwho framed the old master back then.

105
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,700
Now that He Sanyuan has been found,

106
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,300
perhaps we can get some clues from the dead Guo Zhen.

110
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,119

111
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,476
Sit.

- All right.
- No.

113
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:39,900
How can a eunuch dine with you?

114
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,020
That's against proper conduct.

115
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,532
You can join us, too.

116
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:44,899

Do you dare or not?

119
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,940
Your Majesty's word is a decree.

120
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,650
One must dare even if afraid.

121
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:59,530
Good. Take a seat.

122
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,590
Add a pair of chopsticks.

123
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:03,199
Yes. Thank you, Your Majesty.

124
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,920
Your Majesty, it will get cold if you don't eat it soon.

125
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,360
Okay, eat.

126
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,739
Your Majesty, this is too delicious.

127
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,579
Your Majesty, do you eat like this every day?

128
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,640
It's precisely because I eat like this every day,

129
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,600
that everything is starting to taste bland.

130
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,579
But today is different, because you are here.

131
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:04,380
I find this meal exceptionally delicious.

132
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,440
From now on, you shall accompany me for meals every day.

133
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,544
Every day?

134
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,299
What's wrong? Are you unwilling?

135
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:23,779
Your Majesty, actually I have a favor to ask of you.

136
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:29,559
It's been a long time since anyone has asked me for a favor. Speak.

137
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,399
I want to leave the palace.

138
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,620
Just a few bites and you want to go to the restroom.

139
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,200
No. I mean to leave the palace.

140
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,779
Why?

00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,919
Despite daily certainty in food and drink,

142
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,340
I always feel this is not where I should stay.

143
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,779
I feel especially unsettled staying here now.

144
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,840
There's no telling which day I might be killed.

147
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:02,360
I will think about your request again.

148
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,080
Eat.

This… I don't know.

Speak up! You've been with Guo Zhen for so many years.

159
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,400
You know best everything he's done.

160
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,600
Were you the person behind him?

161
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,000
I told you I don't know. If you have the guts, just kill me.

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He Sanyuan,

163

W-W-What do you mean?

165
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,000
I can break your ribs one by one,

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,400
and then set them back one by one.

167
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:29,799
I've got plenty of time. You can think about it slowly.

168
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:34,840
But don't let me hear any more nonsense from you.

169
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,679
I'll tell you. I'll tell!

170
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,800
Guo Zhen had a jade ring on his finger.

171
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,200
That ring must hide a huge secret.

172
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,500
<i>As long as I have this jade ring,</i>

173
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,200
<i>I can be walk around in the Southern Kingdom.</i>

174
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,500
What does the murderer look like?

175
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,600
He is of medium build, clad in white.

176
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,800
A black gauze covers the face, making it hard to discern the features.

177
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,500
That ring must have been taken by the murderer.

178
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,400
<i>Aren't you looking for Guo Zhen?</i>

179
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,100
<i>He died by my sword.</i>

180
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,000
<i>[Broken Bridge by the Water]</i>

181
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,100
<i>[Imperial Palace]</i>

182
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:25,559
Tell me! Where is the jade ring?

183
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,800
What jade ring?

184
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,500
Who sent you to kill me and Guo Zhen?

185
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,000
I didn't intend to kill you, and I don't know Guo Zhen.

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,400
There must be some misunderstanding here.

187
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Right! Let's be honest with each other.

188
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,500
You won't cry until seeing a coffin.

189
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,400
I'll speak…

190
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,800
<i>Are you saying you don't remember anything?</i>

191
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
<i>This is amnesia.</i>

192
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,700
<i>From now on, we're brothers.</i>

193
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,000
<i>Where did this badge come from?</i>

194
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,200
<i>Brother Dao, let me find you a place with food and lodging.</i>

195
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,000
<i>And you even get a monthly allowance.</i>

196
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
<i>I also want to leave the palace. Take me with you.</i>

197
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,900
<i>Imperial eunuch Xiao Qiangzi, executed on the spot.</i>

198
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,200
<i>- Help!
- Wait.</i>

199
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,800
Now you understand, Commander Yan.

200
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,000
I really have amnesia. Look.

201
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,400
Don't move.

202
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,500
I won't move.

203
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,300
My Lord, look.

204
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,400
There's noticeable swelling when touched.

205
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,500
It must have been from a heavy blow.

206
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,000
Look! When I knock here, he reacts.

207
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,900
This is clearly a contusion at the cranial acupoint,

208
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,200
which has caused the amnesia.

209
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,500
See, Commander Yan, I told you so.

210
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Imperial Physician Qu, can his memory be recovered?

211
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,400
This amnesia causes memory loss

212
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
and causes a great change in temperament.

213
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,200
It's hard to treat effectively.

214
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,600
With good luck, he could recover in three to five days.

215
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,800
But if he's unlucky,

216
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,000
it could take thirty to fifty years to recover.

217
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,700
Thirty to fifty years?

218
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,300
Commander Yan, I really have lost my memory.

219
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,159
Then please let me go back.

220
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,200
Having amnesia doesn't feel good, does it?

221
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Yes.

222
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,800
How about I help you regain your memory?

223
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,300
After the human body spins with the rotating disk,

224
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,200
fear and excitement alternately stimulate the head,

225
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,600
causing the patient's blood to flow back to the head, engorging the brain.

226
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,300
It helps to stimulate the cranial acupoints

227
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,800
and to increase the possibility of memory recovery.

228
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,600
Commander Yan, what do you want me to recall?

229
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,300
I don't remember anything at all.

230
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,100
Commander Yan, please let me go.

231
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,200
Slow down. Why is there another round?

232
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,400
Acupuncture stimulates the brain's points.

233
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,800
Firstly, it can refresh and awaken the mind,

234
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,800
speeding up cerebral blood circulation.

235
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,700
Secondly, by strongly stimulating various acupoints in the brain,

236
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,600
it can quickly restore his memory.

237
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,400
So much nonsense. Why has it not taken effect yet?

238
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,600
A serious illness requires strong medicine.

239
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,900
I remember now!

240
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,700
Speak.

241
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,300
Actually, I was just stalling for time.

242
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,800
Let me think again.

243
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,600
You won't cry until seeing a coffin.

244
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,800
You scum who kills the innocent indiscriminately,

245
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,000
even as a ghost, I won't let you go.

246
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,500
<i>It seems he's truly lost his memory.</i>

247
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,839
Not bad, you truly are one of my people.

248
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,300
Despite amnesia, you kept the secrets intact.

249
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,300
Even after life and death, you haven't betrayed me.

250
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,600
Xiao Qiangzi, I really didn't misjudge you.

251
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,200
Are you saying that I am one of us?

252
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,100
I don't blame you for forgetting it.

253
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:32,000
Actually, you are mine. You are a shadow guard I've fostered.

254
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,500
All these years, you've been hiding your identity.

255
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,800
Actually, you've been working for me in secret.

256
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,100
Last time, I sent you to intercept General Guo.

257
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,000
It was just to get the important evidence, the thumb ring.

258
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,200
But you were injured and lost contact with me.

259
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,900
In these days,

260
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,700
I had A'Cheng and Tianjiao try to contact you.

261
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,700
Unexpectedly, although you have amnesia,

262
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,200
you still came to the palace unintentionally.

263
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,700
Do you mean that I came to the palace just to see you?

264
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,950
That's right!

265
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:16,400
Xiao Qiangzi, you've suffered in these days.

266
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,700
Rest assured. I'll find a way to help you with your memory.

267
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,200
Thank you, Commander Yan.

268
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,400
<i>You liar, you don't even know I'm a woman.</i>

269
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,100
<i>But you said I am one of us.</i>

270
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,800
Commander Yan, I'm so moved.

271
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,500
I finally see my kin in the palace.

272
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:43,000
In these days, you don't know how much I've suffered.

273
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,759
Xiao Qiangzi, from now on you'll stay by my side.

274
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,839
I will explain it to the His Majesty myself.

275
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:58,160
That would trouble you too much, Commander Yan.

276
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,900
Since we're all in the same boat,

277
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,100
then I will go to His Majesty myself.

278
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,900
Commander Yan,

279
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,200
following someone as wise and powerful person as you, is my honor.

280
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,300
Okay, I'll wait for your good news.

281
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Then I'll go.

282
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,000
Take care.

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,600
Boss, I don't even believe your words,

284
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,500
do you think he will?

285
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,919
Whether he believes it or not, we need to first stabilize him,

286
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,599
then slowly search for the jade ring.

287
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:42,760
<i>[Imperial Spring Palace]</i>

288
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,500
Xiao Qiangzi, what's the matter?

289
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,699
Your Majesty, you don't know how vicious Commander Yan is.

290
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:13,699
In the pretext of restoring my memory,

291
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:17,119
he spun me on a turntable and pricked me with needles.

292
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,840
He also threatened me with a sword.

293
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,340
Your Majesty, Commander Yan also said he wants me to follow him.

294
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,859
I can't go, Your Majesty.

295
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,319
If I go, I'll lose my life, Your Majesty.

296
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,700
I just want to follow you and serve you.

297
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,839
All right. If you are scared,

298
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:39,960
you just stay by my side always. I will protect you.

299
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,939
Good. Thank you, Your Majesty.

300
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,540
Your Majesty, you really did make me stay with you.

301
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,359
But you have been in there for an hour already.

302
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,680
You are sitting on a toilet, not on the throne.

303
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,480
My toilet is no ordinary one.

304
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,399
Each piece of wood in it is made of the finest sandalwood.

305
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,979
They are all meticulously designed by skilled craftsmen in the palace.

306
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:18,400
Every pattern on it was made according to my instructions.

307
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,320
In this palace,

308
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,039
only the toilet in the restroom is truly my throne.

309
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:32,279
These memorials have all been reviewed by Chancellor Xiao.

310
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:38,560
There are a lot of eunuchs and maids in the palace, and none of them are on the same side as me.

311
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,759
They are just the eyes and ears of various forces in the court.

312
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,799
This is the only place that is the cleanest.

313
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,259
Your Majesty, don't be sad.

314
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:52,300
From now on, whenever you go to the bathroom, I'll be there with you.

315
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,810
My good brother.

316
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,680
We share weal and woe together.

317
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:17,279
Your Majesty, isn't it vulgar for the emperor to give money?

318
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,820
Your Majesty, Xiao Qiangzi accompanies you during meals.

319
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,060
How come you can't do without him even when using the toilet?

320
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,400
I used to be the one you were closest to. Don't you remember?

321
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,459
All right. Tell me. What's the matter?

322
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:44,140
Your Majesty, whose nameplate will you choose tonight?

323
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,400
I'm not interested in that.

324
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,519
Your Majesty, it has been a long time since you've flipped any nameplate.

325
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:52,259
If you don't flip one, when can our Southern Kingdom have a prince?

326
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:54,312
Your Majesty.

327
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,759
Your Majesty, if you don't like it, just flip over for another one.

328
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,050
<i>[Her Majesty]</i>

329
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,220
It's all Her Majesty.

330
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,019
Your Majesty, you must go tonight.

331
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:25,120
What if the queen blames you

332
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,460
and tells Chancellor Xiao about it.

333
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,140
I truly can't bear the responsibility.

334
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,599
Alright, I know. You may leave now.

335
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,419
Your Majesty, how could this be?

336
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:40,960
Don't you have seventy-two concubines in the Three Palaces and Six Courtyards?

337
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,659
Why is it only Her Majesty?

338
00:23:43,659 --> 00:23:48,960
Fine, I will take you to see seventy-two concubines in the Three Palaces and Six Courtyards.

339
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,720
Let's go!

340
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,140
It's time to turn over the signboard. Why hasn't His Majesty arrived yet?

341
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,820
Her Majesty, please don't rush. With your beauty that graces the kingdom…

342
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,300
If His Majesty doesn't come, it is his lack of good fortune.

343
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,340
Don't talk nonsense. That's His Majesty.

344
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,979
How could I have white hair?

345
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:21,179
Her Majesty, you've seen wrong.

346
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,440
How could you, so young, have white hair?

347
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,419
How many good years can a woman have?

348
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:33,160
Should I remain alone in my chambers, destined to die in loneliness?

349
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,200
Her Majesty, please don't be sad.

350
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,320
His Majesty is unaware of warmth and cold, but the young master cares for you.

351
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,239
But after all, he's my brother and can't be compared to His Majesty.

352
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:46,600
His Majesty… Why has he not arrived yet?

353
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,750
I must go out and welcome him.

354
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,540
His Majesty has arrived!

355
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,816
Quick, quickly go!

356
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,300
Beauty Sun.

357
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,580
Slow down.

358
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,860
Your Majesty, don't come near me. I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

359
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,240
I will take my leave first.

360
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,910
No…

361
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,070
Your Majesty.

362
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,640
I really have such a good father-in-law.

363
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,820
Chancellor Xiao even takes care of such matters.

364
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,200
They are all afraid of him.

365
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,299
People think I have three thousand beauties in the harem,

366
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:37,220
enjoying the pleasures of the world.

367
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,820
Actually, I also have unspeakable secrets.

368
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,119
You understand now?

369
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,680
Let's go.

370
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:56,379
Then, in this huge harem, isn't there a woman who dares to approach you?

371
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:58,510
Your Majesty!

372
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,159
Your Majesty!

373
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,699
Who dares to take such a risk with their life?

374
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,816
The empress.

375
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,860
Commander Yan.

376
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,920
Eunuch Qiang,

377
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,130
I'd like to ask for your help.

378
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,180
Kill.

379
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,459
<i>Kill.</i>

380
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,320
Wait!

381
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:13,019
Commander Yan, is it necessary to make it this realistic?

382
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,079
What is the new treatment method?

383
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,139
This is the Scenario Reproduction mentioned by Imperial Physician Qu.

384
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:21,580
It puts you back in your original environment to awaken your memory.

385
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,540
You are now an assassin and the commander is Guo Zhen.

386
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,140
You have to kill him now. Okay?

387
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,640
Okay.

388
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,190
Get ready.

389
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,599
What's this?

390
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
Great.

391
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,880
I mean what I'm wearing on my hand.

392
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,410
A ring.

393
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,390
A thumb ring.

394
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,559
This thumb ring is a reminder to focus on assassination details.

395
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,440
Focus. Recall as much as you can.

396
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,040
Kill.

397
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,940
<i>Kill.</i>

398
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,359
Oh, my goodness.

399
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,960
I told you to kill them.

400
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,480
But I really can't beat them.

401
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,540
Stop torturing me. You can just kill me.

402
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,472
Commander, what do we do now?

403
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:44,160
The scene must not be realistic enough.

404
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,179
Go to the place where Guo Zhen died.

405
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,640
Let's go.

406
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,319
Stop acting, let's go.

407
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,370
Hey! Wake up.

408
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,760
Look at me. Imperial Physician, look at me.

409
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,319
I am the patient.

410
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,299
He should be fine speaking with such vigor.

411
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm not fine…

412
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,219
My whole-body aches.

413
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,480
Imperial Physician Qu, what illness is it?

414
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,659
My Lord, what illness do you want him to have?

415
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,740
Why do you ask him? You're the physician.

416
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,419
Speak plainly.

417
00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:01,680
Based on his pulse, there's an abnormal meridian within his body.

418
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,880
It comes and goes, bizarre and unpredictable.

419
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,759
It's like a very complex type of—

420
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,279
Excessive internal heat?

421
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,876
It is excessive internal heat.

422
00:30:13,876 --> 00:30:16,700
- Excessive internal heat?
- Excessive internal heat.

423
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,640
Since there's nothing urgent, you may leave.

424
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,980
Then I'm really going now.

425
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,359
Hurry up and go. His Majesty will send for you again soon.

426
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,519
- Right. I'm off.
- Go.

427
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,240
Commander Yan, you also noticed the red line on his wrist.

428
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,419
What's going on?

429
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,820
The red line moving upward on the wrist

430
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,520
is a sign of poison attacking the meridians.

431
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,470
What kind of poison is it?

432
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,510
Is there an antidote?

433
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,280
It seems to be a refined poison made from many kinds of toxins.

434
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,360
Only the person who created the poison has the antidote.

435
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,839
Is it lethal?

436
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,850
Without the antidote,

437
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:04,080
one will surely die within a hundred days.

438
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:14,039
Imperial Physician Qu,

439
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,960
you know what should be said and what shouldn't.

440
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,479
If he asks you—

441
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:21,780
I understand.

442
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,680
There is no poison at all.

443
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,239
It is a minor ailment from excessive internal heat.

444
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,200
This humble servant will take his leave.

445
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,219
Your Majesty, have you never suspected that I might be a bad person?

446
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:51,220
If you truly wanted to harm me, you would have done so at the opera house.

447
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,470
Why do you wait until now?

448
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:57,860
I trust you. And in this vast Imperial Palace,

449
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,356
only you dare to speak the truth to me.

450
00:32:00,356 --> 00:32:04,820
Rest assured, Your Majesty. No matter what happens, I will not deceive you.

451
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:10,680
Brother Qiangzi, without you, the Imperial Palace would be unbearably dull.

452
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:15,540
Your Majesty, if you could live outside the Imperial Palace, where would you want to go?

453
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:20,019
What is this?

454
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:23,039
<i>[Map of the Southern Kingdom]</i>
The landscapes of the Southern Kingdom.

455
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,760
Since all these belong to you, you can go wherever you want.

456
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,420
These landscapes, just like people,

457
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,580
are beautiful from a distance, but not so much upon closer examination.

458
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,328
Why?

459
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,916
Look at that.

460
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:47,139
I'm actually not as glorious as others think.

461
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:51,170
Chancellor Xiao controls the court's power,

462
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,120
with his supporters everywhere.

463
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,819
Memorials are reviewed in Chancellor Xiao's residence.

464
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:00,939
Duke Wei is in charge of the Southern Kingdom's finances.

465
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:04,459
Every penny of mine is firmly in his grasp.

466
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:09,780
And Empress Dowager watches my every move.

467
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:15,000
What's the point of being an emperor like this?

468
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,220
Your Majesty, I truly think you're a good person.

469
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,480
Of course, I am a good person too.

470
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,480
However, in this vast palace, there's hardly another good person except us.

471
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,400
That's not entirely true.

472
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,019
I think Commander Yan is not bad.

473
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:34,200
He has followed me for many years, always faithful and devoted.

474
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,440
He would even risk his life to protect me in times of danger.

475
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,660
Do you mean the Commander of the Thousand Feather Guards? I don't think so.

476
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,220
He is simply despicable and shameless.

477
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,939
Ruthless and merciless, he will stop at nothing.

478
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:54,120
Keeping the ruthlessness to oneself.

479
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,119
Sparing no effort in giving warmth to you and me.

480
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,640
Greetings, Your Majesty.

481
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:08,620
Commander Yan, do you have something to ask me?

482
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,039
I come to see Your Majest to ask for someone.

483
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,080
Eunuch Qiangzi is very eager to join the Thousand Feather Guards.

484
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,260
He has applied to me many times.

485
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,660
Your Majesty, I was forced to do so.

486
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,860
- I don't want to go anywhere but accompany you—
- Eunuch Qiang,

487
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,719
breaking your promise is not good.

488
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,619
I feel so dizzy.

489
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:33,612
What's the matter?

490
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:35,620
- Your Majesty, I'm feeling dizzy.
- What's wrong?

491
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,532
- Are you all right?
- Dizzy.

492
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,036
He might be a bit afraid of heights.

493
00:34:42,036 --> 00:34:44,079
- It's so high.
- I'll take him to see the imperial physician.

494
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,100
Commander Yan, don't force him. Let's go.

495
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,880
- How can I walk?
- Take it slow.

496
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,620
I'm so dizzy that I can't even get my bearings.

497
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,800
Commander, this is troublesome. He belongs to His Majesty.

498
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,599
The person I want can't escape.

499
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,820
<i>[Phoenix Rite Palace]</i>
Four years have passed.

500
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,460
Not a single prince has been born.

501
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:13,700
I really don't know what you are doing.

502
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,980
Back then, I made so much effort to help you become the empress,

503
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,800
but what about you?

504
00:35:24,979 --> 00:35:27,360
In today's court assembly,

505
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,519
Duke Wei actually proposed your dismissal to His Majesty,

506
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,860
stating that you have not produced an heir in four years of marriage.

507
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,499
This old man dared to ride over my head.

508
00:35:40,499 --> 00:35:44,860
I, Xiao Wanli, have never suffered such an extraordinary humiliation in my life.

509
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,960
Father, Heng'er has already tried her best.

510
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,159
It's also possible...

511
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,680
that His Majesty is the issue.

512
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,820
Father, His Majesty always avoids me.

513
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,412
I don't know what to do.

514
00:36:00,412 --> 00:36:01,860
You…

515
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,020
You can't even handle a man. Of what use are you to me?

516
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,239
If you continuously fail to gain His Majesty's favor,

517
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:15,119
you can only be replaced by someone from the Xiao Clan.

518
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,459
In short, the legitimate descendant of the Southern Kingdom,

519
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:21,039
must carry the bloodline of our Xiao Family.

520
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:23,119
Think it over by yourself.

521
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,140
Yan Changyun didn't follow you, did he?

522
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,400
Don't worry.

523
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,660
Your Majesty.

524
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,160
Feng Shixi, what are you doing?

525
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,760
Your Majesty, if you don't go for Her Majesty tonight,

526
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,520
the Empress Dowager will have me dead by tomorrow.

527
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,270
Chancellor Xiao will also flay me alive.

528
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,780
Please go there.

529
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,120
All right, you may kneel.

530
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,580
Your Majesty, I do have a method.

531
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,240
It could help you avoid it and also prevent Eunuch Feng from being blamed.

532
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:02,000
Your Majesty, your skin is truly delicate and flawless, as smooth and white as porcelain.

533
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,820
How many women envy you for it!

534
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,620
Only you speak so well. I don't need the envy of others.

535
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,760
As long as His Majesty likes it, that is good.

536
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,080
Your Majesty, will His Majesty not come today again?

537
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,419
Impossible. It was Empress Dowager's order.

538
00:37:19,419 --> 00:37:21,920
His Majesty will surely come.
