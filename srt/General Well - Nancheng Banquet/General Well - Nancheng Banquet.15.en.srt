<i>[Episode 15]</i>

21
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:51,139
Imperial Physician Qu, you have been examining her for quite a while.

22
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:53,059
How is she?

23
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:59,020
Imperial Physician Qu, my child cannot be saved. Right?

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,660
- I'm afraid—
- Imperial Physician Qu, my child is blessed by God.

25
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,539
We won't lose it so easily.

26
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,620
Do you agree?

27
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,560
I'm afraid…

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,059
That makes sense, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:19,380
Imperial Physician Qu, no one knows a child better than their mother.

30
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,852
I feel my child definitely cannot be saved. Right?

31
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:28,879
- I think...
- Imperial Physician Qu, your medical skills are exceptional.

32
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,219
Surely with more prescriptions, the imperial child can be saved. Right?

33
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:38,460
Imperial Physician Qu, this child is quite ominous.

34
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,360
Yesterday, it caused a maid to die.

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,600
Who knows who will be the next one to suffer misfortune?

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,524
<i>If a baby isn't born, my fate is the same, death. It's better to seize this opportunity.</i>
- Imperial Physician Qu.

37
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:52,956
Your Majesty, I can't help it. It's beyond my ability.

38
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:57,379
The b-b-baby is gone. Please restrain your grief, Your Majesty.

39
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:01,399
What? Everything was fine yesterday.

40
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,360
And today, it's just gone?

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,700
Empress Dowager, it's not my fault.

42
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,059
It's on Xiao Quan. He deliberately bumped into me hard.

43
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:14,739
And I lost the baby as a result.

44
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,530
How ridiculous!

45
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,839
How can a baby be lost from just a bump?

46
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:24,020
Well then, since the baby is gone,

47
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,240
there's no need for you to stay by His Majesty's side anymore.

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,539
I'll give you two choices.

49
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:33,820
One, become a nun to pray for the departed child.

50
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:39,300
Two, go to the restroom to scrub squat toilets. Choose for yourself.

51
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,600
I choose to scrub squat toilets.

52
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,580
Good choice.

53
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,140
Guards, take Fu Xiao to the restroom to work immediately.

54
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,748
Grand…

55
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,036
Your Majesty.

56
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:25,380
Scrubbing squat toilets is both dirty and tiring.

57
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,260
How can you still be so happy?

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,939
I don't have to lie anymore. I feel relieved inside. Of course, I feel happy.

59
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:36,600
You'd rather scrub squat toilets than live with me?

60
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,480
Why? What's wrong with me after all?

61
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,580
I am the emperor of an empire.

62
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,360
Not just that, I have wealth and power, and I am handsome too.

63
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,999
We get along and are good friends.

64
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:49,319
I don't understand.

65
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,060
So what?

66
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,539
I neither like money nor do I care for power.

67
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:57,700
I just want to live a free and easy life.

68
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,099
Your Majesty, you should hurry back.

69
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:03,299
You are not suitable for such places.

70
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:04,900
Look, you've scared them all away.

71
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,020
I want to find someone to share the burden with me but can't.

72
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,340
Hurry back.

73
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,079
I am leaving.

74
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,539
I am really leaving.

75
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,559
Fine, keep scrubbing squat toilets for the rest of your life.

76
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,859
What are you here for?

77
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:51,339
I am scrubbing a squat toilet now.

78
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,259
You came to laugh at me. Right?

79
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm not that bored.

80
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,219
So what are you here for?

81
00:05:57,219 --> 00:05:58,979
I came to tell you

82
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,580
you were right to use an excuse to rid yourself of the false pregnancy crisis.

83
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,000
But you shouldn't have provoked Xiao Quan.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,779
Do you realize that it'll put you in even more danger?

85
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,260
I only know an eye for an eye.

86
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,779
Can you not be so reckless?

87
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,800
What's wrong with being reckless? At least I feel good about it.

88
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,216
It's still better than someone.

89
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:20,640
Worrying about this and that every day even more than a woman does.

90
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,640
- You—
- Commander Yan, you don't have to lecture me here.

91
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,079
You're delicate and not suitable for such places.

92
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,000
Please leave.

93
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,520
One moment you care for me, the next you neglect me.

94
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,260
Are you playing with me?

95
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,310
I'm done with you.

96
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,319
You didn't hear how resolute her words were.

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,559
It feels like she'll never return to me again.

98
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,160
Your Majesty, one must not indulge women.

99
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,199
You are the heaven, our emperor.

100
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,680
You can't let a woman lead you by the nose.

101
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,360
Ignore her for a couple of days. Teach her a lesson.

102
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,360
Then she will miss your kindness.

103
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,980
I hope so.

104
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,400
Don't worry. Your Majesty, I'll take care of it.

105
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,920
I'll definitely make Ms. Fu Xiao come and apologize.

106
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,979
All right, then I will wait a little longer.

107
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,000
The most unfortunate thing of my life

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,839
is meeting this calamity and bringing her into the palace.

109
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:39,840
Still thinking you're carrying His Majesty's heir?

110
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,120
You're destined to be scrubbing squat toilets.

111
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,439
Don't slack off. Get to work now.

112
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,660
What are you doing?

113
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,639
What's the matter? Angry?

114
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,040
You just lost a baby, and now you are eating sunflower seeds. So heartless.

115
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,879
How can you guilty woman be so smug?

116
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,580
Just by looking at her face, I can tell she's a ruthless woman.

117
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,079
His Majesty is kind and was momentarily deceived by her.

118
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:07,339
Since you are so delicate, why bother coming here?

119
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:11,300
I need to scrub squat toilets.

120
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,959
So stubborn. You're asking for a lesson.

121
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,452
Everyone, come on.

122
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:17,439
Beat her up.

123
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,720
Come on. I was just thinking of having a fight with you.

124
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,719
Xiao Daozi, come help.

125
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,859
Xiao Daozi!

126
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,440
If you don't finish scrubbing before nightfall, you can't eat dinner.

127
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,880
Let's go.

128
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,100
Truly asking for a lesson.

129
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,279
- Are you okay, Brother Qiang?
- I'm fine, Xiao…

130
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,400
My goodness, Xiao Daozi! You're so nice.

131
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,000
You're the best. I ended up scrubbing squat toilets.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,480
Only you came to keep me company.

133
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,679
If it weren't for Yan Changyun forcing me, I wouldn't have come to this darn place.

134
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,080
Who did you say forced you to come?

135
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,259
Yan Changyun forced me.

136
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,480
Feng Shixi, has she admitted her mistake yet?

137
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,200
Ms. Fu Xiao is still holding onto her last bit of dignity.

138
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,839
In my view, she won't last a few more days.

139
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,840
Everything is under my control.

140
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,840
Don't worry, Your Majesty. I will put in extra effort.

141
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,419
All right, I will wait a bit longer.

142
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:27,192
A bit longer.

143
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,240
What are you going to do?

144
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,880
- Let's use words.
- No need for words.

145
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,139
You are going to beat me again?

146
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,919
- Yes, I'm hitting you.
- I—

147
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,900
Commander Yan is here.

148
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,679
- Yan Changyun.
- Let's leave.

149
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,840
Hurry.

150
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,240
Commander Yan, you finally came.

151
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
If you had come just one step later—

152
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,016
Are you all right?

153
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:05,200
Whether I'm all right or not, it's none of your business.

154
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,360
For you. You've worked hard scrubbing squat toilets these past few days.

155
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,039
Hand cream. Apply three times a day.

156
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,600
Those maids won't come to bully you anymore.

157
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,420
Is it for you?

158
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,360
Yes, it's for me.

159
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,960
He even said it was for Liu Yidao.

160
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,759
I knew it was for me.

161
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,384
This is really bad.

162
00:10:44,384 --> 00:10:45,480
Bad luck.

163
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,460
What do we do now? We were seen by Commander Yan.

164
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,960
What can we do about this?

165
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,120
We can't afford to mess with Commander Yan.

166
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,979
But Eunuch Feng ordered us to punish Ms. Fu.

167
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:56,600
We can't just do nothing.

168
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,440
Right! We're really caught in the middle and it's tough.

169
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,000
That's right. We're always the ones in a difficult position.

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Exactly.

171
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:11,760
Feng Shixi, when is she finally going to admit her mistake?

172
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,040
Your Majesty, don't worry. Based on my estimation, it should be within these two days.

173
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,900
I have already instructed others if Ms. Fu Xiao comes, no one should stop her.

174
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,070
All right, I will wait a bit longer.

175
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,340
You still know to come?

176
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,720
I really should come.

177
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,780
Your Majesty, who would have thought you could be so despicable?

178
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,890
And you, too.

179
00:11:42,524 --> 00:11:45,119
What's the matter, Feng Shixi?

180
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,659
I shall take my leave.

181
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:49,919
Don't go!

182
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,640
Your Majesty, you say we are friends,

183
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,639
but you plot against me behind my back and even let the maids bully me.

184
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,779
That was all Feng Shixi's doing. I was unaware.

185
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,299
Don't explain.

186
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:04,599
From now on, I never want to be friends with you again.

187
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:08,460
Fine by me. I never wanted to be your friend.

188
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:15,699
Fu Xiao.

189
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:20,440
Your Majesty, please let me go.

190
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,348
You…

191
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,400
Your Majesty, the Xiaos sent someone here for Xue Ru's corpse,

192
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,560
saying they want to take it back for burial.

193
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,180
Give it to them for the sake of the empress.

194
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,948
Your Majesty, you've got paint on your hands. Ask the eunuch to wash it.

195
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:50,720
I shall take my leave.

196
00:12:57,804 --> 00:12:58,860
You're here.

197
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,399
Boss, the case of Xiao Wanli.

198
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,980
You asked me to investigate secretly the cosmetics used in the palace.

199
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,144
Here are the investigation records.

200
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:10,720
<i>[Cosmetics Order]</i>

201
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,600
Why did Eunuch Feng need cosmetics?

202
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,120
I asked him. He said His Majesty needed them.

203
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,240
That day, when painting the facial makeup, he felt the colors were not bright enough,

204
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,200
so he added some at the last minute.

205
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:31,944
Tianjiao.

206
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,159
What was His Majesty doing the day Xiao Wanli died?

207
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:40,799
Just like usual, nothing different.

208
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,900
But quite a few people in the palace saw him dressed in a theatrical costume,

209
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,120
with stage makeup on, performing in a play.

210
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Dressed in a theatrical costume with stage makeup.

211
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,740
Was Eunuch Feng there?

212
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,639
No, he wasn't. At least, nobody mentioned him when I asked.

213
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,180
And that day, not long after Xiao Wanli's body was brought back for examination,

214
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,200
His Majesty ordered us to return the body.

215
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:15,459
Ms. Fu Xiao, those maids were arranged by me.

216
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:20,080
I did it because I wanted you to return to His Majesty sooner.

217
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,888
His Majesty was not aware of it.

218
00:14:21,888 --> 00:14:25,220
His Majesty is innocent. Please do not blame him.

219
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,800
I'm just a commoner. How can I blame His Majesty?

220
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,080
So are you saying you're willing to reconcile with His Majesty?

221
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,039
I have no right to blame His Majesty.

222
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:39,080
How would I have the right to reconcile?

223
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:48,019
When can we stop doing this?

224
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:51,339
Of course not until Ms. Fu Xiao does.

225
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,080
Ms. Fu Xiao, can you do me a favor?

226
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,120
Would you reconsider it?

227
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,420
Xiao Daozi, look at how you clean it.

228
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,600
It's not clean at all.

229
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,200
Look at Eunuch Feng. He's truly deserving of the inner court chief manager.

230
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,500
Look, he's doing so well.

231
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,459
Stop scrubbing. Even I think it's still dirty.

232
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,159
Not to mention the masters.

233
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,840
Leave these tasks to someone capable.

234
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,320
Let's go.

235
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:28,519
Let's go. take it.

236
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,299
I was wrong.

237
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:39,299
What did you do wrong?

238
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,480
I should not have disrespected your thoughts.

239
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,960
But I did mean well.

240
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,860
Of course, it truly did damage the brotherly bond between us.

241
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,320
I promise you that from now on, I'll treat you solely as a brother.

242
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Once bitten, twice shy.

243
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,919
I don't believe what you're saying now.

244
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,710
You...

245
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,200
just go back and see how I behave.

246
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,700
I'm not going anywhere. I'm quite fine here.

247
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,480
I've been here so long that I don't even notice the smell.

248
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,170
Besides, I'm no longer the person I was back then,

249
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,919
who you could deceive with just a few words.

250
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,960
I will consider forgiving you.

251
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,040
Go back and wait for news.

252
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,360
Brother Qiang, don't go too far. Just take the way out offered.

253
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,540
I was just thinking, if I didn't teach him a lesson, how could he learn?

254
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,759
How long is this endless scrubbing supposed to last?

255
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,960
Look, my hands are like dried radishes now.

256
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,019
How much longer can I do it for you? You'll have to do it alone.

257
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,080
With the weather so cold, can you endure it?

258
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,560
That makes sense. I'm a bit worried now.

259
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,619
Was my act just now a bit too much?

260
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:04,600
It's hard to say.

261
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,200
Your Majesty!

262
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,510
Your Majesty!

263
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,920
Your Majesty, it has been over a month since the chancellor's death.

264
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,299
The murderer remains a mystery to this day.

265
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,119
Rumors are rife among the people,

266
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,880
all fearing that it's the remnants of the Qin Family.

267
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,660
To console the chancellor in heaven,

268
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,720
to quell the rumors and reassure the people,

269
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,480
I suggest that all the remaining members of the Qin Family should be executed.

270
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,240
I find it inappropriate.

271
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,600
Your Majesty, I think Minister Song's words are too radical.

272
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,820
If we blindly execute the remaining members of the Qin Family,

273
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,550
it will inevitably harm many innocents.

274
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,940
By then, it will surely arouse public outrage, Your Majesty.

275
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,479
Your Majesty, I agree with Minister Song's suggestion.

276
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:02,059
15 years ago, the Qin Family committed a monstrous crime.

277
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:04,079
Those vicious and evil felons.

278
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,420
Keeping them is always a hidden danger for the kingdom.

279
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,640
It's better to kill them all to eliminate future troubles.

280
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,499
There is no conclusive evidence that the chancellor's death was the Qin Family's doing.

281
00:18:15,499 --> 00:18:20,580
If I were to execute them all based solely on conjecture, wouldn't I become a tyrant?

282
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,220
Your Majesty, you are wise.

283
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,340
Please don't show mercy to the remaining members of the Qin Family.

284
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,799
<i>He's right.</i>

285
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,164
<i>[Prosperity]</i>
Enough! No more arguing.

286
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:39,079
Dismissed if there are no other matters.

287
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:44,040
<i>- Long live the Emperor!
- Long live the Emperor!</i>

288
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,980
Lord Xiao, can we really lure out Qin Yan by doing this?

289
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,400
As long as he lives.

290
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,279
He's been living in hiding.

291
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,359
I guess he will not easily take the risk to show up.

292
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,280
He definitely will.

293
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,799
The Qin Family values their reputation the most and loves to pretend to be good.

294
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,450
Back then, Duke Ding used the lives of his entire family

295
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,220
in exchange for a glimmer of hope for his subordinates.

296
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:19,079
I believe that Qin Yan will do the same.

297
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,420
Lord Xiao, you're so smart.

298
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,750
Take care.

299
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:28,684
<i>[Imperial Spring Palace]</i>

300
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,079
Greetings, Your Majesty.

301
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,640
Commander Yan, what is the matter?

302
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,559
I have already found the real murderer who killed Xiao Wanli.

303
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,920
Who is it?

304
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,788
The murderer...

305
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,930
is you.

306
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,200
Commander Yan, what do you mean by this?

307
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,500
At first, I found traces of cosmetics on the chancellor's corpse.

308
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,480
And given the wound, I thought the murderer was weak

309
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,330
and believed the murderer was a woman.

310
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,170
But I overlooked one point.

311
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,519
That kind of makeup is not exclusive to women.

312
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,160
<i>How can men use makeup?</i>

313
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,560
<i>Why can't men use it?</i>

314
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,519
Those who perform in operas use it.

315
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,039
And the killer could pretend to be weak.

316
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:39,619
That doesn't necessarily prove it was my doing.

317
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:43,540
I did not leave the palace that day. The servants can testify to this.

318
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:47,659
Before coming, I had already conducted an investigation.

319
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:51,020
You were performing an opera on the tower that day.

320
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:56,800
But the strange thing is that you usually perform operas in the Miaoyin Pavilion and never wear makeup.

321
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,659
But that day, you did.

322
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,359
I suspect it was Eunuch Feng standing in for you.

323
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,359
Brilliant. No wonder you're the leader of the Thousand Feather Guards.

324
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,880
So, you admit killing Xiao Wanli?

325
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,480
Yeah, kind of true.

326
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,820
<i>[Bright Moonlight]
I'm really loyal to the kingdom and you.</i>

327
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,040
<i>I truly do not understand you.</i>

328
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,610
<i>You form cliques for private gain and make arbitrary decisions.</i>

329
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,790
<i>You coerce me and grasp control of the government.</i>

330
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,750
<i>And now, you even want to manipulate me to eliminate dissidents.</i>

331
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,260
<i>This is what you call loyalty?</i>

332
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,279
<i>Your Majesty, the vermilion silver powder brings disaster to the kingdom and the people.</i>

333
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,739
<i>If you're soft-handed and don't kill them all,</i>

334
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:40,899
<i>they will surely bring endless misfortune to our kingdom.</i>

335
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,450
<i>Hypocrite.</i>

336
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,080
<i>You're just an unscrupulous who will do anything to achieve power.</i>

337
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:52,560
<i>Just like 15 years ago when you forced me to kill Duke Ding.</i>

338
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,879
<i>He deserved to die.</i>

339
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:58,020
<i>He was ambitious and greedy for merit and acted rashly.</i>

340
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,360
<i>He caused chaos in the military. The evidence was irrefutable.</i>

341
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,519
<i>Xiao Wanli, you…</i>

342
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,250
<i>[Bright Moonlight]</i>

343
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,519
<i>Lord Xiao, you should not talk back to His Majesty.</i>

344
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:16,824
<i>His Majesty is merciful. But you're disrespectful and repeatedly anger him.</i>

345
00:22:16,824 --> 00:22:21,519
<i>Who do you think you are to speak to me this way?</i>

346
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,360
<i>I deserve death.</i>

347
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:48,200
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

348
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,260
<i>Five years ago, you conducted a private visit in disguise.</i>

349
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,780
<i>You found me poor so you gave me money</i>

350
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,460
<i>to bury my deceased mother and brought me into the Imperial Palace.</i>

351
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,379
<i>I can only repay you this way.</i>

352
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:00,640
<i>I am asking you what exactly do you mean.</i>

353
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,780
<i>I mistakenly killed Xiao Wanli without your order.</i>

354
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,680
<i>Your Majesty, don't worry.</i>

355
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,840
<i>To mislead others, I have already written "Guanyou" beside the body.</i>

356
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,980
<i>You…</i>

357
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,680
<i>Xiao Wanli has committed heinous crimes, murdering the loyal and good and coercing me.</i>

358
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,759
<i>If I wanted him dead, I'd have made his crimes known to the whole world</i>

359
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:24,359
<i>and conduct a public trial.</i>

360
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,540
<i>Leave the capital and never come back in this lifetime.</i>

361
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:37,720
All this time, I believed Xiao Wanli plotted the Guanyou incident,

362
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,039
but he did not admit it even at the point of death.

363
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,999
- You believe his words?
- Not entirely.

364
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:49,780
But I trust Duke Ding. He was loyal to the kingdom.

365
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,420
He would never do anything that would harm the kin

366
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,559
You've never doubted Duke Ding over the matter of the vermilion silver powder?

367
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,820
Never.

368
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,660
<i>Father, can you hear this in heaven?</i>

369
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,440
<i>His Majesty believes you were innocent.</i>

370
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:13,680
I thought, since "Guanyou" was written on it,

371
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,880
I could take the opportunity to find out the real culprit behind the Guanyou Incident.

372
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:22,540
However, it implicated the families of those involved in the Guanyou Incident.

373
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,640
I really do not know what to do.

374
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,859
I believe someone must be advising Song Ting from behind the scenes.

375
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:31,090
It's Xiao Quan.

376
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,759
I have long felt that Xiao Quan was no simple character.

377
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,560
So after his father's death, I probed him.

378
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,580
I even made him the Minister of Justice, waiting for him to become complacent and expose his flaws.

379
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,580
I didn't expect him to exploit the incident

380
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,699
to try to eradicate the former members of the Qin Family.

381
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:52,200
He's even more vicious than Xiao Wanli.

382
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,100
Your Majesty, don't worry.

383
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,680
I have a plan that can temporarily suppress Xiao Quan.

384
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,119
I just need something from you.

385
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,832
What is it?

386
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:13,680
Commander Yan, now I'm giving you the weapon.

387
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,959
You trust me so much. I will certainly not let you down.

388
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:35,720
I knew I could trust you at any time.

389
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:40,799
Can I ask for one more thing?

390
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,599
Miss Chu Yue.

391
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:50,079
Yes, Miss Chu Yue is still in the prison of the Ministry of Justice.

392
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,839
I am truly worried.

393
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:54,070
You worry about her so much.

394
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,450
Do you like her?

395
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,280
Since Miss Chu Yue has promised herself to me, I have the responsibility to protect her.

396
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,112
Good! You are a real man.

397
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:15,860
Don't worry. I will help you protect her at any time.

398
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,440
Thank you, Your Majesty.

399
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,820
Then I shall take my leave.

400
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,020
Eunuch Feng, you're a good actor.

401
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,860
It seems you have learned quite a lot from His Majesty.

402
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:34,180
He knows it.

403
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,000
It won't cause any trouble, will it?

404
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,880
It's okay. It's good that he knows.

405
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,192
He has agreed to help me find the real culprit behind the Guanyou incident.

406
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:53,280
It's just that I'm growing more and more suspicious of his identity.

407
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,279
Hide this dagger in Song Ting's residence.

408
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,960
But Song Ting is a man of Xiao Quan.

409
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,180
Wouldn't this expose you even more?

410
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,760
This is the only way.

411
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,860
Only then can I protect the ones implicated.

412
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,519
Only then can I save Chu Yue.

413
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,439
Xiao Quan already suspects you. What if they use this as an excuse to make it hard for you?

414
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:21,400
I have my own methods. Listen to me.

415
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,200
Go and get ready.

416
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,720
<i>Duke Wei. Xiao Wanli.</i>

417
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,659
<i>The two great burdens weighing down on me have already been toppled.</i>

418
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:02,620
<i>But it is Xiao Quan who truly worries me.</i>

419
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,599
<i>Yan Changyun, if you truly are Qin Yan,</i>

420
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:15,000
<i>help me safeguard the kingdom.</i>

421
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:25,319
Of course, we must thoroughly eradicate all evil.

422
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,100
If none of you will go, then fine, I'll say it.

423
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,330
I'll do it.

424
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,040
Your Majesty, for the peace of the kingdom,

425
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:42,020
I suggest executing all remnants of the Qin Family.

426
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,080
Your Majesty, no.

427
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,160
If we kill them without evidence,

428
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,799
I fear it would lead to great chaos throughout the land.

429
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:58,359
Your Majesty, I found the real culprit behind the murder of the chancellor.

430
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,520
You found the real culprit?

431
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,270
Who?

432
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,679
Song Ting, the Lesser Director of the Imperial Manufactory.

433
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,419
<i>What?</i>

434
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:08,544
<i>Song Ting?</i>

435
00:29:08,544 --> 00:29:09,600
<i>Him?</i>

436
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,079
You're slandering me. You're framing a loyal person.

437
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,000
Don't try to deny it, Lord Song.

438
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I have already found the murder weapon in your residence.

439
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,968
What weapon?

440
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,720
The blade of this dagger matches the chancellor's wound exactly.

441
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,720
The servants at your residence saw the dagger being found with their own eyes.

442
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,120
Here are their testimonies.

443
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,680
Nonsense. I don't have any dagger at all.

444
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,880
Besides, this kind of dagger is common in the market.

445
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,480
On what basis do you claim this is the murder weapon?

446
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,960
What Lord Song said is right.

447
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,420
But I also found a strand of silk thread in the chancellor's fingernails.

448
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:03,359
Whether you're the murderer or not will be known soon.

449
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:20,039
<i>Could it really be Lord Song?</i>

450
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,240
<i>It seems true.</i>

451
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,190
This thread...

452
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,090
is from Lord Song's left shoulder.

453
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,460
<i>Really?</i>

454
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,220
<i>There really was one at the scene of the crime.</i>

455
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,000
<i>Lord Song, you've worked hard.</i>

456
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:54,520
You took this silk thread from me.

457
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,000
You're framing me.

458
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,960
Song Ting, take it easy.

459
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,900
Commander Yan, please continue.

460
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,240
Your Majesty, to determine the guilt of Lord Song

461
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,340
based solely on a common thread

462
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,359
is far too childishly whimsical, isn't it?

463
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:14,039
Didn't you condemn Chu Yue for killing the chancellor

464
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,830
simply because she is the daughter of Lei Bao?

465
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,519
How can these two cases be equated?

466
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,480
The crime scene contained "Guanyou".

467
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,039
Chu Yue is the daughter of Lei Bao, a former subordinate of Duke Ding.

468
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:33,279
She has been suspected of murder for revenge.

469
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:39,260
But Lord Song has always had a very good relationship with my father.

470
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,899
- Can you tell me...
- Yes.

471
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:45,880
why he'd kill my father?

472
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,744
Yes.

473
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,880
That makes sense.

474
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,260
Commander Yan, do you have any more evidence?

475
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,419
This is the conclusive evidence that Lord Song killed the Chancellor.

476
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,160
You're really vicious.

477
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,779
<i>[Account Books]</i>
He killed someone to cover up his corruption.

478
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:19,219
<i>[Steward Liu's confession]</i>
The chancellor was going to report him.

479
00:32:19,219 --> 00:32:23,200
In a moment of desperation, Lord Song killed the chancellor.

480
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,839
For fear of exposure,

481
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,340
Lord Song then framed the former subordinates of Duke Ding.

482
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:33,639
- Song Ting!
- Here.

483
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:36,399
You engaged in corruption, hired an assassin, and committed murder.

484
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,500
With so much evidence here, what else do you have to say?

485
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,540
Your Majesty, I did covet some money,

486
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:45,200
but I did not kill the chancellor.

487
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,119
Your Majesty, the remnants of the Qin Family killed the chancellor.

488
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,559
It was the remnants of the Qin Family.

489
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,559
It's clever for Lord Song to mislead us with the two characters "Guanyou".

490
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,319
Do you have some entanglement with the Qin Family?

491
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:08,360
And you intended to eliminate your biggest concern by killing the chancellor?

492
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,640
You're venomous.

493
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,960
Guards, drag him out and deal with him according to the law.

494
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,619
Your Majesty, I am being wronged.

495
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,319
Secretary Xiao! Your Majesty! I am being wronged.

496
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:22,799
I am unjustly accused, Your Majesty!

497
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,419
<i>The murder of the chancellor.</i>

498
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,400
We have starved her for three days, but she still doesn't say naything.

499
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,339
As long as you confess the rest of the Qin Family, we will let you out.

500
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:47,279
Still stubborn. Quite the temper.

501
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,160
The chief courtesan of the Yunshao Bureau is beautiful.

502
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,200
Why not talk with us?

503
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Right, come chat with us.

504
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,000
Come on, let's talk.

505
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,520
Brother Yan.

506
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,639
Here.

507
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,719
Yan Changyun, I was waiting for you to break into the jail.

508
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,530
I didn't expect you to actually come.

509
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,540
Capture him!

510
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,119
Xiao Quan, you're even more shameless than your father.

511
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,619
You should know that breaking into the Ministry of Punishment

512
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:53,500
and kidnapping the imperial court's most important criminal will cost you your head.

513
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,840
His Majesty has already issued an order to release Chu Yue.

514
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,000
Lord Xiao, do you intend to defy the imperial order?

515
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,060
Are you still doubting the authenticity of the imperial edict?

516
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,799
- What are you thinking about, Your Majesty?
- Nothing much.

517
00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:00,079
Chancellor Xiao's killer has been found.

518
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,159
This eases my mind quite a bit.

519
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:05,280
Who is the murderer?

520
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,199
Song Ting, the Lesser Director of the Imperial Manufactory.

521
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,760
Song Ting?

522
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,459
I seem to have heard of him.

523
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:16,679
They say he's a corrupt official. Serves him right.

524
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:22,599
Then it was Yan Changyun who found this out, right, Your Majesty?

525
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:28,020
Yes, Commander Yan has been working tirelessly to find the murderer these days.

526
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,160
- It's both for the public good and a personal matter.
- What do you mean?

527
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,239
His childhood sweetheart, Miss Chu Yue, has been wronged for so long.

528
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:37,360
How could he not be anxious?

529
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,260
Today, he carried my edict to personally pick her up from jail.

530
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,640
And he asked me to annul her servitude.

531
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,000
It seems he intends to redeem her and take her home honorably as his wife.

532
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,130
Commander Yan dares to follow his heart.

533
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,119
He is truly a hero.

534
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:54,639
I am greatly comforted by this.

535
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,000
I want to see their happy reunion.

536
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Just such a woman.

537
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,840
Due to my status, it is not convenient to leave the palace.

538
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,520
Why don't you go on my behalf and take a look?

539
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,779
Then I'll go right now.

540
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:24,648
<i>[Commander's Mansion]</i>

541
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,119
Chu Yue, it's not convenient for you to return to Uncle Lei's place for now.

542
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,440
So stay at my residence temporarily.

543
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,900
I've had the servants prepare this room for you.

544
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,300
Rest here and recover from your injuries.

545
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:40,030
Thank you, Brother Yan. I'll do as you say.

546
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,119
You've suffered these past few days.

547
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:46,840
This bit of suffering is nothing.

548
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,159
But do you know the pain in my heart?

549
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:53,559
I do.

550
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,199
Chu Yue, you're finally out.

551
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:01,100
Changyun and I were worried about you every day.

552
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:06,300
Changyun, I told you before to visit Chu Yue a lot.

553
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,079
But you wouldn't listen.

554
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,340
Changyun, I was just pregnant.

555
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,800
- You don't need to be so nervous, watching me every day.
- What are you saying?

556
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,316
You were not carrying the Boss's child. Why would he be worried about you?

557
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:21,280
Shut up.

558
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,119
Chu Yue, it's getting late.

559
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,436
- Changyun, escort her back to the Yunshao Bureau.
- No need.

560
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:31,140
His Majesty has granted you a special pardon and removed your status as a courtesan.

561
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,800
From today onwards, you are free.

562
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,440
Really?

563
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,200
Brother Yan, you not only redeemed my freedom for me

564
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,400
but also let me stay at your house.

565
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,670
Thank you.

566
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,800
I'll take you inside to have a look.
