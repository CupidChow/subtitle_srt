Sun Cheol, long time no see.

187
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,890
- Hello.
- Hey.

188
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,850
Wow.

189
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,730
You look great.

190
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,780
We need to go somewhere together.

191
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,860
R-Right now?

192
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,830
Why? Are you busy?

193
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,090
No.

194
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,960
Where are you going?

195
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,710
What's this now?

196
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,830
What's your name?

197
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,320
Me?

198
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,310
- I'm Yun-
- Go away, you idiot.

199
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,850
Are you f***ing crazy?

200
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,760
I think he's in 10th grade.

201
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,290
I don't know him.

202
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,190
Really?

203
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,840
What an interesting kid.

204
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,370
Let's go now.

205
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,800
Let's go.

206
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,730
Won't you study?

207
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,200
The midterm is coming up.

208
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,340
He's saying something to you.

209
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,470
He's not right in the head.

210
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,240
I knew it. Just look at him.

211
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,550
Sun Cheol, you have a lot to do today.

212
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,830
It will be a long night.

213
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,050
[Grandpa]

214
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,220
All done.

215
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,650
So, how many answers did I get wrong?

216
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,200
Four...

217
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,280
I only got four wrong?

218
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,500
No.

219
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,350
You got everything wrong but four.

220
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,650
But this is very impressive.

221
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,290
I can't even solve one of these questions.

222
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
I got three right yesterday.

223
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,590
I got one more right. Here.

224
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,270
Why do you study for TOEIC?

225
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,920
What do you mean?

226
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,370
Because...

227
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,980
TOEIC is for getting a job.

228
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,150
So, you mean,

229
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:57,180
why am I doing this when I'm about to die?

230
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,030
No, no.

231
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,150
That's not what I meant.

232
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,030
- It's fun.
- Pardon?

233
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,810
I'm becoming a better person than I was yesterday.

234
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,450
How could I not do something this fun?

235
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,330
<i>Hey.</i>

236
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,350
If you meet Sun Cheol,

237
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,060
teach him how fun it is to study, okay?

238
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,510
I think you could do it.

239
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,330
<i>Last evening, near the Ancheon Port,</i>

240
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:44,630
<i>a man in his 40s was found dead from a stabbing.</i>

241
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,600
<i>The police used the CCTV</i>

242
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,310
<i>to determine that the suspect is</i>

243
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,600
<i>an 18-year-old high school student, Kim,</i>

244
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,240
<i>and they are searching for him.</i>

245
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,970
Isn't that obviously our school uniform?

246
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,640
But to kill someone?

247
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,750
By the way, I think I've seen him before.

248
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,590
Isn't this Kim Sun Cheol, the blonde?

249
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,360
- Kim Sun Cheol?
- Yeah.

250
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,060
- Pi Han Ul's underling, Kim Sun Cheol?
- Yes.

251
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,220
You're right.

252
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,100
Right? Look, Yun Ga Min.

253
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,250
- Is it him?
- Look. He's blonde.

254
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,030
- Yun Ga Min.
- It has to be him.

255
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,570
What's wrong?

256
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,520
It's nothing.

257
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,200
But don't you think it's him?

258
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,210
Yes, he's the blonde.

259
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,870
Yun Ga Min,

260
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,620
you met Kim Sun Cheol last night, right?

261
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,770
- Yes.
- What?

262
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,880
So, you suggested he study with you,

263
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,890
but he left the hospital with

264
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,900
a Yeonbaek Gang member?

265
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,610
Yes.

266
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,930
And that was around 10:45 p.m.?

267
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,340
Yes.

268
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,180
And? Anything else?

269
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,350
<i>Sun Cheol, you have a lot to do today.</i>

270
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,550
<i>It will be a long night.</i>

271
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,600
No, there was nothing else.

272
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,090
Is that so?

273
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,580
Okay.

274
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,410
By the way...

275
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,610
Yes.

276
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,980
Do you...

277
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,590
really think Sun Cheol is the murderer?

278
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,220
He's the top suspect right now.

279
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,830
I mean,

280
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,230
do you really believe that, too?

281
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,040
Hey, this isn't about what I believe.

282
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,520
I'm just saying that's how it seems.

283
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,920
[Yuseong Technical High School]

284
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,240
Are you still thinking about that?

285
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,710
By the way,

286
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,710
do you think Sun Cheol could have done that?

287
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,890
He's a backup fighter.

288
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,270
He's close to Pi Han Ul, too.

289
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,320
- But still.
- Why?

290
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,500
Do you think he didn't?

291
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,740
What are we discussing this early?

292
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,390
Hee Won and I investigated the Kim Sun Cheol case.

293
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,630
That's what this is about?

294
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,900
Why are you doing this now?

295
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,050
Who cares what a thug has been up to?

296
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,600
Right.

297
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,480
Ta-da.

298
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,060
If you look at this graph,

299
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,910
since Pi Han Ul joined the school last year,

300
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,340
murders committed by high schoolers

301
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,190
in Ancheon skyrocketed.

302
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,590
It's clearly much higher than in other regions.

303
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,480
Was this neighborhood cursed?

304
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,290
But to say that,

305
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,210
the overall crime rate isn't higher than others.

306
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,570
What does that mean? Help me understand.

307
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,510
The overall crime rate is the same,

308
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,200
but only the juvenile crime rate went up

309
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,850
which means the adult crime rate went down

310
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,100
and the juvenile crime rate is going up.

311
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Another words,

312
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,470
high school students are used in adult crimes.

313
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,490
Don't you think that could be the case?

314
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,080
They use high schoolers?

315
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,310
Why?

316
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,630
What makes us better than the gangsters?

317
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,060
- Our looks?
- Bingo.

318
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,290
Hee Won.

319
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,640
Sorry. I thought he was right, too.

320
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,430
Okay.

321
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,140
Age?

322
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,900
Bingo.

323
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,540
When did you get here, Four-eyed Psycho?

324
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,170
I just got the chills.

325
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,510
That's right.

326
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,360
We're protected by the

327
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,120
juvenile law because we're minors.

328
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,920
A first-time offender and a minor?

329
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,690
You'd be on parole in a few years.

330
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,460
Seriously.

331
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,000
You only get a few years after killing someone?

332
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,690
What? Are you guys acting?

333
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,960
I thought you'd ask that.

334
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,260
But still. Would anyone go to prison for someone?

335
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,360
What if you serve just three years,

336
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,720
join the Yeonbaek Family, and the YB Construction?

337
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,700
Whoa, sweet.

338
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,560
Sweet, my foot.

339
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,500
Okay, you have a point, but...

340
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,060
where's the evidence that the thug isn't the murderer?

341
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,560
Well...

342
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,050
There isn't any.

343
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,570
I need your help.

344
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,460
Huh? You're Sun Cheol's friend?

345
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,000
Sun Cheol isn't the culprit.

346
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,380
Give me a break, you f***er.

347
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,420
- Hey, Dae Cheol.
- Yes.

348
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,200
You're still talking bulls***.

349
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,700
You need to be trained more.

350
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,470
You don't mean studying, do you?

351
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,440
What's this crazy bastard saying?

352
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,800
Right.

353
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,030
Aren't you the ugly psycho from the hospital?

354
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm not.

355
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,740
Look at you, bastard.

356
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,890
Hey.

357
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,680
What are you looking at me like that for?

358
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,370
Just be on your way.

359
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,460
These f***ers are acting up together.

360
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,970
You asked for this, okay?

361
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,770
You petty bastard.

362
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,600
A metal pipe? A metal ball...

363
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,570
What happened?

364
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,850
<i>I saw it clearly.</i>

365
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,150
<i>Chu Seong Wung...</i>

366
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,790
<i>was cleaning a bloody knife.</i>

367
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,030
Actually,

368
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,580
it's an open secret among the backup fighters

369
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,530
