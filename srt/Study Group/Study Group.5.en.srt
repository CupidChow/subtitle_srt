If each person eats two slices of pizza,

187

00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,440
Here are your placement test rankings.

361
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,350
Lee Ji Wu.

362
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,280
Average score, 14 points.

363
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,420
Out of 220 students, you're in 180th place.

364
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,040
Whoa.

365
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,850
- What?
- Lee Jun.

366
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,580
- Average score, 31 points.
- What?

367
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,180
132nd place in the entire school.

368
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,420
Geez, I'm worse than gochujang?

369
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,050
I fight with my mind, okay?

370
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,340
I'll pluck your eyeballs.

371
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,600
- Choi Hee Won.
- Yes.

372
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,520
Average score, 29.

373
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,000
162nd place in the entire school.

374
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,450
Anyone would think Hee Won is a good student.

375
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,400
Yun Ga Min.

376
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,100
- Yes.
- Your total score is 25 points.

377
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:09,500
It's not the average score. It's the total score.

378
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,390
The average score is 8 points.

379
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,110
You're in 219th place in the entire school.

380
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,240
Four-eyed Psycho, 8 points?

381
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,280
Hey, you'd get a better score by guessing.

382
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,690
Lastly, it's Kim Se Hyeon.

383
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,600
Average score, 95 points.

384
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,340
Second place in the entire school.

385
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,940
- Wow.
- Second place?

386
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,000
Shit, you're a liar.

387
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,640
I'm impressed.

388
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,170
It's nothing.

389
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:43,490
Everyone but Se Hyeon is at the bottom, right?

390
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:49,150
But our grades could miraculously improve if we tried from now on, right?

391
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,050
Ga Min,

392
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,860
there's no such thing as a miracle in grades.

393
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,760
If you were in a normal high school, I mean.

394
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,640
But this is Yuseong Tech High.

395
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,660
We have 20 days until the midterms.

396
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,420
You can do it if you do as I say from now on.

397
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,100
- I'm hungry.
- Still?

398
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,870
- Yes.
- Right, I heard something earlier.

399
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,170
What is it?

400
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,170
- I heard you run a study group at school.
- Yes.

401
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:25,090
Improve all of their overall rankings by 10, then.

402
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,050
Why? Would it be too difficult?

403
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,750
No.

404
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,230
I'll give it a try.

405
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,670
I'll improve all of their rankings by at least 10.

406
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,920
By 10 rankings each?

407
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,320
Yes.

408
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,710
- All of us?
- Yes.

409
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,450
I'm jealous, Four-eyed Psycho.

410
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,440
It'd be so easy for you.

411
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,860
How about Se Hyeon, then?

412
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,780
Does he have to be in 1st place since he's in 2nd place?

413
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,350
- Wow.
- How intense.

414
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,490
Guys, I'll get going now.

415
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,220
What? Aren't you hungry? Let's get tteokbokki.

416
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,550
I'm meeting someone. I need to go now. Bye.

417
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,360
What's wrong with him? Is he shocked because he has to be in 1st place?

418
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,140
Tteokbokki, yes?

419
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,000
- Yes.
- Yes? Yes?

420
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,850
Let's get tteokbokki.

421
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,230
I'm on my way now.

422
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,890
<i>You bastard. Do you think I was joking?</i>

423
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,440
<i>Come to the site as soon as you're off school!</i>

424
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,280
- Kim Se Hyeon.
- Yes.

425
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,040
Choi Jong Hwa.

426
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,660
[English - 100 points]
Yes.

427
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,240
Kim Ho Min.

428
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,610
<i>You should be stuck at home.</i>

429
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:00,060
<i>Why do you go around town and get scammed?</i>

430
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,810
<i>I didn't do that to only feed myself.</i>

431
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,870
<i>How long will we keep living like this?</i>

432
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,680
F***!

433
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,220
You loser!

434
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,950
- Seriously!
- You son of a bitch!

435
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,480
<i>- Die, die!
- Fine! I'll leave!</i>

436
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,190
<i>Please stop!</i>

437
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,500
<i>Enough is enough! Stop!</i>

438
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,250
<i>Go kill yourself!</i>

439
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,980
Poor bastard.

440
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,810
He can't come to our playground because he doesn't live in our building.

441
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,550
Why does he keep coming here?

442
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,530
Are you a beggar?

443
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,030
<i>Se Hyeon.</i>

444
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,020
Hey.

445
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,410
I thought you were meeting someone.

446
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,900
Yes, I am.

447
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,030
Should we walk together?

448
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,690
I think we're going in the same direction.

449
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,760
Together?

450
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,450
Let's do it later if you don't want to.

451
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,370
I-It's not like that.

452
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,100
Let's walk together. I'd like to.

453
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,480
Okay.

454
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,570
Thank you for what you did that day.

455
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,070
That day?

456
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,580
At the police station.

457
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,050
You accompanied me there.

458
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,930
Oh, that day?

459
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,390
I didn't do much then.

460
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,960
You explained the situation to the police calmly.

461
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,180
I couldn't have even gone in if I were alone.

462
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,090
It's nothing.

463
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,740
Yun Ga Min was the impressive one.

464
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,500
He destroyed the real thugs

465
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,610
and he saved Manil High by fighting the bad kids, too.

466
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,850
He reminds me of a superhero in a comic.

467
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,960
If Yun Ga Min were the main character,

468
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,910
I'm probably Friend No. 3 next to him?

469
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,880
That's probably all I am.

470
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:01,200
I think you underestimate yourself too much.

471
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,030
You destroyed the computer with the video in front of the disciplinary committee.

472
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,710
Not anyone can do stuff like that.

473
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,760
I think Ga Min is very impressive,

474
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,220
but I also think you're really...

475
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,210
really impressive.

476
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,110
- Really?
- Yes.

477
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,010
Huh? It's the poor bastard.

478
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,950
Come here.

479
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,510
Gosh, you immature bastard.

480
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,260
You're going out with a girl now?

481
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,330
You terrible son.

482
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,500
Come here. Come here. Come here.

483
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,610
You're a forever loser because you live such a pathetic life.

484
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,450
Stop it.

485
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,030
Who's worrying about whom? You bitch.

486
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,650
Hey, I'm glad I caught you today.

487
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,210
You bitch. Hey.

488
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,650
You had your fun last time.

489
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,860
Go ahead and do it again.

490
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,140
Why? Are you embarrassed in front of the boys?

491
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,440
Hey!

492
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,460
You'd better stop.

493
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,160
Stop what? Stop what?

494
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,370
Stop what, you f***er?

495
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:39,960
You're losers who can't fend for yourselves, but you're acting cool.

496
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,920
Why does someone like you hang out with this loser?

497
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,290
He can't even buy you a roll of gimbap.

498
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,680
Look at him.

499
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,710
He actually dolled up for her.

500
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,750
Right, Se Hyeon?

501
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,630
Wow.

502
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,840
- Wow.
- Se Hyeon...

503
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,580
You thought you could do something if you fought me in that moment?

504
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,400
Does being Yun Ga Min's underling make you feel like somebody, too?

505
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,770
What a f***ing loser.

506
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,810
Guys,

507
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,290
he needs to do physical labor. Don't break anything.

508
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,870
Beat him up enough and let him go.

509
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,410
- See you later. Bye.
- You lose if you don't play. Rock, paper, scissors.

510
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,230
Hey, are you okay?

511
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,090
Are you out of your mind?

512
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,660
You want to fight me right now?

513
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,760
No, I'm playing a game. Ddakbang game.

514
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,140
Let's just play 10 games to determine who's the winner and loser.

515
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,630
You're eager to get expelled, aren't you?

516
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,360
You lose if you don't play. Rock, paper, scissors.

517
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,230
I won again.

518
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,240
It's 2:0.

519
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,030
You lose if you don't play. Rock, paper, scissors.

520
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,020
You didn't play this time.

521
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,270
- Go on and play.
- Take pictures. Take pictures.

522
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,740
I hate getting pictures taken.

523
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,140
Sorry.

524
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,020
- Se Hyeon.
- Let's run.

525
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,560
Are you okay?

526
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,760
Se Hyeon.

527
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,500
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

528
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,450
It's okay.

529
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,710
I'm okay.

530
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:07,490
He called us losers, but we're winners. Right?

531
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,500
You're the winner.

532
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,950
What?

533
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,440
I'll leave now.

534
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,610
♫ <i>My days on these narrow streets</i> ♫

535
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,820
Welcome home-

536
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,470
You bastard. Won't you make money?

537
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,310
I told you to come to the site and learn the job.

538
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,200
Is that really that hard?

539
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,260
Did I say I won't make money?

540
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,110
I'll do it once I graduate high school.

541
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,400
How about the debt?

542
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,060
What will you do with the debt your mom created?

543
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,070
I said I'll pay it.

544
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,210
It's not even my debt, but I said I'll pay it.

545
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,370
Listen to this bastard.

546
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,210
How dare you talk, looking at me like that?

547
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,630
Father,

548
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,770
being humiliated by your colleagues

549
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,530
matters more than the blood on my face, right?

550
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:07,250
You bastard. You talk just like your mother, don't you?

551
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:11,280
You always say, "Your mother, your mother," because of some debt.

552
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,930
She was your wife before she was my mom.

555

Come to my place.

556
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,200
What?

557
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,430
To be honest,

558
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,010
I have something in common with you.

559
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,300
So, come to my place.

560
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,090
It's okay. You go on.

00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,230
Where will you sleep?

562
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,180
No one takes you in past 10.

563
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,810
If we take a taxi and go home before the curfew time,

564
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,060
my mom won't say anything, either.

565
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,770
How about the taxi fare?

566
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,680
It'd be more than 10,000 won from here.

567
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,990
It's okay. I'll pay.

568

You don't really understand...

569
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,220
why I'm like this over just 10,000 won.

571
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,250
Right. Friends can help each other.

I'm so grateful you're helping me.

573

But why are you the only one helping?

574
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,740
