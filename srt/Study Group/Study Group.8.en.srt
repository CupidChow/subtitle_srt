368
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,220
It'd be better if he didn't go anywhere today.

369
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,880
<i>Right now! Right now!</i>

370
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,660
I'm bored. Should we play a round, too?

371
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,070
The lowest scorer buys ice cream.

372
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,330
The three of us?

373
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,090
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Hurry.

379

<i>- What the heck?
- I did...</i>

380
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,600

386

Every year,

387
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,660
there are four days I don't bother Ga Min.

388
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,200

389
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,350

390

He acts strangely after checking the scores.

391
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,960
He can't focus on anything, and he's a bit...

392
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,630
Yun Ga Min, score lower than 300

393
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,740

394
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,670

395
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,910
Let go!

396

397
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,270

- It's okay. It's okay.

403

Gochujang, you're actually the one to blame.

404
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,260

405
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,500
I'll open this for you. Don't be angry, okay?

406
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,000
Eat, eat. It's my treat.

407
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,610
We already paid. What do you mean?

408
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,960
Are you worried it'd be lower than you thought?

409
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,660
- Huh?
- Aren't you worried

410
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,030
about the exam results?

411
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:58,670
Yes, I thought it'd be different this time.

412
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,000
By the way, I don't understand it.

413
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,500
You get at least 20 points from

414
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,020
guessing the multiple choices.

415
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,040
How's your average score 10 points?

416
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,740
He doesn't guess when he doesn't know the answer.

417
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,750
- Are you joking?
- Why not?

418
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,270
He doesn't think he deserves the score by guessing.

419
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,560
Geez.

420
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,390
Ga Min is the best.

421
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,060
Guys, I have a quiz for you.

422
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,490
Okay.

423
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,180
What happens when you boil water?

424
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,700
Yes, Yun Ga Min. You answer.

425
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,080
Me?

426
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,450
You can eat ramen.

427
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,960
- Wrong.
- Really?

428
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,910
The answer is, "Nothing happens."

429
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,630
Huh?

430
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,720
Water starts bubbling and creates opportunities

431
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,470
when it reaches the boiling point.

432
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,150
But nothing appears to be happening until then.

433
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,060
So what?

434
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,180
- Huh?
- What?

435
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,520
So, what I'm saying is...

436
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,810
Until you reach the boiling point,

437
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:24,450
you might think nothing is changing at all.

438
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,460
But...

439
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,480
if you put energy into something steadily,

440
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,710
a big change has to happen eventually.

Hey, Pi Han Ul!

549
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,190
What will you do now?

550
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,880
The disciplinary committee is on you now.

551
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,270
Keep your neck clean until then.
