00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,280
I'll do it.

2
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,850
- What?
- I said I'll do it.

3
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,300
I said I'll join your study group.

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,870
Really?

5
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,820
What are you guys doing?

6
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,080
<i>Wait, Inspector...</i>

7
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,180
Assault and arson.

8
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,780
What's your name?

9
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,360
Pardon? Me?

10
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,040
Why are you here?

11
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,390
What if you get blamed for being with me?

12
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,330
Well...

13
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,730
the team leader of the study group is captured, so-

14
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,980
What?

15
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,170
What leader?

16
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,650
You're so easy.

17
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, here. I found them while cleaning the classroom.

18
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,250
Thank you.

19
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,730
Okay.

20
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,200
Well, then.

21
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,530
Well, I...

22
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,860
- What?
- What you did in the training room yesterday...

23
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,920
and in the classroom just now...

24
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,870
I want to thank you for it.

25
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,600
No need to thank me. We're friends.

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,750
I gave you jellies and vitamins and...

27
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,630
when you fell asleep in the library, I waited for you so you wouldn't be late for class.

28
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,790
But no need to thank me for those.

29
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,910
I didn't thank you for those things.

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,870
I told you to think about what you did, and you're laughing?

31
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,240
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,020
Hey, hey, hey.

33
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,740
Go, go. Go forward. Go.

34
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,980
Go.

35
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,520
There are problem students like him at every school.

36
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,890
Don't worry so much. We'll hold a campus violence committee quickly

37
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,990
and get him expelled.

38
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,940
- Expelled?
- Vice Principal.

39
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,300
A wrongdoing should be followed by a punishment.

40
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,890
But getting him expelled is a bit-

41
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,480
Be quiet.

42
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,710
Summon his parents and prepare for the campus violence committee.

43
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,400
Do you understand?

44
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,080
Let's check out the Training Building since we didn't get there earlier.

45
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,570
Isn't it the school that's actually at fault?

46
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,250
Ms. Lee Han Gyeong.

47
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,960
Did I hear you wrong just now?

48
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:01,230
This school cares more about one inspector than its 600 students.

49
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,070
Seriously. I can't believe this...

50
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,000
You're making me look like a terrible person.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,100
He's the one who's bad. Him.

52
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,820
He's like a thug who's violent in school.

53
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,150
He had no choice because he was bullied and assaulted first.

54
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,020
He used violence to stop the violence? Violence can't-

55
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,750
Violence can't be justified. I agree with you.

56
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,000
But as for what I have seen here for the last couple of days,

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm not so sure.

58
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,800
Can students...

59
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,470
even defend themselves without violence?

60
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,440
You haven't changed, Ms. Lee Han Gyeong.

61
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,380
You weren't the top scorer on the Teacher Certification Exam out of luck.

62
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,890
Top scorer?

63
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,170
Yes. I remember now.

64
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,590
The top scorer on the Teacher Certification Exam last year, Lee Han Gyeong.

65
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,970
But she didn't register for some reason, and the certification was canceled.

66
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,400
That's you, Ms. Lee, right?

67
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,980
<i>I'll become a school teacher.</i>

68
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,170
Someone who has a good influence on students.

69
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,970
That kind of a teacher.

70
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,550
So, how are you planning to fix this school's problem?

71
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,010
Even though she was the top scorer,

72
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,250
what could a rookie substitute teacher do-

73
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,880
A study group.

74
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,230
A study group?

75
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,970
Yes, a study group.

76
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,110
Forming a study group was his idea.

77
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,690
I'll work hard on creating it with him.

78
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,760
Inspector, let's stop this meaningless conversation and-

79
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,440
It's a good idea. A study group.

80
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,470
Inspector.

81
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,550
Vice Principal,

82
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,340
the student wants to study. Is that a problem?

83
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,690
I just noticed faulty fire alarms and cigarette butts on the floor...

By the way,

109
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,190
did the inspector really approve it?

110
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,600
Yes.

111

I'm curious.

120
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,440
Would you be able to say naive things like a study group

121
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,990
even after experiencing this school more?

122
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,670
Five students in two weeks?

123
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,720

Why? You don't think we could?

126
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,570
Well, you want us to find three more students who want to study, not just one.

127

Guys, there's a saying that goes...

128
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,350
What was it? The quote by Napoleon.

129
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,390
"My unhappiness today is the revenge of time once..."

130
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,650

don't you want to prove the Vice Principal wrong for not believing in us?

138
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,380
Yes, I do, but is it realistically-

139
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,930
We can do it.

Why do you buy so many pens?
