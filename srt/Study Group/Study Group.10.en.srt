00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,210
So will we, then.

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:24,690
You might get expelled, too.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,360
I'm okay.

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,960
We're okay, too, then.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,340
Right.

8
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,160
By the way,

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,050
the teacher who tried to

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,090
punish Pi Han Ul a year ago

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,870
was murdered the night before the meeting.

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,360
Pardon?

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,740
The police said it was a random killing,

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,450
but Yuseong kids secretly believe it was him.

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,560
What? Just to prevent the meeting?

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,490
That makes no sense.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,800
It's Pi Han Ul, but will he murder...

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,070
Because it would've gotten him expelled.

19
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,000
Yuseong isn't just a school to him.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,140
It's a kingdom he created.

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,950
But he gets kicked out of it?

22
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,520
Not only would it hurt his ego,

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,050
the succession plan at Yeonbaek

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,060
would be affected, too.

25
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,380
No one would fear him anymore, then.

26
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,560
He'd risk his life for it.

27
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,700
Anyway, he'll do anything to cancel the meeting.

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,040
What are we considering?

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,900
We just need to attack him first.

30
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,870
- I agree.
- No.

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,850
- Why not?
- What if we fail?

32
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,240
Why are you thinking about failing first?

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,660
Ms. Lee's safety is on the line.

34
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,740
We have to be absolutely careful.

35
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,120
No, but-

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,980
Se Hyeon is right.

37
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,020
We can't let her get hurt even a bit.

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,700
What do we do, then?

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,190
Until the meeting happens,

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,460
