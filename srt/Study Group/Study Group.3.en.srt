00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,140
Hold on. What is it, anyway?

185
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,210
[Lee Ji Wu]

186
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,470
Look at you, bastards.

187
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,100
Not the Disciplinary Committee room.

188
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,070
Why not?

189
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,140
Because it's the Disciplinary Committee room.

190
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,860
So, what about it?

191
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,440
Right.

192
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,040
The Disciplinary Committee room is a bit...

193
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,030
Right?

194
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,700
Why?

195
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:05,300
Because the Disciplinary Committee is a gang approved by the school.

196
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,240
A gang approved by the school?

197
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,970
<i>They're officially allowed to act like thugs</i>

198
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,110
<i>while controlling the bad kids.</i>

199
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,490
<i>That's why most kids don't even go near the Disciplinary Committee room.</i>

200
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,300
Gosh, bastards.

201
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,690
Are you that curious about this?

202
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,770
Do you want to watch it?

203
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,850
The thing is...

204
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,040
I do, but...

205
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,730
- Go ahead.
- Really?

206
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,610
Watch it yourselves, you bastards.

207
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,270
I'll upload it on GoTube.

208
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,350
GoTube? I thought you promised not to release it.

209
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,400
Why don't you pay back the money you borrowed from losers?

210
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,650
Why would I pay them back?

211
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,700
Right. Only losers keep promises.

212
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,050
And think about it, you bastard.

213
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,740
If Ji Wu's last family member goes to the juvenile hall,

214
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,120
she'd be so sad.

215
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,250
You'll attack her while she's vulnerable?

216
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,180
Her boyfriend would be the only one to rely on.

217
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,690
And I didn't even give him a loan with my money.

218
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,980
Whose is it, then?

219
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,000
It's his.

220
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,600
What do you mean by that?

221
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,570
You don't have to know.

222
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,160
Seriously, Han Ul is a genius.

223
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,860
Why do you ask me where Hyeon Wu is?

224
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,670
I heard you were close to him.

225
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,040
I'm not.

226
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,130
I'm not close to anyone.

227
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,920
I heard he borrowed money from Kim Gyu Jin and never paid him back.

228
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,910
- Maybe he ran away?
- He borrowed that money because of you, too.

229
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,580
Because of me?

230
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,660
Who says that?

231
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,450
Didn't he end up that way because he got into an accident

232
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,790
while running an errand for you?

233
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,330
What would I get by doing that?

234
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,650
If you tell him to,

235
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:54,540
he even breaks into his homeroom teacher's house, destroys things, and threatens me.

236
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,400
He became that desperate.

237
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,700
Han Ul,

238
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,250
you used him enough.

239
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,020
Let Hyeon Wu go now.

240
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,770
Is that all?

241
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,820
Is that the only reason you wanted to see me?

242
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,920
I heard you were starting a study group at a school like this.

243
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,660
I thought you'd be a very interesting person.

244
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,190
But you aren't.

245
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,330
Ms. Lee,

246
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,460
if Lee Hyeon Wu doesn't come to school,

247
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,570
just ignore it.

248
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,650
It's much easier to give up on the low lives.

249
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:56,110
Han Ul.

250
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,460
It's f***ing stupid that she's doing that for her brother.

251
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,070
She should give up on a piece of trash like him.

252
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,630
Some people might seem hopeless,

253
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,590
but that doesn't mean you can give up on them.

254
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,150
What's that?

255
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,530
What was that noise?

256
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,320
Shit, you scared me. What's this psycho doing?

257
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,530
Wow, were you hiding in there?

258
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,810
Oh, I see.

259
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,420
Lee Ji Wu told you to steal the USB drive, right?

260
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,800
That f***ing cunning thing used a man?

261
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,380
Wait...

262
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,700
by chance,

263
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,690
do you have a crush on her?

264
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,360
How dare you ambush like a coward?

265
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,270
Why does this loser keep getting in the way?

266
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,470
Did he do this to steal the USB drive?

267
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,890
You don't know how scary the disciplinary committee is.

268
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,190
How will you deal with the aftermath?

269
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,110
What the f***?

270
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,070
Sunbaenim!

271
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,150
Shit, he's in trouble. Three more went in.

272
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,470
My gosh.

273
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,390
This is no good. Let's fight.

274
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,740
- What?
- The two of us will fight.

275
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,400
The disciplinary committee comes in whenever there's a commotion.

276
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,880
We'll pretend to be fighting so Yun Ga Min gets to escape.

277
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,240
Oh, okay.

278
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,090
If I go there,

279
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,340
yell at me, saying, "Hey, you f***er."

280
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,980
What? Me?

281
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,780
Why? What's wrong?

282
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,830
Well, the thing is...

283
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,870
By chance, you've never cursed?

284
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,870
- No.
- Well...

285
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,920
but you should do that so it looks like we're fighting.

286
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,600
- Right.
- Choi Hee Won?

287
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,820
Okay, done. It's yours, bastard.

288
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,140
I already saved it on the computer. It was ready to be uploaded on GoTube.

289
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,510
Lee Hyeon Wu's life would be over after a click.

290
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,740
Lee Ji Wu will be doomed, too.

291
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,810
Don't!

292
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,430
[Uploading the video]

293
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,050
You f***ers went too far.

294
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,570
How embarrassing.

295
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,850
Well, the thing is-

296
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,490
I'm sorry, Ji Wu.

297
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,410
I wasn't trying to keep it a secret-

298
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,080
No, it's not that.

299
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,370
I should've f***ed them up sooner.

300
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,210
It's annoying that I put you guys through this.

301
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,020
It's nothing...

302
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,930
Ji Wu, are you going to the Disciplinary Committee room?

303
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,090
Watch closely.

304
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,490
I might get hurt later, but I can at least throw a punch.

305
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,200
But you shouldn't do that now, Ji Wu.

306
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,890
You're dead.

307
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,190
What?

308
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,090
Hey! You crazy bastard!

309
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,460
Why is he taking all that?

310
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,980
Why is it so noisy?

311
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,780
That bastard...

312
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,960
Hey, what's that?

313
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,380
I'll destroy it.

314
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,290
If this is destroyed, you'd no longer-

315
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,920
- What?
- Get the computer!

316
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:58,220
Did I need help from a loser like that?

317
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,680
Se Hyeon, the video is on there. The video.

318
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,630
You bastard! Wait right there.

319
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,710
Sons of bitches!

320
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,150
Se Hyeon, hurry! Take it with you now!

321
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,450
- You son of a bitch. You'd better not run.
- I don't know. I don't know.

322
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,290
You son of a bitch. I'll kill you.

323
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,170
You f***ing losers!

324
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,850
Kim Se Hyeon.

325
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,700
Where are you going?

326
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,770
It's too heavy.

327
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,960
Geez, seriously.

328
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,180
Son of a bitch!

329
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,970
Are you all f***ers high or something?

330
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,140
Hey, you f***er!

331
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,200
I'm so f***ing tired. You f***er.

332
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,970
You know I'm in the Disciplinary Committee, right?

333
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,400
Bring it here while I'm being nice, you f***er.

334
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,870
Why are you suddenly causing trouble together? You f***er.

335
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,520
Keep acting like a loser-

336
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,590
There are no pedestrians here.

337
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,510
You f***er.

338
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,010
I'll throw you, too, you son of a bitch!

339
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,780
Peekaboo, you f***er.

340
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,750
I finally understood what the four-eyed psycho meant.

341
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,430
I can kill you once that thing is destroyed.

342
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,400
Do you want to act cute, then, Gyu Jin?

343
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,390
You crazy bitch!

344
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:38,170
I'll kill you if you mess with us siblings again.

345
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,440
It doesn't mean you can give up on them?

346
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,120
I haven't met someone so interesting in a while.

347
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,140
You say that after what you went through?

348
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,390
I'll take it as a compliment.

349
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,530
It wasn't a compliment.

350
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,040
What is it, then?

351
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,150
A word of pity?

352
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,560
You'll be disappointed soon.

353
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,540
Follow me, you bastard.

354
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,230
It's gone.

355
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,900
Hee Won! That thing!

356
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,910
Huh? What's this?

357
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,680
It's that thing Gyu Jin is obsessed with.

358
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,020
Hey, loser, did something happen here?

359
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,350
No, the thing is...

360
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,860
I suppose you know nothing.

361
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,540
Gyu Jin would be thrilled if I brought this to him.

362
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,860
