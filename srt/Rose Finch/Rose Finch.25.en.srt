1
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,039
Commander Zhao doesn't want to see you.

2
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,520
Just tell me

3
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,120
just tell me.

4
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,880
Tell you?

5
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,360
Are you qualified?

6
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,440
Move.

7
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,120
Am I qualified?

8
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,800
You can't get in anyway.

9
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,410
Commander Zhao said

10
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,640
there

11
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,280
in there.

12
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,600
Shen Lian.

13
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,720
You are a villain.

14
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,800
Mr. Gao.

15
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,120
Don't blame me.

16
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,800
I'm just a messenger.

17
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,880
But

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,889
there's one thing I'm different from you.

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,200
I’m not as ambitious as you.

20
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,180
Commander Zhao refused to see me.

21
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,370
Commander Zhao has always been moody.

22
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,720
Shen Lian and Song Shi

23
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,090
always hurt each other when they're down.

24
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,079
If you want to leave,

25
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,880
I've checked.

26
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,020
Tomorrow morning,

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,170
there will be a cruise to Hong Kong.

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,160
It might be the best ending

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,560
might be the best ending.

30
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,480
End?

31
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,160
When is it your turn

32
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,760
to arrange an ending for me?

33
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,040
When?

34
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:47,760
Dad.

35
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,770
Why are you here?

36
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,680
Have you heard

37
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,120
You heard, right?

38
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,720
Yes.

39
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,440
I was framed.

40
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,780
Commander Zhao wants to kick me out of Shanghai.

41
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,280
Your father’s efforts

42
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,960
will be gone.

43
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,480
But I'm still trying.

44
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,519
for the last chance.

45
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,360
Your sister has gone to see Commander Zhao

46
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,600
with money.

47
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,320
I want you to go with me.

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,820
Commander Zhao has always liked you.

49
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,320
If you

50
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,920
and plead for him,

51
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,970
maybe the Gao family

52
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
can get through this.

53
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,040
I'm not going.

54
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,240
Moon.

55
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,480
What are you doing?

56
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,880
Get up.

57
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,600
Dad.

58
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,640
Yueyue.

59
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,360
Dad.

60
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,040
I beg you.

61
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,880
Dad.

62
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,920
The Gao family can't end like this.

63
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
Go upstairs.

64
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,580
Your sister is waiting for you upstairs.

65
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,760
I'm admiring you.

66
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,900
Where is my sister?

67
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,080
Are you here for your sister?

68
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,560
not to save your dad.

69
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,090
Commander is so nice to you.

70
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
He gave you so many gifts.

71
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,530
How could you do this to him?

72
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,290
What do you mean?

73
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,960
Your audition chance.

74
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,240
It was Commander Zhao

75
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,560
was arranged by Commander Zhao.

76
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,760
Ms. Gao must think

77
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,800
she's talented

78
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,560
to be the female lead.

79
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,520
Right?

80
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,040
So,

81
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,320
you really like my performance?

82
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,040
Of course.

83
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,120
In Shanghai,

84
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,000
without a backer,

85
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,960
without a backer?

86
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,080
Actually,

87
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,300
you can regard Commander Zhao

88
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,200
as your lover, Zhao Shuang.

89
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,960
You can play with him

90
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,160
you can play with Commander Zhao.

91
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,520
Dad.

92
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,500
Commander Zhao has always liked you.

93
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,920
If you

94
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
and plead for him,

95
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,690
maybe the Gao family

96
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,520
can get through this.

97
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,400
or leave,

98
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,480
or live or die.

99
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,420
From now on,

100
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,480
in my own hands.

101
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,890
My daughter’s death

102
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,090
has nothing to do with Commander Zhao.

103
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,360
If she wants to blame,

104
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,080
blame me, her father.

105
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,560
for being greedy.

106
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,320
and confused.

107
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,850
You still have a chance.

108
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,880
I still have a big task for you.

109
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,800
Mr. Go Su.

110
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,480
Spit out the money

111
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,180
double the amount you ate.

112
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,200
If you can't spit it out,

113
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,360
to pay for it.

114
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,920
Spit it out.

115
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,760
I will spit it out.

116
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,610
Thank you for not killing me, Commander Zhao.

117
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,080
Su Sheng,

118
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,320
I will make up for my mistake.

119
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,280
This is...

120
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,040
for Commander Zhao.

121
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,320
This is...

122
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,540
Dongling is out of territory.

123
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,370
Tzu-hsi's favorite thing.

124
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,800
I only have

125
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,640
the last one.

126
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,000
Be quiet.

127
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,320
It's Ms. Gowol.

128
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,080
Even Go Su's biological daughter died.

129
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,800
How long can we live?

130
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
I don't want to die. I want to go home.

131
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,410
Where are you going?

132
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,680
I can tell you clearly.

133
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,560
as long as you are not blind,

134
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,680
or deaf,

135
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,000
you can never leave here.

136
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,760
What a beautiful face.

137
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,690
If you don't behave,

138
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,080
I’ll stab you here.

139
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,560
Sun Mei,

140
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,170
Don’t you have nightmares?

141
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,160
A nightmare?

142
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,600
I am a nightmare.

143
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,880
What happened?

144
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,600
Dad, what happened?

145
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,120
She went home.

146
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,370
I want to talk to her.

147
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,300
She didn't listen.

148
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,320
Pull it.

149
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,960
I accidentally fell from the second floor.

150
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,540
Your sister loves beauty.

151
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,800
I want her to leave beautifully.

152
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,840
Do you

153
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,960
really that annoying?

154
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,480
That photo just now

155
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,800
was the last time I played the second young lady of the Gao family.

156
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,200
Dad.

157
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,000
I want to ask some priests

158
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,920
to perform a ritual for her.
