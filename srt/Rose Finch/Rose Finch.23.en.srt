1
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,520
You bastard!

2
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,280
Do you know what you're doing?

3
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,720
Then what are you doing?

4
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
You're suppressing your own child.

5
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,890
You give your power to an outsider.

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,920
If I speak now,

7
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,880
in your mind

8
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,520
every word.

9
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,370
The master standing in front of others

10
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,800
is a symbol.

11
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:37,800
Power

12
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,320
is always in the hands of the Gao men.

13
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,200
Understand?

14
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,200
In Shanghai,

15
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
in Shanghai.

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,520
You can’t be the superior.

17
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,050
Commander Zhao is so powerful.

18
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,320
We just need to hold this thigh

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,960
and treat him like a god,

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,680
like a god.

21
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,160
we can threaten and control

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,000
and control all the nobles in Shanghai.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That’s real power.

24
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,520
In comparison, Qingzhu Gang is nothing.

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,040
Son,

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,450
If you're a man from the Gao family,

27
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,320
you have to learn to weigh the pros and cons.

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,640
and hide in hiding.

29
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,940
instead of fighting for the position of master.

30
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,320
Understand?

31
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,600
Listen.

32
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,400
This piece of paper

33
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,410
is more valuable than gold.

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,120
You can make as much as it rises.

35
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,960
So you're making money

36
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
to make money for yourself.

37
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,970
Understand?

38
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,079
Go back to Phoenix Hall.

39
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,160
If anyone dares to say a word,

40
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
send her to hell tomorrow.

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,560
Everyone,

42
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,560
The current entertainment industry is influential.

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,280
Shanghai is the capital of Chinese entertainment.

44
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,960
I, Zhuque Clinic, take the advantage

45
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,880
and Shanghai Zhabei Chamber of Commerce

46
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,480
of Shanghai Zhabei Business Association

47
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,560
and entertainment industry

48
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,920
to launch

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,760
the unprecedented big world entertainment shares.

50
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,600
OK.

51
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,920
Now let's welcome the spokesperson of World Entertainment,

52
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,399
the famous movie star, Ms. Kozuki.

53
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,340
Are you satisfied now?

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,290
The headlines of all newspapers tomorrow

55
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,400
will be your big photo.

56
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,700
I earned them by working hard.

57
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,240
Mr. Gao.

58
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,600
If I do that,

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,320
Zhabei will be dead.

60
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,220
Zhabei Chamber of Commerce will also be doomed.

61
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,240
In the chaotic times of Republic of China,

62
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,480
in the chaotic times of Republic of China

63
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,680
in the end,

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,400
in the end.

65
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,480
When the wind blows, people scatter

66
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,880
Who else cares about it?

67
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,840
Zhabei Chamber of Commerce is over.

68
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,560
If you get it done,

69
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,040
the position of General Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai

70
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,440
belongs to you.

71
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,680
Or Chairman Tang,

72
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,000
want to go back?

73
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:40,960
Stop!

74
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,940
Under the order of Deputy Director Yang,

75
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,240
to remove Tang Zhenyun's position as Chief immediately.

76
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,480
Tang Zhenyun, your backer is down.

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,400
You're doomed too.

78
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,690
What do you mean?

79
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,440
Your uncle, Tang Bo Kui,

80
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,210
ran away with the money.

81
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Take him back to the police station.

82
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,120
Search him.

83
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,320
Who dares?

84
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,320
Tang Zhenyun!

85
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
The clue of your uncle Tang Bo Jian's withdrawal

86
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,920
might be hidden in you.

87
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,000
Search!

88
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,320
Tang Zhenyun!

89
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,560
They're forcing you to do it.

90
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,820
and frame you for assaulting the police.

91
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,200
Search.

92
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,960
Look at him.

93
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,370
He doesn't even wear pants.

94
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,520
What happened to you?

95
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,570
I was dismissed.

96
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,100
They said my uncle eloped with money.

97
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,320
What about the clothes?

98
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,280
They took it off.

99
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,010
You're bullying me. I'll go find them.

100
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,080
Enough.

101
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,260
The police station has no reason to explain.

102
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,040
Where's my brother?

103
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,440
He doesn't even give you a piece of clothes?

104
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,780
What are you doing?

105
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,560
Jigui gave it to me.

106
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,640
He is a good man.

107
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,170
Where are your clothes?

108
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,100
I was stripped.

109
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,960
Shen Lian said I had an advance of half a year's salary.

110
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,880
and asked me to spit it out.

111
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,080
If I take off all my clothes,

112
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,240
I can pay some interest.

113
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,400
I haven't vomited anything in my pocket.

114
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
No money, no life.

115
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,490
Don't make any trouble.

116
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
We have more important things to do.

117
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,920
I'll pay you back.

118
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,800
I can't pay you back.

119
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,720
No need.

120
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,880
Fine, I'm loyal to you.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,659
I won't pay your rent anymore.

122
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,409
Let's go.

123
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,760
Where are we going?

124
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,560
You two are naked.

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,320
Buy clothes

126
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,640
Buy underwear first

127
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,370
My underwear was stripped too.

128
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,840
These people are not qualified

129
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,200
to board our new ship.

130
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,640
Everyone here,

131
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,800
as long as you do the right thing,

132
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,720
you will have more money

133
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,760
and more power.

134
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,280
Mr. Gao.

135
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Where is Mr. Tang?

136
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,160
I know where my uncle put the key.

137
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,600
Jade.

138
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,040
and gold bars.

139
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,560
and run away with the money.

140
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,800
How could he run away with the money?

141
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,240
If I don't take Tzu-hsi's jade and gold bars,

142
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,600
such a valuable thing.

143
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,820
It's really a trap.

144
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
Where is my uncle now?

145
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,780
Is he alive or dead?

146
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,600
The ledger.

147
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,400
With such a valuable item,

148
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,540
with such precious stuff.

149
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,640
Take them all and go.

150
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,210
It's him! After him!

151
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,300
Are you coming?

152
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,480
Deputy Director Yang.

153
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,080
Do you know where my uncle is?

154
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,640
He is in danger.

155
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,600
The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,720
Missing?

157
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,770
No news from the newspaper.

158
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,490
Zhabei Chamber of Commerce is also quiet.

159
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,460
This is not normal.

160
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,140
At this moment,

161
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,000
Shen Lian and Qingzhu Gang

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,960
are copying Tang Bo Jian’s house.

163
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,280
Is the surname Gao of the police in Shanghai?

164
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,760
Didn't Cheung tell you?

165
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,320
the police colluded.

166
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,940
Deputy Director Yang.

167
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,820
You're also a police officer.

168
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,160
You dismissed us first.

169
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,050
and now you want us to get in.

170
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,720
What do you mean?

171
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,600
If you don't become a cop,

172
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,160
we can do more.

173
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,600
What can we do now?

174
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,720
Observe. Wait.

175
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,600
Wait for what?

176
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,720
Wait for the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce.

177
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,640
But I can't wait anymore.

178
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,760
If you can't wait, you'll be like your uncle.

179
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,440
like your uncle.

180
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,400
What did you find at Tang Bo Jian's house?

181
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
Nothing.

182
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,280
That's good.

183
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,560
It's safer for you two.

184
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,160
In Shanghai,

185
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,440
in Shanghai.

186
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,120
Secret.

187
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,800
and the dead.

188
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,520
Deputy Director Yang, you mean

189
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,600
Didn't you investigate a case

190
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,440
who found the secret?

191
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,960
Hongxiu.

192
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,480
Don’t think

193
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,840
you are the only police in Shanghai.

194
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,280
I know Hongxiu’s case has something else to do.

195
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,040
I found a chance

196
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,560
to catch a man of Gao Su.

197
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,680
I found out the truth of Hongxiu’s death.

198
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,050
Commander Zhao.

199
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,600
Let me do it.

200
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,160
It was the night

201
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,360
wiped Sun Mei’s shoes.

202
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,240
they found evidence that Hongxiu broke in.

203
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,480
When Gao Su found out

204
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,200
Hongxiu not only found the secret house,

205
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,560
but also

206
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,320
see him.

207
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,560
being a dog.

208
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,900
Think about it.

209
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,540
Can the high-level life let her live?

210
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,320
Deputy Director Yang.

211
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,600
What you found out

212
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,660
are basically similar to our previous investigation.

213
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,490
Hongxiu finally escaped Gao Su Sheng's hunt,

214
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,380
but was killed by Zhao Shuang.

215
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,600
I told you this

216
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,240
because I think

217
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,780
really want to investigate the case.

218
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,780
As for whether you trust me or not,

219
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,100
you two can decide.

220
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,840
My uncle may be locked in this house.

221
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,880
It won't open.

222
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Something is blocking the outside.

223
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,840
It must be Go-young.

224
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,480
She's afraid we'll barge in.

225
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,400
It's good.

226
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,280
It's the same as the description in iyue Pavilion's notebook.

227
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,120
Ha Young-ki.

228
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,340
I'm asking you to read the ledger.

229
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,800
What's there to read?

230
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,200
You have no idea how rare this is.

231
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,320
Brother, trust me.

232
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,440
I'm 90% sure.

233
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,960
This is from Tzu-hsi in Dongling.

234
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,360
Tzu-hsi loves jade all her life.

235
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,300
It must be her grave treasure.

236
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,840
Who is it?

237
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,220
Cheung Zhiqiu.

238
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,920
Aren’t you in prison?

239
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,370
Why did you come out?

240
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,780
Deputy Director Yang.

241
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,560
Good timing.

242
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,160
Help me check something.

243
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,020
This is a Yin and Yang account.

244
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,440
Yin and Yang accounts?

245
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,840
Who is Yin and who is Yang?

246
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,080
This is Zhabei Chamber of Commerce.

247
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
It’s easy to guess the other side.

248
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,520
The people ranked first.

249
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,690
Commander Zhao.

250
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,400
I can ask my colleagues from the economic edition

251
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,720
to check the data on it.

252
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,920
Okay.

253
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,160
Is there any progress

254
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,540
with my sister's case?

255
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't hide it from me.

256
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,720
My sister is dead.

257
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,000
What could be worse than this?

258
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,720
We saw a video.

259
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,360
Xia Mo.

260
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,380
He has the right to know

261
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,720
someone assaulted Zhang Yun Li.

262
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,280
and filmed the process of assault

263
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,240
into a video.

264
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,490
They're having fun in this way.

265
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,580
Your sister, Zhang Yun Li,

266
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,120
Liu Shuang Zhu and Zhou Yuqin

267
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,320
are their prey for fun.

268
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,760
Why?

269
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,290
When I saw the video,

270
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
and the murderer.

271
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,730
I can't do anything about them.

272
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,040
One by one.

273
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,200
So cheap that

274
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,000
In this world,

275
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,680
eat humans.

276
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,620
The world eats humans.

277
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,960
we'll try to change it.
