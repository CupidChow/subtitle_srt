1
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,520
Her spine has obviously transformed.

2
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,240
She has severe bone defection.

3
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,480
This is the same result

4
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,680
by taking opium for a long time.

5
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,400
Then it could be Jeong Mi-woon.

6
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,440
I found it.

7
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,720
Look.

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,240
I kneeled on the wet wooden floor in the attic.

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,260
My mother's hand is under the moonlight.

10
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,360
under the moonlight.

11
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,039
Yesterday,

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,759
I turned the house

13
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,520
into my mom.

14
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,280
Her legs

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,039
in the house.

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,960
Her hands are surrounding me.

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,720
I live in a house

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
It's like living in my mom's arms.

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,440
This story is quite strange.

20
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,280
Story?

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,479
It's a murder record, right?

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
I have a question.

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,080
From the way you stand,

24
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,840
This leg should be the right leg.

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,200
But now the left and right legs are upside down.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,080
Like shoes in reverse.

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,039
I received a scroll of Yin Manual before.

28
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,720
It does record

29
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,360
against the anti-feng shui formation.

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,540
All methods are the opposite.

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,560
Like you said,

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
What's the point?

33
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,600
Like a puppet.

34
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,880
He can't control himself and will be controlled forever.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,760
So,

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,760
he trapped his mother

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,680
in this house forever.

38
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,200
And this house

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,920
became his mother.

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,700
I really bought a premium haunted house.

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,320
The masks were found at the crime scene.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
Do you think

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,040
who killed Zheng Meiyun?

44
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,000
Probably.

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,810
we're one step closer to the murderer.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,120
New Publishing Press.

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,160
It's been a long time

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
for a long time.

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,200
Mr. Zhang.

50
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,400
Miss Gao.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,640
These are my two police friends.

52
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,080
They want to talk to you.

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,040
Editor Zhang, may I have a word with you?

54
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,680
Okay.

55
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,760
It's been a while since someone called me Editor Jang.

56
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,600
When the new publishing house closed five years ago,

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,730
I became a reporter.

58
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,060
Do you remember this book?

59
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,740
"The Legend of Zhi Weiqi".

60
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,240
I edited this book ten years ago.

61
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,000
I've always liked Shibi novels.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,520
This kind of book is selling well.

63
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,079
Everyone is curious.

64
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,120
There's a novel called "Mom".

65
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,280
The author is Ke Hua. Do you know him?

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,079
I almost knew him.

67
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,000
Almost?

68
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,880
In this book,

69
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,600
in this book.

70
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,680
I'm looking for Ke Hua to write a draft.

71
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
He left me an address

72
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
a mental hospital.

73
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,840
I thought he was a doctor there.

74
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,970
But I went to ask him.

75
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,680
there was no such person as Ke Hua.

76
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,079
No doctor writes novels.

77
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,720
There's a mental patient

78
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,960
is similar to

79
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,040
in this novel.

80
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,970
What's his name?

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,770
I don't know.

82
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,320
I heard he ran away.

83
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,650
Which mental hospital?

84
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,440
A Psychiatric Hospital.

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,810
Have you heard of "happiness brings sorrow"?

86
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,120
Yes.

87
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm happy.

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,040
Are you sad?

89
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
Don't think that you won.

90
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,120
Only one person

91
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
who wins or loses.

92
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,450
Secretary Song.

93
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,520
Next is the time

94
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,800
the beauty of modern times.

95
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,300
Swimming suit.

96
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,160
This is good.

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,000
This is what I said.

98
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,360
a new era female liberation.

99
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,240
That's right.

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,460
We have to find the doctor.

101
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

102
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,920
Today, among the 24 beauties on the stage,

103
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,240
of the 24 beauties on the stage.

104
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,520
They are going to wear swimsuits

105
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,600
to show you the beauty of women.

106
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,200
Okay.

107
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,400
This girl is nice.

108
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,920
I like her.

109
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,080
Really?

110
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,160
Okay.

111
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,480
Miss Ying.

112
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,720
You have such an idea.

113
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,000
You take my seat.

114
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,480
Young.

115
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,120
Trust me.

116
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,840
I'm definitely better than Lee Hye-min.

117
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,040
You even thought about who to replace.

118
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,500
Don’t forget you have to obey my rules

119
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,240
you have to follow my rules.

120
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,320
Do you think you can climb up the ladder

121
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,680
if I look at you?

122
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,900
What are you better than Lee Hye-min?

123
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,880
Lee Hye-min is smarter than you.

124
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,320
and better than you.

125
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
Someone as unscrupulous

126
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,840
and disobedient.

127
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,570
We don't know how they will die.

128
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,400
Young.

129
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,040
Please.

130
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,540
Everyone wants to go high.

131
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,760
As long as I can become the Movie Queen,

132
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
I'll do anything.

133
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,760
Ying.

134
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,080
I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of poverty.

135
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
I'll listen to you.

136
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,000
I will follow the rules.

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,200
Miss Ying, I beg you.

138
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,600
I beg you, Miss Ying.

139
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,540
You should let your father die in the casino.

140
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,040
Ying.

141
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
This is my life.

142
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,520
Dr. Fang,

143
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,640
We know that

144
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,840
you were a doctor at the Civil Psychiatric Hospital.

145
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,300
I'm here to ask you something about the past.

146
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,560
What is it?

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Are there many patients running away from the mental hospital?

148
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,720
Not really.

149
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,200
It's heavily guarded.

150
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,360
It's similar to the prison.

151
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,120
Almost.

152
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,330
That means there is.

153
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,240
This...

154
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,360
There is one.

155
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,290
What's his name?

156
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,060
How could I remember that?

157
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,080
But I have the patient's hospitalization record.

158
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,480
Please wait for me.

159
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,240
Here.

160
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Ward 109.

161
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Why are you so sensitive to the room?

162
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,800
One of the patients

163
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,880
one of the patients in this ward.

164
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,000
sex.

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,040
I'm most scared.

166
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,600
he was the one who ran away.

167
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,440
Joey Jung.

168
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,860
Ladies and gentlemen,

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,640
the exciting moment is coming.

170
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,400
Tonight, Phoenix Hall

171
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,240
will unveil

172
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,560
of the film selection.

173
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,640
Please count down with me.

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,960
Four.

175
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,160
Three.

176
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,400
Two.

177
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,600
Young.

178
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,850
Joo Yu Ha is missing.

179
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
The number doesn't match.

180
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,680
Twelve golden hairpin.

181
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,280
Why are there only 11 people?

182
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,400
Yeah.

183
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,860
Why is one missing?

184
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,160
Coming

185
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,640
Coming.

186
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,680
It's just an interlude.

187
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,080
The lady in white dress.

188
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,520
What is her name?

189
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,280
My daughter.

190
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,880
Gowol.

191
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,210
Joey Zheng is in the mental hospital room.

192
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,850
Tang Zhenyun

193
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,160
Zheng Zu Kang is the murderer.
