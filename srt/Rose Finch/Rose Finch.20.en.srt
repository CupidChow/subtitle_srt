1
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,240
This car has something in the trunk,

2
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,120
let's take the other one.

3
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,920
Alright,

4
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,640
let's go.

5
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,960
I never expected

6
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,440
such an accident would happen tonight.

7
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,380
Let's head back first and talk later.

8
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,080
Everyone hide the gold bars well,

9
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,080
and don't breathe a word about what happened tonight.

10
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,960
Why?

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,840
They killed Qian Yun.

12
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,000
Xu Jing is the one who killed Qian Yun.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
I didn't kill her.

14
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,480
Who would believe what you say

15
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,280
compared to Commander Zhao?

16
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,800
Su Qiuping is right.

17
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,840
Whatever they say

18
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,840
becomes the truth.

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,280
But I had no idea that sword was real!

20
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,960
What if...

21
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,000
what if the other girls ask

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,960
where Qian Yun has gone?

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,360
We'll stick to Commander Zhao and Mr. Gao's story -

24
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,620
there was an accident.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,600
I'm doing this for everyone's sake,

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,930
or we'll all end up dead.

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,600
Don't forget how Mr. Gao threatened us -

28
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,050
keep the gold and keep your mouth shut.

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,480
All of you stay put,

30
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,210
someone will come to take you to your accommodations later.

31
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,400
What's wrong?

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,560
Want to stay with them?

33
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,690
Shen Ruchun.

34
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,600
Where's Qian Yun?

35
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,720
While Qian Yun was filming,

36
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,320
an officer took a fancy to her

37
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
and took her away.

38
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,410
Have Cao Yin help you

39
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,400
dispose of the body tonight

40
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,690
without leaving any trace.

41
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,930
Don't worry.

42
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,400
Why isn't he back yet?

43
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,090
I can't wait any longer,

44
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,760
I'll go to Zhuque Hall to get some news.

45
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,560
I'll come too.

46
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,600
You stay here.

47
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
In case Xia Mo returns

48
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,360
and doesn't see us,

49
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,490
I'm afraid he might do something rash.

50
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,000
You're finally back. You scared me to death.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
Quick, tell us

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,800
what happened?

53
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Gao Ying saved me.

54
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,450
Something's wrong.

55
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,940
The car is taking detours.

56
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,240
It must be to prevent passengers

57
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,080
from knowing the mansion's location.

58
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,000
I suspect that mansion

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,920
is at the center of this whole case.

60
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,840
Those girls from before

61
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,240
must have all been there.

62
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,780
So where exactly is it?

63
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,540
We still need Gao Ying's help.

64
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,520
Father.

65
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,460
Since I was little,

66
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,130
when you say one,

67
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,640
I never say two.

68
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
I'll do whatever you ask of me.

69
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,920
I've made Zhuque Hall

70
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,340
the most popular dance hall in Shanghai.

71
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,440
I've made the girls at Zhuque Hall

72
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,400
the most dazzling in the city.

73
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,560
But Father,

74
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,050
I can't understand now.

75
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,160
Please explain to me,

76
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,960
why you so casually

77
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,040
let those girls die?

78
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,000
Compassion is a boning knife.

79
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,920
In Commander Zhao's eyes,

80
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,600
they are merely ants.

81
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,180
Ants are meant to be trampled underfoot.

82
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
These girls,

83
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,960
from the moment they entered Zhuque Hall,

84
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,760
their fate was already sealed.

85
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,240
They are all pawns.

86
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
Those girls

87
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,360
are your pawns.

88
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,840
You and Gao Fei

89
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,600
are my pawns.

90
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,720
I, Tang Boju, Song Shi

91
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,560
are Commander Zhao's pawns.

92
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,800
We are all pawns.

93
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,600
Your father all these years

94
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,200
has endured the unendurable,

95
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
all for the sake of

96
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,730
climbing to that position.

97
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,170
To be the one moving the pieces,

98
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,960
to be someone who can decide others' fates.

99
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
Don't forget,

100
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,000
that magnificent sign outside

101
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,760
was watered with human blood.

102
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,800
Drive.

103
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,840
Turn left.

104
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,120
Turn right.

105
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,800
Ying,

106
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,000
there's an intersection ahead.

107
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,120
Turn left.

108
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,400
Turn left.

109
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,240
Turn left.

110
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,080
Turn right.

111
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,880
Ying.

112
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,170
The car is going in circles.

113
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,280
I know,

114
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,080
turn left.

115
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,400
Turn right.

116
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,290
Sister Ying, is this the place?

117
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,680
That house is very secluded.

118
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,720
Seems they've gone to great lengths

119
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,740
to keep that house hidden.

120
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,010
Let's head back.

121
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,200
Sister Ying.

122
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,400
What is it?

123
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,240
I came to thank you

124
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,280
for saving my brother again.

125
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,880
Come to our place,

126
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,340
I'll make you some snacks.

127
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,080
You, Xia Yingqi, are famous for never doing anything without profit.

128
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,560
I can't afford your snacks.

129
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,090
Others can't afford it, but you can't either?

130
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I've been practicing for a long time.

131
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,400
Get in the car.

132
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,040
Okay.

133
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,320
You can go back first.

134
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,160
Thank you, Hu.

135
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
Ying, try this.

136
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,120
Just say what you want to say.

137
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,480
I know you sent Ying Qi to find me.

138
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,360
Two grown men being so shy,

139
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,010
having to send a girl to do your job.

140
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,200
That sack last night,

141
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,000
it contained a woman, didn't it?

142
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,650
What are you getting at?

143
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
I saw everything.

144
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,120
It was too light to carry,

145
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,520
couldn't have been a man.

146
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,930
Let me give you some advice.

147
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,520
Whatever's happening in that house,

148
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,050
you'd better stay out of it.

149
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,160
I have my own way of handling things,

150
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,760
so don't make trouble for me.

151
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,890
Well, I'm sorry,

152
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,640
but we're definitely getting involved.

153
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,760
Those girls in the ghost sculptures,

154
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,480
they must have all died in that house.

155
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,600
If that's the case,

156
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,980
your Tang family is also implicated.

157
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,440
I saw your uncle in that house yesterday,

158
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,000
Tang Boju.

159
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,480
If your uncle really has done something wrong,

160
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,600
would you turn him in for the sake of justice?

161
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,280
Yes.

162
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,040
But don't worry,

163
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,920
if you ever make a mistake,

164
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,600
I'll kill you myself.

165
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,810
Your uncle is even involved in the film industry.

166
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,240
The Zhabei Chamber of Commerce has always focused on traditional industries.

167
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,840
Well...

168
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,680
Wait here for me.

169
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,400
Miss Sun,

170
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,280
could I have your autograph?

171
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,040
Thank you.

172
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,120
I noticed earlier

173
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,840
that on her left arm,

174
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,560
there's a scar identical to Zhang Yunli's.
