1
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,560
Qian'er told me

2
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,690
to be careful of Wen Yu Ting.

3
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,920
She died because of me.

4
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,280
At that time,

5
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,760
I thought I would die.

6
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,520
and passed out.

7
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,480
I woke up in this room.

8
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,840
As for the rest,

9
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,360
I know nothing.

10
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,560
This year, the Republic of Education Department

11
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,120
to set up fingerprint science.

12
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,479
From now on, every country will know

13
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,400
that

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,160
since she was born.

15
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,960
Fingerprint.

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,800
I extracted two blood prints

17
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,460
on Kong Qian'er's left cheek.

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,000
That wasn't Wen Yu Ting's fingerprint.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,200
If you left it,

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,600
that means you're lying.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,060
You're still awake after Kong Qian'er died.

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,080
Qian Er.

23
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,360
That's only half of the story.

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,820
What about the other half?

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,800
I...

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,240
I don't know.

27
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,840
I... I saw nothing.

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,120
I saw...

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
What did you see?

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,930
Left screen, take him away.

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,130
Who's faster, you or me?

32
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,610
Turn left and pull over.

33
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,520
Crazy woman.

34
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Last night,

35
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,440
I sent someone

36
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,840
from the police station.

37
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,920
I took care of my arm.

38
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,720
To be honest,

39
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,600
In this situation,

40
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,280
it's hard for you to live.

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,660
But at least I can do one thing.

42
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,360
so that you and Kong Qian Er

43
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,720
with Kong Qian Er.

44
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,320
Ying.

45
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,880
I thank you on behalf of Qian.

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,660
If you really want to thank me,

47
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,690
finish what you haven't finished.

48
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,240
What did you see?

49
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,000
Young.

50
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,280
I can't tell you.

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,960
I saw it.

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,100
Many people will die if I tell you.

53
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,440
Young.

54
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,400
I can't hurt you.

55
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,170
Why did many people die?

56
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,600
What did you see?

57
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,280
What did you see?

58
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Ying, Gao Fei brought someone here.

59
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,080
Gao Ying's car is still outside.

60
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,810
She can’t escape with Hongxiu.

61
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,000
Search.

62
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,520
No one is here.

63
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,880
No one.

64
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,080
No one.

65
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,340
Where's Go-young?

66
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,120
He left.

67
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,280
Hongxiu.

68
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,890
You and I are the only ones left.

69
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,800
We share the same bed.

70
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,080
What are you hiding from me?

71
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,560
I've done so much for you.

72
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,520
Can't you see?

73
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,120
For me?

74
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,200
If I hadn't

75
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,200
to kill Wen Yu Ting in time,

76
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,400
Now you're his lovebirds.

77
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,159
I also asked the corpse-salvage to buy a female body.

78
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,720
and asked you to use Wen Yu Ting's autopsy mechanism

79
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,050
by Wen Yu Ting's corpse.

80
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,440
What am I doing all this for?

81
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,800
You did it for the secret I saw.

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,260
What's the difference

83
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,800
Wen Yuting?

84
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,850
Let me tell you what's the difference.

85
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,040
I'm more ruthless than him.

86
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:57,800
Believe it or not,

87
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,330
I'll kill you more miserable than that bitch!

88
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,320
What did you see?

89
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,640
My dad forced me to kill you.

90
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,940
Say something.

91
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,920
Hongxiu.

92
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,840
I’ll chop you

93
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,240
with your best friend.

94
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,280
Okay, chop it.

95
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,370
Chop it into pieces.

96
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,720
I don't want the girl who betrayed me anyway.

97
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,380
You do it. I don't need to do it.

98
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,200
Do it.

99
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,610
My hand still hurts.

100
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,440
Because I haven't got what I want to know yet.

101
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,540
I don’t want to.

102
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,840
Master Fei.

103
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,200
Miss Ying.

104
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,200
Mr. Gao ordered me

105
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,040
to take Hongxiu back.

106
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,600
Sir.

107
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,720
This body is not Hongxiu.

108
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,760
You told me a ghost story

109
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,320
in the autopsy room?

110
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,920
We saw

111
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,320
the real Hongxiu was taken away by Gao Ying.

112
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,610
Detective Tang.

113
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,360
Investigating cases in Shanghai

114
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,240
is not just about the truth.

115
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,680
Like this body.

116
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,800
Like this body.

117
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,039
Who is she?

118
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,320
who she is.

119
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,520
It’s not up to Hongxiu.

120
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,980
Who is the boss?

121
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,039
Go-young.

122
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,240
By the way,

123
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,880
it's up to you.

124
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,720
Ms. Gao said the body is Hongxiu,

125
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,000
then she is Hongxiu.

126
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,850
But you can’t change the truth.

127
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,480
You should pay attention to your attitude.

128
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,880
Although your uncle is the chairman of Zhabei Chamber of Commerce,

129
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
I’m your boss

130
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,600
I’m your boss.

131
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,680
Hongxiu has a deadly secret.

132
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,120
Yes.

133
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
A deadly secret.

134
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,480
Fu Ying.

135
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,920
It's so dark.

136
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,570
The darker it is,

137
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,160
the darker it is.

138
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,600
Listen.

139
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,180
They're calling for justice.

140
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,680
Look straight.

141
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,170
Lower your chin.

142
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,200
Okay.

143
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,330
Make a natural face.

144
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,520
Mr. Gao said

145
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,440
the photos should be beautiful.

146
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,360
Smile.

147
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,080
Yes. Okay.

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,260
Miss Gao, I'm leaving.

149
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,700
You want to kill me,

150
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,660
and you want me to live.

151
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,960
Why?

152
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,040
I want to know why too.

153
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,480
What did you see?

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,260
Is it related to my dad?

155
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,000
Ying.

156
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,360
Help me.

157
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,280
Then tell me what you know.

158
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,240
I told you.

159
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,680
I can't tell you.

160
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,000
I will...

161
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,400
get you into trouble.

162
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,050
Hongxiu, I’m not afraid of you.

163
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,520
You have to tell me what you know.

164
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,580
How can I help you if you don't tell me?

165
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,040
Hongxiu.

166
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,360
Remember,

167
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,080
if you kneel and beg for life,

168
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,080
you will die faster.

169
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,400
Live desperately.
