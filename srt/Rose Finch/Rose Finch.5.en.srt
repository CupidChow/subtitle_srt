1
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,960
This movie is really good.

2
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,080
Look at the screen.

3
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,200
is always a light fan.

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,880
Embroidered Lotus.

5
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,880
Come on.

6
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,440
Come, Chairman Tang.

7
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,460
Deputy Director Yang.

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,170
Detective Shen.

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,920
Thank you for the invitation, Mr. Gao.

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,480
I'm honoured.

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,000
Thank you.

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,560
Mr. Gao, you're welcome.

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,080
What do we police do?

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,210
To ensure the safety of the citizens of Shanghai.

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,200
and the safety of Zhuque Hall.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,080
It’s our duty.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,960
Mr. Gao,

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,600
The Chamber of Commerce has a lot to say.

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,560
I promise.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,920
From now on,

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,160
Newspaper media

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,680
I won't mention Number 25 in Hye'an anymore.

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,400
Thank you.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,440
After all,

25
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,320
it's all my family's fault.

26
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,920
It's complicated

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
a trivial matter.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,600
Take care of

29
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Take care of it.

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,759
Come on, let's drink.

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's go.

32
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,800
Go to hell!

33
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,100
It's better than being punished.

34
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,440
Now it's your turn.

35
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,120
Mr. Gao,

36
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,440
Please do me a favor.

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Don't say that, Mr. Tang.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,440
I had no choice.

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,760
Your nephew hurt Qingzhu Gang today.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,640
several people today.

41
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,800
I was self-defense.

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,440
Look.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,720
The problem is you don't know what's good for you.

44
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,040
On behalf of Chairman Tang,

45
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,880
for Chairman Tang.

46
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,240
Let them soak in cold water.

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,800
and sober up.

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,920
For young people,

49
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,040
for young people.

50
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,840
Mr. Gao is right.

51
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,680
You're good-for-nothing.

52
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,520
That's right.

53
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,320
Thank you for your generosity.

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,640
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

55
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
That's right.

56
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
Let's drink.

57
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,290
Why don't you let my brother go?

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,040
Can you open the door?

59
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,560
Awesome.

60
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,060
I'll give you a chance.

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
I'll count to five.

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,560
You drive.

63
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,399
Two.

64
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,880
Isn't it five?

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,400
The potential of human

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,080
at the critical moment.

67
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,840
Young lady, you're amazing.

68
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,880
Who taught you how to unlock it?

69
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,500
There used to be a locksmith next to my pawnshop.

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,360
who taught his son to unlock the door every day.

71
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,840
His son is too stupid to learn.

72
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,560
I got it.

73
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,120
I pointed a gun at you

74
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,450
I didn't see you scared.

75
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,880
Aren't you afraid of death?

76
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,560
Yes.

77
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,040
But I think

78
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
you won't kill me.

79
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,120
Why?

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,880
If you really want to kill me,

81
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,120
why did you pick me up?

82
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,200
Young man,

83
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,360
I want to tell you

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,320
some cases

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,560
can't be solved by you.

86
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,000
Understand?

87
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,040
Yes.

88
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,260
We all understand.

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,360
Yes.

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,450
Detective Shen.

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,400
Mr. Gao.

92
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,480
How are Detective Tang and Dr. Xia

93
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,290
are capable of handling cases?

94
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,440
They

95
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,080
are brave and resourceful.

96
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,160
They cooperate well.

97
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,080
Great.

98
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,840
I'll give you a chance.

99
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,200
The one who made Hongxiu into a puppet

100
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,920
Help me find him.

101
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,120
and bring him to me.

102
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,440
I want a chance

103
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,920
to become famous.

104
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,140
I'll give you one more chance.

105
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,640
That's right.

106
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,480
Remember,

107
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,960
working for Mr. Gao

108
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
is to work for the Shanghai Police Station.

109
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,920
No.

110
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,680
It's the police who serve the people of Shanghai.

111
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,020
The atmosphere seems a little tense.

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,280
Then I'll tell you

113
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,920
to you.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,120
Phoenix Hall

115
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,600
will hold

116
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,840
a grand movie queen selection.

117
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,290
I want to use this beauty selection

118
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,120
to start the vanguard of Republic Fashion.

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,200
Girl, Kunling.

120
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,440
Student, dancer.

121
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,720
treat everyone equally.

122
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,640
No restraint.

123
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,360
Let's choose 12 gold pins

124
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,640
in Shanghai.

125
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,080
and then choose

126
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,159
from this hairpin.

127
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,720
I, Phoenix Hall,

128
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,320
will invest a huge investment

129
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,720
to create a legendary masterpiece.

130
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,720
Okay.

131
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,000
Mr. Gao,

132
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,600
Do you want to invest in movies

133
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,000
or investors?

134
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,120
I want to invest in movies

135
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,640
and investors.

136
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,320
Human beauty is rare.

137
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,700
Making movies can make a lot of money.

138
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,160
It's the most worthy investment.

139
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,090
Mr. Gao. Mr. Gao.

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,640
Mr. Gao.

141
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,240
OK.

142
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,440
Let me introduce.

143
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
His name is Zhao Shuang.

144
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,180
The future star director.

145
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,480
He will be in charge of

146
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,400
will be filmed by him.

147
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,280
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

148
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,280
Mr. Gao, don't worry.

149
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,280
I won't let Mr. Gao

150
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,960
and everyone here.

151
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,280
Let's look forward to this beauty pageant.

152
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
and make Shanghai famous.

153
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,080
Success!

154
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,280
Get in.

155
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,159
Wait for me.

156
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,240
Get in.

157
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,920
Uncle.

158
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,140
I'll go with my friend.

159
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Thank you, uncle.

160
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,600
I know you hit me

161
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,160
to save me.

162
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,840
In the future,

163
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,360
when you do things.

164
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,400
If you can't solve anything,

165
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,260
just come to me.

166
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,650
Is he really your uncle?

167
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,440
Kiss.

168
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,380
Do you think you don't have to be punished

169
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,320
to find a scapegoat?

170
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,600
Dad.

171
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,240
I was wrong.

172
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,560
What did I do wrong?

173
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,520
You asked me to kill Hongxiu.

174
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,080
I didn’t do it.

175
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,120
I was going to do it,

176
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,760
But I saw Wen Yu Ting torturing her.

177
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,000
I like Hongxiu.

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
for a moment.

179
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
You killed Wen Yuting

180
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
and helped Hongxiu return her soul.

181
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,040
because I like Hongxiu.

182
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,800
Yes.

183
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,610
Is your brother telling the truth?

184
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,970
Did you burn the body at the police station

185
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,880
to cover up for him?

186
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,800
No.

187
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,560
I’m doing this for Phoenix Hall.

188
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,280
I’m afraid the involvement

189
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
will harm the interests of Zhuque Hall.

190
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,560
So I thought

191
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,280
to prove Hongxiu's death.

192
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,080
Alright.

193
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,040
Let's call it a day.

194
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,680
The movie queen selection

195
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,960
the beauty selection

196
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
together.

197
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,400
Why are you suddenly holding a movie queen selection?

198
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,000
The incident at the 25th in Hye'an-ri

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,440
[has caused a stir.]

200
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,800
Although Tang Bo Jian and Yang Zezhi

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,440
can suppress the public,

202
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,040
But at this moment,

203
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,880
we need a shocking news.

204
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,160
to divert the attention of those people.

205
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,440
Dad.

206
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,000
Why did you

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,320
Why did you let those two useless police do it?

208
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,000
Aren’t our people better?

209
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,480
Useless police.

210
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,040
Your trick

211
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
your trick.

212
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,840
It's more fair

213
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,960
It looks more fair.

214
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,000
Use it on time.

215
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,700
That's the best solution.

216
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,080
Go-young.

217
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,420
Keep an eye on them.

218
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
Don't worry, dad.

219
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,480
Did the Gao family kill Hongxiu?

220
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,360
No.

221
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,920
Whether it's a corpse mask or a crime scene,

222
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,200
are not like gangs.

223
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,740
It'll be easier and direct for gangs to kill.

224
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,600
I suddenly feel that

225
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,760
Miss Gao is not that bad.

226
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,160
It's not bad that she shot your brother.

227
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,200
He's not dead either.

228
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,880
Yes.

229
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,640
Which side are you on?

230
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,760
Look at his angry face.

231
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,200
I remember my childhood.

232
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,680
Did you let me kick you into a dung pit?

233
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,280
I've never been in a dung pit.

234
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,400
It can't be.

235
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,600
What I did when I was young

236
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,880
I didn't grow up much.

237
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,120
Take your time.

238
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,360
If I think of it,

239
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,820
Are we childhood friends?

240
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,720
Yes.

241
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,680
You?

242
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,920
Does your sister like me?

243
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,760
If you really want to,

244
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,360
think about what to do now.

245
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
The current situation is when we investigate the case,

246
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,880
in a sack

247
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,210
into the Huangpu River.

248
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,320
You're right.

249
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,880
If your uncle

250
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,720
the chairman of Zhabei Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai,

251
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,920
We've sinned into Huangpu River today.

252
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,530
I'm different from you.

253
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,520
I'm just a little forensic doctor with no background.

254
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,680
I have no power or power.

255
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,010
It's too easy for the Gao family to kill me.

256
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,720
If you really like my sister,

257
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,000
if I disappear one day,

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,060
protect her for me.

259
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,760
Like what?

260
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,960
She gave you half a year's salary in advance.

261
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,490
You suddenly disappeared.

262
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,780
I won't lose anything.

263
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,680
Hongxiu has many mysteries.

264
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,760
What did she see in the beginning?

265
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,400
Why did you ask her to return her soul?

266
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
Why did you make her a puppet?

267
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,640
As long as I'm still alive,

268
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,480
I will find out the cause

269
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,290
and put an end to her grievance.

270
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,800
Okay, I'll go with you.

271
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,120
Let's play along.

272
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,640
Since Gao Su

273
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,680
Didn't we agree to investigate the case together?

274
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,800
Let's sleep together.

275
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Go home.

276
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,840
Investigate the suspect first.

277
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,570
I found some clues from the bag.

278
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,360
These two men were jealous

279
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,890
because they were jealous.

280
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,840
They all said they would deal with Hongxiu.

281
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,640
And

282
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,120
wearing bracelets.

283
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,800
Hongxiu.

284
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,410
I don’t know him.

285
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,280
I’ve never been

286
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,580
I’ve never been there.

287
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,480
I didn’t say Hongxiu is a girl from Phoenix Hall.

288
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,560
Tell me.

289
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,520
Where did Hongxiu come from?

290
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Where did the Phoenix come from?

291
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,120
Tell me.

292
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,080
It's not him.

293
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,450
He can't pull the rickshaw.

294
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,560
How did he die?

295
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,000
He was attacked by his enemy.

296
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,090
I stayed in the hospital for a week.

297
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
I spent a lot of money for nothing.

298
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,880
I'm so unlucky.

299
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,280
Pong.

300
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,120
It's been a week.

301
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,960
There's no time to commit the crime.

302
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,020
What are you doing?

303
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
He doesn't mean anything.

304
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,290
I'm used to autopsy.

305
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,440
Miss Gao.

306
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
The seat is wrong.

307
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,540
Let me ask about the progress of the case.

308
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,640
It's only been one night. There's no progress.

309
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,320
So I found a helper for you.

310
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,080
No need.

311
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,720
Not even me.

312
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,720
Why did you get my sister involved?

313
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,640
You're good.

314
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,480
we can identify whether the mask is real or not.

315
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,140
How do you know about the mask?

316
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,220
Ha Young-ki, she used you.

317
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,280
If you give me ten silver dollars a day,

318
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,880
I'm willing to be used by you.

319
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,560
Stop pretending.

320
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,760
You really need me.

321
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,840
Corpse mask.

322
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,080
It's so sinister.

323
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,120
in Shanghai.

324
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,520
It's a black market.

325
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,720
Why is it so dark here?

326
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,120
Tell me.

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,960
Did you bring Ha Young-ki in

328
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,560
to stop Ha Young-ki?

329
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,050
If you can't find the murderer,

330
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,520
you'll all die.

331
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,680
You and Tang Zhenyun will be fine.

332
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,880
But now you have your sister Xia Yingqi.

333
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,160
Work hard, Dr. Ha.

334
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,730
What would you like?

335
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,080
Pressing tongue balls, buying money, Jiuqiao Stock.

336
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,140
We all have it here.

337
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,960
Do you have a corpse mask?

338
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,640
Come in.

339
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,500
Please come in.

340
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,840
I don't have a corpse mask.

341
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,720
But there is a treasure related to it.

342
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,290
The Buddhist Scripture...

343
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Good for you.

344
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,810
The Buddhist scripture

345
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,600
It's called the past blanket.

346
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,320
What does it have to do with the mask?

347
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,360
Corpse mask curses the dead

348
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,040
And the past life

349
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,880
who specializes in enchantment.

350
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,140
and exorcise the sins.

351
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,570
and ascend to paradise.

352
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,260
Look at this color.

353
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,600
Yellow.

354
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,240
It's specially for the emperor.

355
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,600
To be honest,

356
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,560
this piece was wrapped up by Master dry Long.

357
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,280
Dongling?

358
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,700
You stole the tomb?

359
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
My subordinate is ignorant.

360
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,120
Go on.

361
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,960
Although the government is covering for him,

362
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,040
everyone knows

363
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,720
Sun Dianying stole Dongling.

364
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm not afraid you'll find out.

365
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,200
I found

366
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,800
from Qingzhu Gang.

367
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,440
They have

368
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,360
have all kinds of treasures.

369
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,770
Qingzhu Gang can’t be found by you.

370
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,680
Their eldest daughter, Gao Ying.

371
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,520
She's my distant cousin.

372
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,000
Is Go-young old?

373
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,040
He's a senior.

374
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,920
It's your shop too.

375
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,520
No.

376
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,599
You can't touch a fake one, liar.

377
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,319
The emperor uses top-class silk craftsmanship.

378
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,400
Every inch of thread is gold.

379
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,160
I can weave anything like that.

380
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,760
Go to Phoenix Hall when you have time.

381
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,119
I’ll show you something nice.

382
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,880
Sure.

383
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,680
No, stay away from her.

384
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,880
Stay away from me.

385
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,160
Why is it so cold here?

386
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,480
I feel comfortable.

387
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,640
Like a morgue, right?

388
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
You know him well.

389
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,480
Corpse mask.
