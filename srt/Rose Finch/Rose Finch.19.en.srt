1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,400
It's pretty clear now.

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,720
The body and evidence are gone.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,160
We have a live witness.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,840
So,

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,880
the person who hurt Shim Yeo-chun

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,080
could be the murderer

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,320
and those ghost figures.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,860
I'll leave Ha Young-ki to you.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,840
Don't worry.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,800
When a girl stalks a girl,

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,120
will never be suspected.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,479
You let her take the risk.

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,010
It's none of your business.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,840
Miss Shen, I'm your fan.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,640
Miss Shen, please sign here.

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,560
Miss Shen, you are really beautiful

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,820
and your handwriting.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,960
Thank you.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,640
So pretty.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,960
I like you so much.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,920
She's so pretty.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,080
If I had been treated fairly

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,000
in the beauty selection,

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,160
I wonder if you can still

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,020
wear the cinnamon of Movie Queen.

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,320
Lady Ruan.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,280
If I can choose again,

28
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm willing to give you

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,759
for you.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,920
I need you to give me

31
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,160
What I want

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,920
what I want.

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
You don't know yet, do you?

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
I'll be one step ahead of you

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,200
to be the leading role in the first voice movie in Shanghai.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,840
When the video is released,

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,640
we'll see who's the real Movie Queen.

38
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:51,920
This studio

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,560
is too small.

40
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,079
Shim Yeo-chun

41
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,520
at the same time.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,880
and blindfolded.

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,920
So...

44
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,290
If you want to know where she is,

45
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,840
just follow the flying car.

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,880
Go-young.

47
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,920
Commander Zhao wants you to go somewhere with me tonight.

48
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,480
Where?

49
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,370
You'll know when you get there.

50
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,440
Okay.

51
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,840
Here we are.

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,160
Remember.

53
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,530
When you get inside,

54
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
when you get inside.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,130
and act cautiously.

56
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,040
Actually, I don't want you

57
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,800
to let you know this place.

58
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,380
Because people who have been here

59
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,840
either join

60
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,720
or die.

61
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,810
Secretary Song.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,760
Miss Gao.

63
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,540
Commander Zhao has been waiting for you.

64
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,370
Commander Zhao.

65
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,090
Commander Zhao.

66
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,920
Go-young.

67
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,360
Your father always surprises me.

68
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,840
that your father raised.

69
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,690
It's really different.

70
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,280
Right, Su Sheng?

71
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,730
Thank you, Commander Zhao.

72
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,610
Secretary Song.

73
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,600
Commander.

74
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,920
What did he arrange for you?

75
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,280
for you.

76
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,840
Miss Gao,

77
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,720
How did you promote the movie selection?

78
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Record your beauty with the camera.

79
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,680
Okay.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,840
I'll give you a chance

81
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,480
to record your beauty with the camera.

82
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,120
Commander Zhao wants to make a movie for you.

83
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,680
You can choose

84
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,420
the roles you want to play.

85
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,880
You chose

86
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,090
the female lead.

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,530
Then you choose the script.

88
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,450
The ballroom

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,200
is the place you are most familiar with.

90
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,960
There are difficult customers inside.

91
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,360
and unexpected rewards.

92
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,730
The secret realm

93
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,620
is the place of adventure.

94
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,720
As the saying goes,

95
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,240
Since there is a risk,

96
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,880
there will be wealth.

97
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,880
I choose Secret Land.

98
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,080
Then this script

99
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,880
only needs four actors who act with her.

100
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,840
Who would like to?

101
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,440
Okay.

102
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,090
The rest, follow me.

103
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,640
Let’s start.

104
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,640
Only he knows

105
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,610
that Commander Zhao is making.

106
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
From now on,

107
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,440
from now on.

108
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,000
All your performances today

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,280
will be recorded.

110
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,680
You...

111
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,040
You're an explorer.

112
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,600
I found a treasure in the secret realm.

113
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,120
The four of you

114
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,480
are the treasure guards.

115
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,240
One minute.

116
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,520
It wasn't...

117
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,760
by these tool swords.

118
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,160
Win!

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,920
The winner

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,320
the gold will be yours.

121
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,600
Okay.

122
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,200
Girls,

123
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
Commander Zhao has said something.

124
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,640
Your wealth will come tonight.

125
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,200
You'll be their referee.

126
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,120
Start.

127
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,020
Guardians die.

128
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,320
Wait.

129
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,360
We can divide the gold equally.

130
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,600
The gold is mine.

131
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,760
Why should I give them to you?

132
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,540
The guard died.

133
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,800
Stay back!

134
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,840
Don't move.

135
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,680
It's dangerous here.

136
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,420
And it's heavily guarded.

137
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,170
Once you open the trunk,

138
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,730
you will be discovered.

139
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,360
But I have to find out

140
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,400
where we are now.

141
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,600
All the truth may be here.

142
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,320
Knowing the truth is not enough.

143
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,240
you have to expose the truth.

144
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,840
So,

145
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,360
you have to live.

146
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,400
I want to avenge

147
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,860
for those innocent girls,

148
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,120
you have to be prepared to sacrifice your life.

149
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,960
Fu Ying.

150
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,210
You know I'm not afraid.

151
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,040
I know.

152
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,840
I'll be with you.

153
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,800
Do you feel it?

154
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,240
The secret of Zhuque Hall

155
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,290
and the secrets of those ghost statues

156
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,370
the secret of those ghost statues.

157
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,900
Commander.

158
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,100
The real sword.

159
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,290
I was negligent.

160
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,640
Comfort her family, understand?

161
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,720
You...

162
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,120
You win.

163
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,640
Take it.

164
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,720
Girls.

165
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,760
It was an accident.

166
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,760
It was just an accident.

167
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,280
Let's split the gold.

168
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,040
But...

169
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,600
keep your mouth shut.

170
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
Don't tell anyone

171
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,600
what happened today.

172
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,640
What a coincidence.

173
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,440
Exactly.

174
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,740
Commander Zhao, don't worry.

175
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,050
I'll ask the twelve golden hairpin

176
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,680
to stay here for now.

177
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,080
I announce

178
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,020
she's doing closed training and shooting outside.

179
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,320
Why is she so unlucky

180
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,080
so unlucky?

181
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,010
Commander Zhao.

182
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,200
Unpredictable plot

183
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,280
is a good movie.

184
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,880
Miss Gao,

185
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,080
I think you are

186
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,720
a man who is as good as men.

187
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,640
I admire your decisions.

188
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,360
I want you

189
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,500
to do something for me.

190
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,980
Commander Zhao, what can I do for you?

191
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,050
Tomorrow night.

192
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,170
Tomorrow night.

193
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,530
tomorrow night.

194
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,120
Okay.

195
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,180
Say something.

196
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,840
Young.
