1
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,520
No.

2
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,780
You are quite capable.

3
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,880
How dare you rob them?

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,280
Why do you like

5
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,880
to go against our Gao family?

6
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,920
What about you, Miss Gao?

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,720
You swapped the body.

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,520
Are you also going against the Gao family?

9
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,720
When I was at the broken temple,

10
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,080
I found the skull

11
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,280
was clearly damaged.

12
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,039
But the five bodies

13
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,759
are intact.

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,240
You know so much.

15
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,520
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

16
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm afraid.

17
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,650
But I knew you wouldn't do that.

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,040
Only I can make the body speak.

19
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,000
You left the body

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,440
to hear

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,960
what they can say.

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,500
You hid the body in the shabby temple.

23
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,300
It's dark under the light.

24
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,200
Good.

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,130
The most dangerous place is the safest place.

26
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,920
Move this box.

27
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,400
I found it before.

28
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,040
on her left arm

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,880
on her left arm.

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,360
I found it too.

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,020
That's why I brought her here.

32
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,170
Miss Gao, you can stand over there.

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,760
Why?

34
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,530
You stand behind me.

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,920
I'm afraid you'll do it again.

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Go over there.

37
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
I need an autopsy.

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,680
He has a lot of bruises.

39
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,480
Her head and hand are fractured.

40
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,760
She was abused by violence.

41
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,920
She was like Zhang Yun Li.

42
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,120
she has never been sexually assaulted.

43
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,640
Miss Gao, look.

44
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,120
No, one for each of us.

45
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,980
We're even now.

46
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,000
Be careful.

47
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,280
Be careful.

48
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,760
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Miss Gao, you'll be fine after a nap.

50
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,850
What's going on?

51
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,960
What took you so long?

52
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,130
Let's go and have a look.

53
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,040
Young.

54
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,240
Young

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,760
Young

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,800
Young

57
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,320
Young.

58
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,120
Are you okay?

59
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,040
Where's Xia Mo?

60
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,400
I didn't see him. He was with you.

61
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,400
I burned the body in front of my dad.

62
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,520
Liu Shuang-joo can't be caught by others.

63
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,400
Xia Mo can't go far with the body alone.

64
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,320
Go get him.

65
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,080
Go.

66
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,280
Deputy Director Yang.

67
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,080
I found the bodies of five girls.

68
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,600
Four were destroyed.

69
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,340
This is the last evidence.

70
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,480
Take over.

71
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,200
Wait.

72
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,940
Deputy Director Yang.

73
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,780
Don't let these girls be wronged.

74
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,520
You can only trust me now.

75
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,040
Do you think

76
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,480
you can escape this time?

77
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,720
I know.

78
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,280
I can't escape.

79
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,940
Then tell me the truth.

80
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,640
Who sent you to the hospital to kill Zhang Yun Li?

81
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,680
I... I told you the truth.

82
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,170
can you survive?

83
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,240
If you're not the mastermind,

84
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,000
I can help you.

85
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,650
I'm the mastermind.

86
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,760
I killed Zhang Yun Li.

87
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,120
No one ordered her.

88
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,520
I want to kill her.

89
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,320
Don't think I can trust you

90
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,640
I can trust you.

91
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,280
I have evidence.

92
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,000
to prove my motive.

93
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,440
Go to my house.

94
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,520
There are a few newspapers in the drawer.

95
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,200
It's the news report written by Cheung.

96
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,300
If you investigate it carefully,

97
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,840
you can find out my motive.

98
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,920
The article written by Zhang Zhiqiu offended me.

99
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,320
I lost a lot of money.

100
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,640
Money is the most important thing to me.

101
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,400
So,

102
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,480
I’ll kill Zhang Zhiqiu’s favorite

103
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,370
and kill his sister.

104
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,360
What's wrong?

105
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,640
I caught the murderer who killed Zhang Yun Li in the hospital.

106
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,920
I thought I found it out myself.

107
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,800
I didn't expect

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,400
He came to me himself.

109
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,039
You mean

110
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,320
A trap?

111
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,799
Witness, physical evidence, motive for murder.

112
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,360
The Gao family is ready.

113
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,370
Yang scheme.

114
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,760
When all the evidence

115
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,160
point to the wrong direction,

116
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,220
you can only get one expected result.

117
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,080
How about you?

118
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,760
I found new evidence.

119
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,680
Where is it?

120
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,280
Yes.

121
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,200
Hello, Deputy Director Yang.

122
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,960
I'm Xia Mo.

123
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,920
Where is the body I gave you tonight?

124
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,520
Tonight? What body?

125
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,800
Yang.

126
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,080
It's within the deadline.

127
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,600
We've found out the case of Zhang Yun Li's murder.

128
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,370
The truth is as follows.

129
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,200
Zhang Zhiqiu believes that his sister Zhang Yun Li

130
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,040
was murdered for another reason.

131
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,160
[causing a riot]

132
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,280
to attract public attention.

133
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,840
to clear Zhang Yun Li's name.

134
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,720
During the time,

135
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
he even slandered

136
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,640
Tang Zhenyun who was in charge of this case

137
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,760
and Xia Mo.

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
to mislead the public again.

139
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,360
Fortunately, everyone in the police force

140
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,080
through lies.

141
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,880
to restore the truth of the case.

142
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,560
Chief Tang Zhenyun

143
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,920
He even caught

144
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,080
who killed Jang Yun-ri.

145
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,600
[and found out the murderer's motive.]

146
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,220
[and drew a full full stop]

147
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,560
for this case.

148
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,760
Okay.

149
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,600
Guys.

150
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,280
Thank you.

151
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,160
There’s a cocktail party

152
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,490
at Zhuque Hall tonight.

153
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,960
Come with us.

154
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,160
Thank Mr. Gao.

155
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,480
Thank you, Mr. Gao. Let's go.

156
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,930
Deputy Director Yang, please.

157
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,440
You give him face.

158
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,080
He can enter Phoenix Hall openly.

159
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,000
Why not?

160
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,660
Why did Deputy Director Yang help me?

161
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,920
Why did you leave this body?

162
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,880
Your sisters died mysteriously.

163
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,720
You want to know why?

164
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,840
I want to know too.

165
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,060
Then bury it like this.

166
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,680
In front of the absolute power,

167
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,760
in front of the absolute power?

168
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,960
Who can be afraid?

169
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,200
Tang Zhen Yun Xia Mo is an idealist.

170
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,440
Miss Gao.

171
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,560
You should know that.

172
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,850
The Movie Queen is back.

173
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,520
I knew it.

174
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,400
The higher-ups love happy endings.

175
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,080
Yang Zezhi completed the mission.

176
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,400
The superior pretended to be peaceful.

177
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,160
The Gao family escaped unscathed.

178
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,620
Who cares about the truth?

179
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,280
Who chose the Movie Queen?

180
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Of course.

181
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,660
A high-ranking official.

182
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,210
Choose the one you like.

183
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,200
Just like

184
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,930
Liu Shuang Zhu and Zhang Yun Li.

185
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,720
Young is looking for you.

186
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,050
Where have you been these days?

187
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,680
Job.

188
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,160
With whom?

189
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,370
Commander Zhao.

190
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,640
What did he do to you?

191
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,940
Say something.

192
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,320
Young.

193
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,540
What can you do for me if I tell you?

194
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,760
My Empress.

195
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,800
Did I hurt you?

196
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,440
Are you okay?

197
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,920
What are you doing? Let me show you.

198
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,400
Are you okay?

199
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,000
Let go!
