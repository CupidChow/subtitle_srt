1
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,720
Move.

2
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,480
Move!

3
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,560
You are going to wipe out the Red Moon House.

4
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,760
How can I let

5
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,080
This procuress...

6
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,720
When I was looking for food,

7
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,840
you were still eating milk.

8
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,650
Are you okay?

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,720
I'm fine.

10
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,800
Watch him.

11
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,780
How are you?

12
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,050
I can hold on.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
Stay in the room.

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,930
Don't go out.

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,370
Tiger, come with me.

16
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,960
I'll teach you a lesson!

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,640
Madam!

18
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,250
How did my uncle die?

19
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,660
Say something.

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,600
It was Gao Su's life.

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,840
Zhabei Chamber of Commerce is over.

22
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,600
If you get this done,

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,690
the position of General Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai will be yours.

24
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,680
Or Chairman Tang,

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,960
want to go back?

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,400
Mr. Gao.

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,480
I did what you did before.

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,120
I'll save the money

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,600
I'll keep whatever you say.

30
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,240
I didn't say anything.

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,530
Are you threatening me?

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,200
How dare I?

33
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,640
Mr. Gao.

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,040
I beg you to let me go.

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
Let those merchants in Zhabei go.

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,760
The boat has sailed.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,720
If you want to get off,

38
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,480
you have to dive.

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,120
and drown.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,880
He died.

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
There's no turning back.

42
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,920
Whether we live or die,

43
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,320
depends on the next step.

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,970
You and Tang Zhenyun

45
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,520
follow the original plan.

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,380
We'll work together from inside.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,600
Yingqi.

48
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,170
Come with me.

49
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,640
and wait outside the mansion.

50
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,500
Send the message when necessary.

51
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:41,840
Som's mom.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,280
These two are important witnesses.

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,040
Please keep an eye on them.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,640
Also,

55
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,880
the left screen is injured.

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,130
Please take care of her.

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,520
Miss Gao.

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,040
I bet

59
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,560
I bet on you.

60
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Thank you, Mommy.

61
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,960
Ying.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,720
Did I ask you to speak?

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,720
What's wrong?

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,459
Where are we going?

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,920
Miss Gao.

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,839
Your 12 gold pins

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,320
have become phoenix.

68
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,410
Commander Zhao decided

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,200
send them to America.

70
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,000
America?

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
This is Commander Zhao's decision.

72
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,159
Miss Gao.

73
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,880
Are you okay with it?

74
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,320
Let's go.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,640
Go.

76
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,159
The movie queen selection held by Phoenix Hall

77
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
is a new age of women liberation.

78
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,000
Especially for all girls

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,440
who pursue beauty,

80
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,000
your faces will be recorded by the screen.

81
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,920
You will always be young.

82
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,720
and will be remembered

83
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,380
by this beautiful era.

84
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,490
What are you doing here?

85
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,980
Just taking a walk.

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,960
It's quiet here.

87
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Where is Miss Gao?

88
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
I haven't seen her since she came in.

89
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,400
I saw her just now.

90
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
She went that way.

91
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
Is this broken?

92
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,200
Probably.

93
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,570
I don't know.

94
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,600
There's another urgent matter.

95
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,000
The 12 gold hairpin was sent away.

96
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,680
They said they were going to the US.

97
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,559
I suspect they're trying to silence us.

98
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,690
Get someone to contact Deputy Director Yang to save him.

99
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,240
Okay.

100
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,200
30,000.

101
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,040
Are we really going to the dock?

102
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,400
The order given by Mr. Gao

103
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,730
to send them to the boat.

104
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,160
Do you really want to dig the boat on the sea?

105
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,920
and let these ten beautiful women

106
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,850
to feed the fish.

107
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,040
They are all the beauties selected.

108
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
Where can we meet usually?

109
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,280
Now,

110
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,440
they are the fish on our board.

111
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,080
Apart from making us happy,

112
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,120
but also valuable goods.

113
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,320
When you have enough fun,

114
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,280
find some human traffickers who specialize in Nanyang

115
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,340
to bid for auction.

116
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,100
Think about it.

117
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,320
How much is the 12 gold hairpin

118
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,400
worth?

119
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,520
As police officers,

120
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,440
we can't make that much in our life.

121
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,040
No.

122
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,440
What if Mr. Gao finds out?

123
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,400
With that money,

124
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
who would still be a cop here?

125
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,720
Go wherever you want.

126
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,640
The Gao Su students can't find us

127
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,440
I know a place to hide people.

128
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,330
Turn around.

129
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,090
Turn around.

130
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,400
Okay.

131
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,240
We found the boat Gao Su Sheng arranged.

132
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,120
But those girls

133
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,450
didn't come to the dock.

134
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,570
Someone must have hidden them.

135
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,440
Keep looking.

136
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,480
Yes.

137
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,720
Get off.

138
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Get off one by one.

139
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,880
Down.

140
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,440
Run!

141
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,920
Run.

142
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,600
Come here.

143
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,440
Hurry up.

144
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,290
Where are you going?

145
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,380
Do you all want to run away?

146
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,840
I'll kill the chicken for the monkey.

147
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,700
Don't kill her.

148
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,250
We'll listen to you.

149
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,040
Let's see

150
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,650
how you can be obedient.

151
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,560
Is there any trouble

152
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,970
in the big world entertainment stock?

153
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,880
It's a legitimate deal. I admit defeat.

154
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,920
What will happen?

155
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,860
Is there any sound?

156
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
What did you hear?

157
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,000
That's it.

158
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
In the future,

159
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,840
I still need the support of the special agents.

160
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,920
Commander Zhao, you’re welcome.

161
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,880
We are all working for the Party.

162
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,800
Goodbye.

163
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,000
It's confirmed.

164
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,780
Tomorrow morning,

165
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,040
a press conference will be held tomorrow morning.

166
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,840
At that time,

167
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,180
you have to speak on the stage.

168
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,960
Me?

169
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,800
Of course.

170
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,740
Commander Zhao thinks highly of you.

171
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,320
Now you’re the leader of Qingzhu Gang.

172
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,720
It’s your turn.

173
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,760
I see.

174
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,770
I won't let you down.

175
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
I didn't see Yingqi when I came out.

176
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,680
She must have gone after the 12 gold pins.

177
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,360
If we find her,

178
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,760
you can find 12 gold pins.

179
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,840
Okay, I got it.

180
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,000
You stay here and find them.

181
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,680
Okay.

182
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,480
Guys.

183
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,580
I'm always nice to you, right?

184
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,170
I'm here to take you to make some money.

185
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,760
We

186
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,320
we need to calm down at critical times.

187
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:43,880
Got it.

188
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,120
As I said,

189
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,840
Brothers play first.

190
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,040
We'll sell after we're done.

191
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,800
One by one.

192
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,050
No fighting.

193
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,120
No internal conflict.

194
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,050
Be disciplined.

195
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,840
Got it?

196
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:53,730
Okay.

197
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,450
Tall.

198
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,360
Look at their faces.

199
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,840
So white.

200
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:58,960
The legs

201
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,400
Long and long.

202
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,600
How much gold bumps can it worth?

203
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,320
Guys.

204
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,280
This is the last chance.

205
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,370
Understand?

206
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,360
Yes.

207
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,200
I'll go first.

208
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,250
These rich people are really good at playing.

209
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,500
They're all better-looking.

210
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,800
You just said

211
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,620
you're the most obedient.

212
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
It's slippery.

213
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,100
Don't touch me.

214
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,380
Don't touch me!

215
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,480
Shut up!

216
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,280
Let go of me!

217
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,660
Brother, there's noise outside.

218
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,320
Let's go.

219
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,180
Is there anything?

220
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,970
Nothing. There's no ghost.

221
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,280
It's just a false alarm.

222
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,080
No one is here.

223
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,680
No.

224
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,080
We have to send them away tomorrow.
