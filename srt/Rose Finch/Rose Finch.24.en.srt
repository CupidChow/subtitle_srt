1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,760
You've been away from your sisters for so long.

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,080
It's time to catch up.

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,400
Tonight,

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,440
stay with them tonight.

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,340
Shim Yeo-chun.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,640
You really think you're the Empress?

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,600
Are you torturing us?

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,260
makes you feel accomplished?

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,520
She slapped you before.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,760
Go, call her back.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,080
If you don't,

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,680
I'll do it for you.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,400
Enough.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,980
Shim Yeo-chun.

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,920
I don't believe you did it willingly.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,580
to be Commander Zhao's woman.

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,440
We can let bygones be bygones.

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,800
But you have to tell us one thing.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,970
How do we get out of here?

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,640
Get out of here.

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,720
Be good.

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,840
You can live if you behave.

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,140
Shim Yeo-chun.

24
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,800
Shen Ruchun.

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,759
Say something.

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,330
You must know how to get out of here.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,120
right?

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,880
Tell us

29
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,000
how to get out of here.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,000
Say something.

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,800
Say it.

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,520
Say something!

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,960
Say it!

34
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,840
Tell me.

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,120
Turn into a dog.

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,200
A dog like Sun Mei.

37
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,040
and Commander Zhao’s dog,

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,440
we can get out of here.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,440
You're the dog.

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,360
We are not.

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,520
Okay.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,800
Hye-min Lee, why are you helping her?

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,440
Of course.

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,300
They are four golden flowers.

45
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Listen up.

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,240
Now,

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,040
only 11

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,520
who want to leave this place.

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,970
Those bastards outside

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,730
want us to fight each other.

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,620
They like to watch this kind of scene.

52
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,940
Have you forgotten how Qian Yun died?

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,920
Only when we let go of our grudges

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,920
can we take our lives back to our hands.

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,400
We can only twist it into a rope

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,720
to survive.

57
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,460
If you want to live,

58
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,440
let go of your petty thoughts.

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,700
Shim Yeo-chun.

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,970
What others think doesn't matter.

61
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,080
Don't think of yourself as a dog.

62
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,040
We're not dogs.

63
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,000
We will all leave here alive.

64
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,640
Will we?

65
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,440
There's no definition between winning or losing.

66
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,000
It's all courage and luck.

67
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,880
Let's have a bet.

68
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,800
So pretty, superstar.

69
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080
If it weren't for the promotional photos,

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,920
you would have forgotten about this family.

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,680
Do you

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,320
that much?

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,840
It's not that.

74
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
It's strange.

75
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
You guys...

76
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
I'm getting more and more confused.

77
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,920
Mr. Gao.

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,440
The machine is ready.

79
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,240
Ladies,

80
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,140
We can take a family photo now.

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,159
Look here.

82
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,800
Miss Gao, I'm leaving.

83
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,000
Yue.

84
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,280
Listen to me.

85
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,610
Leave Shanghai.

86
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,780
Go back to America.

87
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,200
If you don't want to go back to America,

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,960
go to Europe.

89
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,680
Why?

90
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,820
Because this is not a peaceful place.

91
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,640
You have no idea how many eyes

92
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,920
behind a beautiful woman.

93
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
I'm not afraid.

94
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,360
Aren't you afraid because

95
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,160
you know your surname is Gao.

96
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,240
Don't you want freedom?

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,120
Don't you want to be yourself?

98
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,040
Then leave. Leave Shanghai.

99
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,730
You always think I care too much about you.

100
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,440
Now you don't even have the courage

101
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,640
to fly out of this cage.

102
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,500
What about you?

103
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,060
Why did you become the leader?

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,800
Can't you smell the blood on that seat?

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,400
When I sit here,

106
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,840
if I sit here.

107
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,240
But power won't change.

108
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,480
It will.

109
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,920
The one who sits there

110
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,080
Sister.

111
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm afraid

112
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,260
you'll become like me one day.

113
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,400
Don't worry.

114
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,680
I'm not him.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,640
Sister.

116
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,640
I've been like you since I was young.

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,720
As long as I believe in one thing,

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
I will do it.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,080
That photo just now

120
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,320
was the last time I played the second young lady of the Gao family.

121
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,440
My movie contract

122
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,520
I earned it by working hard.

123
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,290
Whether I leave or stay,

124
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,200
or live or die.

125
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,120
From now on,

126
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,200
in my own hands.

127
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,440
Moon.

128
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,120
Ying.

129
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,880
There are girls who register every day.

130
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,140
to enter Phoenix Hall.

131
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,280
This is

132
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,840
to open the cash cabinet in Shanghai.

133
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Within a month,

134
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
I want this big world entertainment stock

135
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,080
20 times more.

136
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,080
Okay.

137
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,400
World Entertainment has issued stocks.

138
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,530
World Entertainment has been issued.

139
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,480
Let me see.

140
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,320
Zhabei Chamber of Commerce has invested in the big world.

141
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,960
This is a good thing.

142
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
It's a good thing.

143
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,160
Look at the newspaper.

144
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,960
Zhang Di, the new chairman of Zhabei Chamber of Commerce,

145
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
I hereby announce

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
the Chamber of Commerce will purchase

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,160
World Entertainment Stock.

148
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,000
Follow the banker. We'll make a lot of money.

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,480
That's right. Let's go and buy some.

150
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Hurry up.

151
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,240
Go.

152
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,700
You won't be able to buy it if you're late.

153
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,760
Observe. Wait.

154
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,720
Wait for what?

155
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Wait for the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce to make a move.

156
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,360
Turn left.

157
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,040
Go-young, according to his memory,

158
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,800
and the distance of the secret tunnel.

159
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,680
Plus, it's heavily guarded here.

160
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,800
the house should be here.

161
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,120
My uncle

162
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
locked up in that house.

163
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,160
A flying car.

164
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,160
Let's catch up first.

165
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,410
Hurry up.

166
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,720
Hurry up, load the rock.

167
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,250
Hurry up.

168
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,600
Hurry up.

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,400
Hurry.

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,680
Tie it up.

171
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,720
Young master, it's done.

172
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,050
Let's go.

173
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,000
I ended up like this

174
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,600
for your life.

175
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
In this chaotic Shanghai,

176
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,680
in Shanghai?

177
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,000
Uncle, I can help you.

178
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,320
Tell me everything he has done.

179
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,480
I have my own way, okay?

180
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
You overestimate yourself.

181
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,840
It's such a big Shanghai.

182
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
in Shanghai?

183
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,280
If your surname is not Tang,

184
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,440
you would have died

185
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,060
I would have died long ago.

186
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,450
Actually, I remembered my childhood a long time ago.

187
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,920
When I was a kid,

188
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,570
my dad sent me to a martial club.

189
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,240
But all my brothers were led astray by me.

190
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,360
You?

191
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
to report me?

192
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,680
I was so angry.

193
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,120
I brought a group of people

194
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,980
and beat you up in the shower room.

195
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,020
I still remember the birthmark on your butt.

196
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,040
I heard that

197
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,120
your parents passed away

198
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,480
because your parents passed away.

199
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,560
At that time, I thought

200
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,240
a child

201
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
is so righteous.

202
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,800
There's nothing he can't handle in this world.

203
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,480
See? I'm old when I'm three.

204
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
I'm still like this.

205
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,240
You too.

206
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,200
Those animals

207
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,080
can't escape.

208
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,460
You and Tang Zhenyun came to my Red Moon House so many times.

209
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,080
You spent money to buy information.

210
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,540
Money to make phone calls.

211
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
is to play with girls without money.

212
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,400
Are you guys men?

213
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,880
Hello?

214
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,720
[I've checked it.] Okay.

215
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,080
The data in the ledger

216
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,640
is the Yin and Yang accounts of Gao Su Sheng and Zhabei Chamber of Commerce.

217
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,160
Gao Su Sheng has been sucking the blood of Zhabei Chamber of Commerce

218
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,000
He has also deposited two accounts.

219
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,960
One is his personal account.

220
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,360
And the other one?

221
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,000
I've been staring at you for a long time.

222
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,970
Reporter Zhang.

223
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,370
What Yin and Yang accounts?

224
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,360
Don’t chase.

225
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,040
The military pay donated by Zhabei Chamber of Commerce

226
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,280
Gao Su Sheng embezzled 30%.

227
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,560
Okay.

228
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,240
Okay.

229
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,210
You're faking the accounts under my nose.

230
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
What do you think?

231
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,680
It's done.

232
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,880
It's done.

233
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,680
This ledger is the evidence

234
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,740
who embezzled Commander Zhao's pay.

235
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,000
Gao Su Sheng is a dog of Commander Zhao.

236
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,240
What do dogs hate the most?

237
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,780
Bite its owner.

238
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,780
If we publish it in the newspaper,

239
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,200
I'm afraid Gao Su Sheng has other ways.

240
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,260
Block the news and reverse the truth.

241
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,640
We've suffered this.

242
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,560
So we need to find a way

243
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,690
to send this ledger to Commander Zhao.

244
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,690
to kill someone.

245
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,040
Hello, I've checked.

246
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,640
The data on the ledger

247
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,040
is the Yin and Yang accounts of Gao Su Sheng and Zhabei Chamber of Commerce.

248
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,900
Gao Su Sheng has been sucking the blood of Zhabei Chamber of Commerce.

249
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,640
I'm Gao Su student

250
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,440
I'm looking for Chairman Zhang.

251
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,440
Mr. Gao.

252
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,730
Mr. Song is here.

253
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,210
Secretary Song.

254
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,319
Is something urgent?

255
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,380
You didn't even call before you came.

256
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,359
From now on,

257
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,520
call you again.

258
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,329
Secretary Song.

259
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,720
Don't make jokes like that.

260
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,119
You don't believe me?

261
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,440
Then you can

262
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,920
call Zhabei Chamber of Commerce now.

263
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
and the police station.

264
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,119
Yongli Private Bank.

265
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,440
See who else

266
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
will answer your call again.

267
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
Commander Zhao asked me to tell you

268
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,000
you can take

269
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,700
you can take them all back.

270
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,610
Commander doesn’t need it.

271
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,760
to send the documents

272
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,240
and accounts related to Zhabei Chamber of Commerce.

273
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,440
Take them all away.

274
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,120
Yes.

275
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,600
Cao Yin.

276
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,810
Take it away.

277
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,440
Mr. Gao.

278
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,360
Did they know about the Chamber of Commerce?

279
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,240
I think Tang Bo Kui left evidence.

280
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,200
He didn't die wrongly.

281
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,040
What do you need me to do next?

282
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,600
Let me think.
