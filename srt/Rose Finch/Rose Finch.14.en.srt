1
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,800
How did it go?

2
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,600
I found Yoo Shuang-joo's place.

3
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,000
but it was rented out.

4
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,039
There's no clue.

5
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,039
Since

6
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,120
no clue now,

7
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,900
Let's stop for a while.

8
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,400
Zhou Yuqin, Liu Shuang Zhu.

9
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,960
Did Zhao Zheng kill her?

10
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,560
Why did Zhang Yun Li die?

11
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,090
Why are you stopping without finding out?

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,200
The movie selection final is coming.

13
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,400
All politics in Shanghai will be there.

14
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,640
The media is also paying special attention.

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,240
We can’t make too much noise.

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
You mean for the interests of Phoenix Hall,

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,600
You don’t want to investigate the murder case?

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,930
I don't care about the girl you care about.

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,720
Yingqi.

20
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,720
Do you care about your brother's lives?

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,479
Then be a good sister.

22
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Take care of them.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,840
But Young,

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,740
In my brother's heart, good sister doesn't care about him.

25
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,480
I thought this temporary alliance is very loose.

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,960
I didn't expect it to end so quickly.

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,360
Then don't listen to her.

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,880
Make it more noisy.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,130
Detective Shen Lian is wise and brave.

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,360
Under the order of the director,

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,240
A reward. A reward.

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,160
Sir.

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,040
You were so cool just now.

34
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:42,480
The medal that Deputy Director Yang personally wore for you.

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,440
Mr. Yang didn't put it on me.

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,320
It's Mr. Gao.

37
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,840
Understand?

38
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,200
Detective Shen is really awesome.

39
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,880
You must be kidding.

40
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,000
In front of you,

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,560
in front of you.

42
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
Let me make it clear.

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,120
Zhuque Hall Film Queen choosing Beauty Night.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,640
There are many guests.

45
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,840
If something goes wrong with the security,

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
by then,

47
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,980
no one can take care of you.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,370
I don't understand.

49
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,200
Yes.

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,079
Yes.

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,920
Liu Erjiao.

52
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,720
Take some men to guard the intersection.

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,040
No pedestrians can pass.

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,560
OK.

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,880
Jigui, go to

56
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,640

57
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Vice Mayor Zhang.

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,720
Mr. Gao.

59
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,040
Welcome.

60
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,600

Good evening, special agents.

Understood.

103
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,860
Let's choose Shen Ruchun.

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,370
Commander Zhao.

105
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,120
Do you know the person who drank with me?

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,200

00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,200
Sit.

114
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,520
Shen Ruchun.

115
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,880
Good evening, everyone.

116
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,160
Welcome

117
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,160
Tonight is a special day.

118
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,760
Because we are going to witness

119
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,920

120
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,600

Protect Commander.

123
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,700
Why did you turn off the light?

124
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,730
What's going on?

125
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,530
Secretary Song.

126
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,520
The interlude.

127
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,080
Have a seat.

128
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,800
Let’s welcome the most popular movie star in Shanghai,

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,120

Congratulations.

137
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,440
Thank you.

138
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,840
Miss Sun Mei, I’m your fan.

139
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,840
I want to be someone like you.

140
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
Wait for justice.

141
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,520
Wait for justice.

142
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,400
Go!

143
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,800
Wait for justice!

144
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Injustice!

145
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,880
Wait for justice!

146
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,080
Wait for justice.

147
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,280
What injustice do you have?

148
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,080
My sister.

149
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,760
Take her away! Hurry!

150
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,280
The police colluded.

151
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,280
and wait for justice.

152
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,120
Director Yang.

153
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,760
Yes?

154
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,860
This seems to be something within your station.

155
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,730
Commander, we will investigate thoroughly.

156
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,120
This has caused such a big impact.

157
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,760
Of course the military will intervene in the investigation.

158
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,000
Before we find out the truth,

159
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,920
Reporters,

160
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,240
I believe you won't be bewitched.

161
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,560
Here,

162
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,400
I promise you

163
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,360
I will find out the truth.

164
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,760
If there is any injustice,

165
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,720
I don't care

166
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,240
or power,

167
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,600
will never be lenient

168
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,240
and never show mercy.

169
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,920
Chief Tang,

170
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
What's your security job?

171
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,400
How can you let him get in?

172
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,360
You have to

173
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,600
for this.

174
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,480
Jang Zhiqiu.

175
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,240
You made a panic

176
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,480
when an official attends an event.

177
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,440
and spread rumors.

178
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,100
The law will not tolerate you.

179
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,040
Sir.

180
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,800
Let me ask you.

181
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,840
Has my sister's death

182
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,090
Is the law in charge?

183
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,960
Did the law do it?

184
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,720
Did you?

185
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,920
Did you?

186
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,960
Mr. Go Su.

187
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,480
In order to create publicity for your movie,

188
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,680
Commander Zhao invited so many agents.

189
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,560
But

190
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,160
In your territory,

191
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,320
in front of everyone

192
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,800
in front of everyone.

193
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,640
Calm down.

194
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,200
Calm down, Secretary Song.

195
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,960
Please tell Commander Zhao

196
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,880
I will take care of this.

197
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,680
I'll see how you'll deal with this mess.

198
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,780
I'm telling you, Gao Su Sheng.

199
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,760
Don't get me involved if you want to die.

200
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,840
I know.

201
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,410
Secretary Song.

202
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,820
Please explain it to Commander Zhao.

203
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,600
Drive.

204
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,220
Where is Zhang Zhiqiu?

205
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,800
This morning,

206
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,560
Detective asked me to release him.
