1
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,640
Can you tell me

2
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,210
what’s the secret of Phoenix Hall?

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,880
Aren’t you trying to save him?

4
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
Why didn't you

5
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,200
he was killed

6
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,600
but got killed in front of you.

7
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,680
Leave this case alone.

8
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,259
I'll send someone to investigate it.

9
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,800
Okay.

10
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,680
Hello?

11
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,120
Sir.

12
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,920
Miss Gao,

13
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,800
Have you found out about my brother's car accident?

14
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,640
Yes.

15
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,400
That girl suddenly rushed out.

16
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,880
Young Master Fei couldn't dodge

17
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,320
and caused an accident.

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,850
Everyone in the police station witnessed it.

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,560
It's just that Master Fei was frightened.

20
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,440
I've sent someone to send him back to rest.

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,800
It's fine as long as it's clear.

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you, sir.

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,360
Working for Miss Gao. I...

24
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,320
Hello?

25
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,160
Why are you still standing here?

26
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,920
Where is he?

27
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,840
As soon as I close my eyes,

28
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,160
when I close my eyes.

29
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,620
What did he say?

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
They will die if I don’t kill them.

31
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Qingzhu Gang killed Zhang Yun Li.

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Gao Fei hit someone with a car.

33
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,120
There’s only one purpose

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,400
for one purpose.

35
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,840
Zhang Yun Li must die.

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,880
Phoenix Hall wants to silence her.

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,360
Zhang Yun Li must be involved in

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,760
the secret

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,740
the secret of Zhuque Hall.

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,080
How dare you hit someone in front of the police station?

41
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,640
Are you out of your mind?

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,960
Dad, don't be angry.

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,079
It’s clear.

44
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,140
It was an accident.

45
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,720
Learn from your sister.

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,520
Get lost!

47
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,980
I went to the hospital to see the moon.

48
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,410
She's recovering well.

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,880
Three kids.

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,570
You're the only one who makes me worry.

51
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,400
and I have high hopes.

52
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,940
On behalf of Phoenix Hall,

53
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
on behalf of Zhuque Hall.

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,960
Okay.

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,160
Yun Li.

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,280
You...

57
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,880
You took a box

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,880
and told me this is my sister.

59
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,340
The murderer is cruel.

60
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
and the police need to close the case.

61
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,320
So...

62
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,329
My condolences.

63
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,600
My sister was murdered.

64
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,810
Where did she go that night?

65
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,040
Why did Gao Fei kill her?

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,800
You don’t even allow me to collect her body.

67
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,640
What did you do to her?

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
What did you do to her?

69
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,520
That's all I can do.

70
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,040
Live for your sister.

71
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,720
Take your money.

72
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,140
Under the order of the inspector,

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,600
to deliver Zhang Yun Li

74
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
to Zhang Yun Li.

75
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,440
of the car accident case.

76
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,160
Miss Gao.

77
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,360
Miss Gao.

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,640
Miss Gao, I thought

79
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,000
from other Gao family.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,240
It's none of your business.

81
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,500
What did you find in Zhao Shuang’s house?

82
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,120
Guess.

83
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,440
Is it related to

84
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,100
with Hongxiu and Zhang Yunli?

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,880
The case is closed.

86
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,140
You can't hear his cry, right?

87
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,640
So you don't care about others' lives.

88
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,240
or them.

89
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,800
They used to be your girls.

90
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,970
The gun that didn't ring that night

91
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,920
is still on your heads.

92
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,440
Don't try to kill yourself.

93
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,640
Tiger!

94
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,080
Yes.

95
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,680
If you cover up the cause of Zhang Yun Li's death,

96
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,840
there must be another Hongxiu.

97
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,970
The second Zhu Yuhe.

98
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,260
I know the secret of Phoenix Hall.

99
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,610
Hongxiu is not the first one

100
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,200
Before her,

101
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,600
you covered up the cause of her death,

102
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,920
there must be another Hongxiu.

103
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,120
The second Joo Yu He.

104
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,480
Young.

105
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,010
Are you all here?

106
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,160
Yes.

107
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
Since you've decided to come,

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,160
I'll be frank.

109
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,120
You're right.

110
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,800
The thing I found at Zhao Shuang’s house

111
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,920
has something to do with

112
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,159
and Zhang Yun Li.

113
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,480
What is it?

114
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,440
A photo of the five girls.

115
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,040
The background of the photos

116
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,640
It's all a triumphant hotel.

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,200
The date is written on the back.

118
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,920
I suspect it’s Zhao Sin.

119
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,440
to take photos for them.

120
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,640
according to the time.

121
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,080
Hongxiu is not the first one.

122
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,810
Her name is Liu Shuang-joo.

123
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,680
She works at Yongfeng Department Store.

124
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,740
The photo was taken three months ago.

125
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,760
The second one is Zhou Yuqin.

126
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,280
He's an artist.

127
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,730
The photo was taken two months ago.

128
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,730
The remaining three

129
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,560
is not long.

130
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,720
As you all know,

131
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,440
I'll cut to the chase.

132
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,920
Liu Shuang Zhu and Zhou Yuqin

133
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,680
and Zhuque Hall.

134
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,440
the latest cosmetics and clothes of Yongfeng Department Store.

135
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,559
will be sent to Phoenix Hall

136
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,640
for girls to pick.

137
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,840
As for Zhou Yuqin,

138
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,840
she was invited to perform in Phoenix Hall.

139
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,730
But it hasn’t been long.

140
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,840
Ms. Gao.

141
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,290
Why are you willing to tell us this?

142
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,840
I want to know.

143
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,280
why the girls

144
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,000
die?

145
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,480
We can start with the photo date.

146
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,840
If Liu Shuang-joo and Zhou Yuqin

147
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,760
disappeared at this time,

148
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,980
the relatives will report it.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,330
There will be files in the police station.

150
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,680
We have to go to Yongfeng Department Store and the bomb reviewing club.

151
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,400
I'm afraid it's hard to move now.

152
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,130
Shen Lian is watching closely.

153
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,200
I'll go.

154
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,160
President.

155
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,090
I really want to watch the show of the White Snake.

156
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,920
Then she won't act anymore.

157
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,000
Two months ago, she told me

158
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,520
she was up to something.

159
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,680
Then he suddenly disappeared.

160
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,640
Who knew

161
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,240
she was kept in a cage of gold.

162
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,120
Yoo Shuang-joo suddenly didn't come to work.

163
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,920
She left these behind.

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,660
I was going to throw them away.

165
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,120
Let me see.

166
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,240
See?

167
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,760
Miss Gao.

168
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,680
It's an honour to have you here.

169
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,960
Don't mention it.

170
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,820
You brought so many things. Look.

171
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,320
It’s because of the car accident.

172
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,440
Sir.

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,400
Thank you.

174
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,320
Good job.

175
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,640
You're welcome, Ms. Gao.

176
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,330
Here, open the wine.

177
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,120
I'll drink with Ms. Gao.

178
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,640
What?

179
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,600
Don't you know Ms. Gao is afraid of rats?

180
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Throw it for me.

181
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,600
So you prepared rats

182
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,640
was used here.

183
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,960
I found it.

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,480
Liu Shuang-joo is indeed missing.

185
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,920
She lives alone in Shanghai.

186
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,380
The landlord reported it.

187
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,080
You two.

188
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,360
catch someone.

189
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,600
Who?

190
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,920
Go away.

191
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,040
You still don't give up after running three newspapers.

192
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,500
Who dares to send you this?

193
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,720
Let go of me!

194
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,600
Let go of me!

195
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,720
What are you doing?

196
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,720
I'm going to the fourth newspaper.

197
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,800
The fifth, sixth and seventh.

198
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,760
If you don’t go to so many newspapers,

199
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,420
Qingzhu Gang will come to you.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,200
What’s the difference between you and Qingzhu Gang?

201
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,480
What did you say

202
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,410
what did you say?

203
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,400
Detective Tang, you told me yourself.

204
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,440
My sister called the police.

205
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,300
She said she was followed, right?

206
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,800
Tell them.

207
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,600
I got it wrong.

208
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,320
My sister

209
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,320
is in this small box.

210
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,880
in this small box.

211
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,720
Tell her

212
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,360
Tell her you got it wrong.

213
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,760
Say it.

214
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,560
Say it.

215
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,040
You said you got it wrong.

216
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,440
You should calm down now.

217
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,360
What you want to do

218
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,060
Being brave is not enough.

219
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,600
but also strategies.

220
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,240
Jigui.

221
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,320
Didn't you arrest the Chief Inspector?

222
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,400
The suspect escaped.

223
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,810
We didn't catch him.

224
00:12:59,320 --> 00:12:59,960
Thank you.

225
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,140
I want to do something.

226
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,240
Can you help me?

227
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
As long as we can clear Yun Li's name,

228
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,400
we will help you.

229
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,380
Deputy Director Yang is knowledgeable.

230
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,600
What do you think of today's show?

231
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,760
Modern.

232
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,240
Mr. Gao.

233
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,560
The beauty selection is a success.

234
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,520
Really?

235
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,820
Congratulations.

236
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,000
Thank you for your compliment.

237
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,560
Mr. Gao.

238
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,800
The twelve golden hairpin

239
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,120
has been taught so well by you.

240
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,920
Really?

241
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,880
Detective Shen, thank you for your hard work.

242
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,040
You're wise in solving cases.

243
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,410
I want to go to your director

244
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,120
to ask for your credit.

245
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,180
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

246
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,960
It's all thanks to you.

247
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,440
thanks to you.

248
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,200
To express my gratitude,

249
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,280
I'll drink up.

250
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,440
Mr. Gao.

251
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,730
Mr. Song is here.

252
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,770
Secretary Song,

253
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,080
We're waiting for you.

254
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,800
Mr. Gao.

255
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,080
Sit.

256
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,930
Secretary Song.

257
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,800
You missed

258
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,880
the best moment just now.

259
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
Good food is not afraid of being late.

260
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,640
Well said.

261
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,680
Hello, Mr. Song.

262
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,320
Thank you for your hard work.

263
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Three days later,

264
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,000
Let's see

265
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,400
among you.

266
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,480
to wear the cinnamon of Movie Queen.

267
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,720
Good luck, everyone.

268
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,360
Also,

269
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,240
I brought good news today.

270
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,840
Commander Zhao has invited a special agent from Nanjing.

271
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,160
to attend

272
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,040
the final of the movie queen selection.

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,200
The French Consulate

274
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,760
in the concession.

275
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,680
Mr. Gao,

276
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,200
Your beauty selection

277
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,200
is really worth it.

278
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,160
Not at all.

279
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,440
Thank you, Commander Zhao.

280
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,760
Girls,

281
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,440
To thank Commander Zhao,

282
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,880
for supporting

283
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,680
for our beauty selection.

284
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,880
I suggest

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,120
we take a step forward

286
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,040
to Secretary Song, OK?

287
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,560
Okay.

288
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,020
Take a small step forward.

289
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,720
Come on.

290
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,800
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,130
Sorry, Mr. Song.

292
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,520
Sorry.

293
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,520
Sorry.

294
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,200
It's okay.

295
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,040
You're a wise person.

296
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,890
It's not your fault.

297
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,760
Thank you, Mr. Song.

298
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,319
Here.

299
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Did you hear that?

300
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,040
The night of beauty selection in three days

301
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
is our priority.

302
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,800
Don’t make any mistakes.

303
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,480
Also,

304
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,040
keep an eye on Tang Zhenyun and Xia Mo.

305
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,800
If they have to find a way out,

306
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,400
just send them off.
