1
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,039
to create chaos in Phoenix Hall.

2
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,100
and spread rumors.

3
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,600
It's the police.

4
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,760
of the police station.

5
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,120
They asked me to do it.

6
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,800
How could they do this?

7
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,840
What did they tell you to do?

8
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,600
I told you,

9
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,610
I would never protect my weakness.

10
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,000
The night before yesterday,

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,160
they came to me.

12
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,000
Are you a man?

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,720
You didn't even

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,770
You didn't even go to seek justice.

15
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,960
You just need to make things bigger.

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,880
Leave the rest to us.

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,039
Don't be rude.

18
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,479
I'm a cop.

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,009
He's a forensic doctor.

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,680
Do you believe he can kill you easily?

21
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,120
Don't listen to him.

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,200
There's no such thing as death. Come on.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,120
Let me tell you.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,640
This matter

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,680
is very simple.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,880
I can teach you how to do it.

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,600
Then,

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,640
I did as they said

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,360
Mr. Zhang.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,760
Can you be more specific?

31
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,640
Yes, Mr. Zhang.

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,760
Tell us, Mr. Zhang.

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,240
Yes

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,640
Mr. Jang, tell us.

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,920
How many women are you hiding in the portrait?

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,640
Five.

37
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,480
Recently

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,690
the department store employee

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,079
The number is correct.

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,290
What about that clay maker?

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,640
I've controlled him.

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,120
Okay.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,720
It's time to close the case.

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,400
Zhabei Factory was shorthanded due to the cocoon.

45
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
Half of the trolley stopped.

46
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,880
The female workers gather at Baoshan Road.

47
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,800
Due to the suspension of Yangtze River flood and Guanghan railway,

48
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
the rice price of Shanghai increased

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,240
Nine yuan per stone.

50
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,240
The poor line up to buy cheap rice.

51
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,960
He's dead.

52
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,400
The Public Concession has dispatched the sealing and maintaining order.

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,600
According to the data of Jiang Haiguan,

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,280
the weapon should be this police stick.

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,079
So,

56
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,400
the police killed him.

57
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,200
There are two cops in this house.

58
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,079
Two days ago, there was a rumor spreading

59
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,800
You mean…

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,060
Reporter Zhang Zhiqiu

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,370
revealed the truth to the police and the media today.

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,480
he claimed that he was threatened

63
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,600
and Xia Mo,

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,480
he was forced to join the case.

65
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,440
And the two policemen

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,200
tried to make a case for personal revenge.

67
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,680
to fight against personal enemies.

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,200
It is reported that

69
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,480
and forced a confession to a statue craftsman.

70
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,880
and forced them to provide perjury that would be beneficial.

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,730
It's all connected.

72
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,040
You and I killed him.

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,560
No, we have to go.

74
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,480
Stop!

75
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,400
He's here to catch the murderer too.

76
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,200
Who do you think is the murderer?

77
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,640
Jigui, go that way.

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,800
Go.

79
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,120
Stop!

80
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,680
Stop!

81
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,200
Hurry!

82
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,920
Go after him.

83
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,800
Hurry up.

84
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,690
I didn't raise my gun. Why did you raise your hand?

85
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,000
Run!

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,940
You're like a wild rabbit.

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Take him away.

88
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,240
Thank you, Detective Shen.

89
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,200
Mr. Fei, it’s nothing.

90
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,320
Why didn’t you run away?

91
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,120
I was hoping you would come back to save me.

92
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,760
Run!

93
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,880
I'll shoot you two on the street.

94
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,280
Detective Shen can give me

95
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,560
a good citizen award.

96
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,640
Of course.

97
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,400
Master Fei.

98
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,760
What should we do now?

99
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,560
Take him away.

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,460
Take them away!

101
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,760
You want to kill them?

102
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,740
The case is closed.

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,360
and the troublemakers will disappear.

104
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,170
Isn't it good to kill two birds with one stone?

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,580
We can't kill them now.

106
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,640
Why?

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,320
We want to

108
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,560
without any trouble.

109
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,480
But if two police officers

110
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,040
were killed for no reason,

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,330
someone will take advantage of it.

112
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Besides,

113
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,580
Tang Zhenyun is Tang Bo Kui's nephew.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,460
I'm afraid it's difficult

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,520
I'm afraid it's hard to explain to the higher-ups.

116
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,320
Come down.

117
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,520
Go.

118
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
Master Fei, don't shoot.

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,940
None of your business.

120
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,700
There's a room over there.

121
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,060
Be careful not to leave any trace.

122
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,100
We have to let them run.

123
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,240
What?

124
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,960
If they don't run,

125
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,080
if they don't run away?

126
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,720
Let's go.

127
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,880
Go.

128
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,560
Go ahead.

129
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,720
Run!

130
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,520
You almost hit me.

131
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,280
I was aiming at you.

132
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,440
I missed.

133
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,560
Tiger

134
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,320
Sister.

135
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,880
Adjust this gun when you get back.

136
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,799
Okay.

137
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,840
Sir.

138
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,480
Let him go.

139
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,480
Miss Gao.

140
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,930
They were arrested for murder.

141
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,160
Just let them go?

142
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,320
This...

143
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,400
I don't have the right.

144
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,840
Do I have the right?

145
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,500
Deputy Director Yang.

146
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,440
Untie him.

147
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Take him back to the police station.

148
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,720
The time of the craftsman's death

149
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,040
for more than three hours.

150
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,240
If you don't believe me,

151
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,100
you can find any forensic doctor.

152
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,840
Tang Zhenyun and I can't be the murderer.

153
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,440
Because all day,

154
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,240
we have perfect alibi.

155
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,480
The artisan only got hit on the head.

156
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,120
That's why he died.

157
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,600
If it was a confession by torture,

158
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,060
would it only hit the head?

159
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,560
You're right.

160
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,320
It's not forced confession.

161
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,000
It's murder.

162
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
Young Master Gao.

163
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,160
Pack up.

164
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,560
and hide to Nanyang as soon as possible.

165
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,160
Now?

166
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,080
Miss Gao, I can’t see through you.

167
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,280
Let Zhang Zhiqiu

168
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,160
to make false testimony to frame me and Xia Mo.

169
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,760
Ask Yang Zezhi to save him later.

170
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,080
Are you a human or a ghost?

171
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,210
If it weren't for me,

172
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,650
both of you would have turned into ghosts.

173
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,960
What about the five female corpses?

174
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,220
Where did you get them?

175
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,450
You want to know?

176
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,340
if you want to know.

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,960
Thank you.

178
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,610
You should thank me.

179
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,280
I listened to the radio.

180
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
Fortunately, I'm back.

181
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,440
Your daughter, Go-young,

182
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,280
your daughter, Go-young?

183
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,400
Go-young is indeed capable.

184
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,240
Su Sheng.

185
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,040
You can't raise a son.

186
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,040
It's better to raise a daughter.

187
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,120
On the day of the final selection,

188
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,440
the girl who went upstairs to see the beauty selection

189
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,160
Is she your daughter, Gawol?

190
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,040
Yes.

191
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
Commander Zhao, you have a good eye.

192
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,520
That’s my useless daughter, Gawol.

193
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,320
What do you mean?

194
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,120
I'm not sure.

195
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,040
I might be better than you in the future.

196
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,280
Boss, how is it?

197
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Ms. Gao's performance is very good.

198
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,440
When I studied abroad,

199
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,770
I joined the drama club.

200
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,120
Great.

201
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,520
I really want to talk to Miss Gao.

202
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,360
We're preparing for the shoot.

203
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,080
Wait.

204
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,720
Do you know who I am?

205
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,320
This...

206
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,040
So,

207
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,200
you really like my performance?

208
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:01,880
Of course.

209
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,680
Of course.

210
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,080
Chief Tang.

211
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,640
What a rare guest!

212
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,680
Bao Rui, take good care of her.

213
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,900
No need, Nanny.

214
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,240
I'm not here for fun.

215
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,240
Chief Tang.

216
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,840
Don't be shy.

217
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,960
My little girl.

218
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,720
It seems that the Red Moon House

219
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,200
but she's still a young girl today.

220
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,080
Bao Rui.

221
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,480
Chief Tang.

222
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,840
This is you.

223
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,760
Otherwise,

224
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,280
I don't want her to come out.

225
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,960
to serve those bastards.

226
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,480
Detective Tang,

227
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
I have to try it.

228
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,480
Mommy.

229
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,520
I'm here to ask you something.

230
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,960
All right.

231
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,800
I won't make fun of you.

232
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,120
Chief Tang,

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
What do you want

234
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,080
to inquire about?

235
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,680
When Zhou Yuqin was performing here,

236
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,120
did anyone contact her?

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,600
It's been a while.

238
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,240
I need to think about it.

239
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,920
Silly girl.

240
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,720
Fireworks are free.

241
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,440
My money is not enough.

242
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,570
Inspector Tang,

243
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,120
Do you know why this place is called the Three Brothels?

244
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,000
Every time

245
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,600
at least three silver dollars.

246
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,300
Speaking of someone suspicious,

247
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,480
there is really one.

248
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,240
Sister.

249
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,800
You come here often.

250
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,400
That man looks like

251
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,960
He looks like a rough man.

252
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,400
He's not interested in evaluation.

253
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,760
But he spent a lot of money

254
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,360
to invite Zhou Yuqin to perform at home.

255
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,240
I saw

256
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
he's just a courier.

257
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,000
There must be someone else

258
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,080
must be someone else.

259
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,000
Did Zhou Yuqin go?

260
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,920
I don't know.

261
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
But later,

262
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,640
she never came to the Red Moon House.

263
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,560
Did that suspicious person

264
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,720
has any

265
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,260
characteristics?

266
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,800
It's just a man.

267
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,840
look like that.

268
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,680
Chief Tang is different.

269
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,200
Kiss.

270
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,840
That's him.

271
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,840
Fight outside.

272
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,360
Don't affect my business.

273
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,530
Little bastard.

274
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,960
Here, enjoy.

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,930
Okay, thank you.

276
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,440
Liang, you don't have appetite?

277
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
I'll eat them all.

278
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,740
He told me to bury a bunch of bones yesterday.

279
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,560
Human bones?

280
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,640
Human bones.

281
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,320
Let's go.

282
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,380
Don't move.

283
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,960
Who are you?

284
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,260
Look at the tattoo.

285
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,760
I’m from Qingzhu Gang.

286
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,760
Qingzhu Gang?

287
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,140
Isn’t it Hongzhu Gang now?

288
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,920
Don’t.

289
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,760
Don't kill me.

290
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,560
Don't worry.

291
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,760
I don't want your life.

292
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,359
Just answer me one question.
