1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,520
The shape of the hairpin on Sun Mei’s head

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,000
is exactly the same

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,740
on Zhang Yun Li's left arm.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,080
Tang Zhenyun

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,020
What are you doing?

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,960
Uncle.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,860
What are you doing?

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,610
Mind your own business.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,730
Don't make trouble.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,000
I didn't do anything.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,840
Is your uncle crazy?

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,840
How dare you talk about others?

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,640
What did I do?

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,480
What’s wrong with me?

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,560
Commander.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,120
I’ve done

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,800
you asked me to do.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,240
Commander.

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,200
Take a look.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,200
The headline of the newspaper.

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,600
can be written like this?

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,260
The major Chamber of Commerce invests in theaters.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,160
The capital of entertainment has a bright future.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,000
So literary.

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,289
The Chinese citizen

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,120
to let the people see

27
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,810
what they want the most.

28
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,600
is the weapon that caused

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,919
on Zhang Yun Li, Liu Shuang Zhu, Shen Ruchun,

30
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,320
It looks like the hairpin on Sun Mei’s head.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,360
Sun Mei played the role of "Legendary Love of Dust Sea".

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,200
Liu Shuang Zhu’s colleague said

33
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,920
Liu Shuangzhu liked Sun Mei’s movie very much.

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,880
Now?

35
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,079
It's not easy.

36
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,000
Is it possible that

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,440
Sun Mei used her role as a movie star

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
to lure Liu Shuang Zhu into the trap.

39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,320
That's easy.

40
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
You can bring her to interrogate her.

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,960
Maybe you can even find out

42
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,020
the strange house.

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,650
It's not that easy to catch people.

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,840
I'm afraid to alert them.

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Police.

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,250
Let's go inside.

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,880
You two study it yourselves.

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,320
The lower class.

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,010
Stop pretending to be pure.

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,720
Kong Shun.

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,120
Tang Zhenyun.

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,360
You caught him at Red Moon House?

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,760
I'll welcome him when he gets out.

54
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,020
Why did he come out?

55
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,400
You'll go to jail if you kill someone.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,600
and kill many people.

57
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,370
That means he's acquitted.

58
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,640
The law

59
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,640
is to restrict people like you.

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,800
Master Tobio is unhappy after spending money.

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
That's your fault.

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,800
Mommy.

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,520
My friend likes her.

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,960
Master Fei.

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
You can’t take her away.

66
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,760
You?

67
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,040
I'm not qualified.

68
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,480
I'm afraid the special agents will be unhappy.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,440
Last time, the special agent came here for a drink.

70
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,720
He likes this girl.

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,960
Maybe

72
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,840
take her to enjoy her life.

73
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,760
You're threatening me with a special agent?

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,560
I'm a courtesan.

75
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,680
I wouldn’t dare to do that.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,240
Master Fei,

77
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,040
Please be generous.

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,839
Why would you

79
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,079
like us?

80
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,840
Master Fei is good.

81
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,000
Come here.

82
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,000
to apologize to Master Fei.

83
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
You are generous.

84
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,600
Old man.

85
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,600
Mommy, buy some news.

86
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,640
Not enough.

87
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,840
A movie star like Sun Mei

88
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,320
can stand in Shanghai.

89
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,920
Is he backing up?

90
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
What do you think?

91
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,640
Who is her backer?

92
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,440
Sun Mei’s backer.

93
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
That’s really a mountain.

94
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,280
Take a guess.

95
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,520
The people first.

96
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,960
What task is Commander Zhao assigning to me?

97
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,760
Don't worry.

98
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,200
He'll tell you.

99
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
Why are there rats again?

100
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
What's wrong with you two?

101
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,200
What are you doing?

102
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,240
Didn't you hear me?

103
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,120
What did you hear?

104
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,040
There's noise.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,080
This is a haunted house.

106
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,760
It's normal to hear noise.

107
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,040
It's a mouse

108
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,640
It's normal to have mice

109
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,320
No, the sound comes from the wall

110
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,360
from the wall.

111
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,640
Come on.

112
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,260
Pay if you break it.

113
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,680
Give it to her.

114
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,120
What is this?

115
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,520
Is this the place where the old mansion holds treasures?

116
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,400
There are so many things in your house.

117
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,280
That head, that hand and leg.

118
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,240
Cut the crap.

119
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,060
Flashlight, let's go inside.

120
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,650
Why do you have to follow me?

121
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,320
It's treasure hunting. How can I not come?

122
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,080
Be careful.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,800
Wait

124
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,240
Women's footprints

125
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,060
The distance between the footprints was tight.

126
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,210
They should be careful.

127
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
The footprints were messy when they came back.

128
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,400
A big step, a heavy step.

129
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,680
I think he's running.

130
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,640
No matter who it is,

131
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
She was curious when she went there.

132
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,040
She was flustered when she came back.

133
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,840
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,080
Who could it be?

135
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,320
Hongxiu.

136
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
I... I don't know.

137
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,000
I... I saw nothing.

138
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,000
I saw...

139
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,010
What did you see?

140
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,970
Where is the secret passage to?

141
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,929
The secret we're looking for should be ahead.

142
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,580
Don't destroy these footprints.

143
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,680
This secret tunnel is quite long.

144
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,020
You know how to do this?

145
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,700
My family used to run a pawnshop. Why not?

146
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,290
What do you mean?

147
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,220
Don’t move.

148
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,800
Why does Sun Mei

149
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,000
looking outside the screen?

150
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,010
She is pleasing her backer.

151
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,320
The people ranked first.

152
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,490
Commander Zhao.

153
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,040
You can't take the film.

154
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,720
Why?

155
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,960
Use your brain.

156
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,520
If you take it,

157
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,400
all three of you will die.

158
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,600
You, Tang Zhenyun,

159
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
and Xia Yingqi.

160
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,480
Xia Mo.

161
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,800
She's right.

162
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,440
Back then,

163
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,520
you failed to protect me.

164
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,520
Now you have to protect Yingqi.

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,560
Do you think she's right?

166
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,800
Okay.

167
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,700
I'll listen to her.

168
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,210
Where did you come from?

169
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,120
Hurry up.

170
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,000
Miss Gao.

171
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Where is the bathroom?

172
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,680
This way.

173
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,960
Commander Zhao is waiting for you.

174
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,640
Let's go.

175
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,080
Go.

176
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,890
Commander Zhao.

177
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,490
Commander Zhao.

178
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,800
Miss Gao.

179
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,160
Once you enter this door,

180
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,800
I’ll treat you as my family.

181
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,810
Thank you, Commander Zhao.

182
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,210
Do you remember what I told you yesterday?

183
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,240
Yes.

184
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,400
Commander Zhao appreciates me.

185
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,930
and wants me to work for you.

186
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,940
If you work with me, there's no turning back.

187
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
A man with a narrow mind

188
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,480
can't live long here.

189
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,320
There's no reason to turn back even if the Arrow of Arrow is broken.

190
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,120
I understand.

191
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,680
Father taught me

192
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,610
to open this box.

193
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,440
Stocks.

194
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,240
This is

195
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,620
to open the cash cabinet in Shanghai.

196
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,800
to integrate the entertainment resources in Shanghai

197
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,200
to launch this World Entertainment Stock.

198
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,020
Chairman Tang,

199
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,480
Zhabei Chamber of Commerce is very important.

200
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Do you have a plan?

201
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,460
Don’t worry, Commander Zhao.

202
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,960
We’ll do our best to cooperate.

203
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,740
President Zhang of the stock trade guild

204
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,200
He can give him whatever he likes.

205
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,760
Got it.

206
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,810
Commander Zhao.

207
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,520
Chairman Zhang is on board.

208
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
The stock commercial guild

209
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,520
is the last puzzle.

210
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,930
It's time to carry out the plan.

211
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,120
Within a month,

212
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,880
within a month.

213
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,920
I want this World Entertainment Stock

214
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,960
20 times more.

215
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,320
Great!

216
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,800
Commander Zhao gave us the money.

217
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,200
this stock will be 20 times higher.

218
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,600
Right?

219
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,600
Yes.

220
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,400
Just tell me if you have any questions.

221
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,520
It turns out

222
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,480
the movie selection in Shanghai

223
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,760
The reputation of Zhuque Hall

224
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,240
and the so-called quote age.

225
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
It's just a trick.

226
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,240
The final show

227
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,240
is this stock.

228
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,560
Su Sheng,

229
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,400
I was right.

230
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,240
your heroic daughter.

231
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,160
Once the money cabinet opens,

232
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,800
someone has to move it.

233
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
related to

234
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,280
the Yongli Private Bank

235
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,640
to you.

236
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,280
You can deploy

237
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,280
are at your disposal.

238
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,800
What's wrong?

239
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,359
I dare not answer.

240
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,329
Thank you, Commander Zhao.

241
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,319
Okay.

242
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,560
Okay.

243
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,079
Cheers.

244
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,040
Wish our great success.
