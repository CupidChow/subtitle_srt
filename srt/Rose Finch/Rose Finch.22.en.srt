1
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,400
This place is not fit for human habitation,

2
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,720
can't you all see that?

3
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,479
We've all been deceived,

4
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,580
there was never any film production.

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,259
Shen Ruchun and Sun Mei are accomplices,

6
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,960
they're just using us to-

7
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,160
Come on!

8
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,479
You hid these gold bars,

9
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,360
how did you get gold bars?

10
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,380
We won them playing games.

11
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,520
Playing games?

12
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Weren't you supposed to be filming?

13
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,600
Give them back to me,

14
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,040
I risked my life for these.

15
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,440
You're just like Shen Ruchun,

16
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,280
all accomplices.

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,160
That must be it,

18
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,720
why else would they hide the gold bars?

19
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,520
Tell me clearly,

20
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,720
where did you come from?

21
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,880
Please don't do this.

22
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,320
Enough! How did it come to this,

23
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,040
alright.

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,440
Qian Yun is dead.

25
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Father was right about you.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,890
My years of training you haven't been wasted.

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,920
Our father-daughter bond began

28
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,370
because of your exceptional courage,

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,490
do you remember?

30
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,720
I do.

31
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Back then, the Green Bamboo Gang took in many orphans,

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,920
but you three were the most capable.

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,040
Now the new gang leader will soon open the altar

34
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,380
to receive offerings.

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,800
You are gifts for the new leader.

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,240
The tribute I gave you,

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
you haven't forgotten it, have you?

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,450
How did you know I'm the new leader?

39
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,680
It just rained,

40
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,010
all the elders' shoulders are wet,

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,520
except for yours.

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,780
They held an umbrella for you.

43
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,480
Come here.

44
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,480
Child,

45
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,680
from now on,

46
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,370
your surname is Gao.

47
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,050
Commander Zhao values you highly,

48
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,240
your future will be limitless.

49
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,800
Although you're not my biological daughter,

50
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,280
I've made my decision.

51
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,320
The Vermilion Bird Hall and Green Bamboo Gang,

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,130
I will hand them all over to you.

53
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,740
I understand, Dad.

54
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,080
But

55
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,360
working with Commander Zhao on this stock,

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,920
isn't the risk too high?

57
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,040
Throughout history,

58
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,200
risks

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,720
have always been borne by ordinary people.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,760
Who is Commander Zhao?

61
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,080
He has guns, an army,

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,580
and powerful backers.

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,240
When we stand beside him,

64
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,200
we stand at the center of power.

65
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,600
Then we

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,450
are no longer ordinary people.

67
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,380
With matters like stocks,

68
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,010
someone of Commander Zhao's position

69
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,700
shouldn't be visible.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,960
And you and I

71
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,360
are the ones who will take the stage for him.

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,490
This secret passage

73
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,540
shouldn't be opened carelessly.

74
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,940
Gao Ying is over there.

75
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,330
So that means...

76
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,840
So this place

77
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,080
is the secret residence I've been

78
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,720
looking for but couldn't find before.

79
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,840
This secret tunnel

80
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,280
was built into the original design of both houses.

81
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,920
It might have been for escape purposes.

82
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,600
Or it could have been to

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,530
facilitate private affairs in wealthy households.

84
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,200
Could it be that Hongxiu also discovered

85
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,360
this secret passage entrance because of rats?

86
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,400
Hongxiu used the secret passage

87
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,880
to enter that house.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,800
She stumbled upon a huge secret.

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,760
When she escaped,

90
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,880
she must have lost something that could prove

91
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,210
her identity as a dancer from Zhuque Hall.

92
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,440
It could be footprints,

93
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,570
it could be jewelry,

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
or something else.

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
But even if she returned to Number 25

96
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,920
through the secret passage,

97
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,320
those people still knew she had been there.

98
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,900
So she brought deadly trouble upon herself.

99
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,780
The people in the house

100
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,600
thought she entered through the front door

101
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,000
and escaped the same way.

102
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,880
No one would know

103
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,240
that she returned to No. 25 through the secret passage.

104
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,640
You're making progress,

105
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,680
your logic holds up.

106
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,280
Your deduction is probably close to the truth.

107
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,220
Hong Xiu most likely died because of her curiosity.

108
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,240
But why didn't Hong Xiu

109
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,840
reveal the secret passage

110
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,040
even until her death?

111
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
The secret was too significant.

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,880
She didn't dare to tell,

113
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,240
revealing it would mean certain death.

114
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,040
By keeping quiet,

115
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,040
she might have had a slim chance of survival.

116
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,840
Hong Xiu didn't tell Gao Ying about this secret

117
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,200
because she didn't want to involve her,

118
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,330
which could have endangered her life.

119
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,650
Compared to Hong Xiu, a dancer,

120
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,210
those officials who kill for pleasure

121
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,080
are the true lowlifes.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,120
So what do we do now?

123
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,440
What should we do?

124
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,480
There are two people who know the truth and can help us,

125
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,360
one is Gao Ying.

126
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,360
The other is my uncle.

127
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,930
Uncle, you can't hide from me forever.

128
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,520
How much were you involved in what happened to the Gao family?

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
You can't cause me any more trouble.

130
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,090
Let's go.

131
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,080
I'll take you to the dock right now.

132
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,340
Leave Shanghai today.

133
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,320
I'm not leaving.

134
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,720
Have you forgotten when you were kneeling on the ground

135
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,280
with a gun to your head?

136
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,340
How many lives do you have?

137
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,040
Were you involved in those girls' deaths?

138
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,880
I had nothing to do with it.

139
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,840
Are you working for Gao Susheng?

140
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,800
Why don't you understand?

141
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,040
In this world, everything is about exchange of interests.

142
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,159
Name your price.

143
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,840
I, Tang Boju, will keep my word.

144
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,920
From now on,

145
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,810
the Zhabei Chamber of Commerce

146
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,200
will follow Mr. Gao's lead.

147
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,800
I've fallen this low

148
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
just to save your life.

149
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,720
Your father told me before he died

150
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,240
Bang! Bang! Bang!

151
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,840
to take good care of you.

152
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,680
Tian! Tian!

153
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,940
Tian! Tian!

154
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,780
Tian! Tian!

155
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,919
Bang! Bang! Bang!

156
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,520
You're the only heir to the Tang family.

157
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,500
Do you know where this jade came from?

158
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,810
From Empress Dowager Cixi's tomb.

159
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,160
Gao Susheng was involved in tomb raiding,

160
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,490
trading artifacts from the dead for power among the living.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,280
Come, Mr. Gao.

162
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,480
Cheers!

163
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,620
Chairman Tang.

164
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,410
Since we divided the loot from the Eastern Tombs,

165
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,160
there's been no turning back.

166
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,290
Everything's going downhill.

167
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
In this chaotic Shanghai,

168
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,280
who can claim to be innocent?

169
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,240
Uncle.

170
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
I can help you.

171
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,680
Tell me everything he's done,

172
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,600
and I'll find a way, okay?

173
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,530
Detective Tang,

174
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,250
aren't you overestimating yourself?

175
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,440
In this vast Shanghai,

176
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,570
do you think you can make a difference?

177
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,200
If your surname wasn't Tang,

178
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,800
you wouldn't be alive today.

179
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,760
You'd be long dead.

180
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,640
Get out!

181
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,160
The new leader of the Green Bamboo Gang

182
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,520
receives the leader's token.

183
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,170
On what grounds?

184
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,480
She's just the daughter of a whore from a brothel.

185
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,640
Young Master Fei, you've had too much to drink.

186
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,770
Let me take him back.

187
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
Gao Fei.

188
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,420
You're causing trouble while drunk,

189
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,540
disrupting our gang's ceremony.

190
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,090
According to our rules,

191
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,130
you should have both hands cut off.

192
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,320
Dad, let me.

193
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,500
Thanks to everyone's support today,

194
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,160
I, Gao Ying, have taken over the Green Bamboo Gang.

195
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,780
Now that I hold the command token,

196
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,200
I will establish a new gang rule.

197
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,000
From today onwards,

198
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,250
the blades of our Green Bamboo Gang

199
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,840
will only be drawn against outsiders.
