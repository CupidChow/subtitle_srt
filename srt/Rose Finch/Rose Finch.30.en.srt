1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,650
What are you going to do with me?

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,000
Dad.

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,520
Go-young.

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,880
You're really my goddaughter

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,840
You hid it so well.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,000
Surprised?

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,600
You have a plan.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,880
I have a hidden weapon.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,340
Do you think you can control the power

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,400
you can control the power of Qingzhu Gang?

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,200
I know you always treat me as a puppet.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,360
But what if

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,360
is broken?

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,850
What do you want?

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,290
What do you want?

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,420
What are you doing?

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,720
Traitor!

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,600
You are the traitor of Qingzhu Gang.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,800
In order to please Commander Zhao,

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,120
you’ve hurt so much of our gang’s interests.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Do you think the seniors don’t know?

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,780
Don't listen to her nonsense.

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,000
She's talking nonsense.

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,840
This shot

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,160
is Takazuki.

26
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,600
This shot

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,840
for the girls.

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
Kill me if you dare.

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,479
If you become a ghost,

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,440
I'll get even with you.

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
If there are ghosts in this world,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,960
your son

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,199
has been haunted by hundreds of ghosts.

34
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,520
How could I have killed him?

35
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,520
Three.

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
Every stab

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,400
to the bottom.

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,880
He didn't say anything.

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
He's finally going to be killed.

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,840
He's coming.

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,360
He's coming.

42
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,240
It's him.

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,200
It's him.

44
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,160
Pay us back!

45
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,240
Pay me my hard-earned money!

46
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,800
That's my coffin notebook.

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,120
My hard-earned money!

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,380
Nice catch!

49
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,920
You'll die a horrible death.

50
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,840
Die a horrible death.

51
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,840
Why is there no trial?

52
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
What do you think?

53
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,240
They don't want Go Su

54
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,500
to reveal everything.

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,960
Are we going to let it go again?

56
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,440
Kill them!

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,000
Pay me my hard-earned money!

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Kill them!

59
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,760
All these years,

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,480
for so many years

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,360
to climb to that position.

62
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,960
and be a Go player.

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,880
and be someone who can decide someone's fate.

64
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,320
Deputy Director Yang.

65
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,520
Where is Commander Zhao?

66
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,680
left unscathed.

67
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,780
The superior wants him to give up a large sum of money

68
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,159
to calm down the financial storm in Zhabei.

69
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:41,840
And then?

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,860
and continue to be his commander.

71
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,280
It's just a change of defense.

72
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,159
What's the point of doing this?

73
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,050
I’m more concerned about Commander Zhao’s mood.

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,600
He must be in a bad mood now.

75
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,050
Guess what he'll do when he's in a bad mood.

76
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,800
As long as he's alive,

77
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,100
there will be more girls missing.

78
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,560
The money I took

79
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,040
I’ll make them spit it out twice.

80
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,100
Commander.

81
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
I heard that your new transfer

82
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,800
is not even Shanghai.

83
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,040
Don’t worry, Commander.

84
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,240
Once I arrive,

85
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,560
I'll find

86
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,520
How are you?

87
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,400
Are you okay?

88
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,520
Don't die!

89
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Don't die!

90
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,000
Please don't die.

91
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,480
If you die, I'm nothing.

92
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,560
Don't die.

93
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,440
I don't want you to die.

94
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,440
Miss Shen.

95
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,800
Let's go.

96
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,370
Leave Shanghai.

97
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,900
as far as possible.

98
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,240
Never come back.

99
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,080
He's really dead.

100
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,400
Dead.

101
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
I'm dead.

102
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,640
Fu Ying.

103
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,040
I did it.

104
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,480
I put an end to

105
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
for those girls.

106
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,860
I haven't seen you smile like you did before.

107
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,280
Xia Mo.

108
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,520
Back then,

109
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,040
we found a broken arm here.

110
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,280
Let's say goodbye here.

111
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,000
Farewell?

112
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,010
What do you mean?

113
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,320
I mean goodbye.

114
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,240
is to say goodbye to the pain in the past.

115
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,760
You can't be trapped by them.

116
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,320
I will never leave you.

117
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,330
You're here.

118
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,800
I'll be there.

119
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,680
[Even if I'm dead,]

120
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,640
And

121
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,920
you examined my body.

122
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,640
Stop it.

123
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,400
Xia Mo.

124
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,880
You have to look forward.

125
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,200
Go forward.

126
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,520
It's time

127
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,440
to put an end to your past.

128
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,860
It's not like that.

129
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,920
I still have a long way to go.

130
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,320
I still have a lot to do.

131
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,880
You can do it with me.

132
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,280
right?

133
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,960
Promise me one thing.

134
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,440
What is it?

135
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,000
You have to do it more often.

136
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,120
Smile.

137
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,040
OK.

138
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,040
Now you know to line up.

139
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,200
Yes.

140
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,500
It's well-organized.

141
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:45,960
Look.

142
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,700
Deputy Director Yang.

143
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,700
My brother said I should give this to you.

144
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,160
This is a national treasure.

145
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,880
In the tomb?

146
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,240
Yes.

147
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,520
it became

148
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,290
the bargaining chip for Gao Su's power exchange.

149
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,920
The National Government.

150
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,160
How rotten.

151
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,080
Now Commander Zhao is dead.

152
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,370
Maybe there will be Commander Qian. Commander Wang.

153
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,600
I’m afraid

154
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,280
won't change anything.

155
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Not necessarily.

156
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,280
Look at you.

157
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,600
changed them too?

158
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,920
I believe in this society,

159
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,260
there are always people who make progress like you.

160
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,400
faith is greater.

161
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,360
Break the old order

162
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,970
and find a new way out

163
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,280
for this country.

164
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,780
Deputy Director Yang.

165
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,520
What did you just say?

166
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,730
What did you say?

167
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,880
What did I say?

168
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,240
I will arrange for you two to leave Shanghai as soon as possible.

169
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,770
The death of Commander Zhao

170
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,360
will affect both of you sooner or later.

171
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,320
Young, come with us.

172
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,640
I haven't finished playing yet.

173
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,700
I have to continue.

174
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,920
I’m tied to the high position of Qingzhu Gang.

175
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,450
There are more things to do.

176
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,780
But I can wait for you in Shanghai.

177
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,360
Mommy, we're leaving.

178
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,040
Let's go.

179
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,480
If you stay in this haunted house for too long,

180
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,200
I should get some fresh air.

181
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,420
I hope there won't be such a haunted house again.

182
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Who knows

183
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,520
Who knows?

184
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,520
Let's go.
