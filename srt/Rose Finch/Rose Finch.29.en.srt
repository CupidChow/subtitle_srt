1
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,010
Ha Young-ki!

2
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,100
Ha Young-ki, are you okay?

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,000
We were looking for you. Are you hurt?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,640
Cut the crap. Save him.

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,720
Help!

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,080
You sit in the front.

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,810
Lead the way.

8
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,640
Go forward.

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,800
You have to move forward.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,140
The house in front.

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,200
See?

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,610
Liu Erjiao and three guards have guns.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,530
We are not easy to deal with.

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,760
This is the house.

15
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,080
You and Xia Mo stay here.

16
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,009
Hu, come with me.

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,539
They have four guns. Can you do it?

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
Don't worry.

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,479
Be careful.

20
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,120
Let's go.

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Let's take a look.

22
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,760
Come here.

23
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,200
Don't move.

24
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,280
Let go of me!

25
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,480
Don't move.

26
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,280
I'll kill you if you move.

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,360
Chief, sit in the middle.

28
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
Sit in the middle.

29
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,329
Mr. Gao. Mr. Gao.

30
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,160
Excuse me.

31
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,600
Mr. Gao.

32
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,880
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,060
At the door of the box that day,

34
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,200
I had no choice.

35
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,600
Please understand.

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,530
Detective Shen.

37
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,000
Things have changed.

38
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,400
Now we're on the same boat

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,400
and eat together.

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,250
Keep your eyes away.

41
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,600
Mr. Gao has a different layout.

42
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,400
In my life,

43
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,520
in my life.

44
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,560
Mr. Gao. Gao.

45
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,680
It's really...

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,730
Detective Shen.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,760
I will remember you

48
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,120
will remember you.

49
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,360
Mr. Gao.

50
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
All right.

51
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,000
Sit.

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,920
Mr. Gao.

53
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,600
Chairman Zhang.

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,160
I need your help from now on.

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,440
Are you kidding me?

56
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,240
Let's work hard together.

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,079
Same to you.

58
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
Chairman Jang, have a seat.

59
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,000
Please.

60
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,880
What's wrong?

61
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,360
It’s an important occasion.

62
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,840
Commander Zhao is not here.

63
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,240
I still feel uneasy.

64
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,680
Didn’t I tell you?

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,200
We're just standing on the stage

66
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,800
for Commander Zhao.

67
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,480
It's okay.

68
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,680
Dear guests,

69
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,360
Today we gather here

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,580
to witness the important historical moment together.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,240
In the time of changes and changes,

72
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,970
the capital of entertainment in Shanghai

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,680
is a more important mission given by the times.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,440
Today, we have a very important person

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,680
[with passion and expectations.]

76
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,640
a special specialist of the government financial reform.

77
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,200
Mr. Yan Gang.

78
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,960
He will announce a grand plan

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,200
a grand plan that concerns the future of Shanghai.

80
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,370
Let's welcome the special agents.

81
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,600
Today,

82
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,000
to join the Xinzhabei Project.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,240
Press conference.

84
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,320
Before I explain this grand plan,

85
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,640
I would like to invite you

86
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,480
watch a carefully prepared video.

87
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,840
It records the past and present of Zhabei

88
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,720
It also indicates Zhabei

89
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,320
of Zhabei.

90
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,080
This is good.

91
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,440
It's good

92
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,290
Good.

93
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,840
Not bad.

94
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,320
Not bad.

95
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
It's quite clear.

96
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,680
Yes.

97
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,480
Not bad.

98
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,120
What's wrong?

99
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,409
Mr. Gao, this...

100
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,680
Wait, no hurry.

101
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,400
What's wrong?

102
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,200
What's going on?

103
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:01,760
Look.

104
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,840
It’s so cruel.

105
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,040
It seems to be Sun Mei.

106
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,080
Stop her!

107
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,940
This is Sun Mei.

108
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,620
This is her.

109
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
But...

110
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Isn’t this Sun Mei?

111
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,840
It’s her.

112
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,620
This doesn't look like an act.

113
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,480
Not acting

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,880
Yes.

115
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,960
How could he do this?

116
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,600
I know.

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,330
Where did you come from?

118
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,600
Miss Gao.

119
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,720
Where is the bathroom?

120
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,360
Here.

121
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,960
You know this?

122
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,880
When I was in England,

123
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,860
I always want to learn something.

124
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,400
Okay, let's go.

125
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,960
This is a film

126
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,240
from the screen.

127
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,300
You know what it is?

128
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,480
Mr. Gao, what should we do?

129
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,360
My godfather.

130
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,080
Mr. Gao Su from Zhuque Hall

131
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,920
once told me

132
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,600
He said

133
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,160
the magnificent reputation of Phoenix Hall

134
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,400
with human blood.

135
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,520
Gao

136
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,049
How could you tell her that?

137
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,020
This Gao Su student

138
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,679
is so inhumane.

139
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,780
What are you doing?

140
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,920
Why are you still standing here?

141
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,980
Where are your men?

142
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,400
Stop them!

143
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,640
You too.

144
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,240
Miss, get on the stage.

145
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,400
Lean on Ms. Gao.

146
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,680
Follow me.

147
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,520
Hurry.

148
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,840
Everyone.

149
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,920
The human blood signature Gao Su Sheng mentioned

150
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,120
was made by these

151
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,200
by the officials.

152
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,440
They are all

153
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,080
behind these murders.

154
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
We have solid evidence. Arrest him.

155
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,180
Who dares to arrest me?

156
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,240
I have no right to arrest you.

157
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,440
But in reality,

158
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,800
I believe these reporters have conscience.

159
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
I don't believe you can get away unscathed.

160
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,200
It's fake.

161
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,480
This is all fake.

162
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,440
Yes, someone framed me.

163
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
This is a frame.

164
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Yes, it's a trap.

165
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,130
Did you see that?

166
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,220
The ones who should be ashamed

167
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
are those bastards under the stage.

168
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,640
They are the ones who are guilty.

169
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,360
Not you.

170
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
If you want to say something,

171
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,090
don't worry.

172
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,520
I will stand in front of you.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
They're killing people.

174
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,400
Mr. Go Su. Commander Cho.

175
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,960
and them.

176
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,080
are all animals in clothes.

177
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,600
They treat us like toys.

178
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,130
They've had enough fun.

179
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,960
and want to kill us.

180
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,440
From the beginning,

181
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,370
Beauty selection is a conspiracy.

182
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,720
We have caught

183
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,280
the killer sent by Gao Su

184
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,200
He will confess and testify.

185
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,080
The wound on my arm

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,160
is the same as the girls in the video.

187
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,640
Commander Zhao is a beast.

188
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,840
He is not a man.

189
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,180
He's incompetent.

190
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,760
Otherwise, he wouldn't have

191
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,520
to us.

192
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,560
Gao Su Sheng

193
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,200
embezzled the money from Zhabei Chamber of Commerce.

194
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,000
In order to protect myself,

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,320
to protect myself

196
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,320
to Commander Zhao.

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,800
She didn't fall to death at home.

198
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,520
She was killed

199
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,240
by her father, Go Su.

200
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,520
Nonsense!

201
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,970
Conspiracy?

202
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,000
This is a conspiracy.

203
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,400
You did this with Commander Zhao

204
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,530
to win over these Shanghai officials.

205
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,800
to acquire the property and title deed

206
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,930
to acquire the property and title deed of Zhabei people.

207
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,760
When the special agents announce the new Zhabei plan,

208
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,960
the life of Shanghai

209
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,720
will be in your hands.

210
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,480
Will there be any trouble

211
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,810
in the big world entertainment stock?

212
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,840
It's a legitimate deal. I admit defeat.

213
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,000
What will happen?

214
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,560
Stocks

215
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,010
is just a piece of paper.

216
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,520
If we raise it, it's a gold tag.

217
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
Let it fall.

218
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,060
It's just a piece of paper.

219
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,320
A man's heart is not enough for a snake to swallow an elephant.

220
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,520
If you want to be rich,

221
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,240
as long as you can bet the deed,

222
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,570
you'll lose everything

223
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,040
they won't stop

224
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,080
They won't stop.

225
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,000
Tell me.

226
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,640
The national government

227
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,560
the so-called government

228
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,680
In the end,

229
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,740
everything becomes a profitable business.

230
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,800
The new Zhabei plan to rebuild the center of Shanghai

231
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
To put it bluntly,

232
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,520
it's a big deal.

233
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,680
So much money.

234
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,410
Instead of letting others make money,

235
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,560
it's better to enter our own pocket.

236
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,880
Now we have taken over half of Zhabei

237
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,280
through stocks.

238
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,130
Special agents.

239
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,130
From now on, wherever we stand,

240
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,760
is the city center in Shanghai.

241
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,600
My uncle, Tang Bo Jian,

242
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,920
the chairman of Zhabei Chamber of Commerce.

243
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,280
Although he was dragged down by Gao Su Sheng,

244
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,880
he still has conscience.

245
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,640
He doesn't want the whole Zhabei to be killed.

246
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,080
Gao Su killed him.

247
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,320
and replaced Zhang Yun

248
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,450
took over Zhabei Chamber of Commerce.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,880
They want to build a Jinshan

250
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,610
to build Mount Jin for Commander Zhao.

251
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Don't move.

252
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,120
Sit down.

253
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,600
I'll blow you up!

254
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,640
What are you looking at?

255
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,500
Listen to them.

256
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,660
Where's Young Master?

257
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,940
Master Fei was killed by Gao Ying.

258
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,130
We escaped from the Red Moon House.

259
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,300
Give me the gun.

260
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,920
Get down!

261
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,120
Don't let any of them escape.

262
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,010
Let's go.

263
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
Ha Young-ki, press her wound.

264
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,080
Get up.

265
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,440
No, the bleeding won't stop.

266
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,930
I can't save her.

267
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,040
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,680
No.

269
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,680
Don't tell my mom.

270
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
You're fine. You can still be saved.

271
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,680
Mr. Gao.

272
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,800
You go first.

273
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,200
Okay.

274
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,600
Let's go.

275
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,000
Take the girls to the hospital.

276
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,800
Protect them.

277
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,640
Yes.

278
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,800
Gao Su escaped.

279
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,540
Commander Zhao didn't get rid of him.

280
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,360
Be careful.

281
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,840
I know where he is.

282
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,530
He can’t escape.

283
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,010
Commander Zhao.

284
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,160
Go-young set us up.

285
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,420
You were tricked by Go-young.

286
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,690
Commander Zhao.

287
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,920
My daughter died.

288
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,160
and my son was killed.

289
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,320
Please save me.

290
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
You bastard!

291
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,080
If you want,

292
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,220
I can give you freedom.

293
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,180
You can leave anytime.

294
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,920
Live freely like Gao Su Sheng

295
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,240
Freedom.

296
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Mr. Gao.

297
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Find someone now.

298
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,680
Call Go-young.

299
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,520
Tell them the gang has something important to discuss.

300
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,400
Mr. Gao, what are you doing?

301
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,250
She betrayed Qingzhu Gang.

302
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,490
According to the rules,

303
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,960
we must get rid of her.

304
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,160
Okay.

305
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,370
What are you going to do with me?

306
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,600
Dad.
