1
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,470
Via, I didn’t want to do it.

2
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,484
Let’s talk.

3
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,796
Just not here.
There are too many people.

4
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:31,851
It’s Larkin Sanchez!

5
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:32,685
Hey! It really is Larkin!

6
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:34,085
- Come on!
- Larkin! Take a photo with us!

7
00:00:34,228 --> 00:00:35,396
That Arkin is such an asshole,

8
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:37,093
having the nerve
to cheat on Clea.

9
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:40,401
Seriously, Larkin Sanchez?
You’re disgusting.

10
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:42,115
Whoever that girl is in the picture,

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,697
I hope you know the guy you’re
hugging already has a girlfriend!

12
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:45,789
Via!

13
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:47,491
I’m sorry.

14
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:48,492
Let him be. Come on.

15
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:50,411
I hope karma hits you both!

16
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:52,204
Isn’t she the one Larkin was
hugging over in España?

17
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:53,873
Who the fuck is that girl?

18
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:55,314
I thought she was just a fan!

19
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:59,009
I feel like he just used Clea so
he could become famous.

20
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:01,130
Yanna, how do I look?

21
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,631
You’re beautiful, Via.

22
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:04,175
And you have a good heart.

23
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:06,507
You’re still my baby, Via.

24
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:11,390
Are you going to
end things with him?

25
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:13,203
Clea!

26
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:16,687
OMG! I saw Clea
and Arkin’s side-chick

27
00:01:16,687 --> 00:01:18,522
in our subdivision yesterday.

28
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:20,441
She was picking a fight with Clea.

29
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:21,478
Hey, bitch!

30
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,526
You slut!

31
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:23,319
You’re going too far.

32
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,069
That’s enough—

33
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:25,070
Via!

34
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,460
Yes, Mommy Jo? Yeah.

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,257
I’ll see what I can do, okay?

36
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,499
Hi.

37
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:38,792
- Larkin?
- Yes, sir.

38
00:01:38,792 --> 00:01:41,003
Okay. Allie’s son?

39
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:41,754
Yes, sir.

40
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:43,297
Matt Villanueva from
Cloud Entertainment.

41
00:01:43,297 --> 00:01:44,340
Nice meeting you, sir.

42
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,467
All right. Okay.

43
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:49,595
So this is your dream, huh?

44
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:51,597
Because if it’s not, just tell me.

45
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:53,182
I don’t like wasting time.

46
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:55,097
Yes, sir.

47
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:56,578
Good, good.

48
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:58,575
So tell me,

49
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:00,751
how badly do you want this?

50
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:04,613
A lot of people are scrambling
for the position you’re in.

51
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:08,113
I really want this, sir.

52
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:13,556
I want to write songs and
act in movies and TV series.

53
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:14,578
Okay…

54
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:15,996
And most of all,
I want to be a director.

55
00:02:15,996 --> 00:02:17,498
That’s my end goal, sir.

56
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:19,667
Wow.

57
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,834
A dreamer.

58
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:22,378
- I like that!
- Yes, sir.

59
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:25,923
But big dreams
come at a big cost.

60
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,550
But don’t worry, I’m here.

61
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:31,929
Trust me. Follow my lead. I’ve got you.

62
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:34,265
We’ll make all your
dreams come true.

63
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:35,474
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

64
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:37,559
But let me warn you,

65
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:40,145
this won’t be easy.

66
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:47,152
Hey, relax!

67
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:48,487
We can do this.

68
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:50,990
That’s good. I like it.

69
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:03,877
You need to act like a couple.

70
00:03:03,877 --> 00:03:05,254
A real couple.

71
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:06,714
That’s what people want.

72
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:10,050
Sir, isn’t that kind
of deceiving the fans?

73
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,260
- If we do that?
- No, no.

74
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,680
That’s called
fan service, Larkin. Okay?

75
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,890
Give them what they want,
but not too much.

76
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:20,352
You just need to be
sweet together.

77
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:21,478
Keep them wanting more,

78
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:22,855
especially about
your relationship status.

79
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:24,148
That’s what we’re going to do.

80
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:25,587
Yes!

81
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:29,016
Why?

82
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:31,488
Is there a problem? Can’t you do it?

83
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:34,366
I thought this was your dream.

84
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:36,035
This is what you want, right?

85
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,330
Do you have a girlfriend?

86
00:03:39,613 --> 00:03:40,489
No, sir.

87
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:41,813
I can do it.

88
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:43,542
Good, good.

89
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:44,793
Good dreamer.

90
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:46,587
Good dreamer, let’s go!

91
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:10,170
- That’s enough—
- Slut!

92
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,923
- Washed up.
- You’re a one-hit wonder.

93
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:14,071
You’re washed up, outdated!

94
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:16,260
- That’s enough—
- Slut!

95
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:18,762
That suits you!

96
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:20,013
- You and Arkin don’t belong together.
- You deserve it!

97
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:20,722
Hey!

98
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:21,432
You’re going too far.

99
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:22,533
What is this?

100
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:23,267
Please stop.

101
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,268
What’s your problem?

102
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:25,269
Are you all crazy?

103
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:27,062
- Your daughter’s a side-chick!
- Go home already!

104
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:28,856
- She’s a slut!
- It’s true.

105
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:30,313
Get out of here!

106
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:32,192
- She’s a slut.
- Go!

107
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:33,861
She’s stealing Arkin—

108
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:35,112
- Want me to fight back?
- She’s such a whore!

109
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:36,280
- You better remember this day.
- Go home!

110
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,990
Wait for us.
We’ll come back for you.

111
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:39,950
Remember this!

112
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,048
You’re all insane!

113
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:42,661
- Go away!
- We’ll come back for you!

114
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:44,371
- Go away!
- We’ll come back for you!

115
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:45,828
So shameless!

116
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,053
Via… Sweetheart?

117
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:55,003
What if next time,

118
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:57,155
they deliberately drag
my family into this?

119
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:01,680
Sorry. I’m sorry.

120
00:06:11,732 --> 00:06:12,941
This is all my fault.

121
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,776
Papa, this is my fault. I’m sorry.

122
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:16,487
This is my fault. I’m so sorry.

123
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:18,155
It’s all my fault. I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry.

124
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:20,282
Papa, I’m sorry.

125
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:21,283
Sorry.

126
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,169
Mira? Ysha?

127
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,118
I’m sorry about what happened.

128
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:57,730
You shouldn’t have
been involved in this.

129
00:06:57,755 --> 00:06:59,632
You shouldn’t have been
dragged into this mess.

130
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:02,391
It’s not your fault, Via.

131
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:05,369
We’re always here for you, Via.

132
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:08,375
Thank you.

133
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,835
I’m really sorry.

134
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:17,548
Thank you. I’m sorry.

135
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,927
All right now.

136
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:23,595
Are you sure you’re both okay?

137
00:07:25,138 --> 00:07:26,807
Okay. Go get some rest.

138
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:28,709
You too, Via.

139
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:29,977
Yeah. I will. Later.

140
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:31,001
Okay.

141
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:40,648
I went through the same
thing with Mama before.

142
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:44,427
Until now, I still
haven’t forgotten it.

143
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:46,714
Is that Ivy Diaz?

144
00:07:47,053 --> 00:07:49,306
- That’s Ivy. The washed-up singer.
- Oh my gosh. Isn’t she past her prime?

145
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:50,581
Dude, she’s outdated!

146
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:52,307
What do you expect,
she got into drugs, man!

147
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:54,459
- Hey, washed up!
- What is this?

148
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,504
- She even has a guitar!
- Is this what being washed up looks like?

149
00:07:57,504 --> 00:08:01,633
Why don’t you just let her sing so
we can actually hear that voice of yours—

150
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:12,253
You’re washed up, and rude too.

151
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:51,308
Why do they have to see me
crying and being treated like this?

152
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:53,141
Via?

153
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:55,562
Larkin!

154
00:08:57,543 --> 00:09:01,501
Tell your sister, she has
no right to ruin ArClea!

155
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:03,111
Disgusting side-chick.

156
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:04,571
What did you just say?

157
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:05,405
Mira!

158
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:06,852
- Hey, what are you doing—
- Mira!

159
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,659
They’re saying all kinds
of things about you

160
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:10,369
when they don’t even know you!

161
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:12,245
I can’t just let
them do that, Via.

162
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:16,273
If I’m weak,

163
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:17,871
what will happen to them?

164
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:20,440
It feels like
everyone’s mad at me.

165
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,276
It feels like everyone’s saying that—

166
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:24,486
that I’m a slut.

167
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:25,529
Fuck them!

168
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,906
Who the hell are they to have
an opinion about you?

169
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:29,533
Now that everything’s
out in the open,

170
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:30,659
Larkin wants to quit.

171
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:33,161
But he can’t because
we both signed a contract.

172
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:37,249
You know all of this won’t
do him or his career any good.

173
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:39,251
And for my career,

174
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:40,877
I won’t let anyone ruin it.

175
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,420
Not Larkin.

176
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:44,047
Not Adi.

177
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:45,590
Not anyone.

178
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:01,815
Hello?

179
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:04,693
Where are you?

180
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:07,696
We need to talk.

181
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,866
Via, I’m sorry.
I’m at a shoot right now.

182
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:14,744
Did something happen?
Are you okay?

183
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,705
I need to talk to you now.

184
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:19,332
I’ll go there instead.

185
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:20,500
I don’t care about your schedule.

186
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,710
I don’t care if you’re busy.

187
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,285
We need to talk right now.

188
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:27,757
I’ll find a way.

189
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:30,176
I’ll go to your house, Via.

190
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,741
Via?

191
00:10:57,704 --> 00:10:58,705
Larkin.

192
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:29,778
Can we still make this work?

193
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:47,180
I can.

194
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:49,416
You?

195
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:57,870
I can’t do this anymore.

196
00:12:04,663 --> 00:12:06,415
It’s getting too much.

197
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:10,632
Even my family

198
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:13,245
is getting dragged into this.

199
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:26,140
Maybe it’s time to stop.

200
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,841
Just focus on your career.

201
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:39,264
Tell them that we’re over.

202
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:42,976
Be loyal to Clea instead.

203
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:45,562
Tell them that she’s the
only woman in your life.

204
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:47,731
Tell them.

205
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,692
Say that there was never an us.

206
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:51,804
Say that...

207
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:55,595
Say that I was the one
who kept chasing after you.

208
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:58,074
That I was the one
who kissed you that night.

209
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:09,897
Via, come on…

210
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:15,425
I don’t want to.

211
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:19,864
Don’t make me do that, Via.

212
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:25,226
Don’t do this to me, too.
Asking me to do something

213
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:26,603
I don’t want to do.

214
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:31,124
But that’s what
will save your career.

215
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,883
Do you think I want
what’s happening right now?

216
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:43,762
I’m sacrificing myself
for your own good.

217
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:47,665
Do you think I like being
stared at when I go outside?

218
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:51,976
Being confronted, having things
thrown at me on the street?

219
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:01,728
Kino, it hurts.

220
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:04,272
It really hurts.

221
00:14:09,556 --> 00:14:10,932
Via, I’ll quit.

222
00:14:11,314 --> 00:14:13,066
I’ll give up my career. Everything.

223
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,646
Just not this. Please?

224
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:17,233
I don’t want this anymore.

225
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:20,406
And I hate seeing you suffer
like this even more.

226
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:21,783
so please, Via.

227
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,151
Via—

228
00:14:27,497 --> 00:14:29,499
I can’t lose you, Via.

229
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:32,393
Damn it. It hurts me
too when I read

230
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:33,545
what people are saying,

231
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:35,088
because I know
that’s not who you are.

232
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:38,800
Do they even know
how you stepped up

233
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,552
as a mother to your siblings?

234
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:42,262
Do they know everything
you went through?

235
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:43,346
For your family?

236
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:45,974
Have they seen how you love, Via?

237
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,099
Larkin, it already happened.

238
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,743
Via, what can I do?

239
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,483
Whatever it is, just tell me.
I’ll do anything.

240
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:10,874
Via, please.

241
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:19,392
Via—

242
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,647
I’ve managed to endure
all the pain before, right?

243
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:30,668
I’ve endured everything.

244
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:35,155
But with this, I can’t.

245
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:41,571
I’m sorry.

246
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,616
I’m sorry, I really
can’t do this anymore.

247
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:12,018
I should be the one
apologizing to you.

248
00:16:13,397 --> 00:16:15,524
Your whole life,
I was right beside you.

249
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,226
We’ve been together

250
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:20,948
our whole lives.

251
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,780
But now that you’re
suffering this much,

252
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:30,598
I’m not there for you.

253
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,486
Via, I know I keep repeating
myself, but I’m sorry.

254
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,792
I’m sorry that—

255
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,438
I’m sorry that until now,

256
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:50,634
I still can’t stay by your side
while you face all of this.

257
00:17:13,448 --> 00:17:17,452
I promised myself I wouldn’t
let you go through this alone.

258
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,501
I’m sorry that now,
and in these past few days,

259
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:26,878
I couldn’t even do that.

260
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:45,188
I’m not used
to life without you.

261
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:51,528
I never thought the
day would come

262
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:54,948
when we’d be apart,
but here it is.

263
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,955
I really want to stay by your side.

264
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:10,088
I really want to, but I can’t anymore.

265
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,054
In everything I do, I think of you.

266
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,349
I’m sorry.

267
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,312
I tried everything to protect you,

268
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:11,149
but you’re still getting hurt.

269
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,597
Thank you for staying by my side.

270
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,438
But I think it’s time
to let you go.

271
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,281
I love you as a friend,

272
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,283
as a girlfriend,

273
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,119
as you, Via.

274
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,080
I love you.

275
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:13,253
And I’ll love you

276
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,589
until you’re able
to love yourself again.

277
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:15,065
Can you handle it, Via?

278
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,942
Can you handle
not having me around?

279
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,111
Can you handle
not being with me?

280
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,697
Via, I can handle it.

281
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:24,908
But I didn’t say I wanted to.

282
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,341
Why do you keep
following me around?

283
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,399
Because we’re best friends.

284
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:42,777
We go to school together
every day, don’t we?

285
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:44,571
Since pre-school even, right?

286
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,364
Then we should keep it
that way until college.

287
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,116
And when we start working,
we’ll still go together.

288
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,617
No excuses.

289
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,162
Can’t you live without me?

290
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:53,355
Nope.

291
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:07,260
Friends?
We’re the best of friends!

292
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,053
Our friendship won’t end

293
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:10,763
just because of
a small misunderstanding.

294
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:13,560
Even if we change a lot,

295
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:14,809
no matter what happens,

296
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:16,536
nothing changes
between us, okay?

297
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,562
Promise?

298
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,565
Promise.

299
00:23:33,786 --> 00:23:34,787
Via…

300
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,540
I think I have feelings for you.

301
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,125
You’re just confused.

302
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,085
You don’t have
feelings for me, Kino.

303
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,716
Via, I love you.

304
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,885
Not just as a friend.

305
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,803
I know you already know that,

306
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:53,681
so why are you
still avoiding it?

307
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:58,978
Damn it, Larkin.

308
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:00,396
How do you really feel?

309
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,065
Do you love me?

310
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,148
Of course!

311
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:06,819
We’re friends, aren’t we?

312
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,447
Push me away if you’re
not in love with me.

313
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,501
Kino, I can’t do this anymore.

314
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,878
I don’t want to be just a friend.

315
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,256
Via, I love you.

316
00:24:27,006 --> 00:24:28,716
Let’s stop being friends now.

317
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:36,182
I’ve written so many
songs about you,

318
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,101
for you.

319
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,853
I just want you to know that—

320
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:47,819
I love you more than every
lyric I could ever write.

321
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,989
And thank you

322
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,367
for choosing to love me the most,

323
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,995
even when so many
people already admire you.

324
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,291
I love you so much, Kino.

325
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:19,073
There’s still a whole
lifetime ahead of us, Via.

326
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,562
And I’ll make sure

327
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,108
we spend every
anniversary together.

328
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:28,484
From the second,

329
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:30,570
to the silver,

330
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,032
even up to the
centennial anniversary.

331
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,453
You’re the only one
I want to grow old with.

332
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,773
Don’t take this off, okay?

333
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:09,400
I’m your only best friend.

334
00:26:09,984 --> 00:26:11,319
Of course.

335
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,446
It’s always been just you.

336
00:26:56,391 --> 00:26:58,602
This is it. It’s finally over.

337
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:02,492
Five years we spent
together in this university.

338
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:06,203
Five years of
struggling just to pass,

339
00:27:06,228 --> 00:27:08,921
staying up late
just to finish our plates.

340
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:12,968
Five years of enduring
everything just to earn this diploma.

341
00:27:12,993 --> 00:27:14,055
And now… here we are.

342
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:16,422
At last,
I’ve finished my studies.

343
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:18,122
We’ve graduated.

344
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:19,639
Together.

345
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:39,574
I’m here again.

346
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,619
I’m with all of our children.

347
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,956
Via has already graduated.

348
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,002
I know you’d be happy right now.

349
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,839
I wish you had
been there to see it.

350
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:02,353
There’s nothing new about that.

351
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:04,505
It’s not the only thing
she didn’t get to witness.

352
00:28:05,209 --> 00:28:07,711
She didn’t see
how I grew up either.

353
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:11,282
How I took on all
the responsibilities at home.

354
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:15,102
How I raised my siblings
and took care of Papa.

355
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:18,881
How I kept everything
in our house together.

356
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,207
Aren’t you going
to talk to your mom?

357
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,346
Come on, let’s go over there first.

358
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,036
Was it all worth it, Ma?

359
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,126
When you think about
all the people you loved

360
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:17,255
who slipped away while you
were busy chasing your dreams…

361
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,217
Was it all worth it?

362
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,142
I wanted you to
reach your dreams, too.

363
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,563
I wanted you to be able
to do what you wanted.

364
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,069
But was that
really the only way?

365
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,294
Maybe that’s why
I never had big dreams.

366
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,717
Maybe that’s why
I’m actually afraid to dream.

367
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,557
Because I’m scared that
I might lose a part of me

368
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,852
while I’m busy
chasing those dreams.

369
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:17,607
My family. Arkin…

370
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,652
Myself.

371
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,363
Damn it.

372
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,076
It’s really hard
when I love the people

373
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,828
around me more
than I love myself…

374
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,084
But you don’t need to worry.

375
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,541
I’ll take care of my siblings.

376
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,204
I’ll take care of them.
I’ll do everything.

377
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:52,482
I’ll make sure
our lives will be okay.

378
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,686
Even if it means

379
00:30:56,797 --> 00:30:58,924
I have to give up my dreams.

380
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,978
You’re an architectural apprentice

381
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,439
at Valeria Construction Group?

382
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,357
Yes, ma’am.

383
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,736
Then why are you
applying as a waitress?

384
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,408
Why don’t you just focus
on being an apprentice?

385
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:53,077
It’s for extra income while
I’m still waiting for the board exams.

386
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,955
I want to help my
family as soon as possible.

387
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,333
Ma’am,

388
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,170
I know I don’t have
any experience,

389
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,214
but I promise I’m a fast learner.

390
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,967
All right. You can
start tomorrow night.

391
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,260
Really?

392
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,220
Thank you so much, ma’am.

393
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,513
I promise,
I’ll really do my best.

394
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,015
All right. Do your best, okay?

395
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,266
Thank you, ma’am.

396
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,947
I want that scaled properly.

397
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,334
I really don’t want
any last-minute corrections.

398
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:37,296
Also, there’s a meeting tomorrow
with Mr. Dagdag at 10:00 a.m.

399
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,333
Follow up as well if our meeting
with Mrs. Chang is still on.

400
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,585
Did you get everything, Ms. Diaz?

401
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,380
Ma’am, sorry, what was the—

402
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,589
Ma’am, sorry, what was
the last thing you said?

403
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,882
I’m really sorry.

404
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,510
Ms. Diaz, I know you’re new,

405
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,137
but in this job, you can’t be slow.

406
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,389
Here.

407
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:56,616
Prepare this entire deck

408
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,685
for the son of
one of our clients.

409
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,103
Present it to me
tomorrow morning

410
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,689
before our meeting
with Mr. Dagdag.

411
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,711
Yes, ma’am.

412
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,692
Thank you, ma’am.

413
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,258
Thank you.

414
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,411
Welcome.

415
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,121
Reservation for Sir Chris?

416
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,080
Yes, please.

417
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,123
All right, right this way.

418
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,332
Here you go.

419
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,834
Thank you.

420
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,335
Ma’am, here’s our menu.

421
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,087
Please call me when
you’re ready to order.

422
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,046
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

423
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,446
Miss, can you
follow up on this, please?

424
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:30,278
- Just a moment, please.
- Thank you.

425
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,014
Here’s your order, sir.

426
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,807
Thank you. Enjoy!

427
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,808
Thank you so much.

428
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,603
You still good?

429
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,480
I’ll take over here for now.

430
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,940
Go get some rest for a bit.

431
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,401
I’m okay. Thanks.

432
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,532
You sure?

433
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,820
All right, I’ll stay here then.

434
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,905
- Thanks.
- Miss, excuse me!

435
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,282
We’re ready to order.

436
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,533
Just a moment, please.

437
00:33:57,611 --> 00:33:59,196
What would you
like to order, ma’am?

438
00:33:59,566 --> 00:34:03,361
Two classic beef burgers,
and two tuna aglio olio.

439
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,293
All right.

440
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,505
Thank you.

441
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,694
You can do this, Via.
Just a little more.

442
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,948
You can do this.
This isn’t just for your dreams,

443
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,866
it’s for your family too.

444
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,235
Hang in there.

445
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,957
You can do this.

446
00:36:11,364 --> 00:36:12,391
Via?

447
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,005
Huh?

448
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,907
You’re not asleep yet?

449
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,467
I’ll sleep in a bit.

450
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,012
I’m just finishing packing your food.

451
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,514
Via, you have work later.

452
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,892
You should rest first.

453
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,750
I’m fine.

454
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,858
Oh no, it’s okay. Mira,
I’ll do it. I’ve got it.

455
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,026
- It’s okay.
- This is easy, Via.

456
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:35,776
I’ll do it, I’ll do it.

457
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,695
It’s okay, it’s okay.

458
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,698
Via, can you teach me
how to cook rice?

459
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:45,450
And how to fry food,
and all the house chores.

460
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,954
I already know how,

461
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,457
but I still want to learn more.

462
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,836
Why do you suddenly
want me to teach you?

463
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,671
Why do you suddenly
want to learn?

464
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,717
So when you’re busy or tired,

465
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:02,845
I’ll be here to help you.

466
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,727
Mira—

467
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,521
I’m okay.

468
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,357
I can handle it.

469
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,984
Just get some rest for now.

470
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:17,860
Go to sleep.

471
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,738
Get more sleep so you’ll
have energy for school.

472
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,324
But I want to help, Via.

473
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,203
I understand you. Don’t worry.

474
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,666
I know you’ve already
made so many sacrifices

475
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,042
for our family.

476
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,453
Didn’t you say it yourself

477
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,674
that it’s just us
helping each other, right?

478
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,510
So please let me help too,

479
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,595
even if it’s just a little.

480
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,771
Okay, come here.

481
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,566
This is really easy.
I know you can manage.

482
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,403
But you don’t have to
do it all the time, okay?

483
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,727
Okay.

484
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:04,073
I already put in two cups.

485
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,492
Rinse the rice twice, then drain.

486
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:10,680
Add in two cups of water after.

487
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,207
The ratio of rice
to water is one to one.

488
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,208
Like this?

489
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,001
Wash it first.

490
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,460
- Doesn’t matter how much water you use.
- Okay.

491
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,504
And then—

492
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,590
So that’s how it is.

493
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,094
This is easy. I can do this.

494
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,266
Now don’t spill the rice.

495
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,741
Your presentation
was kind of good,

496
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,659
but it still needs polishing.

497
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,121
You’re a Panther alumna, right?

498
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,852
Yes, ma’am.

499
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,696
We always expect excellence
from España graduates.

500
00:38:57,916 --> 00:39:00,293
As the seniors here like to say,

501
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:02,703
mediocrity has no place here.

502
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,136
So next time,
you know what to do. Okay?

503
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:08,613
Yes, ma’am.

504
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,430
Excuse me.

505
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,515
I’ll do better next time. Thank you, ma’am.

506
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:26,452
Oh my gosh. Larkin is speaking!

507
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,698
I told you!

508
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,491
Don’t be loud.

509
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,664
Jeez! Okay, fine.

510
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,662
I just want to repeat that
Clea and I weren’t official

511
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,039
when that incident happened.

512
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,999
And to answer your question,

513
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,502
the woman in the photo
is my childhood friend.

514
00:39:39,697 --> 00:39:41,490
So, we’ve been
close for a long time.

515
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,006
Okay, so what happened?

516
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,466
Why does the photo
look like that?

517
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,594
She was drunk back then,
so that’s how it happened.

518
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,639
Clea already knows about it.
I told her, so we’re okay.

519
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,933
Clea and I are okay,
and that’s what’s important.

520
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,812
And I’m not in contact
with that friend anymore,

521
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:01,148
so please, stop going after her.

522
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,503
Girl, you still okay?

523
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,463
Still fighting.

524
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,301
Ma’am, excuse me,
this is our last call.

525
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,428
If you want—

526
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,722
- Did you miss me?
- Sam!

527
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,933
Hi! Hello!

528
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,020
What are you doing here?

529
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,647
I heard you work here,

530
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,984
and I just got back from an
out-of-the-country business trip.

531
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,820
And I wanted to
give you your souvenir.

532
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,073
Thank you.

533
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,241
Are you ordering something?

534
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,784
I’ll ask if we can still make it

535
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,078
since the kitchen
already took last orders.

536
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,623
Via, I know you need
a friend right now,

537
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:01,975
and I’m here to listen.

538
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,261
Samantha Vera?

539
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,597
Ma’am, it’s Sam!

540
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,115
Let’s take a picture, come on!

541
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,810
Ms. Sam,
can we take a photo?

542
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,811
Sure.

543
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,649
Come on, come on.

544
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,482
There.

545
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,233
One more. One, two—

546
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,111
One, two… There you go.

547
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:29,904
Thank you.

548
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,113
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

549
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,907
- Thank you! Let’s go.
- Thank you.

550
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,087
Good thing you agreed
to do a video greeting

551
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,506
for the owner’s child.

552
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,133
I was finally allowed
to take a break.

553
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,392
How are you?

554
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:03,796
Huh?

555
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,108
I’m okay, I guess.

556
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,977
I’m still managing.

557
00:42:13,217 --> 00:42:14,218
You?

558
00:42:15,308 --> 00:42:16,559
How are you?

559
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:18,961
Busy.

560
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,766
But I can manage.

561
00:42:26,101 --> 00:42:27,102
Hey.

562
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,589
If you need someone
to talk to, I’m here.

563
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,217
You know that, right?

564
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:35,803
Please don’t keep it all inside.

565
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,683
You too.

566
00:42:42,203 --> 00:42:44,562
Don’t keep everything
to yourself either, okay?

567
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,814
You always tell other people that,

568
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:50,134
but you never do it for yourself.

569
00:42:52,129 --> 00:42:53,631
Yes, it’s hard.

570
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,739
We want to hide everything

571
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,908
because we don’t want
to burden other people.

572
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:02,321
But, like you said,

573
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:05,157
it’s hard to keep
everything to yourself.

574
00:43:06,258 --> 00:43:07,876
So, I’m here.

575
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,796
Just tell me whenever
you’re ready.

576
00:43:13,145 --> 00:43:14,146
Thank you.

577
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,430
But...

578
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:21,724
I’m worrying more about you.

579
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,439
I actually visited Arkin
as soon as I got back.

580
00:43:29,825 --> 00:43:31,535
He looks fine,

581
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:37,489
but he kept asking me
to check on you.

582
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,409
- All he could talk about was you—
- Sam.

583
00:43:45,286 --> 00:43:47,664
I didn’t really want to
talk about that anymore.

584
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,884
I also ran into Clea.

585
00:43:58,272 --> 00:43:59,273
You know what,

586
00:44:00,176 --> 00:44:03,388
I understand why she
wants to protect her image.

587
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:08,270
She was raised to be a celebrity

588
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,105
ever since she was a kid.

589
00:44:10,872 --> 00:44:14,501
She worked hard
and achieved all of this.

590
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,905
So, are you mad at her?

591
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,201
Why would I be mad at her

592
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:27,206
when all she did was
cover for and protect us?

593
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,751
I understand

594
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,797
where she’s coming from.

595
00:44:35,303 --> 00:44:39,526
And if what we did
ends up ruining her career,

596
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:44,382
then we really
need to stop, right?

597
00:44:50,696 --> 00:44:51,697
Okay.

598
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,858
If this makes you feel better—

599
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:58,470
Clea likes someone else.

600
00:44:58,773 --> 00:45:01,323
Adonis. You know him, right?

601
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,827
Adi, my ex-crush?

602
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,237
Back in college.

603
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,166
Remember? Okay.

604
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,753
Well, I don’t think
her feelings for him

605
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:17,214
will go away anytime soon.

606
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,007
And I think Adi feels the same.

607
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,971
He’s just trying to stop her
from doing impulsive things.

608
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,014
She has a contract, so—

609
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,435
So he couldn’t be with her either.

610
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,396
Turns out he’s struggling
with the situation too,

611
00:45:32,423 --> 00:45:34,216
he just doesn’t show it.

612
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,775
Adonis and I are kind of similar.

613
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:43,000
The difference is, I tried. He didn’t.

614
00:45:43,025 --> 00:45:47,859
I wish I hadn’t gotten
myself into this situation.

615
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,414
I didn’t realize I couldn’t handle it.

616
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,501
I’m not mad at Clea.

617
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,047
Please tell her,
in case she thinks that.

618
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,095
For now, I’m just going
to focus on my apprenticeship

619
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,597
and my part-time job.

620
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:10,504
At least I’m able to help Papa now.

621
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:16,148
We’re all proud of you, Via.

622
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,278
And if you need anything,
I’m right here.

623
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,740
Don’t be shy, just tell me.

624
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,369
Thank you, Sam. You’ve already
helped us so much.

625
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,705
I’m managing for now.

626
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,124
We even have
extra pay this weekend

627
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,667
because we’re going
to be catering an event.

628
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,171
But thank you, really. Thanks a lot.

629
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,256
Of course.

630
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,094
Aren’t you jet-lagged?

631
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,638
Not really.

632
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:52,267
I really came to give you
your gift and to check on you.

633
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,353
It’s been a while.

634
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,896
Thank you.

635
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,105
Of course.

636
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,322
A lot of people are asking
how one became successful—

637
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,494
a Filipina architect abroad.

638
00:47:06,518 --> 00:47:08,534
Who do you think our
surprise guest will be?

639
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,327
- I don’t know, but—
-I heard it’s a famous singer.

640
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,914
- It started the day I chose to leave.
- I hope he’s handsome!

641
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:18,752
Those days were
extremely hard and heavy.

642
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,380
To risk everything

643
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:25,592
and leave the life I was used to.

644
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,680
Especially the
people I loved here.

645
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,773
Spain is not easy.

646
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,770
I started all over again from scratch.

647
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,692
But it gave me space
and room to grow.

648
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,277
And eventually,

649
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:47,364
it gave me a chance
to build something real.

650
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,241
Not just buildings,

651
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:54,162
but also a life I can be proud of.

652
00:47:55,455 --> 00:48:01,023
I didn’t just build
projects for my clients.

653
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,383
I was also able to build
a home for my parents.

654
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:10,888
And I was able to help
my siblings finish school.

655
00:48:11,575 --> 00:48:13,077
And if you ask me

656
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,019
if I would make that
same decision again?

657
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:19,250
Most definitely—

658
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,523
Yes!

659
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,026
Thank you.

660
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,656
Thank you for that
inspiring message,

661
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,158
Architect Kaydee Benito.

662
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,327
All right, everyone.

663
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:37,331
We have a very special
guest to serenade us.

664
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,918
To sing his newest song,
“Under The Moonlight”

665
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,628
let us all welcome—

666
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,421
Larkin Sanchez!

667
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,146
Hi, this is Larkin Sanchez,

668
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,857
paying tribute to all architects.

669
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,985
I know the hard work you
all went through to get to

670
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,362
where you are today.

671
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,822
I’m going to sing
my newest song,

672
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,282
“Under The Moonlight.”

673
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,745
This song is about

674
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,790
begging for someone to stay.

675
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:26,254
He’s remembering all the
promises they made together.

676
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,591
The promise that
they would stay together.

677
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,844
Like how the lyrics go,

678
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:37,015
“didn’t you say
we’d grow old together?”

679
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,686
“Didn’t you promise that
neither of us would give up?”

680
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:44,690
“Didn’t you say you
loved me and all our plans?

681
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:46,566
Didn’t you?”

682
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,026
Music, please.

683
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,406

Damn it, Larkin!

717
00:54:58,081 --> 00:54:59,749
You’re so careless!

718
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:00,880
What was that?

719
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,382
Dating behind the camera?

720
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,466
Is that true?

721
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,635
Did you forget you have Clea?

722
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,013
Larkin, what is this?

723
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,685
Do you think you can survive
all of this crap without my help?

724
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,812
I had to cut my trip
to the States short

725
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,189
just to be here
and fix everything!

726
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,741
Just so you know,

727
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,068
the endorsements
you and Clea have,

728
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,212
they’re threatening to pull out.

729
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,279
What are you going to do?

730
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,656
What?

731
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,993
There, there,
that look on your face.

732
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,540
That face. So I’m the
one fixing this again?

733
00:55:32,565 --> 00:55:33,566
As always!

734
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,249
Yes, sir, we’re already
working on it.

735
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:39,002
- Yes.
- Good job.

736
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,421
Yes.

737
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:43,324
From now on,

738
00:55:43,767 --> 00:55:46,790
you’re not touching that phone
without my consent.

739
00:55:46,815 --> 00:55:50,402
And you’ll be staying in
a hotel with your road manager

740
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,403
so you can be monitored,

741
00:55:51,428 --> 00:55:53,013
because you might
mess things up again!

742
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,415
- Sir, can’t we—
- No.

743
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,376
- Sir, maybe we can—
- Give it to me!

744
00:55:58,190 --> 00:55:59,191
Give it to me!

745
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:00,740
Give it to me!

746
00:56:00,765 --> 00:56:01,766
Sir, please.

747
00:56:02,922 --> 00:56:04,090
I’m sorry, Larkin!

748
00:56:04,743 --> 00:56:05,927
You made me do this.

749
00:56:07,223 --> 00:56:08,641
Things will get worse.

750
00:56:11,691 --> 00:56:12,692
Joey!

751
00:56:17,564 --> 00:56:18,648
That too. Give it to me.

752
00:56:20,426 --> 00:56:21,386
Give it!

753
00:56:21,826 --> 00:56:24,078
- Sir, I’ll just keep it—
- Give that to me!

754
00:56:24,103 --> 00:56:25,271
Give it!

755
00:56:25,296 --> 00:56:26,738
Sir, I just won’t
wear it outside.

756
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:27,764
Sir, please—

757
00:56:28,565 --> 00:56:29,774
Just listen to me!

758
00:56:29,799 --> 00:56:31,384
Who’s the manager
between the two of us?

759
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,140
Where’s your bracelet?

760
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:38,314
Shit. I lost it, Via. I’m sorry.

761
00:56:40,921 --> 00:56:42,465
I’m not just
protecting you here,

762
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,317
I’m also protecting your girl.

763
00:56:44,979 --> 00:56:47,232
And is that woman
really that important?

764
00:56:47,257 --> 00:56:49,008
That you’d risk your own career?

765
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:50,702
Everything we worked for?

766
00:56:52,915 --> 00:56:53,916
Larkin.

767
00:56:55,265 --> 00:56:56,475
That woman

768
00:56:57,283 --> 00:56:58,952
will be the end of you.

769
00:57:06,996 --> 00:57:11,587
That woman is my beginning, sir.

770
00:57:45,493 --> 00:57:47,282
You went through a lot together,

771
00:57:48,295 --> 00:57:50,814
but just like that, she ‘s gone.

772
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,053
Love is so unfair.

773
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,307
Nothing ever lasts in this world.

774
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,558
I’m done too.

775
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:02,061
Am I a bad person?

776
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,105
We promised a future together.

777
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,734
How am I supposed
to get used to this?

778
00:58:08,868 --> 00:58:10,578
You won’t get used to it, bro.

779
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,494
Go see Arkin and say goodbye.

780
00:58:25,454 --> 00:58:26,455
Hi.

781
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,048
Via?
