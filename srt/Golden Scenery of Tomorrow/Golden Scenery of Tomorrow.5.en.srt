1
00:00:25,914 --> 00:00:27,749
Here’s the lunch box
I borrowed from you.

2
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:30,206
Thanks too, Pres.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,127
Sorry.

4
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:38,451
I can’t stand being
away from you anymore.

5
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:40,061
Via, I’m really sorry.

6
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:41,295
I’m sorry, please.

7
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:42,802
It’s fine now.

8
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:46,138
Pres is graduating soon.

9
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:47,390
When are you going to confess?

10
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:49,433
Maybe I don’t have to. Right?

11
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,726
What if

12
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:52,520
you confess
during the field trip?

13
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:04,657
Via’s got something to say.

14
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:05,808
Want some churros?

15
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:08,244
I like you.

16
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:15,242
I’m sorry, Via.

17
00:01:17,763 --> 00:01:19,265
I like someone else.

18
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:27,972
I don’t have a crush anymore.

19
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:29,939
Forget about not having a crush.

20
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:39,590
Just have a crush on me instead,

21
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,217
since I have
a crush on you anyway.

22
00:01:45,054 --> 00:01:46,264
Look at them.

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,183
Wow, they look so crazy.

24
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:50,643
They’re so hyper, right?

25
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:52,728
Just remember,

26
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:54,981
we’re always here for you.

27
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:56,816
Your friends.

28
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:58,359
I got you something.

29
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,443
Happy birthday!

30
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:02,196
Don’t take it off, okay?

31
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:03,462
Promise?

32
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:06,212
Kino.

33
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:08,244
Eat first. Don’t skip your meals.

34
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:09,453
Arkin!

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,250
Naya, it feels like I haven’t seen
you in the music club for a while.

36
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:17,336
Why? Did you miss me?

37
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,419
Kino forgot his lunch box again.

38
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:00,940
Wait a minute, okay?

39
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,153
Via?

40
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,488
- Oh!
- Were you looking for me?

41
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:08,948
Huh?

42
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,449
Your—

43
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:12,827
Here’s your lunch.
You forgot it.

44
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:14,036
Okay.

45
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:15,788
- Here. You should eat first.
- Thank you.

46
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,623
I’ll go now. I don’t want
to be a bother.

47
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:19,417
A bother? No, not at all.

48
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:20,626
Have you eaten yet?
Let’s eat together.

49
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,461
No, it’s fine.
I already ate. I’m full.

50
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:24,027
I’m really full. Thanks for asking.

51
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:25,673
Arkin!

52
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:27,675
Arkin, let’s go back inside.

53
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:32,304
Let’s continue what we were doing.

54
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,807
We’re practicing since we’re
doing a duet for the club fair.

55
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,892
- Go ahead. Bye now.
- Okay.

56
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:38,967
Good luck. Take care!

57
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:52,073
There’s nothing wrong
if Arkin gets a girlfriend.

58
00:04:52,118 --> 00:04:54,746
That’s actually good.
It might help him mature.

59
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:57,995
But how would that
affect our friendship?

60
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:03,627
Hey.

61
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:05,671
You’re spacing out?

62
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:10,248
Huh? It’s nothing.

63
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:12,808
I was just thinking.

64
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:14,972
It’s from this movie I watched.

65
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:18,142
There was this one scene
that really got me thinking.

66
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:19,685
What do you guys think?

67
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:23,856
Let’s say, a guy best friend
gets himself a girlfriend.

68
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,858
What happens then?

69
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:32,281
Will he stop having time
for his girl best friend?

70
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:35,284
Of course.

71
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:39,305
He’d rather hang out with
his girlfriend than his friend.

72
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,627
Friends will always be around.
While couples break up.

73
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:51,800
You know, the girlfriend
might also get jealous,

74
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,113
so he’d probably see his
girl best friend less often.

75
00:05:57,806 --> 00:05:59,099
I kinda agree.

76
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,228
But for me, you need
to make time for both.

77
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:05,397
You can’t just drop your best friend
because you have a girlfriend.

78
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:08,317
They’re both important.

79
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,364
That movie sounds nice.
What’s it called?

80
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,242
Huh?

81
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:17,826
Oh—

82
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:23,624
I can’t remember.
I forgot the title.

83
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:29,296
I think the title is,
The Life Story of Via and Arkin.

84
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:31,924
Just admit it.

85
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,008
Come on.

86
00:06:33,008 --> 00:06:34,843
It’s just a movie.

87
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:36,095
Just a movie, huh?

88
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,137
- Fine then.
- Okay.

89
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:38,389
Let’s just study.

90
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:39,497
Right.

91
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,475
Sounds very similar.

92
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:49,238
- Let’s go, Via!
- Let’s go, Via!

93
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,859
That’s it!

94
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:52,486
Oh my god!

95
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:54,613
Oh my god!

96
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:02,204
Arkin, Arkin.

97
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:03,956
- Can we take a picture with you?
- Can we take a picture with you?

98
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,708
Oh my gosh,
you’re so handsome.

99
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:10,379
Go, Valeria!

100
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:14,008
Shay, set it for me.

101
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:26,687
Thank you!

102
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,147
I’ll take photos of the game now.

103
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,727
Hey, isn’t that your crush?

104
00:08:06,727 --> 00:08:08,020
You like that one, right?

105
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,730
And that one too.

106
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:18,030
Oh my lord! Oh dear!

107
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,949
You’ve been cheating on me
this whole time?

108
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:23,118
We’ve been together for so long!

109
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:24,745
You bastard!

110
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,592
Via, we can also do that.

111
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:44,473
Wow! Who was that?

112
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:46,642
Amazing!

113
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:49,144
Via, Via.

114
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:50,354
- Via!
- How do you do it?

115
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:53,357
Pardon me.

116
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:55,109
Excuse me
Excuse me, please.

117
00:08:55,109 --> 00:08:57,027
- Let’s not be too loud.
- What’s up?

118
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:01,115
You know that song
“I’ll Say It Now.” right?

119
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:03,325
Yeah. Why?

120
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:04,785
Be my duet partner.

121
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:06,662
Looks like Naya’s gonna be late.

122
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:07,496
Me?

123
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:08,497
Yeah.

124
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:10,457
Up there on stage?

125
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,876
Kino, no, I don’t want to.

126
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:14,712
Via, please.

127
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:16,588
Just this once.

128
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:18,966
Kino, you already know why I can’t.

129
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,259
I don’t want to!

130
00:09:21,552 --> 00:09:24,430
Okay. I understand.

131
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:27,766
I’ll just sing alone then.

132
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:31,228
I’ll go ahead.

133
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,021
Kino!

134
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:36,738
Fine.

135
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:38,444
I’ll go with you.

136
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:39,945
Really?

137
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,072
Yes.

138
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,908
Okay, let’s go.

139
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:02,384
What a very impactful
and high-level performance

140
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,511
from our representative
of the school choir.

141
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:08,458
To keep the excitement going,
let’s call on our next performers.

142
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,476
Let’s welcome
from the Music Club,

143
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:13,979
Larkin Sanchez and his vocalist,
Avianna Diaz!

144
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:40,982
Go Arkin!

145
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,007
I love you!

146
00:10:53,644 --> 00:10:55,354
Via, don’t be nervous.

147
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:56,772
You got this.

148
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:59,233
Kino, there are so many people.

149
00:10:59,942 --> 00:11:02,444
Everyone’s watching.
I don’t think I can do this.

150
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,782

Absolutely amazing!

169
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:08,111
Via, thank you so much.

170
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,863
You’re a total lifesaver.
Seriously.

171
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,282
And didn’t I tell you?
Your voice is incredible.

172
00:13:12,282 --> 00:13:14,826
Didn’t you hear all
the cheering and clapping?

173
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:16,745
So, what do you think?

174
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,242
Let’s do this again next time!

175
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:21,124
Next time? There’s no next time.

176
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:22,793
I did it because you
didn’t have a duet partner.

177
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:24,336
Next time, if you don’t have a partner,

178
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,879
you’re on your own!

179
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,260
You know how things
went with mom,

180
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:36,723
how fame and music
messed her up.

181
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:40,852
Yeah, I get it.

182
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:42,813
I’m sorry, Via.

183
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:47,234
That’s why what you did
for me means so much.

184
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:48,625
Thank you.

185
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,991
Tell Naya to not
be late next time, okay?

186
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:55,742
She’s got a nice voice.

187
00:13:56,326 --> 00:13:57,327
But she was late.

188
00:13:57,327 --> 00:13:58,787
Your voice is better.

189
00:14:00,998 --> 00:14:03,417
You’re just saying that because
I’m right in front of you.

190
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:06,753
Come on, I know Naya’s voice
is better than mine.

191
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:09,297
And besides, you two are
pretty close, right?

192
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,134
Your voice is better,
and what do you mean, close?

193
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,468
Who said that?

194
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:18,473
Didn’t you almost
kiss the other day?

195
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:22,019
What are you talking about? When?

196
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:26,023
The other day, when I came
to bring you your lunch.

197
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:36,758
Wait a minute, okay?

198
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:45,917
That looked like we were
about to kiss to you?

199
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,045
She just wiped something off my face!

200
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:49,379
I was even annoyed
when she did it.

201
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:50,390
And

202
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,257
didn’t we agree

203
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:54,780
that our first kiss
would be with each other?

204
00:14:56,803 --> 00:14:58,388
When would that even happen?

205
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:00,515
Right now.

206
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:05,645
Here.

207
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,851
Ouch!

208
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:11,485
That hurt, Via!

209
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,820
- I’m sorry.
- Why did you do that?

210
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,238
I thought you wanted a slap.

211
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:16,359
I’m sorry.

212
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:21,119
I thought I was finally
getting my first kiss.

213
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,371
You really are
a volleyball player, Via.

214
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,174
There, you got it.

215
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:35,967
Ah, yeah…

216
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:38,345
My… my first kiss… on the cheek.

217
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:39,351
Right.

218
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,143
I’m gonna go get
some fresh air, Via.

219
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,062
Huh? Yeah, it’s really hot
in this music room.

220
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:48,313
I know. Feels like—

221
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:50,941
Are you oka—

222
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:51,691
Kino?

223
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:52,734
I’m okay.

224
00:15:58,544 --> 00:16:00,444
Why did I do that?

225
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,668
Okay, Valeria High, on three.

226
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,044
One, two, three!

227
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:12,212
Valeria High!

228
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:13,880
All right, guys, we can do this.

229
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,174
This is where we find out
who makes it to Nationals.

230
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:18,760
Let’s give it our all.
We can do this. Okay?

231
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:20,345
Let’s go, Valeria!

232
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:24,891
- Let’s go, Via!
- Let’s go, Via!

233
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:29,271
- Go, Via!
- Go, Via!

234
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:32,440
- Go, Via!
- Go, Via!

235
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,119
Let’s go, Valeria!
Let’s go, Via!

236
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,569
Let’s go, Via!

237
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:42,552
That’s okay!

238
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:43,579
It’s okay!

239
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:37,524
- Go, Valeria! Go, Via!
- Go, Valeria! Go, Via!

240
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:14,454
You were amazing out there, Via.

241
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:21,943
Why are you shaking your head?

242
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:24,095
For me, you were
the best one out there.

243
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:34,853
If I were really that good, then
we should’ve won, right?

244
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:41,878
You all did your best,

245
00:20:43,017 --> 00:20:44,317
and that’s what matters.

246
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,326
Rest for now.

247
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,373
I’ll just be here, okay?

248
00:21:56,222 --> 00:22:00,268
I could really feel Via’s disappointment
about not making it to Nationals.

249
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:02,937
Yes, Pa.

250
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:05,732
By the way, Pa—

251
00:22:06,608 --> 00:22:08,359
Let me do the chores
for now, okay?

252
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,570
Via’s feeling down.

253
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:14,032
I’ll take care of
washing the dishes, too.

254
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:16,701
I’ll sleep here tonight, too.

255
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:18,828
I’ll have breakfast
sent here tomorrow

256
00:22:19,746 --> 00:22:21,956
so we won’t have
to wake Via up early.

257
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,710
Poor kid’s exhausted.

258
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:27,921
Thank you so much, Arkin.

259
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,340
It’s nothing, Pa.

260
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:34,761
So, where are you planning
to go for college?

261
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:38,264
Wherever Via plans to go, hopefully.

262
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:41,267
But I feel like
she’s feeling pressured,

263
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:43,811
so I don’t really
bring it up anymore.

264
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,523
Maybe I’ll just go
wherever I get accepted.

265
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:48,983
I don’t want to be away from her,

266
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:51,444
but I also don’t want
to be a burden.

267
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:57,450
I think Via’s just shy to say
where she really wants to study.

268
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,246
Maybe she’s thinking I’d have
a hard time paying for tuition.

269
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:03,623
But I’ve been saving up.

270
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:08,044
I’m just waiting for her to
tell me where she wants to go,

271
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,338
then I’ll do whatever it takes.

272
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:13,967
She’s thinking
about Diliman, I think.

273
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,219
That’s why I also
have to study harder.

274
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:19,222
They say it’s tough
to get into that university.

275
00:23:20,807 --> 00:23:21,808
You can do it.

276
00:23:22,225 --> 00:23:24,602
Nothing’s impossible
if you really want it.

277
00:23:25,436 --> 00:23:28,565
It’s not easy, but it can be done.

278
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,942
Thanks, Pa.

279
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:46,249
They’re here!

280
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,002
They’re here! They’re here!

281
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:57,260
Congratulations!

282
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,597
- Congratulations, Yanna and Sam!
- Congratulations, Yanna and Sam!

283
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:01,848
Thanks!

284
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,853
- Thanks a lot.
- We’re really going to miss you!

285
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:08,396
Good luck in college!

286
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:09,897
Welcome to college life!

287
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:12,817
Oh no, Luna’s crying!

288
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:15,278
Oh no.

289
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:18,323
Hey, how come no one cried
when I graduated?

290
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:20,199
Because we were happy
you were gone.

291
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,743
I mean, happy you graduated!

292
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:22,577
Sure.

293
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:23,828
You’re too much!

294
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,540
I’m going to miss you guys.

295
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:31,210
All right, all right.

296
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:34,380
It’s gross.

297
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:37,008
But yeah, I’ll miss you all, too.

298
00:24:37,925 --> 00:24:38,509
Ouch!

299
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:42,180
Even if we all go our separate ways,
we’ll still be friends, right?

300
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,056
Yeah.

301
00:24:43,056 --> 00:24:44,223
- Of course.
- That’s right.

302
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:45,224
True.

303
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,647
True! And because of that,
group hug!

304
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:57,724
Let’s eat!

305
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:00,615
This is so good!

306
00:25:00,948 --> 00:25:02,909
Even the confetti tastes great!

307
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:06,889
How about me?

308
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:18,599
I’m so lucky, because
you guys became my friends.

309
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,680
I can’t imagine high school
life without you.

310
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:22,989
Why’d you stop?

311
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:24,574
Huh?

312
00:26:24,574 --> 00:26:25,575
Why did you stop?

313
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:28,953
Why don’t you join
the Music Club next year?

314
00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:30,371
You won’t have
volleyball anymore anyway.

315
00:26:31,497 --> 00:26:32,498
I’ll think about it.

316
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:37,712
But if I do join, I don’t wanna perform
in front of people, okay?

317
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:40,548
That’s fine. You can just teach the
first years how to play guitar.

318
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:41,549
That works too.

319
00:26:42,508 --> 00:26:44,427
Are you a promoter of
the Music Club or what?

320
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:46,053
You keep pushing it.

321
00:26:47,764 --> 00:26:49,265
I just really love music.

322
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:53,895
If you love music that much,

323
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:57,607
then why isn’t your college course
about music?

324
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:06,908
Well, my hobby and my future job
are two different things.

325
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:12,622
I just feel like when something
you love turns into work,

326
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:13,998
you end up getting tired of it.

327
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,959
I don’t wanna get tired of music.

328
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:21,756
Sounds like you’ve really thought
that through, huh?

329
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:24,592
As you grow older—

330
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:29,597
As we have grown older, I can
really see how you’ve changed.

331
00:27:30,973 --> 00:27:34,560
You too, you just don’t notice it
‘cause it’s you.

332
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:37,605
But you’ve changed, too.

333
00:27:39,982 --> 00:27:42,819
Well, I’m happy for you.

334
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:53,858
Hey, even if we change a lot—

335
00:27:55,998 --> 00:27:59,043
No matter what happens, nothing
changes between us, okay?

336
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:03,798
How we treat each other. Promise?

337
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:14,851
I promise.

338
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:17,848
Hey, by the way,
what’s your answer?

339
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:19,038
What do you say
about the music club?

340
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:20,582
- Huh?
- You’re joining next year?

341
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,620
Please introduce yourself.

342
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,044
Avianna Diaz. Fourth year.

343
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:45,131
I’ll be singing
and playing the guitar.

344
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:48,384
Ms. Avianna,

345
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,679
what song will you
be performing for us?

346
00:28:56,893 --> 00:28:58,060
“Smile.”

347
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,610
Okay.

348
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:01,647
Please sing when you’re ready.

349
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:21,876
♪ I find myself smiling, ♪

350
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:31,569

Thank you.

357
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:22,478
All right, just wait for the results.

358
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,150
Thanks again.

359
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:29,986
I’ll go ahead, Kino.

360
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:07,231
Via, I’m sorry.

361
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,442
Huh?

362
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:14,030
Why are you apologizing? It’s fine.

363
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,323
I know I’m not that good anyway.

364
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:18,868
I’m just sorry 'cause—

365
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:22,036
we’ll be seeing each other all the time
now, even in the Music Club.

366
00:31:22,913 --> 00:31:23,914
You passed!

367
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,751
You passed.

368
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,210
- What? For real?
- Yeah, really.

369
00:31:28,502 --> 00:31:30,463
You just rigged
my score, didn’t you?

370
00:31:30,463 --> 00:31:31,647
No, I didn’t!

371
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:32,965
Your voice was amazing.

372
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:34,425
They were even surprised.

373
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,512
Now I kinda regret making you join.

374
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:40,639
Am I being selfish?

375
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:44,560
I’m just used to being the only
one who gets to hear you sing.

376
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:47,271
Thanks for making me join.

377
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:49,106
Congrats!
Welcome to the Music Club.

378
00:32:29,105 --> 00:32:31,440
Would you get mad if I kissed you?

379
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,870
Why would you kiss me?

380
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:41,951
No reason. I’m just curious.

381
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:48,256
Curious?
Is this what they call puberty?

382
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,710
All right then, there’s nothing
more to it if it’s Kino.

383
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,821
No.

384
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,779
I wouldn’t get mad.

385
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:23,159
- I just really don’t know what to do.
- You were really out of—

386
00:33:25,968 --> 00:33:27,178
It feels so hot here!

387
00:33:27,203 --> 00:33:28,222
Hey!

388
00:33:28,247 --> 00:33:30,583
We’ve been looking for you two!

389
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:31,847
Yeah.

390
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:33,627
Are you okay?

391
00:33:33,627 --> 00:33:34,628
Huh?

392
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:37,006
- Huh?
- Huh?

393
00:33:38,007 --> 00:33:39,008
What—

394
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:39,925
What?

395
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:42,052
- Huh?
- Huh?

396
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:43,487
Huh?

397
00:33:43,512 --> 00:33:44,513
I’m—

398
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:46,807
What I’m saying is—

399
00:33:47,032 --> 00:33:49,702
I think I’ll go get some air outside.

400
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,020
I’ll just go—

401
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,188
Bye-bye.

402
00:33:52,188 --> 00:33:53,606
Wait, what? Where’s he—

403
00:33:53,606 --> 00:33:54,565
Where’s he going?

404
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,566
What just happened?

405
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,567
What was that?

406
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,527
I don’t know. He suddenly—

407
00:33:58,527 --> 00:34:00,529
He suddenly felt hot, I guess.

408
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,157
How was your audition?

409
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:06,869
Did you pass?

410
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:10,164
I knew it!

411
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:11,916
You’re amazing!

412
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,709
I told you so!

413
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:15,961
Show us what you did!

414
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,427
Luna and Kierra
were so loud earlier.

415
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:24,386
They were so happy,

416
00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:26,180
like they were the ones who
got into the music club.

417
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,932
And they even
wanted me to sing.

418
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:36,649
When there’s a music club meeting,
tell me right away, okay?

419
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:38,943
Of course.

420
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:43,739
I’ll go ahead, Via.

421
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:44,990
Huh?

422
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,576
You’re not coming in?

423
00:34:47,826 --> 00:34:49,036
Probably not.

424
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:50,496
I’m heading out now.

425
00:34:50,663 --> 00:34:51,664
Bye.

426
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:52,915
My guitar.

427
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:54,083
Oh, right.

428
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:55,417
Okay.

429
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:57,294
Okay.

430
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:04,417
What was that about?

431
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:07,486
Is he feeling awkward because
of what happened earlier?

432
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:09,706
Or does he think I’m mad at him?

433
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:24,405
I miss Yanna, Sam, and Sevi, too.

434
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:25,864
I hope nothing changes
between us, you know?

435
00:35:25,864 --> 00:35:26,865
No way.

436
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:30,536
But yeah, they say a lot of things
change when you get to college.

437
00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:31,537
Right?

438
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:35,291
Even if things do change,
I hope our friendship doesn’t.

439
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:36,166
Oh, please.

440
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,167
We're a solid group.

441
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:40,587
Even when I’m ninety, you guys
have no choice but to stay friends with me.

442
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:41,839
Wow, ninety years old, huh?

443
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,840
I’m serious!

444
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,924
Speaking of college,

445
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:46,927
Luna and I are taking the Architecture
entrance exam in España.

446
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:47,886
How about you, Via?

447
00:35:47,886 --> 00:35:49,346
What course are
you planning to take?

448
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:55,269
I don’t know. Probably wherever
you guys are going.

449
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:56,228
What?

450
00:35:56,228 --> 00:35:57,521
Are you serious?

451
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:58,480
Yes.

452
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,898
Come on, Architecture’s hard,

453
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:01,275
especially if you’re not into it.

454
00:36:01,275 --> 00:36:03,819
Well, I don’t really have
any preferences, Luna.

455
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:06,780
So anywhere you
guys are going is fine.

456
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,950
I can draw anyway,
that’s enough, right?

457
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,286
Via would probably like that, too.

458
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:12,995
Yeah, maybe.

459
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:16,533
Honestly, I’m scared to
go to college alone.

460
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:18,227
Like, without any friends again.

461
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:21,575
That’s why I’d rather go
where Luna and Ke are.

462
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:32,222
Kino.

463
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,936
You’re taking the entrance exam
in España too, right?

464
00:36:39,938 --> 00:36:41,315
Huh? España?

465
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:44,026
Huh? Are you glitching?

466
00:36:44,026 --> 00:36:45,235
Are you okay?

467
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:50,949
Oh, España.
Yeah, I’m in batch one.

468
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:52,659
There’s no film course there,

469
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:55,275
so it’ll just be my
backup school in case.

470
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,543
You’ve been quiet for a while now.

471
00:37:01,543 --> 00:37:03,796
You’ve been reading that
same page since earlier.

472
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:05,297
You haven’t turned pages at all.

473
00:37:05,297 --> 00:37:07,174
I’m on vocal rest because—

474
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:09,134
- I’m a singer, remember?
- Vocal rest.

475
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:11,053
He’s our future concert king.

476
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:14,014
But if you ever forget about us,
I swear I’ll bash you online.

477
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:16,100
I’ll be your number one basher.

478
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,144
Luna only wants to study in España
because there are lots of hotties there.

479
00:37:19,144 --> 00:37:21,271
True.

480
00:37:23,315 --> 00:37:25,275
But isn’t Sevi
a varsity player there?

481
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:26,819
Maybe he’ll introduce
someone to me.

482
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:28,612
Maybe you’ll finally meet
your one and only.

483
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:33,659
Like, imagine it’s raining in
España and someone suddenly says,

484
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:36,912
“Miss, you might catch a cold."

485
00:37:39,865 --> 00:37:42,017
That’s my love story right there.

486
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:43,043
Maybe it’s Sevi.

487
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:45,087
Yuck! Sevi? Seriously?

488
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:46,463
- No?
- Hell no!

489
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:48,257
No. Never.

490
00:37:48,257 --> 00:37:49,967
Never.

491
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,010
You’re crazy.

492
00:38:05,274 --> 00:38:07,526
What were you gonna say?

493
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,781
Via, I’m sorry!

494
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:15,075
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

495
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:19,101
Hey, Kino, what are
you doing? Get up.

496
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:20,722
I’m sorry for trying to kiss you.

497
00:38:20,747 --> 00:38:23,417
I shouldn’t have done that.
It was my fault, Via. I’m sorry.

498
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:27,624
I’m not even mad about that.

499
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,340
But fine, you’re forgiven.
Now get up already.

500
00:38:30,365 --> 00:38:31,507
Come on now, quick!

501
00:38:37,306 --> 00:38:38,515
Are you crying?

502
00:38:42,144 --> 00:38:43,729
Are you hurt?
Does something hurt?

503
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:46,648
Did you scrape your knee?
What is it? Tell me.

504
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:53,280
Via…

505
00:38:57,784 --> 00:38:59,578
I think I have feelings for you.

506
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,193
Like this?

507
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,736
Here. G.

508
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,159
Wait, let’s take a break.

509
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,119
I’m hungry.

510
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,120
Okay.

511
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,413
- I’ve got a sandwich here.
- Let’s eat.

512
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:26,940
No, it’s fine. I brought food.

513
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,617
Come on, it’s fine.
Just one bite.

514
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,471
- Go.
- I’m good. Thanks.

515
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:32,456
Come on.

516
00:40:32,705 --> 00:40:33,706
Hurry up.

517
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,633
- Fine, just one bite, okay?
- Come on.

518
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:37,634
Yeah.

519
00:40:46,643 --> 00:40:49,479
You’ve got crumbs on your lips.

520
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:57,279
No, it’s fine. I got it.

521
00:41:03,475 --> 00:41:04,476
Wait a minute, okay?

522
00:41:09,193 --> 00:41:10,194
Via?

523
00:41:10,462 --> 00:41:11,828
- Oh!
- Were you looking for me?

524
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,513
Would you get mad if I kissed you?

525
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:26,183
Why would you kiss me?

526
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,062
No reason. I’m just curious.

527
00:41:31,063 --> 00:41:32,064
No.

528
00:41:32,648 --> 00:41:34,024
I wouldn’t get mad.

529
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,421
No? Does she like me too?

530
00:41:37,512 --> 00:41:41,460
Or is it just that easy for her,
like it means nothing,

531
00:41:41,965 --> 00:41:44,218
because we’re just friends…

532
00:41:44,777 --> 00:41:46,171
But, for me—

533
00:41:46,196 --> 00:41:49,199
I’m sorry, I don’t think
I can hold it in anymore.

534
00:41:49,906 --> 00:41:53,351
Besides… maybe she can like me, too.

535
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:57,226
You two might
actually end up together.

536
00:41:57,673 --> 00:41:59,216
Stop it. You all sound ridiculous.

537
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,186
Oh, Via’s here.

538
00:42:02,202 --> 00:42:04,287
Would you approve of Naya if ever?

539
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,690
♪ So, I’ll say it now. ♪

540
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:22,239
♪ I like you. ♪

541
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,286
Arkin, can you walk Naya home?

542
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:30,305
Come on, let’s go.

543
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,331
Let’s go.

544
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,929
Kino, you’re lucky,
you know that?

545
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:43,538
You already know what
you want to do in life,

546
00:42:43,906 --> 00:42:45,574
and you’re good at everything.

547
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,934
I’m lucky because I have you.

548
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,726
When you become an actor,

549
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:50,127
I might actually be
your number one fan.

550
00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:54,445
The question is, do I want to be an actor?

551
00:42:55,866 --> 00:42:57,617
I know I’m handsome.

552
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:05,055
You look beautiful.

553
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:07,724
Your suit looks good.

554
00:43:09,418 --> 00:43:10,961
Really?

555
00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:22,215
I’m proud of you.

556
00:43:22,796 --> 00:43:23,797
But...

557
00:43:34,926 --> 00:43:36,219
J- just a bit.

558
00:43:36,244 --> 00:43:38,162
I’m just gonna go somewhere.

559
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,913
Via, I’ve passed the exam.

560
00:43:44,938 --> 00:43:45,976
Film.

561
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,407
Really?

562
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:47,908
How about you?

563
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:49,034
How’s your exam?
