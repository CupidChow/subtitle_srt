1
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,444
No, we’re supposed
to do it like this…

2
00:00:42,444 --> 00:00:44,947
- Oh my god!
- There’s the professor.

3
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:46,532
Let’s go get her.

4
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:49,493
Wait, Professor, don’t leave!

5
00:00:49,493 --> 00:00:52,246
Professor, please,
don’t leave yet.

6
00:00:52,246 --> 00:00:53,288
Professor!

7
00:00:53,622 --> 00:00:54,915
Please, our projects...

8
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,210
Diego, your project is late.

9
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,338
The submission deadline
was this morning.

10
00:01:01,505 --> 00:01:05,050
We’re so sorry, Prof. It took
us a while to finish it.

11
00:01:05,384 --> 00:01:06,135
Please...

12
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:08,971
We promise we will
submit on time next time!

13
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:13,454
They kinda remind me of me,
Luna, and Ke back in college.

14
00:01:15,936 --> 00:01:16,937
Fine.

15
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:19,982
But this will be the last time

16
00:01:19,982 --> 00:01:21,525
I’ll accept any
late submission.

17
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:22,401
Do you understand?

18
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:23,444
Yes, Prof!
Thank you so much.

19
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:24,278
Thank you! Thank you
so much, Prof!

20
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:25,779
- Thank you so much!
- You’re welcome.

21
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:32,011
They look so passionate
about their studies.

22
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:34,580
I guess they really love architecture.

23
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:36,415
Good for them.

24
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:39,043
Sometimes I can’t help
but wonder

25
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:41,462
if I even deserve the
opportunity to work here

26
00:01:41,462 --> 00:01:43,547
as an architecture professor.

27
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:47,051
There are so many Filipinos who
dream of being in my position,

28
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:50,929
but here I am, still not sure
if I really love what I do.

29
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:56,571
Hello?

30
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:58,812
Via! Where are you?

31
00:01:58,812 --> 00:01:59,980
Just about to leave
the university.

32
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,522
I’m heading there now.

33
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:03,776
Hurry up! We’re already
at the café outside the venue.

34
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,903
The concert
starts in an hour!

35
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,322
Yeah, okay. See you.

36
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:15,746
I’ve just been trying to go
with the flow lately

37
00:02:15,746 --> 00:02:18,123
since I usually don’t really
have anything to do.

38
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:32,262
He’s really amazing, isn’t he?

39
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:33,639
- Yeah!
- Stop it.

40
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,099
Hey, Via’s here.

41
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,058
There she is.

42
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:37,392
Is this seat taken?

43
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,061
- Yes, it’s free.
- Thanks.

44
00:02:39,086 --> 00:02:40,771
What do you want?
Hold on.

45
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:42,064
Huh? No, it’s okay. I’m fine.

46
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:43,065
- Okay.
- I’m sorry.

47
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:44,525
- I got held up by a student.
- No, it’s okay.

48
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:45,359
It’s fine.

49
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:46,565
We just got here.

50
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,612
Don’t judge us
if we end up crying later

51
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:50,030
at the concert, okay?

52
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,782
I feel like my tears
are ready to fall

53
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:54,268
once I see him
and hear his voice.

54
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:56,915
I swear, I’m just
gonna start crying.

55
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,955
Come on! No big deal,

56
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,205
I’ll even hand you
the tissues myself.

57
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,335
Hey, thanks for coming even though

58
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:04,795
we invited you last-minute.

59
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:08,215
I just couldn’t convince
Gab and Elena.

60
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:11,036
Sorry, girls, he’s just not
my favorite Filipino artist.

61
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:12,803
I’ve got so many deadlines,
you know. I’m exhausted.

62
00:03:12,803 --> 00:03:14,263
- Like right now
- Whatever, Gab.

63
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:15,639
I just went with the flow

64
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,541
and joined my friends
for this concert.

65
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:20,060
I don’t even know the artist!

66
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,814
He’s gonna sing
that song, My Favorite Movie.

67
00:03:23,814 --> 00:03:25,023
- That’s my favorite!
- Hey!

68
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:26,275
That’s my favorite, too.

69
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,252
You guys are so dramatic.

70
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:29,945
It probably just has
a similar title, right?

71
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,572
Oh, come on.
Let them be.

72
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:34,616
Yeah, seriously.  Sorry if
I’m such a big fan, okay?

73
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:36,994
But really, why are we
even here in Spain

74
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:38,203
and not in the Philippines?

75
00:03:38,203 --> 00:03:39,580
Right?
If this were back home,

76
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,749
But I came along anyway because
I wanted to hang out with them,

77
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:45,502
to relate to the
things they’re into.

78
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:47,921
Look at them, they’re both
so happy just knowing

79
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:50,215
they’ll finally see this singer.

80
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,401
I didn’t even know
it was possible

81
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:55,637
to feel that kind of
excitement for a celebrity.

82
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:57,781
I’ve never felt that before.

83
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,433
- We match.
- We kinda match, don’t we?

84
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,310
Though I actually
like Via’s bag better.

85
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:04,897
You’re on brand today.

86
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:16,074
Wow, we’re finally here.

87
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:19,828
Honestly, I’ve never really
experienced being

88
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:21,747
so into something
or someone—

89
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:25,375
that it made me cry.

90
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:30,714
Except maybe for one person.

91
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,178
Oh my gosh!
Larkin Sanchez is so handsome.

92
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:43,827
Oh my gosh, I’m so
happy we got great seats.

93
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:46,765
- Exactly.
- We’re right in front!

94
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,148
Come on, Via, let’s go.

95
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:50,067
We’re so excited for
you to meet Larkin!

96
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:51,652
Let’s go.

97
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:53,131
You guys go ahead, I’ll follow.

98
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:54,549
- You sure?
- Okay then.

99
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:56,717
- I can’t wait anymore.
- Make sure you follow, okay?

100
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:58,219
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

101
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,295
Hey, Via, are you okay?

102
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:34,215
You’re sweating a lot.

103
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:36,799
You’re not used to being around
this many people, huh?

104
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:38,698
Huh? No, I’m fine.

105
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:40,689
Maybe I’m just a little tired.

106
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:44,140
Don’t worry, girl.
Once you hear him play,

107
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,433
you’ll definitely feel better.

108
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:49,103
Yes, he’s so good live,
you might even cry.

109
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:50,313
I’m getting excited.

110
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:51,564
I really want to
see him already.

111
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,316
- He’s taking so long, right?
- Yeah.

112
00:05:53,316 --> 00:05:55,151
Aren’t they going
to call him out yet?

113
00:05:58,696 --> 00:06:00,031
Oh my god!

114
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:05,953
He’s here.

115
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:07,371
Larkin!

116
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:43,449
What’s up, Barcelona?

117
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:48,204
Thank you so much
for inviting me here.

118
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:50,124
Thank you for coming here.

119
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:52,850
And especially to
our fellow countrymen.

120
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:55,260
Hi, I’m Larkin Sanchez.

121
00:06:56,504 --> 00:06:59,090
I hope it’s okay if
I sing my first original song.

122
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:01,676
This song is about someone

123
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:05,805
who wants to confess their love
to their closest friend.

124
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:09,725
But at the same time—

125
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,966
too afraid to lose
everything they have.

126
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:14,605
Sing with me.

Mommy!

144
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:45,900
Hey! Aidan, wait!

145
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,652
What?

146
00:10:48,652 --> 00:10:49,403
Can I see?

147
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:50,654
Milk? Yes?

148
00:10:50,654 --> 00:10:52,573
Such a handsome boy! Yes?

149
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:02,666
Kino!

150
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,419
What’s wrong? Why do you
look so grumpy this early?

151
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:06,378
I woke up late.

152
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:07,463
And I still have so much to do.

153
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:09,340
I’m not even done yet, and
now he wants to eat—

154
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,466
- Hurry, Ysha!
- I’m ready!

155
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:11,967
I’m not even done
taking care of these two yet.

156
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,135
Come here, you two.

157
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:16,055
Arkin! I got a star from
my teacher yesterday!

158
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:16,931
You must be proud of yourself.

159
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:18,682
It’s only been a week and
you already got a star.

160
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:19,850
And she didn’t want
to take a bath—

161
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,518
Good job!

162
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:22,228
because she was scared
the star might come off.

163
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:25,147
And you, your hair’s a mess.

164
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:25,856
Let’s fix it, come on.

165
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:27,566
Wait a minute.
Let me fix this first.

166
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:29,777
- I’ll leave that to you.
- Here, sit down.

167
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:32,363
There you go! Show me?

168
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:34,240
Wear your shoes now.
Okay, you do it.

169
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,407
Give me those shoes.

170
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,326
Via?

171
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:39,495
Got any extra eggs there?

172
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:41,622
Of course, I already
added an extra egg.

173
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:42,915
I know it’s your favorite.

174
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:45,543
Wow, you’re the best, Via!

175
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:47,253
That’s why
you’re my best friend.

176
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:50,965
The other side now.

177
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:52,758
Your turn. Wear your shoes.

178
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:54,176
Oh no, Via.

179
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,221
Sorry I couldn’t help you out,
I woke up late.

180
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:59,098
No problem, Pa.

181
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:00,850
I know you were tired
from work yesterday,

182
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,184
so I didn’t wake you up.

183
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:04,019
It’s okay, we got this.

184
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:05,157
Really?

185
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:06,413
We can manage.

186
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:07,523
Thank you.

187
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,251
All right then,
just be careful, okay?

188
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:12,069
Have fun, and sweetheart—

189
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:13,737
If you meet any new friends,

190
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:14,697
invite them over, okay?

191
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:16,115
I’ll prepare some
snacks for them.

192
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,332
Pa, we’ll get going now.

193
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:26,375
- Well?
- Let’s go.

194
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,835
- You guys ready?
- Here’s your bag.

195
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,629
- Ready?
- I need to pee.

196
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:31,297
Huh?

197
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:33,299
Mira, go with Ysha.

198
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,342
Don’t forget to bring
your lunch boxes, okay?

199
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:37,009
Pa!

200
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:38,227
Thank you.

201
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:41,140
- We’ll go ahead.
- Thank you.

202
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,099
- Bye, Pa!
- Take care, okay?

203
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:43,434
Kino, hurry up! Let’s go!

204
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:45,978
You’re so slow!

205
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:47,605
Really? Are you
turning this on me?

206
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:48,856
I’m the slow one now?

207
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:50,441
We’re gonna be
late again. Come on!

208
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:51,400
I was just waiting for you!

209
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,401
- All right.
- Let’s go!

210
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:16,759
Stop squeezing in.

211
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:18,928
Here’s the fare—

212
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:21,180
Here’s the fare!
Two to Valeria High.

213
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:24,808
I’ll pay for you this time
since you packed me food.

214
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:26,894
I always pack
you food though!

215
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:28,395
Why are you only
treating me now?

216
00:13:28,395 --> 00:13:30,439
Because you always pay first.

217
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:33,025
Excuses.

218
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:34,850
Okay, fine.

219
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:37,446
From now on,
I’ll always pay for your fare.

220
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:39,907
As long as we go to
school together every day.

221
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:42,868
We go to school
together everyday, don’t we?

222
00:13:42,868 --> 00:13:44,703
Since pre-school even, right?

223
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:46,622
Then we should keep it
that way until college.

224
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:48,165
And when we start working,
we’ll still go together.

225
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:49,249
No excuses.

226
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:51,377
You’re so clingy.

227
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,011
It’s cramped, okay?

228
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:02,221
Cramped?

229
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:03,222
Whatever.

230
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:12,564
You’re so mean, Avianna.

231
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:14,316
Scoot! Move!

232
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:26,662
- Hurry up! You’re so slow.
- Yeah. Let’s go.

233
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:29,999
Wait, your lunch, hold on.

234
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:31,250
I’ll just grab it later
from your room.

235
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:32,251
What?

236
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:33,460
Don’t you dare come
to our classroom,

237
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,670
especially with your friends.

238
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,171
You guys are scaring
my classmates.

239
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:37,381
Why? Do I—

240
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:38,424
Just get it from me
at the canteen later.

241
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:39,800
Do I really look that scary?

242
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:43,429
My classmates said

243
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:44,555
you look like a troublemaker

244
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:46,265
and that you’re
always getting into fights.

245
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:49,309
No way. I don’t join them,
I just watch.

246
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:51,186
I’m actually really nice!

247
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:53,605
Anyway, just get it
at the canteen later

248
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:54,565
and seriously—

249
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:57,818
don’t get into any fights,
or I’ll tell Aunt Allie, okay?

250
00:14:58,235 --> 00:14:59,653
I won’t! I promise!

251
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:01,363
Good.

252
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:01,905
Okay.

253
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:03,157
I’m heading this way.
You go that way. Bye!

254
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:03,991
I’m going with you.

255
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:04,867
No, it’s fine!

256
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:06,076
I’m taking you
to your classroom.

257
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:08,037
That’s enough. Go already!

258
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:08,787
Bye!

259
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:10,205
Okay, see you!

260
00:15:10,205 --> 00:15:12,041
Later!
At lunch!

261
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:16,378
Okay, class,
for our art project,

262
00:15:16,378 --> 00:15:18,672
I want you to
draw a historical site

263
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:19,715
in the Philippines.

264
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:23,469
Don’t worry,
you will do it by group.

265
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,472
Hey, it’s a group project!

266
00:15:27,347 --> 00:15:28,348
Class, listen.

267
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:30,376
You can choose your groupmates.

268
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,603
Three members for each group.

269
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:34,897
This is what I hate
the most about group projects,

270
00:15:34,897 --> 00:15:37,357
letting us choose
our own groupmates.

271
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:39,109
I don’t really have
any close friends here.

272
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:40,967
And it’s only been
one week of classes,

273
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:43,536
how am I supposed
to make friends?

274
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:46,366
So how did they manage

275
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:48,035
to get close to
each other so fast?

276
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:53,874
Rock, Paper, Scissors,
whoever loses—

277
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:56,960
Hi!

278
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,506
There’s only two of us.
You wanna join our group?

279
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:01,465
Huh?

280
00:16:01,465 --> 00:16:02,925
Yes, you’re joining us.

281
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:03,592
You’re our groupmate
now so I’ll go ahead

282
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:04,718
and write your name down.

283
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:06,970
Avia… Aviana. Right?

284
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:07,971
Did I spell it right?

285
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:08,972
Double N.

286
00:16:09,515 --> 00:16:10,349
Double N.

287
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:11,767
Why is your nickname Via?

288
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,931
Why not Ana?

289
00:16:13,956 --> 00:16:14,578
- Right?
- Avi, Avi.

290
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:15,562
Why not Avi?

291
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,604
I don’t know.

292
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,527
Ma’am! Group one.
We’re group one.

293
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,195
Did everybody hear us?

294
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:24,154
This girl is really—

295
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:25,155
There’s no prize!

296
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:26,156
What are you talking about?

297
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:27,199
- That’s just how it is.
- Okay?

298
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,784
- We’ll be presenting first.
- Perfect!

299
00:16:28,784 --> 00:16:30,452
So if someone
has a similar concept,

300
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:31,370
it would look
like they copied us

301
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,287
and not the other way around.

302
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:34,331
- Aren’t I smart?
- You’re right!

303
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:35,541
Smart, right?

304
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,751
And with that,
she’s going to be the leader.

305
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,169
- She’s the leader, okay?
- Huh?

306
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,337
- Me?
- Yes.

307
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:41,171
Why me?

308
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:41,713
See—

309
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:42,339
- It’s right there.
- Look at this.

310
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:43,465
- Leader.
- Leader.

311
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:45,467
Avianna. Double N.

312
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:46,176
- Double N.
- Chill!

313
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:47,302
Hey, we’re just
fooling around, okay?

314
00:16:47,302 --> 00:16:48,095
It’s all a joke.

315
00:16:48,095 --> 00:16:49,138
This is just how we are.

316
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:50,472
What’re your socials? Hurry up.

317
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:51,056
- Write it here.
- Write your socials here.

318
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:52,229
Write it at the back instead,

319
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:53,016
we wouldn’t want
the teacher to see it.

320
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:54,351
We’re gonna create
our own group chat.

321
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,019
Right. Avianna, with double N.

322
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:59,565
Avianna, with double N.

323
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:07,948
Luna: Hello, groupmates!
Let’s gooo!

324
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:09,074
Luna: Hello!
Luna: Hello!

325
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:10,200
Luna: Hellooo!!!
Kierra: You’re so noisy!

326
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,743
Luna: What? Just a thumbs up?

327
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:18,375
- I kind of want some more.
- I don’t want any.

328
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,419
Ke, Luna! Come here!

329
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:26,800
Maybe later.
We’ll be back. Thanks!

330
00:17:28,886 --> 00:17:30,804
Hey! Hope it’s okay
if we sit with you.

331
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:32,598
Hi.

332
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:35,934
Do you usually eat alone?

333
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:40,647
Really? You should
join us next time.

334
00:17:40,856 --> 00:17:43,901
Eating alone
can feel sad, right?

335
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:47,636
That looks so good.

336
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:48,797
The way it’s cooked is perfect.

337
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:49,823
The yolk is fully intact.

338
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,116
Did you cook that?

339
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,368
You really cook?

340
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:55,746
Wow.

341
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:57,539
Ke, see that? She can cook.

342
00:17:57,998 --> 00:17:59,166
I know how to cook, too.

343
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,792
Why don’t you cook for me then?

344
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:05,255
Give me some.

345
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:12,721
This is Lance, my boyfriend.

346
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:16,391
Who were you with earlier?

347
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:19,269
Philip, my classmate.

348
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:20,946
Didn’t I tell you to
stay away from him?

349
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:22,784
And where were you last night?

350
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,468
Huh?

351
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:26,453
I didn’t allow you to go.
Did I tell you to go?

352
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:29,404
I’m sorry. Don’t be mad.

353
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,432
Luna’s boyfriend
is so controlling.

354
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:33,992
I wonder what
she sees in him.

355
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:35,827
Come on, don’t be mad.

356
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:38,538
Gotcha!

357
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:40,724
Kino! What are you doing?

358
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:41,823
Where’s my lunch?

359
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:43,418
My lunch.

360
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:50,217
I thought you were suspended?

361
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:52,219
Let’s talk later.

362
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:54,137
Don’t be mad, please.

363
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,310
This looks so good.

364
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:02,854
Save it for later!

365
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:04,398
You’ll run out of food
if you eat it now.

366
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:08,277
Your friends?

367
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:11,937
- My groupmates.
- Hi, groupmates.

368
00:19:11,962 --> 00:19:12,906
Hi.

369
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:14,783
All right, you guys eat first.
I’ll be over there.

370
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:18,161
Bye-bye.

371
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:22,874
Your boyfriend?

372
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:24,918
Your boyfriend?

373
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:25,894
No.

374
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,629
We’re just childhood friends.
Best friends.

375
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:28,880
Oh…

376
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:32,191
Best friends, huh? Okay.

377
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:34,052
Let’s talk about
the art project.

378
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:50,226
All right, team.
Gather around, please.

379
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:56,158
As you all know,

380
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:58,535
we have four
new players this year.

381
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:00,495
And as part of our tradition,

382
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:03,081
we’ll be doing
a skills demo drill.

383
00:20:03,081 --> 00:20:04,082
Okay?

384
00:20:04,082 --> 00:20:05,834
I want you to show us
what you’ve got.

385
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,336
Do your best,

386
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:10,088
this is your time to shine
and impress the seniors.

387
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:11,113
Okay?

388
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:12,225
Come on, let’s go!

389
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,618
Why’d you throw it, bro?

390
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:44,907
Girl in orange, sorry,
we didn’t mean to hit you.

391
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:46,142
Can you pass the ball?

392
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:52,230
Thanks, you’re the best!

393
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:55,342
Oh my god,
Camero’s so handsome.

394
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:57,219
He’s really good-looking.

395
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:59,221
Do you think
he has a girlfriend?

396
00:21:04,851 --> 00:21:06,228
You’re all getting too distracted.

397
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:07,212
Focus on the game.

398
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:20,717
I’ll go ahead, bro.

399
00:21:20,742 --> 00:21:21,758
Okay, bye.

400
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:24,318
Finished with your training?

401
00:21:24,788 --> 00:21:26,828
I told you to go
home first, right?

402
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:29,876
I also told you
we’d go home together.

403
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,182
And I didn’t even
wait that long.

404
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:34,005
We had a meeting
at the music club.

405
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:37,426
I joined so you know
I can play at events.

406
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:40,113
That’s good, because I thought

407
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:42,347
you’d still try to
force your way

408
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:44,141
into the girls’ volleyball team.

409
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,144
You know, I really
don’t get your coach.

410
00:21:47,144 --> 00:21:50,605
Why won’t she let me join the
girls’ volleyball team?

411
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:54,443
I’m tall, I’m good.
I just don’t get it.

412
00:21:56,194 --> 00:21:59,114
You don’t get why you
can’t get into the girls’

413
00:21:59,114 --> 00:22:00,451
volleyball team?

414
00:22:00,476 --> 00:22:02,853
Explain it to me. Why?

415
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:06,521
By the way,

416
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:09,925
maybe you’d like to
join the music club too.

417
00:22:12,294 --> 00:22:13,246
Pass.

418
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:14,843
Stingy.

419
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:17,757
Am I sleeping over
at your place tonight?

420
00:22:17,757 --> 00:22:18,758
Come on.

421
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:19,759
Okay.

422
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:27,309
Rock, paper, scissors!

423
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:28,560
We’re here.

424
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:31,271
- Hi, Via!
- Via!

425
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:33,106
Hello, Ysha, Mira!

426
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:33,899
Hi, Via!

427
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:36,109
- What are you guys doing?
- Hi, Arkin!

428
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,360
You guys should eat now.

429
00:22:37,611 --> 00:22:38,987
- Hey, Aidan!
- Hoy, Aidan!

430
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:40,030
You guys are back.

431
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,572
- Hello, Pa.
- Pa.

432
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:42,115
Kino’s gonna sleep here.

433
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:43,300
Okay.

434
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:43,867
Can I get a kiss first?

435
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:45,494
You have a lot
of clothes there, right?

436
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:47,329
Yes, plenty in her room.

437
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:48,705
Okay, change first,

438
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:50,790
then I’ll call you
when it’s time to eat.

439
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,791
All right.

440
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:52,972
Okay?

441
00:22:53,627 --> 00:22:55,253
That’s enough.

442
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:56,546
We’ll go upstairs, Pa.

443
00:22:56,546 --> 00:22:57,923
- Okay.
- Be careful.

444
00:22:58,882 --> 00:22:59,883
You’re getting heavy.

445
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:02,552
You’re getting really heavy.

446
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:09,778
I’m borrowing this.

447
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:19,046
How’s that song you’re writing?

448
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,821
Not done yet.

449
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:24,658
I don’t even know
what it’s about.

450
00:23:25,492 --> 00:23:26,501
Why?

451
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:28,537
Do you want to write a song?

452
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:45,884
Come on, sing the verse.

453
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:48,640
Sing the verse.

454
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:50,397
Come on.

455
00:23:53,303 --> 00:23:55,622
Why not? Your voice
is really beautiful.

456
00:23:55,753 --> 00:23:58,881
You’d really fit in
the music club. Please join.

457
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:02,881
I’m not really into music,
so I’ll pass.

458
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:05,945
Well,

459
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:09,744
at least now you’re interested
in making friends with others.

460
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:11,369
Friends?

461
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:12,228
Yes.

462
00:24:12,253 --> 00:24:13,254
With who?

463
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:14,476
The girls you were
eating lunch with,

464
00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:15,835
your groupmates.

465
00:24:17,786 --> 00:24:18,950
Luna and Kierra?

466
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:21,770
They’re not my friends.
They just ate with me.

467
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,092
Then be friends with them.

468
00:24:24,426 --> 00:24:25,510
They seem okay.

469
00:24:26,553 --> 00:24:28,804
Sometimes, I worry about you.

470
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:31,499
I’m fine being alone.

471
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,893
And those girls
wouldn’t want to be friends

472
00:24:33,893 --> 00:24:35,186
with someone like me.

473
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:36,730
We’re really just groupmates.

474
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,645
Why not?

475
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,880
Don’t they know
the perks of being friends

476
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:42,532
with Avianna Diaz?

477
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:43,912
First—

478
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:46,823
Free lunch.

479
00:24:47,307 --> 00:24:48,308
Second—

480
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:50,577
Free lunch.

481
00:24:51,244 --> 00:24:51,995
Third—

482
00:24:51,995 --> 00:24:54,748
That’s all the perks
you can think of? Really?

483
00:24:54,748 --> 00:24:55,849
Take a guess.

484
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:56,875
Free lunch?

485
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:57,956
Right.

486
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:00,262
Okay, fine.

487
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:01,546
Let’s make a deal.

488
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,132
If you befriend them,

489
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:07,427
I’ll never ask you
to make my lunch. Ever.

490
00:25:07,427 --> 00:25:09,763
Forever and ever. Well?

491
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:11,348
We got ourselves a deal?

492
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,515
Come on.

493
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:13,308
Really?

494
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:14,309
Yes.

495
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:15,177
All right then.

496
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:16,787
- No take-backs, okay?
- You said it.

497
00:25:16,812 --> 00:25:17,751
Yeah.

498
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,607
Via, Arkin, time to eat!

499
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:21,483
Food’s ready.

500
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:22,484
Just in time, I’m hungry.

501
00:25:23,068 --> 00:25:24,069
Let’s go!

502
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:31,493
Luna: Announcement!
Groupmates!

503
00:25:31,493 --> 00:25:34,454
Let’s do our project at
Kierra’s house this Saturday,

504
00:25:34,454 --> 00:25:37,374
1 p.m. onwards.
There’ll be free snacks,

505
00:25:37,374 --> 00:25:40,085
the room’s air-conditioned,
and the bathroom has a bidet,

506
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:43,588
so make sure you
can come, okay? Okay!

507
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,884
Oh no. This is the first time

508
00:25:47,884 --> 00:25:50,261
I’ll be going to
a classmate’s house.

509
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:51,429
Kinda nerve-wracking…

510
00:25:54,057 --> 00:25:55,850
- Via, don’t be shy.
- Via!

511
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,520
Put your stuff there and make
yourself at home, okay?

512
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,129
- Thanks.
- Come here, sit here.

513
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:01,606
Look.

514
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:04,442
See this? I drew it.

515
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:05,261
Is it good?

516
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:06,287
Yes, it’s really nice.

517
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:07,313
So pretty.

518
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:09,364
Even this one’s really good.

519
00:26:09,364 --> 00:26:12,764
I made this. It’s better
than Luna’s, right?

520
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:14,750
Wow.

521
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:18,039
They both look great,

522
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:22,544
but I’m not sure
if I can draw that good.

523
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:25,171
What?
We’ve seen your drawings.

524
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:26,506
You know, I actually
think the three of us

525
00:26:26,506 --> 00:26:27,757
will get the highest grades.

526
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:30,510
Someone’s full of herself.

527
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,636
It’s true though.

528
00:26:31,928 --> 00:26:32,971
Come on, take your
stuff out already.

529
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:33,888
Girls!

530
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:35,223
- Mommy!
- Hi, Auntie.

531
00:26:35,223 --> 00:26:36,391
I brought some snacks.

532
00:26:36,391 --> 00:26:37,562
Mommy, this is Via, by the way.

533
00:26:37,587 --> 00:26:39,839
Auntie, Via’s our friend.

534
00:26:40,478 --> 00:26:42,605
- Hi, Via! Welcome!
- Hello.

535
00:26:43,314 --> 00:26:45,892
Girls, if you need me,
I’ll just be downstairs, okay?

536
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:47,343
- Okay, Auntie.
- I’ll be downstairs.

537
00:26:47,368 --> 00:26:48,911
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

538
00:26:48,936 --> 00:26:49,984
Thank you so much.

539
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:52,574
My god, I’m so
excited for the food.

540
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:53,742
What? I thought—

541
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:54,617
Friend?

542
00:26:54,617 --> 00:26:55,618
Huh?

543
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:56,595
Friend?

544
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:59,539
Why? You don’t want
to be our friend?

545
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:01,291
If I were Via, I wouldn’t want
to be your friend either.

546
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,500
Hey! I’m nice, okay?

547
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,043
- Huh?
- Via, I promise I’m really nice.

548
00:27:04,043 --> 00:27:05,712
You know what, I’ll even give
you my chicken skin

549
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:09,132
and I’ll go with you
anywhere, anytime.

550
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:11,405
I can even help you
with your assignments.

551
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,431
I promise.

552
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,291
I’ll do all that for you.

553
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:16,556
But, why me?

554
00:27:16,556 --> 00:27:17,515
Why not?

555
00:27:17,515 --> 00:27:18,516
Yeah, why not?

556
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:20,351
Well, you’re our friend now.
You don’t have a choice.

557
00:27:20,351 --> 00:27:21,352
Exactly.

558
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,855
So here it is. Give me that.

559
00:27:23,855 --> 00:27:26,900
We’ll always be with you, okay?
You can’t be alone.

560
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:28,777
Hey, let’s eat.

561
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:29,402
Oh, right!

562
00:27:29,402 --> 00:27:30,945
Try this, quick.
It’s really good.

563
00:27:30,945 --> 00:27:36,159
You know, for our project,
we should just collaborate.

564
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,369
Since our styles
are kind of different.

565
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:39,829
This girl is such a—

566
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:41,206
What? I just want to shine.

567
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:42,999
And I want it to be
colorful and you—

568
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:46,169
I should’ve asked
Auntie for some ham.

569
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:49,461
Via: Sorry, Kino,
you lost the deal.

570
00:27:49,506 --> 00:27:50,465
I’ve got friends now.

571
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:53,426
Via: So no more
lunch for you. Haha.

572
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:54,803
Arkin: Waaahh!

573
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:00,850
Good morning!

574
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:08,858
Wow, you still packed
me lunch. Unbelievable.

575
00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:10,693
You’re really heaven-sent, Via.

576
00:28:10,693 --> 00:28:12,821
You’re such a kind person,
an actual angel.

577
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,239
I’m willing to worship you.

578
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,824
Via… Via...

579
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:16,783
This looks good—

580
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:19,577
You’re so dramatic.
So annoying.

581
00:28:19,577 --> 00:28:23,706
I thought you were serious about
not making me lunch anymore.

582
00:28:23,998 --> 00:28:28,670
Why did you even make a bet
if you couldn’t let go?

583
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,879
You probably—

584
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:34,217
You probably thought I couldn’t
make any friends, huh?

585
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:36,278
No way! I was
actually manifesting it.

586
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:39,515
And I can totally live
without lunch

587
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,292
if it means you’d
make friends.

588
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,810
- Via...
- What?

589
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:46,170
I’m willing to
skip lunch for you.

590
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,606
That’s why I packed you lunch,

591
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:52,068
so I wouldn’t feel
guilty if you didn’t eat.

592
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:56,614
Wait a sec.

593
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,825
Your necktie’s all messy.
Let me fix it.

594
00:28:58,825 --> 00:28:59,784
Okay.

595
00:28:59,784 --> 00:29:00,875
Hold on.

596
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,080
Hey, that surprise quiz from
Sir Sabado was so hard.

597
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,832
I think I barely passed.

598
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:07,625
He gave us one, too.

599
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,377
I probably failed mine.

600
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:11,504
No way, your score’s high.

601
00:29:11,504 --> 00:29:14,048
We checked your papers,
you got nine out of ten.

602
00:29:14,048 --> 00:29:15,008
Really?

603
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:17,051
Apparently,
I’m good at guessing.

604
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:20,179
All done?

605
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:21,180
Yeah.

606
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:22,640
Nice.

607
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:24,559
Arkin!

608
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,603
Hi, Ysha! Good morning—

609
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:27,687
Hey, what happened to your hair?

610
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:30,440
It’s messy. Come on,
let’s fix it over there.

611
00:29:30,732 --> 00:29:32,692
How are you?
Have you eaten breakfast?

612
00:29:33,192 --> 00:29:34,736
Did you eat well?
Did you eat a lot?

613
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:35,789
- Yes.
- You ate a lot?

614
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,016
Yes.

615
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:40,867
Arkin’s always like that.
You’d think he’s lazy,

616
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:43,745
but the truth is,
he’s really smart.

617
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:46,956
Sometimes I even
get jealous of him because

618
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:51,044
I really have to put in effort
just to get passing grades.

619
00:29:51,044 --> 00:29:53,922
Arkin’s actually amazing.
He’s special.

620
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:59,719
You like playing with
makeup or dolls, right?

621
00:30:01,971 --> 00:30:05,558
Jeez, I am so sleepy.

622
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:11,147
Chips again?

623
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,066
It’s so early for junk food.

624
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:15,151
Don’t be like them.

625
00:30:15,568 --> 00:30:17,195
You weren’t like this before.

626
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,739
Honestly, you’ve
gotten really fat.

627
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,533
Haven’t you seen your body
in the mirror lately?

628
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:25,828
And your eating habits too,
tone it down, please.

629
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:27,497
Am I really getting fat?

630
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,460
Wow, this guy’s unbelievable.

631
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,963
Controlling and a body-shamer.

632
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:37,465
I really don’t like
Luna’s boyfriend.

633
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:46,055
Are you that Samantha who’s been
spreading rumors about me?

634
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,611
What?

635
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:50,095
Don’t “what” me.

636
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:50,979
You’re such a drama queen,

637
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:52,397
and I don’t plan on
gossiping about it!

638
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:54,190
Why are they fighting?

639
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,483
If you have nothing good to say,

640
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:57,026
keep your mouth shut, okay?

641
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:59,153
I didn’t do anything wrong.
What’s wrong with you?

642
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:00,655
What’s wrong with you!

643
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:05,121
Are you okay? You all right?

644
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:10,488
Yeah, I’m okay.

645
00:31:11,046 --> 00:31:12,923
That’s Yanna.

646
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:14,919
There’s gossip about her

647
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:18,589
making out with
someone behind the gym.

648
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:20,263
It kinda seems true though.

649
00:31:22,343 --> 00:31:24,220
They say she’s the daughter
of a former adult star.

650
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,961
Looks like she’s following
in her mom’s footsteps.

651
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:29,559
What’s so funny about that?

652
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:31,122
Huh?

653
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:23,780
You want some water?

654
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:27,658
Have some.

655
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:42,694
I’ll get going—

656
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:10,159
Wow, no one makes
fishballs like you, sir!

657
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,914
For real,
his kikiam is the best.

658
00:33:14,914 --> 00:33:17,291
Sir, can I get four
pieces, please?

659
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:19,377
Thanks.

660
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,214
I’ll have one more
stick of fishballs, sir.

661
00:33:23,506 --> 00:33:25,299
Via!
Let me have some.

662
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:26,926
Come on, give me some.

663
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:33,306
Kino, this is Luna and Kierra.

664
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:35,333
Luna, Ke, this is Arkin,
my best friend.

665
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:37,462
Hi, best friend!

666
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:38,572
Hello, groupmates.

667
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:41,857
You know, you’re handsome.

668
00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:43,258
You look like a child star.

669
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:45,452
- So cute!
- Hey!

670
00:33:57,481 --> 00:33:58,940
Via!

671
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,419
He pinched me.

672
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:02,044
What’s wrong with you?

673
00:34:02,044 --> 00:34:04,130
- Why’d you pinch Luna?
- Is it red?

674
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,227
I thought it’s okay to get even.

675
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:09,254
Luna’s turning red.
See, it’s your fault.

676
00:34:09,302 --> 00:34:10,595
You keep pinching
people for no reason,

677
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:11,929
now you got payback.

678
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:12,972
I’m sorry.

679
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:15,600
Sorry, Luna. I’ll just
buy you some fishballs.

680
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,225
Just a piece.

681
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:17,143
What do you mean,
just a piece?

682
00:34:17,143 --> 00:34:18,936
Your friend’s such a cheapskate.

683
00:34:18,936 --> 00:34:19,937
Buy all of this.

684
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:23,733
You two are kinda cute.

685
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:26,194
You’re always together, like
a buy one take one deal.

686
00:34:28,404 --> 00:34:29,906
See? They really are cute.

687
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:31,282
Bro, what’s up?

688
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:33,826
Fifty pesos worth
of kwek-kwek, please.

689
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:34,932
Sure.

690
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,121
Who are you?

691
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:40,041
And who are you?

692
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,131
Hey, freshman,
your cheeks are turning red.

693
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:54,305
Really? Is it that obvious?

694
00:34:57,016 --> 00:34:58,267
It’s kinda cute, actually.

695
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:02,063
How about this, bro?
Is it obvious?

696
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,164
Is it cute, too?

697
00:35:03,189 --> 00:35:04,857
You look like a tomato, man.

698
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:09,487
I’m Sevi, by the way.

699
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:11,155
Sevi—

700
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:12,114
Sevi Camero.

701
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:14,614
The one our classmate
has a crush on—

702
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,309
Kierra, Luna, Via,
and Via’s best friend.

703
00:35:18,412 --> 00:35:19,997
Arkin.

704
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:24,210
Come on now, lend us
fifty bucks of that.

705
00:35:24,627 --> 00:35:25,878
Sir, give these kids something.

706
00:35:25,878 --> 00:35:26,754
- You heard that?
- Wow,

707
00:35:26,754 --> 00:35:28,089
- He’s treating us.
- give us some extra.

708
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:28,992
Sure thing!

709
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:31,050
Bro, get us the expensive one.

710
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:32,969
Sure, I got this.

711
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:33,970
He said he’s got it, Via.

712
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,929
I don’t want any!

713
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:36,681
You’re not the only one
who’ll be treating me now.

714
00:35:38,894 --> 00:35:41,521
Finally, it’s the last
week of school.

715
00:35:41,546 --> 00:35:43,373
Where are you
spending your summer, Via?

716
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:44,897
Probably just at home.

717
00:35:44,897 --> 00:35:46,816
We still have volleyball
training at the club.

718
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,693
What if I joined
the volleyball club too?

719
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:50,152
Then I’d be really
good at spiking,

720
00:35:50,152 --> 00:35:52,113
and you can call me Ace.

721
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:53,864
Let me try, come on.

722
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:54,865
I’ll show you, okay?

723
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:55,992
Look at this.

724
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:58,577
So it’s like this first, right?

725
00:35:58,577 --> 00:36:00,496
Then like this, right?

726
00:36:00,496 --> 00:36:01,574
- Yeah?
- And then—

727
00:36:04,475 --> 00:36:05,499
Oh no, Via!

728
00:36:06,877 --> 00:36:07,545
Oh no!

729
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:08,713
Oh my god, Via!

730
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:11,966
- Hey! Hey!
- Via, I’m so sorry, Via!

731
00:36:11,966 --> 00:36:14,885
I told you, you really shouldn’t
join the volleyball team!

732
00:36:14,885 --> 00:36:16,262
No, it’s fine. I’m fine.

733
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:17,305
- Via?
- I’m really sorry.

734
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:18,723
Via, Via! Via!

735
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:20,200
- What happened to you?
- No, I’m okay.

736
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:21,284
You’re bleeding, there’s blood!

737
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:22,393
Are you sure you’re okay?

738
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:23,436
I’m fine, really.

739
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:24,186
Can you stand up?

740
00:36:24,186 --> 00:36:25,563
- You can’t even stand!
- I’m standing.

741
00:36:25,563 --> 00:36:26,480
- What hurts?
- I said I’m standing.

742
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,149
How many fingers? How many?

743
00:36:28,149 --> 00:36:28,899
Ten.

744
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:30,818
Oh no, she’s dumb now!

745
00:36:30,818 --> 00:36:32,445
I need to take
you to the clinic.

746
00:36:32,445 --> 00:36:34,822
I’ll hit you ten times
if you don’t stop!

747
00:36:34,822 --> 00:36:36,407
I said I’m fine!

748
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:37,033
I’m fine!

749
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:38,200
Via, you’re not fine!
You need—

750
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,577
I’m taking you
to the clinic, come on.

751
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:40,536
Where’s—

752
00:36:40,536 --> 00:36:41,537
Where’s the clinic?

753
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,638
Via, don’t—

754
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:43,622
Don’t close your eyes,
don’t close them.

755
00:36:43,622 --> 00:36:45,291
Via, I’m so sorry!
I didn’t mean for this—

756
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:46,542
You just had
to try spiking, huh!

757
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:47,335
I’m not playing
volleyball ever again!

758
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:48,336
This way could’ve been better.

759
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:52,790
Arkin: Via i’ll pick you up
after my class.

760
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:53,942
Arkin: Are you okay?

761
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:56,882
Via: I’m fine.
It didn’t hit anything vital!

762
00:37:35,194 --> 00:37:36,862
Is she being bullied?

763
00:38:18,984 --> 00:38:20,528
What the heck!
You’re in the way.

764
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:22,263
I’m sorry. Are you crying?

765
00:38:22,555 --> 00:38:23,722
What do you care?

766
00:38:24,098 --> 00:38:26,197
- Attention-seeking bitch.
- Wait, aren’t you—

767
00:38:32,898 --> 00:38:34,442
Hey, I’m Samantha.

768
00:38:35,576 --> 00:38:36,702
Do you know that girl?

769
00:38:38,154 --> 00:38:39,488
I don’t know her.

770
00:38:41,258 --> 00:38:42,271
I see.

771
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,326
Thank you.

772
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:01,417
Does it still hurt?

773
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:05,017
It’s really red.

774
00:39:06,493 --> 00:39:07,909
Are you even
a volleyball player?

775
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:11,061
You keep looking around, that’s
why you got hit by the ball.

776
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:13,048
You’re being so dramatic.

777
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,935
I already said I’m fine,
it doesn’t hurt.

778
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,505
Guess I shouldn’t have
let you sleep over tonight.

779
00:39:18,675 --> 00:39:19,712
Me?

780
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:22,218
I’m literally here to take care
of you because you’re injured.

781
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,797
Jeez.

782
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:27,036
By the way,

783
00:39:27,995 --> 00:39:30,706
I’m joining the photojournalism
club next school year.

784
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:33,674
They liked the shots I took.

785
00:39:36,882 --> 00:39:38,008
You’re joining two clubs?

786
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:39,145
Yes.

787
00:39:39,622 --> 00:39:42,458
Aside from music,
I like cameras too.

788
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:45,828
And so I can be there
during your games.

789
00:39:46,238 --> 00:39:49,799
Photographers usually get sent
to cover school events, right?

790
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:53,312
They didn’t let me join the
girls’ volleyball team anyway,

791
00:39:53,312 --> 00:39:57,191
so I’ll just take pictures of
you looking dumb for my edits.

792
00:39:57,756 --> 00:40:00,217
You really found another
way to annoy me, huh?

793
00:40:02,538 --> 00:40:05,666
And you? Maybe you wanna
join another club too.

794
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:07,783
Come on, join the music club.

795
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:10,326
So we can be together there.

796
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,571
Can’t you live without me?

797
00:40:13,836 --> 00:40:14,837
Nope.

798
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:20,130
I don’t want to join two clubs.
I’m fine with volleyball.

799
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:29,890
That’s a shame, they won’t
get to hear your voice.

800
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:31,600
Goodnight, Via.

801
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:34,635
Goodnight, Kino.

802
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:57,958
Hey guys, I’m running for
second-year student rep

803
00:40:57,983 --> 00:40:59,526
in the student council.

804
00:40:59,551 --> 00:41:00,469
Yeah!

805
00:41:00,494 --> 00:41:02,913
So you’re into politics now?

806
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:04,982
Of course! And like they say,

807
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:08,137
you have to be active
in school activities.

808
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:09,054
They also said,

809
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:11,157
make the most out
of your high school life.

810
00:41:13,183 --> 00:41:17,396
Come on, be part of
my campaign team, please?

811
00:41:17,646 --> 00:41:19,148
- I’m in.
- You’re in?

812
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:20,899
Hey, Via. You too, okay?

813
00:41:20,899 --> 00:41:23,402
I saw the poster you made,

814
00:41:23,402 --> 00:41:24,653
and I was like, it’s so good!

815
00:41:24,653 --> 00:41:27,698
I really wish you’d make
my campaign poster too.

816
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:30,993
Don’t worry, there’s
a little extra incentive.

817
00:41:31,285 --> 00:41:32,411
Come on, please?

818
00:41:32,554 --> 00:41:33,347
Sure, why not.

819
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:34,570
Thank you!

820
00:41:37,142 --> 00:41:39,686
You see that good-looking
guy walking over there?

821
00:41:39,985 --> 00:41:41,403
That’s Acel.

822
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:43,222
He’s running for president,

823
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:44,582
and I’m under his partylist.

824
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:48,777
The VP running with him is Sevi.

825
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:50,010
Yeah, Sevi.

826
00:41:50,094 --> 00:41:52,513
That's a sure win.
He’s handsome.

827
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:55,559
Yeah, but it’s not just that,
his platform’s really good too.

828
00:41:55,976 --> 00:41:58,687
Who else is running
under Acel’s party?

829
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:03,025
I heard it’s a third-year rep,
I think… Samantha Vera?

830
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,419
- Samantha, huh…
- Yeah, she’s running.

831
00:42:05,444 --> 00:42:06,654
I’m so excited, girl!

832
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:08,797
It’s gonna be like
a beauty showdown.

833
00:42:08,822 --> 00:42:10,115
I’m really excited.

834
00:42:11,867 --> 00:42:13,118
- Hello.
- Hi.

835
00:42:13,952 --> 00:42:15,120
Why weren’t you replying?

836
00:42:16,288 --> 00:42:17,623
We were doing research.

837
00:42:17,648 --> 00:42:18,582
Research?

838
00:42:18,582 --> 00:42:19,630
Yes.

839
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:21,585
Looks more like you
were just gossiping.

840
00:42:21,993 --> 00:42:23,202
What were you talking about?

841
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:24,797
Well—

842
00:42:24,797 --> 00:42:27,508
Right, I just remembered.

843
00:42:28,038 --> 00:42:31,111
Yanna! Remember her, babe?

844
00:42:31,136 --> 00:42:32,054
Yes.

845
00:42:32,054 --> 00:42:33,639
The one I told you about before.

846
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:37,225
She got caught again making out
with someone at the fire exit.

847
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:39,019
People were gossiping
about her earlier,

848
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:42,690
then the guy’s
girlfriend slapped her.

849
00:42:43,315 --> 00:42:44,483
- Yes.
- Poor thing.

850
00:42:44,483 --> 00:42:45,859
She’s such a flirt, huh?

851
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:47,778
Probably because she’s the
daughter of an adult actress.

852
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:48,584
Hey!

853
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,031
That’s mean.

854
00:42:51,497 --> 00:42:53,582
Why does he hate
Yanna so much?

855
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:57,121
Why are you looking
at me like that?

856
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:58,764
You’ve been glaring
this whole time.

857
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:00,165
Hey, Lance!

858
00:43:00,165 --> 00:43:01,125
What?

859
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:05,170
Via! Give me my lunch.
I’m starving.

860
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,463
Lunch box.

861
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:09,258
- You know,
- Lunch box.

862
00:43:09,258 --> 00:43:11,343
you should be the
one carrying this.

863
00:43:11,343 --> 00:43:12,970
- All right, go eat.
- Thank you.

864
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,221
Bye-bye.

865
00:43:20,686 --> 00:43:21,687
Bye-bye.

866
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:23,355
Bye-bye!

867
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:33,015
Guys, thanks for the time and
ideas you shared for our campaign.

868
00:43:34,257 --> 00:43:36,717
I can see I made the right
choice picking this team.

869
00:43:39,663 --> 00:43:42,708
Yeah, so let’s give it our
best in the coming days.

870
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:44,752
Yes!

871
00:43:47,087 --> 00:43:49,506
Your speech is
making me emotional, Pres.

872
00:43:50,382 --> 00:43:51,467
I really hope

873
00:43:52,426 --> 00:43:53,927
we win.

874
00:43:54,553 --> 00:43:58,265
And when that happens, Pres is
treating us to some snacks!

875
00:44:02,483 --> 00:44:03,651
All right. All right, then.

876
00:44:03,676 --> 00:44:05,260
Fine. I’ll treat everyone,
I promise.

877
00:44:05,285 --> 00:44:07,454
But for now, meeting adjourned.

878
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:08,650
Thank you.

879
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,819
Thank you, Pres.

880
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:14,114
- Bye!
- Bye!

881
00:44:14,114 --> 00:44:14,740
Take care!

882
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,366
Bye, everyone.

883
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,490
Have you eaten yet?

884
00:44:19,563 --> 00:44:20,564
Not yet.

885
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,173
Why? Are you treating us?

886
00:44:22,198 --> 00:44:23,283
What do you want to eat?

887
00:44:24,572 --> 00:44:26,199
Guys, I’ll go ahead, okay?

888
00:44:27,037 --> 00:44:28,197
Samantha!

889
00:44:29,338 --> 00:44:30,339
Just call me Sam.

890
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:32,800
Sam, come eat with us.

891
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,760
There’s a grill place outside.

892
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,597
They’ve got chicken feet,
grilled intestines,

893
00:44:38,597 --> 00:44:40,728
and grilled blood. It’s really
good. Have you tried it?

894
00:44:40,753 --> 00:44:42,963
Do you eat grilled blood?
Do you know what that is?

895
00:44:44,061 --> 00:44:45,729
What? Grilled blood?

896
00:44:45,729 --> 00:44:48,565
Hi, big sis. I’m Luna.

897
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,255
I’m the candidate for
second-year representative.

898
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,823
Yeah. I heard in the
meeting earlier.

899
00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:57,282
You know what, just call me Sam.

900
00:44:57,549 --> 00:44:58,633
She’s speaking English!

901
00:44:58,658 --> 00:45:02,454
Ke! Ke! Back me up.
Let’s switch!

902
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:04,606
What? I’m not ready.
Vice, you go!

903
00:45:08,252 --> 00:45:09,378
Good afternoon.

904
00:45:09,994 --> 00:45:11,871
How are you?
I’m fine, thank you.

905
00:45:11,896 --> 00:45:14,823
Are you a foreigner?
Do you have dollars?

906
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:17,793
I’m not a foreigner. Are you?

907
00:45:18,387 --> 00:45:19,805
You look so tall.

908
00:45:21,974 --> 00:45:24,351
Bro, she called me a foreigner.

909
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,186
For real though,
do I look like a foreigner?

910
00:45:26,495 --> 00:45:27,454
No.

911
00:45:27,479 --> 00:45:28,647
She’s just flattering you.

912
00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:29,881
Come on, let’s go.

913
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:33,944
Your boyfriend’s
flirting with me, by the way.

914
00:45:34,611 --> 00:45:37,531
Can you please
put a leash on your pet?

915
00:45:38,245 --> 00:45:39,329
I didn’t know.

916
00:45:40,429 --> 00:45:42,279
That’s why I’m telling you.

917
00:45:42,703 --> 00:45:44,955
Believe it or not,
it’s up to you.

918
00:45:45,247 --> 00:45:46,790
I’ve done my part.

919
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:50,752
Wow, fun times!

920
00:45:50,752 --> 00:45:52,629
The campaign
hasn’t even started yet,

921
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:54,339
and there’s drama already!

922
00:46:01,513 --> 00:46:02,931
Samantha Vera. Give it to them.

923
00:46:02,956 --> 00:46:06,877
Samantha Vera, third-year rep.
She’s nice. Super nice.

924
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:09,647
Bro, you’ve got
something on your cheek.

925
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:11,857
I’m already helping him and he—

926
00:46:11,857 --> 00:46:13,150
Don’t vote for him!

927
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,028
He’s got a terrible attitude!

928
00:46:38,823 --> 00:46:40,783
- They’re here.
- There they are.

929
00:46:41,403 --> 00:46:43,280
Class, listen to them first.

930
00:46:43,305 --> 00:46:44,806
Good day, everyone.

931
00:46:44,806 --> 00:46:46,141
I’m Acel.

932
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:50,078
And I’m Sevi.

933
00:46:50,103 --> 00:46:52,480
Yes, and we are
the Ray of Light Partylist.

934
00:46:58,445 --> 00:46:59,154
Okay—

935
00:46:59,154 --> 00:47:01,031
If you vote for us,

936
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:03,659
we’ll be with you
every step of the way.

937
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:06,119
Guys, the Ray of Light
Partylist supports you.

938
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,079
Right, Sevi?

939
00:47:07,454 --> 00:47:08,457
Right!

940
00:47:08,872 --> 00:47:11,708
Once you vote for us,
we’ll take care of you.

941
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:12,906
Okay?

942
00:47:13,168 --> 00:47:14,544
We are the
Ray of Light Partylist.

943
00:47:14,544 --> 00:47:16,088
Ray of Light Partylist, let’s go!

944
00:47:20,467 --> 00:47:22,344
- Hey!
- Guys, water.

945
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:24,262
Here, Sevi.

946
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,892
- You want some? Want some?
- Have some water.

947
00:47:28,892 --> 00:47:30,143
Looks like you already ate some,
that part’s missing.

948
00:47:30,143 --> 00:47:31,103
You’re being dramatic.

949
00:47:31,103 --> 00:47:32,104
You want some, Sevi?

950
00:47:32,104 --> 00:47:32,688
Yummy!

951
00:47:32,688 --> 00:47:34,690
- Via!
- This is my favorite.

952
00:47:39,236 --> 00:47:40,362
Lance: We need to talk.

953
00:47:40,362 --> 00:47:43,073
You know what, even the rice
Via cooks tastes good.

954
00:47:43,073 --> 00:47:44,658
Wow!

955
00:47:45,534 --> 00:47:47,411
Campaigning is so tiring.

956
00:47:48,328 --> 00:47:50,080
It’s worth it. We’re gonna win.

957
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,415
Please vote for Sam Vera!

958
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:54,710
Wait, you’ve been frowning
for a while now.

959
00:47:55,025 --> 00:47:56,068
What’s wrong?

960
00:47:56,093 --> 00:47:57,270
- Is it because of—
- Luna!

961
00:47:57,295 --> 00:47:58,338
Speaking of—

962
00:47:58,338 --> 00:47:59,006
Speak of the devil.

963
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:01,883
Luna, are you really planning
on not talking to me?

964
00:48:02,509 --> 00:48:04,594
Luna, that Yanna’s
the one flirting with me,

965
00:48:04,594 --> 00:48:05,570
not the other way around.

966
00:48:05,595 --> 00:48:07,806
She keeps chatting and
messaging me nonstop.

967
00:48:07,806 --> 00:48:09,577
I’ve been ignoring her, okay?

968
00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:11,810
Come on, Luna, we’ve been
together for two years.

969
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:14,021
You think I’d cheat on you now?

970
00:48:15,063 --> 00:48:17,399
Don’t tell me you actually
believe her over me?

971
00:48:18,282 --> 00:48:23,202
Yanna said you invited her
to your house?

972
00:48:23,325 --> 00:48:24,326
Huh?

973
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,431
And you believed her?

974
00:48:27,561 --> 00:48:29,855
I don’t even invite anyone over.

975
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,298
Her, of all people? No way.

976
00:48:31,413 --> 00:48:33,925
That girl’s just
obsessed with me.

977
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:37,139
She’s doing everything she can
to ruin what we have.

978
00:48:39,237 --> 00:48:40,197
What’s so funny?

979
00:48:40,222 --> 00:48:41,223
Nothing.

980
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,675
- I asked you, what’s so funny?
- Hey!

981
00:48:43,675 --> 00:48:44,134
- What’s your problem?
- You jerk—

982
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:45,135
She’s being a bitch.

983
00:48:45,135 --> 00:48:46,720
- Let go of Via!
- She’s such a bitch.

984
00:48:55,562 --> 00:48:56,563
Let go.

985
00:49:10,285 --> 00:49:11,286
Via…

986
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,538
I’m really sorry. I’m so—

987
00:49:13,914 --> 00:49:15,707
Huh? What are you
saying sorry for?

988
00:49:15,707 --> 00:49:17,000
You didn’t do anything wrong.

989
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,876
I’m sorry too.

990
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:19,544
I couldn’t stop myself.
I’m sorry.

991
00:49:19,544 --> 00:49:20,452
- You okay?
- Yeah.

992
00:49:20,477 --> 00:49:22,896
Don’t worry anymore.
Just forget about that jerk.

993
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:24,633
By the way,
Acel’s calling you guys.

994
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:25,717
He said he’s treating us.

995
00:49:25,717 --> 00:49:27,761
Hallelujah! I’m starving!

996
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:28,970
- Let’s go.
- Come on!

997
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,806
- Let’s go.
- Via…

998
00:49:30,806 --> 00:49:32,015
Hey, let’s post some here.

999
00:49:32,432 --> 00:49:33,558
I’m really sorry, okay?

1000
00:49:33,558 --> 00:49:34,614
It’s fine, really.

1001
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:40,148
Okay. Guys, I brought
some soft drinks.

1002
00:49:40,148 --> 00:49:41,274
- Hey! Thanks, Pres!
- Who doesn’t have any drinks?

1003
00:49:41,274 --> 00:49:42,234
- Thanks, Pres.
- All good.

1004
00:49:42,234 --> 00:49:43,777
- I got mine.
- You, Sam? Whose is this?

1005
00:49:43,777 --> 00:49:45,237
Here, you want some more?

1006
00:49:45,237 --> 00:49:47,322
No, Pres. I’ll just
have water later.

1007
00:49:47,322 --> 00:49:47,948
You sure?

1008
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:49,074
- Yeah. Thanks.
- You’re really nice, Pres.

1009
00:49:49,074 --> 00:49:50,784
Via, here’s one for you.

1010
00:49:50,784 --> 00:49:52,035
Is this normal—

1011
00:49:53,286 --> 00:49:54,287
Thanks, Pres.

1012
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,331
Of course.

1013
00:49:57,707 --> 00:50:00,051
He’s so caring
toward other people.

1014
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,523
You know what, I think we
don’t have utensils yet.

1015
00:50:03,548 --> 00:50:04,215
I’ll go grab some real quick.

1016
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,617
Wait. I’ll help you, Pres.

1017
00:50:06,466 --> 00:50:07,466
Let’s go!

1018
00:50:10,846 --> 00:50:12,472
- Five pairs, okay?
- Five? Okay.

1019
00:50:15,876 --> 00:50:18,462
So even college students
come here too?

1020
00:50:18,487 --> 00:50:19,821
Okay, done.

1021
00:50:22,816 --> 00:50:24,442
You took so long.

1022
00:50:24,808 --> 00:50:26,351
Sorry. I’m sorry, guys.

1023
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:29,865
Hello.

1024
00:50:29,865 --> 00:50:31,241
Hey.

1025
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,706
Don’t give Sevi since he’s
going to use his hands to eat.

1026
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:35,941
Do they know each other?

1027
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,134
Oh, okay!

1028
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:38,248
Guys!

1029
00:50:38,248 --> 00:50:39,457
Sorry I took a while.

1030
00:50:39,457 --> 00:50:40,542
- This is yours, Arkin.
- It’s okay.

1031
00:50:40,959 --> 00:50:42,085
Here.

1032
00:50:42,085 --> 00:50:43,044
- Here you go, Sam.
- Thank you.

1033
00:50:43,044 --> 00:50:44,129
Here’s more.

1034
00:50:45,147 --> 00:50:47,023
- Need help?
- Hold on, Via first.

1035
00:50:47,048 --> 00:50:48,117
Okay.

1036
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,153
That’s three pieces.
Different flavors.

1037
00:50:51,178 --> 00:50:53,430
- Finish them all!
- That’s a lot,

1038
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,307
I can’t finish them.

1039
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,977
Why? You only ate
a little at lunch, didn’t you?

1040
00:50:58,977 --> 00:51:00,145
Make sure to eat properly.

1041
00:51:00,145 --> 00:51:01,980
And you, on the other hand,
only drink soft drinks.

1042
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,106
Drink some water.

1043
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:04,524
Are you guys always like that?

1044
00:51:04,524 --> 00:51:05,901
Like a married couple, bro.

1045
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:12,949
- We’re just friends.
- What’s your relationship?

1046
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:13,742
Friends?

1047
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:14,659
Childhood.

1048
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,171
Luna.

1049
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,344
Luna, are you okay?

1050
00:51:33,803 --> 00:51:36,139
Look, I don’t mean to pry,

1051
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:37,933
but you should just leave him.

1052
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:41,519
You should take care
of yourself, Luna.

1053
00:51:42,145 --> 00:51:46,983
Yeah. Honestly, I’ve never felt
good about that guy.

1054
00:51:46,983 --> 00:51:48,735
I’ve had a bad feeling
about him since before.

1055
00:51:57,786 --> 00:51:58,995
Excuse me.

1056
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,373
Let’s eat somewhere else.

1057
00:52:01,831 --> 00:52:02,666
Let’s go.

1058
00:52:02,666 --> 00:52:04,918
KJ, I’m really craving
for chicken, you know?

1059
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:08,463
Come on, we’re blocking the way.

1060
00:52:08,463 --> 00:52:10,423
That’s enough, let’s go.

1061
00:52:10,423 --> 00:52:11,049
Luna.

1062
00:52:11,049 --> 00:52:12,342
What happened?
Why are you crying?

1063
00:52:12,342 --> 00:52:13,969
Is it because of your boyfriend?

1064
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,471
Forget him,
I already know he’s ugly

1065
00:52:16,471 --> 00:52:17,806
even if I haven’t met him.

1066
00:52:18,848 --> 00:52:20,433
Luna, don’t cry, okay?

1067
00:52:20,433 --> 00:52:22,435
Don’t cry over that bastard.

1068
00:52:22,435 --> 00:52:23,559
He’s ugly.

1069
00:52:25,981 --> 00:52:29,192
What happened? Is it about
that Lance guy again?

1070
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:33,655
That jerk.

1071
00:52:34,072 --> 00:52:39,035
So don’t ever crush
on guys like that, okay?

1072
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:41,830
I would never.

1073
00:52:51,298 --> 00:52:53,800
We’re blocking the way, come on.

1074
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,137
That’s enough. Just let him go.

1075
00:53:00,056 --> 00:53:02,600
This whole week
has been exhausting.

1076
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,060
I agree.

1077
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:08,565
I just hope they finish
tallying the votes soon.

1078
00:53:08,857 --> 00:53:11,818
I really want to know
if my bets won.

1079
00:53:12,152 --> 00:53:16,072
But I’ve got a strong feeling
Luna’s party is going to win.

1080
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,577
Hey, are you okay?

1081
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,080
I think I’m going
to break up with him.

1082
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:26,499
Really?
You’re actually doing it?

1083
00:53:27,776 --> 00:53:32,864
Yeah, I feel like it’s a good
thing I saw everything that happened.

1084
00:53:33,214 --> 00:53:34,841
I saw how toxic he really is.

1085
00:53:36,669 --> 00:53:39,339
Finally, Luna’s come
to her senses.

1086
00:53:39,804 --> 00:53:41,276
Hey! What the hell?

1087
00:53:41,308 --> 00:53:43,769
Take back everything you
said about my girlfriend.

1088
00:53:43,794 --> 00:53:45,879
Because of you, we’re not
even talking anymore.

1089
00:53:46,161 --> 00:53:49,205
Why should I?
I only told her the truth.

1090
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:52,734
You’re the one who should stop
spamming me with texts.

1091
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:56,738
Your flirting is getting annoying,
I’m not even into you.

1092
00:53:56,738 --> 00:54:00,116
Wow, out of all the people
you’ve fooled around with,

1093
00:54:00,116 --> 00:54:01,409
I’m the one you don’t like?

1094
00:54:02,327 --> 00:54:04,454
Quit pretending.

1095
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:08,291
For all I know,
you want a taste of me, too.

1096
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,752
You’ve got some nerve!

1097
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,629
I haven’t even
kissed anyone yet!

1098
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:14,462
Here, let me give you
your first kiss then.

1099
00:54:15,423 --> 00:54:16,758
- You’re disgusting!
- Luna!

1100
00:54:16,758 --> 00:54:18,093
- So disgusting!
- Hey, Luna!

1101
00:54:18,093 --> 00:54:19,928
- What the heck?
- You’re disgusting!

1102
00:54:19,928 --> 00:54:20,929
- Luna!
- You’re disgusting!

1103
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:22,972
- Luna, that’s enough!
- You’re disgusting!

1104
00:54:26,771 --> 00:54:27,853
Yanna!

1105
00:54:29,354 --> 00:54:30,271
Out of the way!

1106
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:31,231
Stop!

1107
00:54:31,439 --> 00:54:32,524
- What the—
- Move! Luna…

1108
00:54:32,524 --> 00:54:34,859
- Babe! She’s the one—
- Hey, don’t you listen?

1109
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:36,528
Didn’t I tell you
to leave Luna alone?

1110
00:54:36,528 --> 00:54:38,446
You perverted trash,
that’s what you are!

1111
00:54:39,489 --> 00:54:39,948
Bitch—

1112
00:54:39,948 --> 00:54:41,449
What did you say? Trash?

1113
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:43,201
- Yeah, I said you’re trash.
- Huh?

1114
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:44,132
Trash, huh?

1115
00:54:44,577 --> 00:54:45,412
I’m trash?

1116
00:54:45,412 --> 00:54:46,460
Yes!

1117
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:47,872
You fucking bitch!

1118
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:50,977
♪ You’re mine… ♪

1119
00:55:59,335 --> 00:56:01,298
I felt Arkin kick.

1120
00:56:01,323 --> 00:56:03,617
Me too, Via kicked.

1121
00:56:04,312 --> 00:56:05,855
You two…

1122
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:09,471
I think they liked our music.

1123
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:10,872
I think so, too.

1124
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:12,874
I’m getting kinda hungry.

1125
00:56:12,874 --> 00:56:14,626
Same here, and
I really need to pee.

1126
00:56:14,626 --> 00:56:16,127
Let’s rest for a bit.
Break time, guys.

1127
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,200
Yeah, break time.

1128
00:56:18,046 --> 00:56:20,632
Why do you keep
following me around?

1129
00:56:20,632 --> 00:56:23,801
Because we’re best friends.

1130
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:29,307
We should always stay together.

1131
00:56:29,307 --> 00:56:30,308
Why?

1132
00:56:30,308 --> 00:56:33,353
Because you’re my first friend.

1133
00:56:50,036 --> 00:56:51,829
Guys, I have good news!

1134
00:56:52,205 --> 00:56:54,457
We just signed a new contract!

1135
00:56:57,085 --> 00:56:59,170
- Thank you so much!
- Guys!

1136
00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:02,048
All right, snacks on me, guys!
Let’s celebrate!

1137
00:57:02,048 --> 00:57:04,133
You came just in time.
Cheers!

1138
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,464
You waited for me again?

1139
00:57:44,132 --> 00:57:45,174
Didn’t I tell you?

1140
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:48,386
We go to school together
and leave together.

1141
00:57:50,644 --> 00:57:51,854
You don’t have a choice.

1142
00:57:52,223 --> 00:57:53,224
You’re so clingy.

1143
00:57:53,249 --> 00:57:54,542
Super clingy.

1144
00:57:55,143 --> 00:57:57,312
How was training? You tired?

1145
00:57:57,787 --> 00:57:58,683
Yeah.

1146
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,539
Yeah?

1147
00:57:59,564 --> 00:58:00,440
I’m tired.

1148
00:58:00,857 --> 00:58:01,944
You’re tired?

1149
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,401
Okay then.

1150
00:58:03,985 --> 00:58:05,528
Come, hop on.

1151
00:58:06,462 --> 00:58:08,172
- What?
- Get on.

1152
00:58:08,197 --> 00:58:10,199
- No way.
- Hurry up.

1153
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:11,409
I said no way.

1154
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:12,452
I’ll lie down right here
if you don’t get on.

1155
00:58:12,452 --> 00:58:13,944
- No! Don’t
- I’m really gonna lie down.

1156
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:15,084
I said no. Stop!

1157
00:58:15,344 --> 00:58:16,789
Get up. I don’t wanna.

1158
00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:18,374
- Come on.
- No.

1159
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:19,525
Whatever.

1160
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:21,377
Get up.

1161
00:58:21,711 --> 00:58:22,712
Stand up.

1162
00:58:23,986 --> 00:58:24,945
Still tired?

1163
00:58:25,145 --> 00:58:26,786
- Am I heavy?
- No.

1164
00:58:26,811 --> 00:58:28,753
- Am I heavy?
- I can carry two of you.

1165
00:59:05,296 --> 00:59:08,111
Why did you have to fight, Kino?

1166
00:59:08,136 --> 00:59:09,776
You want me to just stand
there while that jerk

1167
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:10,927
had you by the collar?

1168
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:13,346
Does it still hurt?

1169
00:59:18,506 --> 00:59:22,510
We only have three weeks left
before Foundation Day, guys.

1170
00:59:23,073 --> 00:59:23,940
Hey, Yanna!

1171
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,570
You’re joining
the Miss Valerian pageant.

1172
00:59:26,595 --> 00:59:28,389
You don’t have a choice anymore,
I signed you up.

1173
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:30,154
Go ahead.

1174
00:59:30,947 --> 00:59:33,533
I knew I’d find you here.

1175
00:59:41,082 --> 00:59:42,291
There.

1176
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:43,751
See?

1177
00:59:43,751 --> 00:59:44,961
Why do you look so red?

1178
00:59:44,961 --> 00:59:45,920
Let me see.

1179
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,713
- Huh?
- Do you have a fever?

1180
00:59:46,713 --> 00:59:48,047
You feel warm.

1181
00:59:49,006 --> 00:59:51,050
It’s kinda hot in this room.

1182
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,552
- Huh?
- I think the fan’s—

1183
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:54,153
No, the aircon’s on.

1184
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:55,179
Hi, Arkin.

1185
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:00,685
Kino, do you have a crush?
