1
00:00:25,352 --> 00:00:26,500
Fine.

2
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:27,859
Let’s get married.

3
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:29,177
You’re really marrying me, Via?

4
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:31,304
Do you take Avianna—

5
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:32,431
I do!

6
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,599
You may now kiss the bride.

7
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,388
Via!

8
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:43,775
Your kiss looked like it
was in slow motion, like this.

9
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:45,277
What if you become my first kiss?

10
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:47,320
Just here.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,155
Fine,

12
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,473
then you do it.

13
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:50,935
Here. Come on!

14
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:58,081
Hey, Yanna.

15
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:00,167
You don’t have a choice, okay?
You’re our friend now.

16
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:02,252
- Right!
- Hug!

17
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:03,962
Is this seat taken?

18
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:05,670
It’s taken.

19
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:11,178
Wow, the kid’s got some attitude.

20
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:13,472
Kino, I think I have a crush.

21
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,389
Who’s your crush?

22
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:15,932
It’s Pres...

23
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:36,555
Put that down.

24
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:45,386
Clean that up,
or I’ll make you eat it.

25
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:14,921
Via, are you okay?
Sit down for a bit.

26
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:16,761
You’re not hurt, are you?

27
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:18,961
Thanks.

28
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:22,100
We’re just gonna get some water.

29
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,393
- I’ve finished mine, so—
- What?

30
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:24,853
Via, are you okay?

31
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:26,104
- I’m really sorry.
- Luna’s coming with me.

32
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:27,439
- Are you okay?
- I’m sorry. Are you sure you’re okay?

33
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,857
- Yeah. You okay?
- All right. Let’s go.

34
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:31,221
Via—

35
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:33,276
Are you okay?

36
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:34,847
Yes, Pres. I’m fine.

37
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:39,492
Here, that’s yours now.

38
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,189
I’ll just buy a new one.

39
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,346
No.

40
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:44,659
It’s okay.

41
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:45,856
Pres, I have—

42
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:49,959
I still have another lunch box.

43
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:51,955
Okay.

44
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:53,238
You know what, I can take that,

45
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:56,975
and you can just
have the one I bought.

46
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:03,323
All right then,

47
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,851
better than it going to waste.

48
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:07,752
Pres, are you sure you want this?

49
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:08,971
Of course.

50
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:13,565
Did you cook this?
I’m sure it’s delicious.

51
00:04:24,746 --> 00:04:25,784
Thank you.

52
00:04:48,827 --> 00:04:52,174
Via: Kino, where are you? Let’s talk.

53
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:00,365
Your G chord’s good.

54
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:02,409
Here. One more.

55
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:03,910
You can do—

56
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,912
Move it here. That’s it.

57
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:08,832
Then the other side, lower…
this one.

58
00:05:08,832 --> 00:05:10,125
Can we talk?

59
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:14,170
Here?

60
00:05:15,046 --> 00:05:17,674
You said you didn’t
wait for me yesterday?

61
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:21,612
Then why did Ke and Luna say
that they saw you yesterday?

62
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:23,222
Waiting outside for me…

63
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:28,727
I did wait yesterday, but—

64
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:29,752
But what?

65
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,234
Mama called, so I had
to go home right away.

66
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,796
Are you being honest,
or are you still lying?

67
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:51,124
Don’t wait for me today.
I’ll go home late.

68
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,003
Go home first since your
mom’s worried about you, right?

69
00:05:58,298 --> 00:06:00,800
Someone’s gonna walk you
home even if I’m not around, right?

70
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,053
I’m worried, that’s all.

71
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:04,596
I can take care of myself.

72
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,981
I’m sorry.

73
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:18,735
Let’s get back to G.

74
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:30,497
Via, you fell asleep before
checking my assignment.

75
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:34,542
Huh? I didn’t! It’s right
here in your bag.

76
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:36,211
See? Look at it.

77
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:42,675
You’re the best, Via!

78
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:50,268
Hurry up. Take a shower,
you’ll be late.

79
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:52,310
Oh, Mira…

80
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:04,906
Where’s the other lunch box?

81
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:09,536
Oh, right. I gave one
to Pres yesterday.

82
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:22,428
Did you finish the math homework?

83
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:24,747
Ah, not yet.

84
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:26,428
- You did yours already?
- I’m so stressed.

85
00:07:26,428 --> 00:07:28,555
I can’t even remember the formula.

86
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,518
- Via?
- Huh?

87
00:07:34,543 --> 00:07:36,253
Are you and Arkin still not okay?

88
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,286
Did he say something
to you guys?

89
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:40,817
Not really.

90
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:44,154
We just noticed you two
aren’t hanging out together.

91
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:50,058
We talked yesterday. We’re—

92
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,459
We just had a little misunderstanding.

93
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:53,204
Is it because of the—

94
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:54,322
Yeah.

95
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,935
But he’s been busy with
the music club lately,

96
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,670
so I guess it’s fine.

97
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:01,504
Let’s not talk about it anymore.

98
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:02,596
Okay.

99
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,341
Yeah, let’s drop that. Let’s talk
about Pres instead.

100
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:06,885
Right! What did you two
talk about yesterday?

101
00:08:06,885 --> 00:08:07,978
What was it, huh? Tell us!

102
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:09,804
Hey, what’s up?

103
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:12,515
Don’t worry about it,
I’ll take care of it.

104
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,813
Hey, you’re getting ahead of me
in the love life.

105
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:22,692
Love life?

106
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:24,527
Come on. No way.

107
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:26,738
Pres is just really friendly.

108
00:08:27,113 --> 00:08:29,491
But he makes you smile?

109
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:32,660
Hey, blame your ex.
Because of him, they got to talk.

110
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,912
Oh, please.

111
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:34,924
Oh,

112
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:35,705
speaking of—

113
00:08:35,705 --> 00:08:36,689
Hurry, look—

114
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:38,657
Hi, Kierra, Luna!

115
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:39,744
Hi!

116
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:43,053
Here’s the lunch box
I borrowed from you.

117
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,766
I washed it already.

118
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:45,967
Thank you.

119
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,885
Thanks too, Pres.

120
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,970
I’ll go ahead.

121
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,347
- All right.
- Take care, you guys.

122
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:55,058
What was that?

123
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:57,489
What do you mean?

124
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,953
Like… what was that?

125
00:09:00,647 --> 00:09:02,607
You didn’t even take the chance?

126
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,025
That’s all you said?

127
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,444
He was talking
to you already, like—

128
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:07,904
Yeah, seriously.

129
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:09,489
What was I supposed to say?

130
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,076
Oh my gosh, if you don’t
confess to Pres soon,

131
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:14,744
I’ll do it for you.

132
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:16,371
Right? Seriously.

133
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:17,539
She’s too slow.

134
00:09:17,564 --> 00:09:18,515
Oh!

135
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,283
Hey, classes are suspended.

136
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:21,767
- What? No way!
- Yeah, look.

137
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:23,085
The teachers will
be having a meeting.

138
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:24,923
Perfect.

139
00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:26,325
Hey, let’s drop by Sevi’s place.

140
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,143
His house is just nearby, right?

141
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,152
You think that’s okay with Sevi?

142
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,110
Of course.

143
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,205
She’s right, you’re inviting
people like it’s your house.

144
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,606
Stop being so dramatic.
It’s fine!

145
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:35,400
I’ll take care of it.

146
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,135
Besides, I’m so tired of
eating the same food

147
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,283
here at the cafeteria.

148
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:39,080
- Let’s eat there instead.
- You sure about that?

149
00:09:39,105 --> 00:09:40,273
- Yes.
- Let’s invite Sam, too.

150
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:41,896
Actually, that works.

151
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:44,025
She’s with Yanna anyway. See?

152
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:46,045
Oh, how about Arkin?

153
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:47,697
Huh?

154
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,133
Don’t worry, I’ll tell him, too.

155
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,275
Oh.

156
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,265
What happened to your ex?

157
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:01,311
Hey, I don’t have an ex.

158
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:02,312
I don’t have an ex!

159
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:03,730
Besides, he loves picking fights,

160
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,189
but he doesn’t even
know how to punch.

161
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:06,937
He’s like—

162
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:09,902
Come on, let’s go.

163
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:13,531
Here, gluttons.

164
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,534
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

165
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:17,535
Looks good.

166
00:10:18,286 --> 00:10:19,579
Hey! Let me do that.

167
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,331
No, it’s fine. Here, I’m done.

168
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:24,834
Are you always alone
here at home?

169
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:26,269
Ah, no.

170
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,755
It’s just early, so my mom’s
out for a check-up.

171
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:30,798
My sibling’s at school,

172
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,217
and my dad’s at
work with your dad.

173
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,471
It’s amazing, right?
They work together.

174
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:37,889
Yeah, it is.

175
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:39,265
Oh, my—

176
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:39,974
That’s my—

177
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:40,975
I got it.

178
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:44,312
This one’s mine.

179
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:45,351
Okay.

180
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,234
- Is that yours?
- Yeah.

181
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:53,196
I don’t like that.
I don’t like it.

182
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:54,447
You don’t like action?

183
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:55,323
- Nope.
- You don’t? What do you like?

184
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:56,199
I want…

185
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,408
I want romance.

186
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,576
Are you two fighting?

187
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:04,332
Why, what did he tell you?

188
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:05,625
You two are always together.

189
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:07,976
He didn’t say anything.

190
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:11,409
Nothing serious.
Just a small misunderstanding.

191
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,719
And he’s the one who started
ignoring me anyway.

192
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:16,677
You should talk it out.

193
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,513
It’d be a shame
to lose your friendship.

194
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,936
You know what—

195
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,856
I have feelings
for a friend of mine.

196
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,317
Yeah, you like Luna, right?

197
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,070
Guys! Gross!

198
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:36,948
How did you know?

199
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,450
Sevi, it’s so obvious.

200
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:42,328
Via.

201
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,664
Don’t tell Luna.

202
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:46,249
I don’t plan on confessing.

203
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:47,500
You guys are so stubborn,
let’s just watch.

204
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,459
What movie do you want?

205
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,752
Besides, I’m graduating soon.

206
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,046
I’m sure I’ll meet plenty of people
I’ll like in college.

207
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:55,049
And I don’t want
to ruin our friendship.

208
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:59,971
If you don’t confess, someone
else might beat you to it.

209
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,974
You’ll regret it forever.

210
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:08,354
What about you then?

211
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:11,607
If you have feelings for a friend,
would you admit it right away?

212
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:15,403
Don’t you think
they might feel awkward,

213
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:18,030
and it’d ruin your friendship?

214
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,407
That would be a shame.

215
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:24,078
That won’t happen to me.
I’d never fall for a friend anyway.

216
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,747
Wait, girls.

217
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:31,752
What are you two
talking about, huh?

218
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,713
Ah, nothing. I was just
checking if this tastes good—

219
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:34,839
UNINTELLIGIBLE

220
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:35,715
Come on, let’s go.

221
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:36,507
- What?
- I got it.

222
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,758
There. Come on, let’s eat.

223
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,386
We’re hungry, and
let’s watch a movie after.

224
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,512
- All right, let’s go.
- What’s that?

225
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:42,013
Yeah, that one.

226
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:43,014
– Okay.
– Please bring it.

227
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:43,764
Okay. Let’s go!

228
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:44,765
You just finished it all!

229
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,521
I told you to leave some for me.
So annoying.

230
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:47,785
Here.

231
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,811
Come on, eat up.

232
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,170
Okay.

233
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:55,776
Want some?

234
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,530
Sam. Sam…

235
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,415
- I dare you to touch me, Yanna.
- Ouch!

236
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:10,708
I’ll smack you with my pillow!

237
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,210
Hey! Why would I touch you?

238
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,795
I should be scared that you
might kiss me later!

239
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,631
You talk too much,
you’re such an idiot.

240
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:18,007
What movie did you even pick?

241
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:18,966
You’re so loud!

242
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:19,926
What’s with you, Sevi?

243
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:22,887
You love adult films, but
you shut your eyes when it’s horror?

244
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,138
Those weren’t mine, dummy!

245
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,348
Just watch.

246
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:27,391
Look at the TV. Watch.

247
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,167
Sorry.

248
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,509
Ouch!

249
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:12,137
Via.

250
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:13,896
Yeah?

251
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,776
I can’t stand being away
from you anymore.

252
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:22,029
So please,

253
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:24,209
let’s fix this.

254
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,121
If I did something wrong,
I’m sorry.

255
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:34,208
If I messed up somehow,
please tell me, so—

256
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:40,673
because I don’t know what to
do when you won’t talk to me.

257
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:44,885
You’re the one who
started avoiding me.

258
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,221
You’re the one who stopped
talking to me first.

259
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:50,516
And Kino, you’re the
one who lied to me.

260
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:52,810
Via, I’m really sorry.

261
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,061
I’m sorry, please.

262
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:55,857
I’m sorry.

263
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,982
Please, I’m sorry.

264
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:04,780
It’s fine now.

265
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:14,749
Why are you laughing?

266
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:22,632
You look ugly when you cry.

267
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:25,990
Blow.

268
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,227
Also—

269
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:39,023
Don’t give my lunch box
to anyone else, okay?

270
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:40,775
That’s mine.

271
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:48,783
Kino, I really made that for you,

272
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:51,744
I prepared it for you,
but you didn’t take it.

273
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:54,189
Then Pres was there,
and he hadn’t eaten yet,

274
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,582
so I gave it to him instead.
It would’ve been a waste.

275
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,335
But that was really for you.

276
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:05,007
Who do you like more,
Pres or me?

277
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,134
Of course, you!

278
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:09,679
Do you even need to ask?

279
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:11,347
Really?

280
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:13,313
No doubt about it.

281
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:17,019
I wouldn’t trade you for anyone.

282
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:22,763
Here.

283
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,162
Wait!

284
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:33,661
Before you take it,
are we good now?

285
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,081
Friends again?

286
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:40,543
Friends? Just friends?

287
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,547
Best, best, best, best friends!

288
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:49,301
And our friendship won’t end just
because of a small misunderstanding.

289
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:54,765
Thanks.

290
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:57,685
Go on, eat.

291
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:00,951
Wait.

292
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,441
What happened here?

293
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:07,111
Oh, nothing. I just
bumped into something.

294
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,130
Where?

295
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,030
Can I eat this now?

296
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,324
Wow.

297
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:26,088
Hey!

298
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,631
What are you guys doing out here?

299
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:29,383
We just finished
watching a horror movie,

300
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,093
we need to shake
the bad vibes off.

301
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,512
Join us inside, we’re scared.

302
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,681
Come on.

303
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,184
Eat it inside, let’s go.

304
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:40,052
So stupid.

305
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:48,944
Come on.

306
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:01,307
Guys!

307
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:02,833
I got accepted in España!

308
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,417
Wow!

309
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,349
Hey!

310
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,293
- Congratulations!
- Congrats, bro!

311
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:07,838
Wow, Sevi. Congrats!

312
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,048
- He’s a Panther now.
- So cool.

313
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,508
I hope we get in, too.

314
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:12,676
- Claiming it.
- Claiming it!

315
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:17,389
Wait, why don’t you look
happy about getting in?

316
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,852
Nothing. Just some family stuff.

317
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:23,236
But it’s nothing!

318
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,396
What about you?

319
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,065
What universities do
you plan on applying to?

320
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:27,817
And what course are
you planning to take?

321
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,279
I don’t know.
It depends on my dad.

322
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:33,839
Huh?

323
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,367
Why does it depend on your dad?

324
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,661
Shouldn’t that be up to you?

325
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:44,583
Well, he’s very much involved
in my college course.

326
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:49,380
Yanna’s going to
Morayta or Intramuros.

327
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:51,465
She said she wants
to be a flight attendant.

328
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:52,716
Sounds nice, right?

329
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:59,056
Even if she looks kind of grumpy,
smiling can be practiced, right?

330
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,162
Maybe.

331
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,505
Hey!

332
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:06,443
Come on, Luna, have mercy.

333
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:08,461
That’s enough.

334
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,318
Via, don’t worry. I’ll look after you.
I’ll protect you.

335
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,279
Wow, you guys
are so over the top.

336
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,573
I’m just giving
this to the spiker.

337
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:19,326
We don’t want her
nose to bleed again.

338
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,703
I’m sorry, Via.

339
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,708
- It’s fine.
- I’m sorry.

340
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:22,955
Hey!

341
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,962
I promise, never again.
Never again.

342
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:31,672
Hey!

343
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:35,217
Bro, give me a hand.
Pres needs me to move something.

344
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:38,012
You’re big enough,
you can handle it.

345
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:39,847
And I’ll stay here
to keep an eye on Via,

346
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:40,806
just in case she gets
hit by the ball again.

347
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,266
Come on, bro,
it won’t take a while!

348
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,684
You’re starting to scare me.

349
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,186
Would you follow Via
all the way to her coffin?

350
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:53,599
You think that’s possible?

351
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,498
How though?

352
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:00,951
Might work, right?
With a back hug?

353
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:08,167
You know what, let’s go.
You’re insane.

354
00:20:08,363 --> 00:20:09,591
- Let’s go.
- Via my bag.

355
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:10,755
Hey, Via.

356
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,130
Via, Pres is graduating soon.

357
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,673
When are you going to confess?

358
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:15,904
Huh?

359
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,887
Yeah. You should admit your
feelings before he graduates.

360
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:23,557
He’s going away, and who knows,
maybe he likes you, too.

361
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,644
Yeah, he said he’s studying
in Pampanga,

362
00:20:26,644 --> 00:20:29,605
taking up
Aeronautical Engineering.

363
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,819
Do I really need to talk to him?

364
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:38,238
Maybe I don’t have to. Right?

365
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,699
What’s with you? If you
don’t do it now, then when?

366
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,493
If not now, when?

367
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:52,002
It’s probably better to just tell Pres
how I feel before I run out of time.

368
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:56,382
What if you confess
during the field trip?

369
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,468
- The view would look so nice, right?
- Wow.

370
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,263
- That would be so sweet.
- Shit, that’d be beautiful.

371
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:04,890
I can already picture it.

372
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,476
But you know what,
at the end of the day

373
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,995
just do what you
think is best for you.

374
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,075
Okay?

375
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,316
If not now, then when?

376
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,068
That’s in English.

377
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,861
Yeah. It’s nice.

378
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:19,208
That’s enough.

379
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,198
Let’s stop this.

380
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,347
Pa.

381
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:41,816
Via.

382
00:21:45,174 --> 00:21:47,134
I got that. You should rest.

383
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:51,061
Wow, my daughter’s
really hardworking.

384
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:53,714
By the way,

385
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,371
isn’t your friend’s
dad Engineer Camero?

386
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:58,884
Yes, Pa. Why?

387
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,656
Well, my boss at work changed.

388
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:07,161
I think he resigned or maybe
transferred somewhere far.

389
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:09,346
I think in Cebu.
Not really sure though.

390
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:11,161
Did your friend mention
anything about it?

391
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:15,794
Is that why Sevi looked
bothered the other day?

392
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,363
No, Pa, he didn’t say anything.

393
00:22:18,522 --> 00:22:21,306
I see. I was just surprised,
that’s all.

394
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:22,749
I lost my drinking buddy.

395
00:22:24,787 --> 00:22:27,581
Arkin mentioned you have
a field trip coming up.

396
00:22:28,637 --> 00:22:30,034
You should join, okay?

397
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:32,140
I’ve set some money aside for it.

398
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,974
Huh?

399
00:22:32,974 --> 00:22:34,267
Yeah. Here.

400
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:37,354
Oh no, Pa, that’s not necessary.

401
00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:40,607
You don’t have to.
I don’t have to go.

402
00:22:40,607 --> 00:22:42,567
We can just use that
money to help

403
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:43,985
with Mira and
Ysha’s other expenses.

404
00:22:43,985 --> 00:22:46,338
- And it’s not even required by the school.
- Come on, sweetheart.

405
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:49,324
I want you to join
things like that.

406
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:52,911
You might miss out on
enjoying your high school life.

407
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:54,454
Come on, take it.

408
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:58,535
Pa…

409
00:22:59,042 --> 00:23:01,878
Take it. I’m going to
sulk if you don’t.

410
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:07,592
Thanks, Pa.

411
00:23:09,094 --> 00:23:14,683
Pa, I promise I’ll study hard
and work hard

412
00:23:14,683 --> 00:23:17,769
so I can make up
for all your sacrifices.

413
00:23:18,144 --> 00:23:20,313
Via, you don’t have to make up
for anything.

414
00:23:20,897 --> 00:23:23,775
I didn’t have kids just so
I’d have a retirement plan.

415
00:23:24,317 --> 00:23:27,153
What’s important is that you
study well and work hard

416
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:28,863
to reach your dreams.

417
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:31,783
And I’ll work hard too,

418
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:35,287
so I can help you and your
siblings reach those dreams.

419
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,963
Okay?

420
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:39,541
Thank you.

421
00:23:40,709 --> 00:23:41,710
Okay.

422
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:45,981
But give back
the change, all right?

423
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:47,173
Of course.

424
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,386
What matters is that you’re happy.

425
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:52,762
- Okay?
- Thank you.

426
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:56,683
I just want you to always
have fun. Okay, sweetheart?

427
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:58,560
- Thank you, Pa.
- Okay?

428
00:24:07,902 --> 00:24:09,154
- Hey!
- Ouch!

429
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:12,198
I’m so excited to ride
the Space Shuttle!

430
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:14,451
- Oh my god!
- Hey, Via—

431
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:15,827
I feel like we should ride
the Space Shuttle—

432
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:17,954
- then Anchors Away, and then—
- No! This is the one I want!

433
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:20,248
- This is what I want, so let’s go here.
- Sevi, come on!

434
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:21,221
Let’s just go there!

435
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:27,672
- Yanna!
- Yeah?

436
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:29,424
I wanna ride that boat thingy.

437
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:31,468
- The boat thingy? What does it do?
- Yeah. The water thing.

438
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:33,470
Then let’s try that
spinning thing!

439
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,929
Oh my god!

440
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,728
Oh my god, oh my god.
Shit, shit, shit.

441
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:00,497
Hey, we’re joining too!

442
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:02,040
One, two, three—

443
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:06,628
Didn’t we go to
those rides earlier?

444
00:25:07,337 --> 00:25:10,757
It was slow at first, but after
a while, it became nauseating.

445
00:25:11,132 --> 00:25:12,133
I got dizzy.

446
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:14,386
Did you have your eyes closed?

447
00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:17,389
You should admit your feelings
before he graduates.

448
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:20,183
And who knows, maybe
he likes you too.

449
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:26,356
That’s exhausting.

450
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:38,493
Don’t vomit, okay?

451
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:39,702
I’m gonna miss you guys.

452
00:25:43,957 --> 00:25:45,917
I don’t like this. Damn it,
this thing’s gonna go fast.

453
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:47,460
I don’t like this. I’m done.

454
00:25:48,336 --> 00:25:49,388
I don’t—

455
00:26:15,113 --> 00:26:16,114
- Ah!
- Hey!

456
00:26:16,698 --> 00:26:17,323
Oh my god.

457
00:26:17,323 --> 00:26:17,866
That hurts.

458
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:19,035
Okay. Get your IDs.

459
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,493
- Hey, Kino—
- That way.

460
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:21,494
- Hey!
- Okay.

461
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:22,203
Give me that.

462
00:26:22,203 --> 00:26:23,455
- Good job!
- Wait.

463
00:26:23,455 --> 00:26:24,080
My—

464
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,098
Hey, Kino!

465
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:28,126
Okay. Everybody,
let’s take a group photo!

466
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:32,046
- Look at this guy’s face.
- Kino?

467
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:33,089
Kino!

468
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:33,465
Hey!

469
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:35,508
- Hey, hey!
- Oh no, no, no!

470
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:42,265
Is it good?

471
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:43,099
Good, huh?

472
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:44,809
Yuck. Gross.

473
00:26:47,353 --> 00:26:49,814
- Look . Sevi’s dizzy, too.
- That was so fun.

474
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:52,609
That was crazy!

475
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:53,860
- I need to pee.
- Hey!

476
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,819
I’m done.

477
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:56,086
Huh?

478
00:26:56,488 --> 00:26:58,615
Don’t go on the next ride,
Arkin, okay?

479
00:26:58,615 --> 00:26:59,616
We can do it.

480
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:02,952
Then I’ll just skip the next one too,
so he has someone to stay with.

481
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:05,330
What are you? Twin pack?

482
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,370
Hey, there’s ice cream.

483
00:27:07,123 --> 00:27:08,183
Hey, Ke!

484
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,626
I want a doughnut.
You want one?

485
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:10,816
I do!

486
00:27:11,503 --> 00:27:12,504
It’s so hot!

487
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,881
What are you looking for?

488
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:16,633
This?

489
00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:20,345
Why do you have one?

490
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:21,846
Why are you carrying that?

491
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:24,349
I always bring one
just in case you need it.

492
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:27,060
Come here, I’ll fix your hair.

493
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:28,728
Do you even know how?

494
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:29,646
Of course.

495
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:31,814
- Of course, who do you think I am?
- It’s so hot.

496
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:39,239
There. One more.

497
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:42,325
Wow.

498
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:43,952
One more. Let me tighten it, okay?
You good?

499
00:27:43,952 --> 00:27:45,078
Yeah, I’m good.

500
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:48,456
Does it look okay?

501
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:50,375
Is it good?

502
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:51,960
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

503
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:54,671
Wait. Let’s take a picture.

504
00:27:56,756 --> 00:27:58,508
Pose properly, I’m sending
this to Mama.

505
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:04,280
Let me see.

506
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:05,557
I look good.

507
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,851
Via!

508
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:10,144
- Luna.
- Come on.

509
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:12,564
- Girl talk.
- Huh?

510
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:13,648
Yeah, come on.

511
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:14,232
Girl talk?

512
00:28:14,232 --> 00:28:15,233
- Girl talk!
- You stay right there.

513
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:16,483
Bye!

514
00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:21,781
Via!

515
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:22,198
Yeah?

516
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:23,533
I know where Pres is.

517
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:24,951
Go and talk to him.

518
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:26,062
Huh?

519
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:28,162
I should go see him?

520
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:29,218
Yes!

521
00:28:29,455 --> 00:28:30,456
Come on,

522
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:32,584
this is your time to shine.

523
00:28:32,584 --> 00:28:35,086
Tell him how you feel!

524
00:28:35,086 --> 00:28:36,546
Let’s look for him later!

525
00:28:36,588 --> 00:28:38,329
- Really?
- Yeah.

526
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,925
I’m really gonna confess?

527
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:42,635
Maybe later.

528
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,484
All right.

529
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:50,893
But Luna, I don’t think
I can do this.

530
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:52,854
Maybe next time.

531
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:54,230
I’m too shy.

532
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:56,774
Come on, you can totally do it!

533
00:28:56,774 --> 00:28:58,026
Want someone to come with you?

534
00:28:58,735 --> 00:28:59,738
Sevi!

535
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:02,864
Hey, what’s that, fishballs?
Gimme some!

536
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:04,824
Sevi, go with Via.

537
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:06,409
Where to? She’s old enough!

538
00:29:07,952 --> 00:29:09,579
Kidding. Where are we going?

539
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:17,587
Wait, for real?

540
00:29:17,587 --> 00:29:18,921
All right, I’ll come with you!

541
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:20,882
Okay.

542
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:22,050
- Later.
- You got this.

543
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,676
Yes!

544
00:29:23,676 --> 00:29:24,796
Eat with us, Sevi.

545
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,681
What’s that? It’s delicious.

546
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:29,741
Right?

547
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:35,938
Where is he anyway?

548
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:44,781
Am I really gonna do this?

549
00:29:45,031 --> 00:29:46,658
Maybe I shouldn’t…

550
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:49,452
Oh, there’s Pres.

551
00:29:50,078 --> 00:29:51,107
Come on.

552
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:54,399
Pres.

553
00:29:54,424 --> 00:29:55,717
Hey. What’s up?

554
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:58,336
Via’s got something to say.

555
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,979
What is it?

556
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:01,464
I’ll leave you guys here, okay?

557
00:30:01,464 --> 00:30:03,216
I’m gonna buy some churros.
You do your thing.

558
00:30:03,508 --> 00:30:04,692
Come sit, Via.

559
00:30:04,717 --> 00:30:05,719
Sit here.

560
00:30:06,844 --> 00:30:07,946
Want some of this?

561
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:10,640
I’ll just put this here.

562
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:13,518
No turning back now.

563
00:30:13,518 --> 00:30:15,422
You got this, Via.

564
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,488
Want some churros?

565
00:30:28,408 --> 00:30:29,742
Here, that’s for you.

566
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:31,536
This is the dip.

567
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:33,329
Okay.

568
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:44,298
I like you.

569
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:50,012
There, I said it.

570
00:30:50,346 --> 00:30:51,597
That’s it.

571
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:54,350
Better to confess than regret
not saying anything.

572
00:31:01,607 --> 00:31:02,900
Thank you, Via.

573
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:13,619
Thank you?

574
00:31:13,745 --> 00:31:14,746
For what?

575
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:16,456
Is that all he’s gonna say?

576
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,834
Should I leave now?

577
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:23,504
Or did he say thank you
because he likes me too?

578
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,204
I thought you didn’t care, Via.

579
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:38,019
Want more? The dip’s here.

580
00:31:39,187 --> 00:31:40,349
There’s plenty.

581
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:44,817
That’s all you’re gonna say?

582
00:31:51,115 --> 00:31:53,868
What else am I supposed to say?

583
00:32:11,052 --> 00:32:12,261
I’m sorry, Via.

584
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:16,349
I like someone else.

585
00:32:20,978 --> 00:32:22,355
You’re still young, Via.

586
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:25,650
The world’s big.

587
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:30,404
You’re pretty, smart, and kind.

588
00:32:30,988 --> 00:32:32,907
Someone out there’s
bound to like you.

589
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:46,337
Yeah, Pres.
Thanks for being honest.

590
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:48,297
And thanks for the churros too,
they’re actually really good.

591
00:32:48,631 --> 00:32:50,591
Pres, I’ll go ahead, okay?
Take care.

592
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,273
Take care.

593
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:58,390
Via. How did it go?

594
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:09,652
It’s all right, Via.

595
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:13,164
Most of the time, the people
we like don’t like us back.

596
00:33:15,366 --> 00:33:17,702
Sevi, I just want to
be alone for a while.

597
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:21,706
Here, take the churros.

598
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:24,679
Okay.

599
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:55,084
Hey, Via!

600
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,158
Where have you been?

601
00:33:58,701 --> 00:33:59,952
What happened to you?

602
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:01,495
Why do you look like that?

603
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,831
Kino—

604
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:08,753
I don’t have a crush anymore.

605
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:17,970
Your hair’s messy again.
Didn’t I fix it earlier?

606
00:34:26,938 --> 00:34:28,564
Forget about not having a crush.

607
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:37,865
Just have a crush on me instead,

608
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,784
since I have a crush
on you anyway.

609
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:47,625
Come on…

610
00:34:49,293 --> 00:34:50,711
Are you joking?

611
00:34:52,505 --> 00:34:53,923
Just kidding!

612
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:55,591
Of course, I’m kidding!
What do you think?

613
00:34:56,759 --> 00:35:00,054
So annoying! My crush just
rejected me, remember?

614
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:02,181
I don’t feel like laughing.

615
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:04,475
I don’t want to joke around
with you right now.

616
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:06,602
I’m sorry. I was just trying
to cheer you up.

617
00:35:06,602 --> 00:35:08,062
Well, it’s not funny.

618
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:10,731
Look at them.

619
00:35:12,274 --> 00:35:14,026
Wow, they look so crazy.

620
00:35:14,235 --> 00:35:15,569
They’re so hyper, right?

621
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:19,038
Just remember,

622
00:35:19,573 --> 00:35:23,035
we’re always here for you.
Your friends.

623
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:27,586
I know.

624
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:31,043
Hey, it’s them.

625
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:33,921
Oh no, Via…

626
00:35:34,714 --> 00:35:36,340
Kino, thanks.

627
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:39,719
Thanks for being a good friend.

628
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:42,138
Of course.

629
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:51,522
It’s good. You want some?

630
00:35:52,523 --> 00:35:53,524
No?

631
00:35:53,524 --> 00:35:56,152
- Arkin’s a really good dancer.
-That part earlier was great—

632
00:35:56,861 --> 00:35:58,821
- You’re messing with me.
- Yeah, he totally nailed it.

633
00:35:58,821 --> 00:36:00,614
Show me, show me.
How’d it go again?

634
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,734
I thought I wanted to be alone.

635
00:36:22,094 --> 00:36:25,431
But I actually feel lighter
when I’m with them.

636
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:36,434
Kino.

637
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:38,122
Hey, Via.

638
00:37:40,584 --> 00:37:41,637
Let’s sit for a bit.

639
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:46,303
I got you something.

640
00:37:46,303 --> 00:37:47,596
Happy birthday!

641
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:54,311
How many times are you
going to greet me today?

642
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:56,147
Couldn’t you have just
waited until later at home?

643
00:37:56,981 --> 00:37:59,150
It’d be weird to give you
a gift without greeting you first,

644
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,232
don’t you think?

645
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:01,717
And besides, I was excited.

646
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:05,447
I even ordered the materials
and made it myself.

647
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:09,743
I made one for me too,
so we’d match.

648
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:13,122
Thank you.

649
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:14,999
Wait, why—

650
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:16,500
Why is it AA?

651
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:17,918
Shouldn’t one of them be an “L”?

652
00:38:17,918 --> 00:38:20,004
That’s the first letter
of your name.

653
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:21,964
Then it’ll be “LA.”

654
00:38:22,918 --> 00:38:24,586
No way. That changes the meaning.

655
00:38:25,718 --> 00:38:26,927
Let’s try it.

656
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:32,558
Give it here, I’ll help you.

657
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:37,901
My turn.

658
00:38:46,363 --> 00:38:47,364
There.

659
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:51,831
It looks nice.

660
00:38:59,752 --> 00:39:00,753
Thanks.

661
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:02,588
Don’t take it off, okay?

662
00:39:02,588 --> 00:39:03,636
Promise?

663
00:39:04,715 --> 00:39:06,133
Why, if I take it off,

664
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:08,469
does that mean we’re
not friends anymore?

665
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:13,641
Hey, I’m kidding. Of course not.

666
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:14,975
But seriously,

667
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:20,064
what if we end up in
different schools for college?

668
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:23,692
Where do you want to apply to?

669
00:39:25,486 --> 00:39:26,737
I’m not sure yet.

670
00:39:27,613 --> 00:39:31,075
But I’m planning to try at
the state university in Diliman.

671
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:32,284
I’ll give it a shot.

672
00:39:32,284 --> 00:39:33,577
Let’s go there.

673
00:39:33,827 --> 00:39:36,080
Then I’ll go with you.
No matter what school it is.

674
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:39,083
Perfect because there’s
a film course in Diliman.

675
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,961
I really want to
study filmmaking,

676
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:43,254
so I’ll take it there.

677
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:46,090
I’m sure you’ll get in.

678
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,425
Hello? You’re smart,
your grades are all in the—

679
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:50,678
- line of nine.
- We’ll both get in.

680
00:39:51,053 --> 00:39:52,054
Okay?

681
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:53,681
Besides, that’s
still a long way off.

682
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:55,683
We’ve got plenty
of time to think about it.

683
00:39:58,936 --> 00:40:01,188
Come on, or you’ll
start complaining again

684
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:02,690
about how long it
takes us to get home

685
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,941
even though you’re the
one who insisted—

686
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:05,693
- on watching our summer training.
- Fine, okay.

687
00:40:05,693 --> 00:40:06,360
Come on.

688
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,361
I’m almost done.

689
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:08,756
Hey.

690
00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:11,323
What are these?

691
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:15,077
Nothing.

692
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:19,790
It’s nothing.

693
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:24,545
You’ve got a ton
of love letters, huh?

694
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:29,717
So you really don’t plan on
getting a girlfriend this year?

695
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:31,468
Do I have to?

696
00:40:32,052 --> 00:40:33,762
I don’t think
it’s necessary, right?

697
00:40:34,013 --> 00:40:37,182
That’s why I just toss
them all in my bag.

698
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:38,934
You?

699
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:40,853
You like someone already?

700
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:42,730
Nope.

701
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:43,897
And it’s not me, obviously.

702
00:40:43,897 --> 00:40:47,568
Between the two of us, you’re
way closer to getting a girlfriend.

703
00:40:47,568 --> 00:40:49,361
Hello? You’ve got more applicants

704
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:50,863
than a college entrance exam.

705
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,659
I’m not. I’m focused on the
music club right now.

706
00:40:56,744 --> 00:40:59,413
Same here,
I’m focused on volleyball.

707
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:01,665
Hope we make it to
the National Championships.

708
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:04,918
You know what? I’ll be
your number one fan.

709
00:41:04,918 --> 00:41:07,588
I’ll be the loudest
one cheering for you.

710
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:08,922
I promise.

711
00:41:08,922 --> 00:41:11,258
And I’ll support your music too.

712
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:16,472
Come on.

713
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:17,473
Let’s go.

714
00:41:17,473 --> 00:41:18,474
Hurry up.

715
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:21,194
Wait.

716
00:41:22,936 --> 00:41:23,936
Let’s go.

717
00:41:24,813 --> 00:41:25,564
Let’s go.

718
00:41:25,564 --> 00:41:26,600
Be careful.

719
00:41:29,526 --> 00:41:30,527
Hurry.

720
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,959
Kino.

721
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:01,392
Eat first. Don’t skip your meals.

722
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:03,060
I’ll go ahead so you can focus.

723
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:07,001
Okay. I’m almost done, too.
Thanks.

724
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:13,447
I’m trying to study this part,
I’m stuck on this key—

725
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,281
It sounds off—

726
00:42:16,824 --> 00:42:18,117
Arkin!

727
00:42:22,621 --> 00:42:26,417
Let’s jam! I found
a really good song.

728
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:30,295
Naya, it feels like I haven’t
seen you in the music club for a while.

729
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:33,424
Yeah, I’ve been busy
with my studies.

730
00:42:33,424 --> 00:42:35,384
Why? Did you miss me?

731
00:42:36,844 --> 00:42:38,762
What song are you talking about?

732
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,891
It’s a song about my crush. So...

733
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:43,559
Go on.

734
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:45,102
- You want me to sing it for you?
- Sure.

735
00:43:14,131 --> 00:43:15,924
Okay, short water break!

736
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,838
Kino forgot his lunchbox again.

737
00:44:51,186 --> 00:44:52,187
Give it back!

738
00:44:52,938 --> 00:44:54,523
- Lance, what’s wrong with you?
- Hey!

739
00:44:55,857 --> 00:44:56,899
Put that down.

740
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:01,488
What the hell?

741
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:06,368
What’s your
problem with Via, huh?

742
00:45:06,577 --> 00:45:07,743
What’s your problem?

743
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:09,621
Ask her! She started it!

744
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:15,377
If you go near Via again,
you’ll get more than that next time.

745
00:45:15,836 --> 00:45:17,671
Watch where you put that
tough attitude, man.

746
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:20,257
What’s going on between
you and Via, huh?

747
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:23,129
You like her, don’t you?

748
00:45:23,677 --> 00:45:24,678
Am I right?

749
00:45:46,158 --> 00:45:47,659
Can’t even answer, huh?

750
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:49,240
Because you’re a coward!

751
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:51,580
Coward!

752
00:45:51,955 --> 00:45:53,206
Acting like her best friend?

753
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,062
But your really just
wanna date her, right?

754
00:45:56,627 --> 00:45:57,628
Right?

755
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:02,174
Try going near Via again,
I’m warning you.

756
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:04,759
One more.

757
00:46:08,508 --> 00:46:09,540
Oh!

758
00:46:11,058 --> 00:46:12,517
What happened to your ex?

759
00:46:14,478 --> 00:46:15,646
I don’t have an ex.

760
00:46:15,646 --> 00:46:17,064
Besides, he loves picking fights,

761
00:46:17,064 --> 00:46:18,440
but he doesn’t even
know how to punch.

762
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:20,782
Wait.

763
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:23,028
What happened here?

764
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:26,907
Oh, nothing. I just
bumped into something.

765
00:46:26,907 --> 00:46:28,016
Where?

766
00:46:28,415 --> 00:46:29,743
Can I eat this now?

767
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,120
Wow.

768
00:46:33,872 --> 00:46:36,625
You can’t just drop your best friend
because you have a girlfriend.

769
00:46:39,169 --> 00:46:40,170
I promise.

770
00:46:42,005 --> 00:46:45,008
Go, Via! Go, Via!

771
00:46:50,806 --> 00:46:52,391
You’ve really changed.

772
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:55,435
So have you.

773
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,437
You just don’t notice it
because it’s you.

774
00:46:58,021 --> 00:47:00,440
But you’ve changed too.

775
00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:06,113
Congratulations!

776
00:47:06,113 --> 00:47:07,989
Congratulations, Yanna and Sam!

777
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:09,032
Be my duet partner instead.

778
00:47:09,032 --> 00:47:10,492
Looks like Naya’s gonna be late.

779
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:11,868
Me?

780
00:47:11,868 --> 00:47:12,869
Yeah.

781
00:47:13,704 --> 00:47:14,913
Up there on stage?

782
00:47:15,388 --> 00:47:16,973
Kino, no. I don’t want to!

783
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:21,795
Kino, there are so many people.

784
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,840
Everyone’s watching.
I don’t think I can do this.

785
00:47:27,008 --> 00:47:29,261
Just keep your eyes on me. Okay?
