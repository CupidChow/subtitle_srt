1
00:00:25,313 --> 00:00:26,961
Kino, are you going
to do something to me?

2
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:28,129
So I’m ready if—

3
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,129
Ready for what?

4
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:31,425
For that, you know. For—

5
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:32,476
- You know what I mean.
- For sex?

6
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:34,201
- Huh? Kino!
- Via!

7
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:36,131
It’s better to be prepared.

8
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:40,499
What matters is that
both you and Arkin

9
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,000
have a great first time.

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,346
I only love you.
You know that, right?

11
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:51,698
I’m really sorry about the news.

12
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:53,981
So what, you’re together now?

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,190
What happens now?

14
00:00:56,204 --> 00:00:57,705
Are you going to act
like you’re together?

15
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,731
You’ll go out, go on dates,
be sweet, hug, kiss, like that?

16
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:03,732
So whatever we do,

17
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:05,192
you’re going to do it
with her too, is that it?

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,860
Via, I’d understand if—

19
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:10,238
you can’t support me
on this anymore.

20
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:11,323
No, Kino.

21
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,284
Even if this breaks me,
even if I get hurt by this.

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,993
It’s okay. I’ll endure it.

23
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:20,025
I don’t want to get
caught up in his spotlight.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,195
I’ll stay standing
behind his shadow.

25
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:47,012
Via, just a little more.

26
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:49,266
Just a little more.

27
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:51,401
Even if it’s hard, even
if it feels really hard,

28
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,869
just a little more.
You can do this.

29
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,092
Once you pass this,
it’s Christmas break.

30
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:57,886
You’ll finally be able to rest,
you can do this.

31
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,613
Hello.

32
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:19,598
Oh, hello!

33
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:21,611
Why did you call?

34
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,016
Sorry, did I interrupt
your studying?

35
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,414
Not really.

36
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:27,862
How are you?

37
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:33,573
I’m okay.

38
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,099
I’m just really exhausted.

39
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,310
It feels like even after
I finish my plates,

40
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,812
there’s still so much
I need to read.

41
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:44,481
I don’t know what to do
anymore or what to prioritize.

42
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:46,567
None of it is getting in my head.

43
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:48,599
I’m sure you, of all people,
can handle it.

44
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:50,070
Just hang in there a bit more,

45
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,488
Christmas break is coming.

46
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:53,108
You’ll get to rest

47
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:56,577
and we’ll be together every day.

48
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,255
Every day?

49
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,231
Really? Aren’t you going
to be busy then?

50
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:03,649
Won’t you have any shoots?

51
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:05,703
All done.
We did them in advance.

52
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:07,789
The staff needs a break, too.

53
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:10,225
By the way, Mama said

54
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,604
she wants to spend Christmas
and New Year with you at the house.

55
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:17,856
Really? Okay,
I’ll tell my family.

56
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:19,316
They’ll like that.

57
00:04:19,316 --> 00:04:21,222
I’m sure they’ll be happy.
They’ll be excited.

58
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:24,897
Via, I have good news.

59
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:28,222
My album is coming out. Finally!

60
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:30,173
You’re coming to
my launch, okay?

61
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:32,771
What? Really?

62
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,649
Kino, congratulations!

63
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:36,077
When is it?

64
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:38,820
First weekend after New Year.

65
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:40,781
You have to be there, okay?

66
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:42,922
Of course.

67
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:44,419
Give me a sample.

68
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:46,426
I already sang it to you before.

69
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:47,844
You probably just
don’t remember.

70
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:49,706
The title of the lead single is called,

71
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:51,834
My Favorite Movie.

72
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,483
Oh. What’s it about?

73
00:04:54,768 --> 00:04:55,815
It’s about you.

74
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,940
Really?

75
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:00,465
About me?

76
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:02,396
You’re probably
just saying that

77
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:04,606
because it’s been a while
since we last saw each other.

78
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,558
Via, you really are my inspiration.

79
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,560
Listen closely to
it at the launch.

80
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:12,922
Okay.

81
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:14,481
Larkin, let’s resume.

82
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,250
Okay, I’ll head back
to recording now.

83
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:19,013
Finish what you’re studying.

84
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:20,406
Two weeks from now,

85
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:22,225
we’ll be together again.

86
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:23,768
Okay. Take care.

87
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:41,330
I can do this!

88
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:42,877
I can do this!

89
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:44,644
I can do this!

90
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,859
Put the gifts there together.

91
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:52,111
Yes, okay.

92
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,198
- Merry Christmas, everybody!
- Merry Christmas, Arkin!

93
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:56,449
I brought gifts for all of you!

94
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:57,868
- Wow!
- Thank you, Arkin!

95
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:59,202
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Arkin.

96
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:00,569
I’m not Arkin, I’m Santa!

97
00:06:00,725 --> 00:06:01,725
Now choose.

98
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:03,351
- You?
- I’ll take this.

99
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,363
And you?

100
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,867
- Hey, you took the one with the star.
- It’s so cute!

101
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,279
Here. This one’s yours.

102
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,566
- Thank you so much.
- We’re a match.

103
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:12,479
Mira, can I open my gifts now?

104
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:14,898
Later, you’re so excited.

105
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:16,803
I’m sorry, Mira.

106
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:18,388
It’s just that,

107
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:21,475
not everyone gets gifts
from their crush like you.

108
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:23,696
Hey.

109
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:25,943
You’re crushing
on someone now?

110
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,327
No, Via.

111
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:30,746
- She is.
- Hey, I don’t have a crush.

112
00:06:30,746 --> 00:06:32,164
They’re just teasing me.

113
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:33,898
I don’t have a crush,
I promise.

114
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:35,908
You know, there’s nothing
wrong with having a crush.

115
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:39,678
I even had a crush
on Via from way back.

116
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,610
We were this small then.

117
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,923
Even Aidan has a girlfriend.

118
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:46,089
Hey. What are you saying?

119
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:47,478
I don’t have any,
you ugly girl!

120
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,298
Hey, Aidan.
Watch your mouth.

121
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:52,890
Be careful with what
you say to your sisters.

122
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,893
Or Santa won’t give you a gift.

123
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:57,353
Sorry, Via.

124
00:06:57,353 --> 00:07:00,273
Santa? I don’t think
Santa gave these.

125
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:03,901
I saw Papa earlier,
he was carrying the gifts.

126
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:08,219
Wow.

127
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:10,180
I feel like I don’t want
kids anymore.

128
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,532
I do.

129
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:15,310
I wonder how many
kids we’ll have, Via.

130
00:07:16,364 --> 00:07:19,523
So, Via, how many will it be?

131
00:07:20,544 --> 00:07:21,712
I guess two.

132
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:22,712
I’m guessing three.

133
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,887
Merry Christmas, guys!

134
00:07:24,887 --> 00:07:26,388
- Hi, Auntie!
- Hello.

135
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:29,516
- Merry Christmas.
- Hello, Merry Christmas.

136
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,642
Hello.

137
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,370
- How are you, Auntie?
- Merry Christmas!

138
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:41,598
Pa!

139
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:42,707
- Sweetheart.
- Need help?

140
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:45,084
Can you keep stirring this?

141
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:46,415
Okay.

142
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:48,152
I’ll bring the fruits out first.

143
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,811
Thank you.

144
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:50,812
Sure.

145
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,557
You can’t really
leave this unattended.

146
00:07:58,671 --> 00:07:59,839
Where are you going?

147
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:03,092
It smells so good here.

148
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,348
How are you
and Arkin doing, Via?

149
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:11,032
He’s not making things
hard for you, is he?

150
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:13,728
Oh no, Auntie, not at all.

151
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,103
We’re doing really well.

152
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,543
That’s good.

153
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:19,233
I just wanted to say thank you

154
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,096
for always being there for him.

155
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:24,030
I know he’s happy
with what he’s doing,

156
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,048
but your situation isn’t easy.

157
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:31,094
So thank you for
accepting him as he is.

158
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:32,625
Yeah.

159
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:34,728
And if you remember,

160
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,684
even when they were kids,
they were inseparable.

161
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:42,319
If you took Via away,
Arkin would cry.

162
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:43,695
If Arkin wasn’t around,

163
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:45,495
Via wouldn’t talk to anyone.

164
00:08:46,168 --> 00:08:49,547
I always knew they would
eventually fall for each other.

165
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,865
That’s right. Inseparable.

166
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:57,295
Via, if you ever have
misunderstandings or problems,

167
00:08:57,295 --> 00:09:00,090
just know that it’s part
of the relationship.

168
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:03,501
In fact, sometimes it even helps to

169
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:05,929
make your relationship stronger.

170
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,055
- That’s true.
- Yeah.

171
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:08,494
Just don’t give up on each other.

172
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:11,731
And to be honest,
your Auntie and I

173
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:12,775
have been through so much.

174
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:14,269
- That’s true.
- But look at us.

175
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:16,028
Yeah, look at us.

176
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:17,140
We’re still here.

177
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:20,862
You know,
ever since you were a kid,

178
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:22,136
you’ve been part of the family.

179
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,272
And you will always be
part of the family.

180
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:27,984
Thank you, Auntie.

181
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:29,719
Uncle, thank you.

182
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:32,895
Okay, let’s eat now.

183
00:09:32,895 --> 00:09:34,104
Get the carbonara.

184
00:09:34,104 --> 00:09:35,104
- Okay.
- Yeah.

185
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,327
Here are the plates.

186
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:40,878
That’s right.

187
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:43,595
I also see Kino’s family
as my own.

188
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:47,265
To me, he isn’t Larkin Sanchez
the celebrity.

189
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:55,636
He’s just Kino,
my childhood friend.

190
00:09:59,236 --> 00:10:02,114
One of the first people
who accepted me.

191
00:10:02,114 --> 00:10:04,533
And now, the person I love.

192
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:20,173
Even if everything is
hard and complicated,

193
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:21,913
I will stay.

194
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,832
I love Kino,

195
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:26,042
and I want to
always be with him.

196
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:41,200
I’m slowly learning
not to be afraid

197
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,257
of his spotlight anymore.

198
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:18,379
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six—
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six—

199
00:11:18,392 --> 00:11:23,105
- five, four, three, two, one!
- five, four, three, two, one!

200
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:26,402
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

201
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:35,403
Happy New Year!

202
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:38,862
Happy New Year!

203
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,748
Happy New Year!

204
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:48,583
In moments like this,

205
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:51,127
it’s easy to forget everything.

206
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:55,398
All I know right now
is that we’re happy.

207
00:11:55,946 --> 00:11:57,382
Kino and I are really happy.

208
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:58,625
Cheers!

209
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:01,822
This is so much fun!

210
00:12:04,116 --> 00:12:06,184
- My goodness.
- Here, eat now. Go ahead.

211
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:24,619
So, how are the kids?
How is Via?

212
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,107
She still hasn’t
visited her mom?

213
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:33,233
She really won’t go.

214
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,319
She might end up being
haunted by her mom at this point.

215
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:40,574
Well, I don’t know
what to do anymore.

216
00:12:40,574 --> 00:12:41,950
Via really doesn’t want to go.

217
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:44,869
Of all the things she
could have inherited

218
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:47,706
from your wife, it had
to be stubbornness.

219
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:49,291
When she wants something,
she wants it.

220
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,584
When she doesn’t, she doesn’t.

221
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,314
And they’re both
really good at music too.

222
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:58,903
Sometimes when I look at Via,

223
00:12:59,926 --> 00:13:01,197
I think of Ivy.

224
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,142
But she actually doesn’t
like music anymore.

225
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:07,537
Probably because of her mom.

226
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:09,807
She’s still angry.

227
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:13,245
Which is understandable.

228
00:13:13,245 --> 00:13:14,829
I can’t really blame her.

229
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:18,089
I mean, she has
struggled because—

230
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:23,338
she had to sacrifice
her time for her siblings.

231
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:31,342
And

232
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:33,473
she had to step up so early

233
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:38,144
and become a
second mother to them.

234
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:43,823
That’s why she never really
got to fully enjoy her childhood.

235
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,709
You know,

236
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:57,775
I want to apologize to Via.

237
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:12,262
And thank her every day for
everything she’s done for us.

238
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:17,982
I feel like

239
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:21,694
I’ve always depended on her.

240
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,971
I feel like

241
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:32,517
she’s been having a hard time

242
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:35,976
carrying all the responsibilities
her mom left behind.

243
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,345
Via is strong.

244
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,897
Maybe you need
to talk to her more.

245
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:00,399
Talk to your daughter.

246
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,312
She might be going
through something

247
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:04,605
you don’t even know about.

248
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:11,583
Just be there for your children
as much as you can.

249
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:17,075
Cheers.

250
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:18,246
Cheers.

251
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:19,506
Come on…

252
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:21,756
More, please.

253
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:23,129
Please.

254
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,676
Is that how Papa feels about me?

255
00:15:27,262 --> 00:15:30,054
I’m actually okay with
everything I’ve sacrificed.

256
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:32,599
It’s tiring and difficult,

257
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,685
but it’s all right because
I’m doing it for our family.

258
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:39,313
It hurts hearing Papa say that.

259
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:42,150
He’s been working
so hard for us.

260
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,313
To make up for what was
left behind by Mama.

261
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:51,534
To give us things
we never even asked for.

262
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:55,999
Mama, you’re the
reason for all of this.

263
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:24,960
Long time no see.

264
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,294
After not visiting you for so long,

265
00:16:31,878 --> 00:16:34,201
you already became
a stranger to me

266
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:37,247
I don’t even know
why I’m here right now.

267
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:43,309
Whenever I think about how Mira,
Ysha, and especially Aidan suffered

268
00:16:43,314 --> 00:16:45,088
because they didn’t have a mother,

269
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:47,465
I get angry all over again.

270
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:54,013
My siblings’ childhood was filled
with fighting, shouting, and fear.

271
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:58,351
Those memories will stay with them
as they grow up.

272
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:04,295
But Papa and I will do everything
we can to heal those wounds

273
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,588
and replace them with
love and happiness.

274
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:15,445
Merry Christmas.

275
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:19,247
Happy New Year.

276
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,890
Enjoy, my dear.

277
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:51,737
I’ll pick you up later.

278
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,476
I love you.

279
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:56,159
Bye, Ma! I love you.

280
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:06,753
Via! You’re here.

281
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:07,758
Here.

282
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:10,978
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

283
00:18:11,645 --> 00:18:13,981
Thanks. This is a lot.

284
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:15,524
You know how these fans are.

285
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:18,013
They really go all out
when they love someone.

286
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,564
This probably has got
your shoulders up high, huh?

287
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:22,956
What do you mean?

288
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:25,646
Because out
of all the girls here,

289
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:28,524
you’re the only one
he goes home to.

290
00:18:28,802 --> 00:18:30,679
- Hey! You’re blushing!
- What are you saying?

291
00:18:30,704 --> 00:18:32,612
Be careful, someone
might hear you.

292
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:36,570
Excuse me.

293
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:39,150
You must be daydreaming?

294
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:40,269
With all due respect,

295
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:41,947
I’m the only one
Larkin goes home to.

296
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:43,365
Sure, miss.

297
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:45,666
She’s really delusional, huh?

298
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:49,286
So annoying.

299
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,293
- Should I just confront her?
- Don’t!

300
00:18:51,293 --> 00:18:52,590
Don’t.

301
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,506
Oh my gosh, do you
think Clea will come?

302
00:18:55,506 --> 00:18:58,884
Duh! Isn’t she supposed
to support her boyfriend?

303
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:02,051
No wonder she’s busy.

304
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:05,304
For sure, she’ll also
congratulate Arkin.

305
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:07,397
Did you watch
their last interview?

306
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,551
They even had a lovers’ quarrel.

307
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:10,552
Because they were asked

308
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:12,001
if they have someone
they’re jealous of.

309
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,026
Girl!

310
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,844
Wow, that—

311
00:19:17,512 --> 00:19:20,197
Should I confront her?
I really want to.

312
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:21,463
No, don’t.

313
00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:22,922
Larkin’s new song—

314
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:24,843
- is for Clea!
- For Clea!

315
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:26,843
Right?

316
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:28,751
Don’t listen to them
anymore. Come on.

317
00:19:29,198 --> 00:19:30,658
Arkin looks
so cute there, right?

318
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:39,720
Are you all ready?

319
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:43,516
Let’s not keep this any longer.

320
00:19:43,522 --> 00:19:48,235
Let’s all welcome,
Larkin Sanchez!

321
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:58,628
Larkin!

322
00:19:58,996 --> 00:19:59,997
Hi, guys!

323
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:02,750
Thank you for coming
to my album launch party.

324
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,836
I’m really excited to share
my new songs with you.

325
00:20:06,712 --> 00:20:12,343
So let’s start with me singing
the title track of my album—

326
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:13,594
My Favorite Movie.

327
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:30,300
It's Saturday, I'm all alone.

328
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,178
I'm stuck inside
my trailer home.

329
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:37,643
And all I could think of
is how you doin'.

330
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:41,443
Getting places I don't know,

331
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,244
interviews and TV shows.

332
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:49,041
But I just wanna pack my
things and just get goin'.

333
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,251
'Cause all I want is you.

334
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:58,133
Behind the cameras,
I see you.

335
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,863
You know it's only you and me.

336
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,699
And no one else will ever be,

337
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,619
The leading lady in this story.

338
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,871
That will always be…

339
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:17,667
My favorite movie.

340
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,185
It feels like this
song is for you.

341
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:23,246
I get it now.

342
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:25,749
It’s funny because they
thought it was for Clea

343
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:27,250
since he said, “leading lady.”

344
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,250
As if.

345
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:32,250
I'm wishing you're here
by my side tonight.

346
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:35,920
Missing you in every mornin'.

347
00:21:36,843 --> 00:21:39,721
I can't wait to
leave this place,

348
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:42,724
'Cause nothing beats
your sweet embrace.

349
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:47,729
'Cause there's no better song
than hearing your heart beating.

350
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:50,648
'Cause all I want is you.

351
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:55,940
Oh! Girl, you two are really
staring at each other.

352
00:21:58,165 --> 00:21:59,166
We’re not.

353
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,167
Really now?

354
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:03,170
You know it's only you and me.

355
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,173
And no one else will ever be,

356
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:09,093
The leading lady
in this story.

357
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,178
That will always be…

358
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:16,016
My favorite movie.

359
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:21,939
My favorite movie.

360
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:33,742
It’s time for the acting challenge!

361
00:22:33,742 --> 00:22:34,869
I’m so excited!

362
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:36,579
What do you want to hear, huh?

363
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:38,937
That you love me.

364
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:40,731
You do love me, right?

365
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,484
And if yes, what would you do?

366
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,240
I love you.

367
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:48,962
Okay.

368
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,669
Not good, she’s not good.

369
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,816
Are you okay?

370
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:55,527
She’s fine. Thank you.

371
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:58,468
Ah, the mic.

372
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Hi.

373
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:03,389
Are you ready?

374
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:06,768
Let’s go, let’s go!

375
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:07,936
Are you nervous?

376
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:10,522
Not really? Okay then.

377
00:23:12,232 --> 00:23:13,733
What do you want to hear?

378
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:16,528
That you love me.
You do love me, right?

379
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,689
If I say yes, what will you do?

380
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:21,901
I love you.

381
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:27,871
Great, that was great.

382
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,324
Let’s give her
a round of applause!

383
00:23:29,924 --> 00:23:31,634
That’s my friend right there!

384
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:34,037
Okay, let’s do this.

385
00:23:35,744 --> 00:23:38,042
So, what do you
really want to hear, huh?

386
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:42,198
That you love me.
You do love me, right?

387
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,577
And if I say yes,
what would you do?

388
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,161
I love you.

389
00:23:49,747 --> 00:23:50,748
Okay.

390
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:53,056
We’re done. Thank you!

391
00:23:55,711 --> 00:24:00,258
And the winner of our
Acting Challenge is—

392
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:02,367
Rye!

393
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:04,329
A round of applause for Rye.

394
00:24:04,871 --> 00:24:06,748
Congratulations,
thank you for participating.

395
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:07,748
- You may take your seats now.
- She’s my friend!

396
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,876
- That’s my friend right there!
- Thank you.

397
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,418
Rye, thank you so much.
Congratulations!

398
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:18,008
Rye, you won a new album
and exclusive posters.

399
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:19,968
Since when have
you been a fan of Arkin?

400
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,820
Since birth.

401
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:23,263
Since birth? So delulu!

402
00:24:23,263 --> 00:24:24,347
Since birth?

403
00:24:24,347 --> 00:24:27,058
From the very beginning.
When he started this.

404
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:29,269
Are you childhood friends?

405
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,438
No, that was a mistake.

406
00:24:32,272 --> 00:24:34,357
What’s your message for Larkin?

407
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,797
Congratulations on
your album launch, Larkin.

408
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,117
Thank you for being an
inspiration to so many.

409
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:50,259
The people here
love you so much.

410
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,707
And I’m sure many
more will love

411
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:56,662
and accept you completely.

412
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,915
Thanks.

413
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:03,299
And as your fan,

414
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:07,386
I’m—

415
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:12,428
I’m always proud of you.

416
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:14,560
Of everything you do,

417
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,179
of all your achievements,

418
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:18,240
and

419
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:21,399
even if others leave you,

420
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:25,315
even if everyone
leaves you, I’ll stay.

421
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:32,880
I’m here because
that’s how much—

422
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:42,932
That’s how much I love you.

423
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:57,237
Wow.

424
00:25:57,237 --> 00:25:59,740
A very heartwarming message.

425
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,074
Congratulations again, Rye,

426
00:26:01,074 --> 00:26:02,576
and you can
take your seat now.

427
00:26:02,576 --> 00:26:04,161
Thank you so much
for participating.

428
00:26:05,412 --> 00:26:08,233
Wait, Larkin is texting.

429
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:10,618
Is that Clea, brother?

430
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:13,037
I always love you, love.

431
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:14,163
So guys, don’t go yet

432
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:17,208
because we’re about
to have a photo-op.

433
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,830
Ushers, please
assist the first group.

434
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,916
It’s because
you’re going to have

435
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,668
- your photo-op now!
- I was totally swooning earlier!

436
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,378
Don’t ever break up, okay?

437
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,463
Because if you do,

438
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,882
I really won’t believe
in love anymore.

439
00:26:32,275 --> 00:26:33,275
Yeah.

440
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,473
- You’re feeling giddy, huh?
- No, I'm not!

441
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:37,846
You are, I can tell!

442
00:26:38,924 --> 00:26:39,925
Luna!

443
00:26:41,444 --> 00:26:42,444
Luna!

444
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:44,012
Okay, next, next group!

445
00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:47,523
You said, I love you.

446
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:03,900
- Sweetheart.
- Pa?

447
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,291
Your aunt called earlier.

448
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:07,237
What about, Pa?

449
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:10,740
She said she’ll take care
of your papers for Spain.

450
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,799
Her suggestion is that

451
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,456
you do an apprenticeship first

452
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:19,638
and take the board exams
here before you go there.

453
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:23,962
Oh…

454
00:27:24,955 --> 00:27:26,392
Will I be there
for a long time, Pa?

455
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:28,981
You’ll work for her
for a few years.

456
00:27:30,196 --> 00:27:32,011
The pay there is good.

457
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:34,360
And if you want to continue
your studies there,

458
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:35,761
she said she’ll take care of it.

459
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,811
Okay.

460
00:27:58,188 --> 00:28:00,709
Sweetheart, are you sure
you’re okay with that?

461
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:04,225
Because you’ll be far from us,

462
00:28:04,498 --> 00:28:06,394
from your friends,
and from Arkin, too.

463
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:09,003
If you want,

464
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:11,771
I can just ask your aunt

465
00:28:11,796 --> 00:28:13,775
to let me pay her back
in installments.

466
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:14,790
Pa.

467
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:17,654
I’m okay.

468
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:19,375
Don’t think like that, Pa.

469
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,305
I don’t want you worrying
about things like that.

470
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:23,837
This is for our family anyway.

471
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:24,838
This is for us.

472
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:26,243
For Mira, Ysha,
and Aidan’s future.

473
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:29,426
Pa, I’ll do it.

474
00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:32,377
Please don’t worry,
I’m really okay.

475
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:35,023
And I also want to repay Auntie

476
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:36,817
for all the help she’s given me.

477
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:38,402
She’s helped a lot
these past few years.

478
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,630
All right, but if you
change your mind,

479
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:44,533
just tell me, okay?
Papa will find a way.

480
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:47,610
Thank you.

481
00:28:47,901 --> 00:28:49,189
- Okay.
- Dude!

482
00:28:50,404 --> 00:28:53,774
Wait, I think my friend’s here.

483
00:29:00,623 --> 00:29:03,543
How am I supposed
to tell Arkin about this?

484
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:06,661
Maybe Auntie will
still change her mind.

485
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:08,830
I won’t say anything for now.

486
00:29:09,256 --> 00:29:12,167
I’ll just focus
on graduating first.

487
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:41,760
Love, are you still busy?

488
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,115
Almost done. Why?

489
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:47,077
Sorry, am I taking too long?

490
00:29:47,102 --> 00:29:48,161
No, it’s okay.

491
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,288
I just wanted to
say something.

492
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,373
What is it?

493
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:58,546
For our anniversary,
we have an out-of-town—

494
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,132
We’re going out of town?

495
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:03,884
No, love.

496
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,097
I have an out-of-town shoot.

497
00:30:09,305 --> 00:30:10,305
Huh?

498
00:30:10,933 --> 00:30:12,612
Two days straight.

499
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,524
But that’s our anniversary.

500
00:30:19,775 --> 00:30:21,485
I mean, I don’t want
to be petty,

501
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:23,821
but of course I want you
with me on that day.

502
00:30:23,821 --> 00:30:24,989
We’re supposed to celebrate it

503
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,366
because it’s our anniversary.

504
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:28,367
Am I wrong?

505
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,953
Love, I know.

506
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,456
I tried to have the shoot moved,

507
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,208
but nothing can be done.

508
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,878
I’m sorry, love.

509
00:30:39,243 --> 00:30:41,203
Do whatever you want.

510
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,840
Love.

511
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:44,884
I’m sorry.

512
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:48,054
I’ll try my best to
finish the shoot early

513
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,347
and come home right away.

514
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,282
One take.

515
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,601
I’ll do every scene
in one take. I promise.

516
00:30:57,471 --> 00:30:58,471
Kino, I get it.

517
00:30:58,478 --> 00:31:00,984
I understand
because it’s your job.

518
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:04,031
But even just that day.

519
00:31:04,711 --> 00:31:06,296
Is it really not possible

520
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:08,954
to at least block it off?

521
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:10,622
Love.

522
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:14,897
I really don’t control
my schedule.

523
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:17,959
When I found out
I had a shoot that day,

524
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:20,336
I really fought for it.

525
00:31:21,603 --> 00:31:23,351
But they said it
really wasn’t possible.

526
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,574
What else can I do?

527
00:31:32,361 --> 00:31:33,612
I’m sorry, love.

528
00:31:33,612 --> 00:31:37,908
What can I do so you won’t
be mad at me anymore?

529
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:43,956
What you said.

530
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:46,542
Try to finish your shoot early

531
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,252
so you can come back right away.

532
00:31:49,897 --> 00:31:52,244
So we can still celebrate.

533
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:55,130
That’s a promise, okay?

534
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,945
I swear on it.

535
00:31:57,746 --> 00:31:58,746
Promise?

536
00:31:58,771 --> 00:32:00,544
I promise. I’m sorry, love.

537
00:32:00,547 --> 00:32:02,424
Don’t sulk anymore. I’m sorry.

538
00:32:18,524 --> 00:32:20,855
What? Why are you staring?

539
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:23,108
Are you still together
with your boyfriend?

540
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:24,599
Huh?

541
00:32:25,925 --> 00:32:27,654
Yeah. Why?

542
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:29,984
It’s been a long time now, huh?

543
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:38,498
You know, my brother
working in the media said

544
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:42,210
that ArClea aren’t really
spending much time together.

545
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:44,318
Aren’t you a Larkin fan?

546
00:32:44,944 --> 00:32:48,091
Is it true? Because I still
don’t really believe it.

547
00:32:49,782 --> 00:32:51,742
Come on, I’m working here,

548
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:53,702
and you keep talking so much.

549
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,997
Besides, it’s their life.
What can we do?

550
00:32:56,997 --> 00:32:59,227
Let them do
whatever they want.

551
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:02,912
Wait.

552
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:05,316
You have a sibling
working in the media?

553
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:08,319
Yes. A photographer
for a magazine.

554
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:11,489
I actually get a lot of
inside scoop from him.

555
00:33:13,316 --> 00:33:14,317
Like what?

556
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:19,573
Samantha Vera was
supposedly engaged before.

557
00:33:21,241 --> 00:33:24,578
This is Clyden, my boyfriend.

558
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:26,037
Huh?

559
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:32,802
Geez, where did you hear that?

560
00:33:33,295 --> 00:33:34,337
Sounds like fake news,

561
00:33:34,337 --> 00:33:35,756
not believable.

562
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:38,091
My brother said it’s from
someone in the media.

563
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:41,136
The insider info is
supposed to be legit.

564
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:43,555
They even attended
the engagement party.

565
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:46,767
But they broke up, so
it’s pointless news now.

566
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:51,563
Still doesn’t sound
very believable.

567
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:53,023
Want more?

568
00:33:53,082 --> 00:33:54,082
There’s more?

569
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:56,610
Clea supposedly
liked someone else,

570
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,411
but that person
didn’t like her back.

571
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:01,072
So Larkin is just a rebound.

572
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:04,527
You rejected me
again through text.

573
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:07,625
I’m sorry, but
I don’t like you, Zo.

574
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:09,782
Now that—

575
00:34:10,873 --> 00:34:12,375
That really sounds
like fake news.

576
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,001
Don’t believe stuff like that.

577
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:15,920
False information is bad.

578
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,514
Gossip? Don’t believe it.

579
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:19,590
You never know.

580
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:21,676
Where do you think
gossip comes from

581
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:23,970
if there’s no hint
of truth to it, right?

582
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:31,602
Oh, sorry, I just
need to answer this.

583
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:34,355
Sure. Talk for as
long as you want.

584
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:42,289
How did they
even find all that out?

585
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,209
What is this?

586
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:58,462
Clea and Arkin on a date?

587
00:34:58,462 --> 00:34:59,922
Weren’t they just at a shoot?

588
00:34:59,922 --> 00:35:01,382
Girl, calm down.

589
00:35:01,382 --> 00:35:03,593
You’re more affected
than the actual girlfriend.

590
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:06,012
Isn’t it annoying?
It’s your anniversary.

591
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:08,723
If that were me,
I’d be really pissed.

592
00:35:08,723 --> 00:35:10,275
I don’t know how
she puts up with it.

593
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:12,059
How do you do it?

594
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:13,352
It’s okay.

595
00:35:13,936 --> 00:35:15,229
He asked permission
from me anyway.

596
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:20,151
Has he texted again?

597
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:22,987
Not yet.

598
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:26,708
How am I supposed
to give him my gift?

599
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:28,534
What is it anyway?

600
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:30,995
- Let me see, let me see.
- What’s your gift?

601
00:35:34,457 --> 00:35:37,251
- It’s so pretty.
- Wow.

602
00:35:38,209 --> 00:35:39,794
I hope he likes it.

603
00:35:40,169 --> 00:35:41,181
It’s beautiful.

604
00:35:42,122 --> 00:35:44,553
I also hope he makes it
to our anniversary.

605
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,627
He still hasn’t texted.

606
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:48,253
He’ll make it.

607
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:51,214
Should we drink?

608
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:52,758
- Okay, let’s drink. I’m getting annoyed.
- Let’s drink.

609
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:54,343
- Excuse me, just following up.
- I’m annoyed.

610
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:56,303
Just following up on
our drink order.

611
00:35:56,303 --> 00:35:57,971
- Here it is.
- It’s coming.

612
00:35:57,971 --> 00:36:00,271
Hey, are you sure about this?
You might get drunk later.

613
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:02,712
It’s fine. I can handle myself.

614
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:05,075
Thank you.

615
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:06,664
- Thanks.
- Come on.

616
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:08,917
- Let’s just drink. I’m annoyed.
- Cheers.

617
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,174
He’ll make it.

618
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:13,630
Should I leave a comment?

619
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:16,872
No, stop. Via’s not
even doing anything.

620
00:36:16,872 --> 00:36:18,582
Via, be careful not
to get drunk, okay?

621
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:29,676
Cheers!

622
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:32,971
Via, wait. You’re getting drunk.

623
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:33,971
Hey!

624
00:36:33,996 --> 00:36:35,735
What? I told you
I can handle this.

625
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:38,060
She says she can.

626
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,022
Luna, you’re really so cute.

627
00:36:42,022 --> 00:36:43,440
I love you so much.

628
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:48,820
Via, you’re really drunk now!

629
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,905
I’m not drunk.

630
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,545
I miss my boyfriend.

631
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:55,285
And here it comes.

632
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:59,806
I miss my boyfriend so much.
I really miss him.

633
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:01,678
I wonder if he misses me, too.

634
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,495
Does he still love me?

635
00:37:03,877 --> 00:37:04,878
It feels like he doesn’t.

636
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:06,600
He doesn’t love me anymore.

637
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:08,685
He doesn’t love me anymore.

638
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:12,230
Via, you’re drunk. Stop—

639
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:15,097
I’m not drunk!

640
00:37:17,724 --> 00:37:18,725
I’m not drunk.

641
00:37:19,142 --> 00:37:20,811
Come on now…

642
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,730
But no, he doesn’t
love me anymore.

643
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,731
Look.

644
00:37:25,565 --> 00:37:26,566
Via?

645
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:30,195
No texts, no calls.
Doesn’t he remember me?

646
00:37:30,195 --> 00:37:31,613
What’s the point of this phone?

647
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:32,781
I should just throw it away.

648
00:37:33,156 --> 00:37:35,033
Don’t cry anymore.
He’s on his way.

649
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:36,034
I promise.

650
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:38,412
He’s on his way.
Here, give it to me.

651
00:37:38,412 --> 00:37:39,830
There, see?
He said he’s coming.

652
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:43,041
He probably doesn’t
love me anymore.

653
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,752
It’s our anniversary today.
What time is it?

654
00:37:45,752 --> 00:37:47,587
But he’s still not here.
Where is he?

655
00:37:47,587 --> 00:37:50,048
He’s there. He’s there
with someone else.

656
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:52,092
With another girl. I’m done.

657
00:37:52,092 --> 00:37:53,510
He loves you. He loves you.

658
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,678
No. He doesn’t love me.

659
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:55,721
- I’m done.
- Via.

660
00:37:55,721 --> 00:37:56,721
Via.

661
00:37:56,728 --> 00:37:57,728
Hey!

662
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:58,735
Hey! What is that?

663
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,445
I’ve got her, sir. It’s okay.

664
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,114
Hey!

665
00:38:03,122 --> 00:38:04,122
I’m okay. I can handle myself.

666
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:06,096
- Clea is just his coworker.
- Let’s drink more.

667
00:38:06,096 --> 00:38:07,243
Clea is just his coworker.

668
00:38:07,257 --> 00:38:08,654
- Let’s just drink some more.
- Come on, let’s drink.

669
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:09,957
- I’ll go first.
- Drink—

670
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:13,041
Don’t drink anymore.
You’re already drunk.

671
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:15,491
Why are you embarrassed of me?

672
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:16,909
Are you embarrassed of me?

673
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:18,619
I thought we were friends.

674
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:19,954
Why are you embarrassed of me?

675
00:38:19,954 --> 00:38:20,996
Don’t you love me anymore?

676
00:38:20,996 --> 00:38:22,581
- You’re just like Larkin.
- Love!

677
00:38:22,581 --> 00:38:24,792
- We love you—
- He doesn’t love me anymore.

678
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:26,376
Hey!

679
00:38:26,379 --> 00:38:28,172
Stand up. It’s dirty.

680
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:30,007
Arkin loves you, I swear.

681
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,884
I promise, Arkin loves you,

682
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:34,845
Via!

683
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:37,109
And you’re the ones I’m
spending my anniversary with,

684
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:38,109
why—

685
00:38:38,134 --> 00:38:39,135
Why?

686
00:38:41,968 --> 00:38:44,763
You’re not even the ones
I’m celebrating my anniversary with.

687
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:46,498
- Via, that’s enough.
- No…

688
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:48,374
I shouldn’t be celebrating
my anniversary with you.

689
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:49,667
You’re not the ones
I’m giving my gift to.

690
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:50,667
Isn’t my gift nice?

691
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:52,094
- Yes, your gift is nice.
- It’s nice, really pretty.

692
00:38:52,094 --> 00:38:53,275
- My gift is pretty, right?
- Yes.

693
00:38:53,282 --> 00:38:54,649
- Very pretty. Nice, right?
- Very nice.

694
00:38:54,655 --> 00:38:56,198
But the person
I’m giving it to isn’t here.

695
00:38:56,991 --> 00:38:57,991
Don’t!

696
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:59,544
I’ll just throw it away!

697
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:02,339
We’re taking you
home now, please!

698
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:05,592
He doesn’t love me anymore.

699
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:07,552
Girl, they’ll make us leave now.

700
00:39:07,552 --> 00:39:08,552
Why?

701
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:09,991
- Via?
- We’re sorry!

702
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,724
I’m fine, let’s drink some more.

703
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,380
Sorry, I just arrived.

704
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:14,531
Let’s drink, let’s drink. Ow!

705
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:16,450
- Love? Come on, let’s go.
- Oh my gosh, Arkin.

706
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,607
Stand up. Let’s go home.

707
00:39:19,954 --> 00:39:21,276
You look like my boyfriend.

708
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:23,653
But my boyfriend left me.

709
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:26,201
He didn’t come even
if it’s our anniversary today.

710
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:27,369
Sorry, I’m really sorry.

711
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:28,369
I’ll take you guys home.

712
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:29,751
- No need, just enjoy your anniversary.
- Where’s my boyfriend?

713
00:39:29,751 --> 00:39:31,753
- We’ll just walk with you to the parking lot.
- My boyfriend isn’t here.

714
00:39:31,753 --> 00:39:32,754
- Love.
- That was tiring.

715
00:39:32,754 --> 00:39:34,256
- He didn’t come.
- Stand up…

716
00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:36,258
It’s our anniversary, right?

717
00:39:37,425 --> 00:39:38,426
What’s hap—

718
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,280
Where are her things?

719
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,587
- We got them.
- All right, let’s go.

720
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:45,327
My boyfriend.
Arkin still isn’t here!

721
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:46,328
Be careful!

722
00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:09,009
Happy anniversary, my love.

723
00:40:17,044 --> 00:40:18,045
Fuck you.

724
00:40:19,653 --> 00:40:23,379
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

725
00:40:23,575 --> 00:40:24,575
Fuck you.

726
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:28,620
You really are drunk.

727
00:40:29,037 --> 00:40:30,164
I’m not drunk.

728
00:40:31,748 --> 00:40:34,306
But I won’t give you my gift.

729
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:36,837
Why not?

730
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:40,397
I came back as soon as I could.

731
00:40:40,707 --> 00:40:42,874
I kept my promise to you.
I did everything in one take.

732
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:49,366
Our anniversary was
almost over when you arrived.

733
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:52,661
Luna and Ke were
basically my boyfriends

734
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:55,578
because they were the ones
with me on our anniversary.

735
00:40:55,798 --> 00:40:57,883
They were with me the whole day.

736
00:41:02,304 --> 00:41:04,379
Maybe you don’t
love me anymore.

737
00:41:05,217 --> 00:41:07,097
Do you love your
manager more now?

738
00:41:10,396 --> 00:41:11,897
You’re the only one I love.

739
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:14,264
Please forgive me.

740
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:19,280
I know I messed up.
I know you’re upset.

741
00:41:19,822 --> 00:41:21,365
I made you wait long.

742
00:41:23,904 --> 00:41:26,698
You always make me wait.

743
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,322
I’m sorry, love.

744
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,617
I really did everything I could
to get back here quickly.

745
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:39,789
I love you.

746
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,149
This is huge, Kino.

747
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,652
It’s still not enough.

748
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,445
I’m sorry.

749
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:13,739
Are you still upset?

750
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:21,372
We’ll always be together
no matter what, okay?

751
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:24,542
I love you.

752
00:42:25,427 --> 00:42:26,428
I love you too.

753
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,239
So, should we celebrate
our anniversary now?

754
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:34,728
I have a surprise for you.
We’re going somewhere.

755
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:11,922
Isn’t it beautiful here?

756
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:14,534
It really is.

757
00:43:15,978 --> 00:43:17,463
- Right?
- Yes.

758
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,961
So, are you okay now?

759
00:43:20,587 --> 00:43:21,588
Are you still drunk?

760
00:43:21,588 --> 00:43:24,508
I’m not drunk.
I’m strong, you know.

761
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,781
Happy anniversary, love.

762
00:43:41,025 --> 00:43:42,193
What is this?

763
00:43:50,158 --> 00:43:54,788
So you can properly hear
the songs I write for you.

764
00:43:56,224 --> 00:43:58,268
Even if we’re not
always together,

765
00:43:59,627 --> 00:44:02,671
you can hear and feel my love.

766
00:44:10,243 --> 00:44:11,811
Happy anniversary, love.

767
00:44:27,304 --> 00:44:28,513
It’s beautiful.

768
00:44:33,477 --> 00:44:34,770
Did you paint this?

769
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:36,146
Yes.

770
00:44:36,813 --> 00:44:40,650
That’s one of my favorite
moments of us together.

771
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:44,863
And I want you to always see it.

772
00:44:53,205 --> 00:44:54,331
Thank you.

773
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:59,113
Thank you for
always waiting for me.

774
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,660
I’m sorry for all my
shortcomings with you.

775
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,453
I promise

776
00:45:07,175 --> 00:45:08,385
I won’t do it again.

777
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:13,941
Look over there.

778
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:22,616
Close your eyes.

779
00:45:24,834 --> 00:45:27,350
Imagine years from now,

780
00:45:28,629 --> 00:45:30,506
growing old together.

781
00:45:34,404 --> 00:45:35,655
Still happy.

782
00:45:36,964 --> 00:45:38,465
Loving each other even more.

783
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,885
Continuing to choose each other.

784
00:45:50,686 --> 00:45:52,729
We’ll end up saying that

785
00:45:53,313 --> 00:45:56,545
everything we went
through was worth it.

786
00:46:01,196 --> 00:46:03,636
There’s still a whole
lifetime ahead of us, Via.

787
00:46:05,798 --> 00:46:07,132
And I’ll make sure

788
00:46:08,662 --> 00:46:11,644
we spend every
anniversary together.

789
00:46:12,207 --> 00:46:15,502
From the second,
to the silver,

790
00:46:16,503 --> 00:46:18,651
even up to the
centennial anniversary.

791
00:46:20,787 --> 00:46:23,164
You’re the only one
I want to grow old with.

792
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,235
I’ve written so many
songs about you, for you.

793
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:45,491
I just want you to know that—

794
00:46:47,492 --> 00:46:51,747
I love you more than every
lyric I could ever write.

795
00:46:53,248 --> 00:46:55,187
Thank you too,

796
00:46:57,586 --> 00:47:00,359
because even though
so many people love you,

797
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,613
you still choose
to love me the most.

798
00:47:08,138 --> 00:47:10,766
I love you so much, Kino.

799
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,610
Let’s go, love.

800
00:48:00,902 --> 00:48:02,505
- Huh?
- Come on.

801
00:48:02,529 --> 00:48:03,530
Why?

802
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:05,198
We’re going somewhere else.

803
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,409
I prepared dinner for us.

804
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:10,245
- Okay.
- Come on.

805
00:48:10,633 --> 00:48:11,634
Let’s go.

806
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:16,180
Careful now.

807
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,223
Yeah.

808
00:48:22,253 --> 00:48:25,747
Thanks again for tonight.
Happy anniversary.

809
00:48:26,828 --> 00:48:28,112
Love you.

810
00:48:40,037 --> 00:48:41,251
Good morning.

811
00:48:41,444 --> 00:48:42,570
Kino?

812
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:45,450
Are you at a shoot?

813
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,077
He still hasn’t replied.

814
00:48:47,832 --> 00:48:48,959
I wonder if he’s busy.

815
00:48:57,009 --> 00:48:58,009
Via.

816
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:00,921
Do you have something to say?

817
00:49:01,422 --> 00:49:03,048
I don’t want any showbiz
gossip for now, okay?

818
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:04,049
But go ahead.

819
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:06,468
I saw something from my brother.

820
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:07,611
What?

821
00:49:07,636 --> 00:49:10,347
Pictures. Those pictures that—

822
00:49:10,597 --> 00:49:11,598
That what?

823
00:49:11,974 --> 00:49:14,827
What are you trying to say?
You’re stuttering.

824
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:16,437
What?

825
00:49:16,437 --> 00:49:18,956
Nothing.
Don’t worry about it.

826
00:49:23,986 --> 00:49:25,171
What was that about?

827
00:49:45,186 --> 00:49:46,938
Why aren’t you
touching what I brought?

828
00:49:46,938 --> 00:49:47,938
Don’t you like it?

829
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:51,568
Hold on—

830
00:49:52,481 --> 00:49:54,492
Are you really that
busy right now?

831
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,263
We haven’t seen
each other in a long time.

832
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,874
You were not replying
to my messages either.

833
00:50:06,876 --> 00:50:07,877
Kino?

834
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:10,967
What’s bothering you?

835
00:50:14,425 --> 00:50:15,430
Nothing, love.

836
00:50:16,594 --> 00:50:18,641
How’s school?

837
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:23,141
It’s okay.

838
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:41,539
I love you.

839
00:50:42,995 --> 00:50:44,709
Do you have any
problems at work?

840
00:50:49,835 --> 00:50:51,007
I love you too.

841
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,887
I love you so much.
Don’t forget that, okay?

842
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,057
You’re being weird.

843
00:51:00,772 --> 00:51:02,377
What’s going on?

844
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:05,263
Hey...

845
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:11,986
Where’s your bracelet?

846
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:16,448
Shit. I lost it, Via.
I’m sorry.

847
00:51:16,953 --> 00:51:17,954
Huh?

848
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,035
Since when?

849
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,413
I don’t remember.

850
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,500
I just noticed that it wasn't
on my wrist anymore.

851
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,670
It’s okay, I’ll just
make a new one.

852
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,920
It won’t take long
to do it anyway.

853
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,969
Kino, are you lying to me?

854
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,266
Hold on, I’ll just answer this.

855
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,728
Yes sir?

856
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,355
Yes, I just stopped by
somewhere. I’ll head—

857
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:49,618
I’m heading back now.

858
00:51:51,126 --> 00:51:54,195
I know. I’ll pick up Clea later.

859
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:56,459
Tonight, right?

860
00:51:58,184 --> 00:51:59,185
Yes, okay.

861
00:52:02,447 --> 00:52:04,574
Via, I’m sorry. I have to go.

862
00:52:04,574 --> 00:52:06,743
My manager doesn’t know
I stopped by here.

863
00:52:06,743 --> 00:52:09,829
Why? Where are you going?

864
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:14,208
I’m just picking up—

865
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,966
I’m just picking up Clea.

866
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,302
We have a date.

867
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,303
You know,

868
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,347
management’s orders.

869
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,767
Oh.

870
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,897
Okay. Take care.

871
00:52:45,315 --> 00:52:46,315
Via?

872
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,874
Why, Kino?

873
00:52:55,211 --> 00:52:56,382
Kino, why?

874
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:02,930
I love you.

875
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,809
I love you so much.

876
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,941
Kino.

877
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,528
I love you, too.

878
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,240
I love you so much too.
Don’t cry.

879
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:24,654
Don’t worry about me, okay?
I’m fine.

880
00:53:25,815 --> 00:53:27,520
I’m fine, I promise.

881
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:30,665
What matters is that
you stay safe, okay?

882
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,086
And keep me updated.

883
00:53:34,656 --> 00:53:35,656
I’m okay.

884
00:53:36,324 --> 00:53:37,325
I promise.

885
00:53:56,844 --> 00:53:57,943
Take care.

886
00:54:02,738 --> 00:54:04,323
Don’t cry anymore.

887
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,451
I’ll go ahead.

888
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:08,971
Take care.

889
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:23,177
I didn’t get to
tell him about Spain.

890
00:54:23,663 --> 00:54:25,206
I’ll just tell him next time.

891
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:27,514
He’ll probably
understand anyway.

892
00:54:43,066 --> 00:54:47,696
So you can properly hear
the songs I write for you.

893
00:54:49,198 --> 00:54:51,288
Even if we’re
not always together,

894
00:54:52,534 --> 00:54:55,579
You can hear and feel my love.

895
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:29,880
- Look.
- Hey!

896
00:55:29,905 --> 00:55:30,906
Look, your idol.

897
00:55:30,906 --> 00:55:31,907
Hey, Via.

898
00:55:31,907 --> 00:55:33,325
Via, oh my gosh!

899
00:55:33,575 --> 00:55:35,869
Via! Have you seen this?

900
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:38,288
Look, look. It’s making
me swoon. Look.

901
00:55:38,288 --> 00:55:39,998
Spotted: Larkin Sanchez
and Clea Aguilar

902
00:55:39,998 --> 00:55:41,541
on a sweet date,
sharing a kiss.

903
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,971
Nica! Nica, let me see!

904
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:51,765
Oh, come on.
You already saw it earlier.

905
00:55:55,187 --> 00:55:56,520
It’s beautiful here, right?

906
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:57,898
It really is.

907
00:55:58,315 --> 00:56:00,067
Happy anniversary, love.

908
00:56:00,985 --> 00:56:02,945
Why don’t you want
her in a love team?

909
00:56:02,945 --> 00:56:05,322
There’s a high chance
she might catch feelings

910
00:56:05,322 --> 00:56:06,696
for her love team partner.

911
00:56:07,196 --> 00:56:09,990
Enough with these love teams
turning into real-life couples.

912
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:15,247
Larkin, are you
trying to court Clea?

913
00:56:15,496 --> 00:56:17,372
No, not yet, nothing like that.

914
00:56:17,372 --> 00:56:21,043
Not yet? So will it happen?

915
00:56:22,878 --> 00:56:24,797
About what happened
earlier with Clea,

916
00:56:24,797 --> 00:56:28,258
that was management’s order,
you know, just for promo.

917
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,598
That was my first time seeing
Clea in person earlier.

918
00:56:32,805 --> 00:56:34,848
She really is beautiful.

919
00:56:34,848 --> 00:56:37,017
Are you sure you
never had a crush on her?

920
00:56:37,226 --> 00:56:38,226
My whole life,

921
00:56:38,234 --> 00:56:40,236
you’re the only one I’ve
ever had a crush on. Okay?

922
00:56:40,738 --> 00:56:43,866
So, Arkin, what’s the real
deal between you and Clea?

923
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:45,910
I’m sure a lot of
your fans are curious.

924
00:56:48,078 --> 00:56:51,749
Well, I can say that our
relationship is very special to me.

925
00:56:51,749 --> 00:56:54,126
So, are you guys official now?

926
00:56:54,543 --> 00:56:56,253
You should ask Clea about that.

927
00:56:56,962 --> 00:56:59,506
You’re going to say in interviews
that you’re a couple?

928
00:56:59,506 --> 00:57:01,258
You’re going to tell everyone?

929
00:57:01,258 --> 00:57:02,718
You know this already.

930
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,428
Orders from the management.

931
00:57:04,428 --> 00:57:05,971
- I really can’t do anything.
- Fine! Okay, fine!

932
00:57:05,971 --> 00:57:08,724
Okay, management.
But what happens now?

933
00:57:09,099 --> 00:57:10,559
This is all just work.

934
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:11,559
You know—

935
00:57:11,852 --> 00:57:13,938
You know you’re
the one I love, right?

936
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,357
Via, I’d understand if—

937
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:19,401
you can’t support me
on this anymore.

938
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:12,044
Try to finish your shoot
early so you can come back

939
00:58:12,044 --> 00:58:14,004
right away and we can celebrate.

940
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,006
That’s a promise, okay?

941
00:58:16,006 --> 00:58:17,842
I swear on it.

942
00:58:18,342 --> 00:58:20,177
Cheers!

943
00:58:21,303 --> 00:58:23,681
Via, wait. You’re getting drunk.

944
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:27,059
He probably doesn’t
love me anymore.

945
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:29,728
It’s our anniversary today.
What time is it?

946
00:58:29,728 --> 00:58:31,605
But he’s still not here.
Where is he?

947
00:58:31,605 --> 00:58:33,899
He’s there. He’s there
with someone else.

948
00:58:33,899 --> 00:58:36,152
With another girl. I’m done.

949
00:58:36,152 --> 00:58:37,319
He loves you. He loves you.

950
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,017
Stay right here beside me, okay?

951
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:43,812
Of course.

952
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,356
I will never leave you.

953
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,405
And cut!

954
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:54,698
Good take, Direk?

955
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:56,116
- Such a good take.
- Good take!

956
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,617
- Okay, okay.
- Okay guys, next scene.

957
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,286
Thank you, I’ll go ahead.

958
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,287
Larkin!

959
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,580
- You were amazing. What happened?
- Thank you, Direk.

960
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,999
You’ve been doing everything
in one take today.

961
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,250
Maybe it’s just my day, Direk.

962
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,250
You were amazing earlier—

963
00:59:06,255 --> 00:59:07,673
- Imagine all the awards you’re going to get.
- Direk.

964
00:59:07,673 --> 00:59:08,673
- Hey, I’ll make a—
- I’m just in a hurry.

965
00:59:08,675 --> 00:59:10,135
Yes, Direk.
Email it to me, okay?

966
00:59:10,135 --> 00:59:11,428
- Send it to me by email.
- Larkin, just to remind you

967
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:12,428
about your upcoming schedule.

968
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:14,009
Okay, I know.
I know, I know.

969
00:59:14,276 --> 00:59:15,276
Sir!

970
00:59:15,693 --> 00:59:16,372
Shit!

971
00:59:16,401 --> 00:59:17,035
Where are you now?
Are you still not done?

972
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:17,753
Are you gonna make it?
Should I keep waiting?

973
00:59:23,169 --> 00:59:24,503
Isn’t it beautiful here?

974
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:27,150
It really is.

975
00:59:30,112 --> 00:59:31,694
Happy anniversary, love.

976
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:49,297
Let’s go, love.

977
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,129
- Huh?
- Come on.

978
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:52,154
Why?

979
00:59:52,675 --> 00:59:56,009
We’re going somewhere else.
I prepared dinner for us.

980
00:59:58,056 --> 00:59:59,057
- Okay.
- Come on.

981
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:00,349
Let’s go.

982
01:00:05,131 --> 01:00:06,797
Yes, sir, we’re already
working on it.

983
01:00:08,051 --> 01:00:09,051
Yes, sir.

984
01:00:32,701 --> 01:00:34,339
Sorry, I can’t kiss you.

985
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:35,912
I can’t do it.

986
01:00:36,705 --> 01:00:39,666
Just stop crying,
for pete’s sake.

987
01:00:40,484 --> 01:00:41,915
Just make it look like we are.

988
01:00:51,594 --> 01:00:52,595
Yes.

989
01:00:53,325 --> 01:00:54,636
Good job.

990
01:00:55,692 --> 01:00:56,693
Yes.

991
01:01:04,111 --> 01:01:05,953
That’s good.
All right, guys.

992
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:07,376
That’s good.
Good job, everyone.

993
01:01:18,429 --> 01:01:19,430
Clea?

994
01:01:20,063 --> 01:01:21,064
Via?

995
01:01:22,043 --> 01:01:23,044
I’m sorry.

996
01:01:24,123 --> 01:01:27,209
Via? Are you okay?

997
01:01:29,295 --> 01:01:30,562
I’m right here.

998
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:34,691
Do you want to go outside?

999
01:01:36,802 --> 01:01:38,679
My sister didn’t ruin anything.

1000
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:40,723
What do you mean?
It’s all over social media

1001
01:01:40,723 --> 01:01:41,974
that your sister is a mistress.

1002
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:43,630
- Mira, what are you doing?
- Oh my.

1003
01:01:43,637 --> 01:01:44,889
Here’s the mistress.

1004
01:01:46,682 --> 01:01:48,809
I’m getting really mad at Arkin.

1005
01:01:50,978 --> 01:01:52,563
Why isn’t he by your side?

1006
01:01:53,606 --> 01:01:55,113
What are you doing here?

1007
01:01:56,692 --> 01:01:57,692
Via, I’m sorry.

1008
01:01:57,705 --> 01:01:59,499
This is the only way
for me to protect you

1009
01:01:59,499 --> 01:02:02,377
from what you’re
most afraid of.

1010
01:02:02,377 --> 01:02:04,754
How are you protecting me
with what you did, Larkin?

1011
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:06,422
You just hurt me.

1012
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:09,377
Oh my gosh, it’s Larkin Sanchez!

1013
01:02:09,377 --> 01:02:12,506
- Hey, it really is Arkin!
- Wait a second.

1014
01:02:12,506 --> 01:02:14,064
Can I really live without him?
