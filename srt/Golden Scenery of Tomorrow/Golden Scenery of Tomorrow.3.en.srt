1
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:26,880
- Go, Via!
- Let’s go, go, go.

2
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:28,364
Hit that ball, Via!

3
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:37,077
Hi, Arkin.

4
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:39,339
Such a heartthrob.

5
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:40,851
I am good-looking.

6
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:43,186
Kino, do you have a crush?

7
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:44,705
We won!

8
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,481
Hey, Yanna!

9
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:48,166
We won! We won!

10
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:48,750
Yeah!

11
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:50,444
Well, congratulations.

12
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:52,975
Hey, you’re joining the
Miss Valerian pageant.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,281
You don’t have a choice
anymore, I signed you up.

14
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:57,826
So, today we’re officially
kicking off our Foundation Week.

15
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,919
A slut, huh?

16
00:01:02,414 --> 00:01:06,460
Yanna, don’t ever think there’s
something wrong with you, okay?

17
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,003
You didn’t do anything wrong.

18
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:09,796
You didn’t do anything bad.

19
00:01:10,923 --> 00:01:11,632
Here you go.

20
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:14,468
If anyone wants to sign up
for the marriage booth.

21
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:16,595
Excuse me, can I sign up?

22
00:01:17,346 --> 00:01:17,654
Huh?

23
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:18,822
Via?

24
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:19,906
Huh?

25
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:23,804
Let’s get married.

26
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:39,093
Huh?

27
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,888
Why would we get married?

28
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,632
So ’til death do us part.

29
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:46,268
Didn’t you say we’d never leave each other?

30
00:02:46,853 --> 00:02:48,912
And look, I even prepared a ring.

31
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:50,117
See?

32
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:54,004
There’s no need.

33
00:02:57,154 --> 00:02:59,197
You don’t want to marry me, Via?

34
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:04,786
What I mean is, we
don’t need to get married

35
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,955
just to prove we won’t
leave each other, right?

36
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,641
What if someone signs you up
and you marry someone else?

37
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,603
No one’s gonna sign me up.

38
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,839
Then what if someone signs me up?

39
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:18,108
I mean, what if someone else signs us up

40
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:19,593
and we suddenly get caught and then—

41
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:21,069
Then you’d marry
someone else and

42
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:22,929
and I’d marry someone
else, and then it’s like—

43
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:24,323
Hush!

44
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:25,651
Okay, okay.

45
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,284
Fine.

46
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:28,560
Let’s get married.

47
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:34,900
You… You’re really marrying me, Via?

48
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,501
- Yeah.
- All right.

49
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:37,319
I mean, I can take it back—

50
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,403
No, no, don’t.

51
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:39,507
Let’s get married.

52
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:47,621
We’re getting married.

53
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:51,958
Arkin, take a picture of us.

54
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:53,960
You’re ruining the moment.

55
00:03:55,337 --> 00:03:56,588
Why do you want a picture?

56
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:58,590
Sevi, you’re so annoying.

57
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:00,008
Fine, whatever.

58
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:00,842
- Okay, say cheese.
- Wait.

59
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:01,343
Are we in it too? Oh, okay.

60
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:04,721
It’s fine, right?
This is just for fun anyway.

61
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:05,972
All right—

62
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:14,397
Let’s go!

63
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:14,981
- Kino, what the—
- Ouch!

64
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:16,597
Where are you taking me?

65
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,183
We’re getting married, aren’t we?

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,336
Right now?

67
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:20,462
Yes, right now.

68
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:21,488
Come on, MUMU.

69
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,281
MUMU?

70
00:04:23,657 --> 00:04:24,800
MUMU.

71
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:28,316
My Universe. My Unending.

72
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:32,181
Huh? Don’t even. That’s so cringey.

73
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:34,150
No way! It’s like calling me a ghost.

74
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,128
I’m just kidding. I just read it online.

75
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:36,920
Well? Come on.

76
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,838
Let’s go!

77
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:39,256
Huh? What?

78
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,549
Excuse me.

79
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:41,800
- Excuse me.
- Kino, what are you—

80
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,551
Excuse me.

81
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,552
- Excuse me.
- Hey, you’re too loud.

82
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:44,094
Excuse me.

83
00:04:44,094 --> 00:04:45,554
Excuse me.

84
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:47,389
- Sir, there’s a line.
- I’m sorry.

85
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:49,324
- Sir, there’s a line.
- I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.

86
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:50,605
We’re getting married.

87
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,769
Who’s being nominated?

88
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:54,646
We're both volunteers.

89
00:04:54,896 --> 00:04:56,064
Volunteers?

90
00:04:56,314 --> 00:04:57,925
What is this, a blood donation?

91
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:01,227
We’re surrendering so you
don’t have to arrest us anymore.

92
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:02,295
Sir…

93
00:05:03,113 --> 00:05:04,781
Can you read?

94
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:08,818
All right then, I’m nominating Via.

95
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:10,206
Avianna Diaz.

96
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:15,667
Sorry, but nominations are
already closed for today.

97
00:05:16,126 --> 00:05:17,711
But—

98
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,339
Maybe I can put Madam Via’s
name down tomorrow.

99
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,383
For tomorrow.

100
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:24,384
Tomorrow?

101
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:25,468
Yeah, tomorrow.

102
00:05:26,386 --> 00:05:27,888
Maybe you can slip us in,

103
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:29,681
‘cause she might change her mind tomorrow.

104
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:31,308
Please, just let us in. Please.

105
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:33,226
- Kino, stand up.
- Please, sir.

106
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:34,895
- I’m sorry about this.
- All right, fine.

107
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:36,730
On one condition.

108
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:39,566
You need to talk to the others
who signed up first—

109
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:40,650
Hey!

110
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,193
Maybe you guys can—

111
00:05:41,193 --> 00:05:42,485
Come on, can we go first, please?

112
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:44,112
Please? Just do it tomorrow instead.

113
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:45,947
I don’t want her to change her mind.

114
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:48,408
Please? Just do it tomorrow
Don’t get married today.

115
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:51,161
He really wants to get married, huh.

116
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:52,287
What do you want in return?
Want some snacks?

117
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,914
I’ll treat you.

118
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:55,123
Alright.

119
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:56,208
Okay? Thank you.

120
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,210
Just head over to the other booths first.

121
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,169
There’s also a Pop the Balloon over there.

122
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:00,545
Thanks a lot. Thank you.

123
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:04,758
All right, the altar’s ready. Let’s go.

124
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:10,263
You’re the officiant?

125
00:06:10,263 --> 00:06:11,890
You don’t want me to?

126
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,016
I do, Father.

127
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:14,935
There she is.

128
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:56,446
Larkin Olivier Sanchez,

129
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:58,788
do you take Avianna—

130
00:07:58,788 --> 00:07:59,706
I do!

131
00:07:59,706 --> 00:08:01,207
- I do.
- Do it later—

132
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:03,501
Well, it’s your wedding anyway. Okay.

133
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,739
Avianna, do you take

134
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,509
Larkin Olivier Sanchez

135
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:17,057
as your lawfully wedded husband?

136
00:08:28,026 --> 00:08:29,052
I do.

137
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,098
Okay.

138
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:36,743
Wait, wait.

139
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:37,844
Wait a minute, please.

140
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:40,163
- Wait, Father.
- What’s that, a prop?

141
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:42,832
I never thought of that.

142
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:47,589
There you go.

143
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:51,274
Okay.

144
00:08:51,502 --> 00:08:53,796
- So, at least with that—
- Wait, Father!

145
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:56,161
One more.

146
00:08:58,723 --> 00:09:03,770
To my best friend Via, you know
that ever since we were kids—

147
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,688
Sir, I still have a lot of
weddings to officiate.

148
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:06,981
- Let’s keep it short.
- Okay, Father.

149
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:07,899
- Is that alright?
- Sure.

150
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:09,651
All right.

151
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:14,030
I now pronounce you, husband and wife.

152
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,484
You may now kiss the bride.

153
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,636
We’re married!

154
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:38,680
We’re married!

155
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,848
We’re married now.

156
00:09:39,848 --> 00:09:41,808
We’re married, Via!

157
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:44,269
Show them your ring.

158
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:47,939
Okay, here—

159
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:49,649
That’s your certificate,

160
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:52,068
and I’ll just take this
for the next couple.

161
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:53,778
- I’m sorry.
- Okay, there.

162
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:54,904
- All right, next please!
- Wait, this too.

163
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:55,572
Next, okay—

164
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:56,614
She’s your crush, right?

165
00:09:56,614 --> 00:09:58,032
She’s not my crush.

166
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,451
Then who is your crush?

167
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:00,827
Come on, I’ll help you, hurry.

168
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:03,246
Hey, everyone! Look!
Via and I just got married!

169
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,688
- Hey, it’s all just pretend, Kino.
- Let me see.

170
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:07,298
This is fake.

171
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:08,741
Fake? That’s legit! It even has signatures.

172
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:10,435
- Can I see? I wanna see.
- There are witnesses too.

173
00:10:10,462 --> 00:10:11,588
Here, look.

174
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:12,922
Via, Arkin tricked you, didn’t he?

175
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:15,528
Want me to suggest an
Annulment Booth to the president?

176
00:10:15,838 --> 00:10:18,258
Annulment, my foot.
You’re just jealous, dude!

177
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,472
- Okay, guys! Shut up!
- Congratulations!

178
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:22,515
I think we’re ready for
all the parlor games,

179
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:24,392
but no one’s allowed to back out or

180
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:26,060
we’ll be short on players.

181
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,228
Okay? Got it?

182
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:28,271
Why, what’s the plan?

183
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,944
Three, two, one—

184
00:10:34,944 --> 00:10:36,160
Go!

185
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:42,118
- Sam!
- Go, Sam!

186
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:43,995
Yanna, hurry!

187
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:45,346
Hurry up!

188
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,206
One foot at a time!

189
00:10:46,206 --> 00:10:48,958
One, two—

190
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:49,959
I’m sorry, okay.

191
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,628
- One, two—
- One, two—

192
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:53,588
One, two—

193
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,298
- One, two—
- One, two—

194
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,342
- One, two—
- One, two—

195
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:00,053
Via!

196
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:00,720
Are you okay?

197
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,430
Arkin, come on!
Faster!

198
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,892
- One, two—
- One, two—

199
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:07,810
One, two—

200
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:12,106
Let’s go, guys! Let’s go!

201
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,483
Kino!

202
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:15,109
- One, two—
- One, two—

203
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,294
Via—

204
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:18,613
Hurry! Hurry!

205
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:20,823
Hurry!

206
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:22,367
- One, two—
- One, two—

207
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,080
Yes!

208
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:31,167
I told you to focus!

209
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:33,545
Good job, Via!

210
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:36,277
And this—

211
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:38,620
You’re always getting hurt.

212
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:40,401
If this keeps up,
I’m keeping you in my pocket.

213
00:11:40,426 --> 00:11:42,428
You’re overreacting. I’m fine.

214
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:43,429
It doesn’t even hurt.

215
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:45,223
Still, it might get infected.

216
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,809
Here, put a band-aid on it.

217
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,478
I said it’s fine.

218
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,647
Stop worrying so much.

219
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:55,400
Stop worrying?

220
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,488
I haven’t placed it yet.

221
00:11:56,513 --> 00:11:58,097
Don’t press on it.

222
00:11:58,152 --> 00:11:59,688
I’m just about to put it.

223
00:11:59,713 --> 00:12:01,631
See?

224
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:02,574
All right, it’s fine.

225
00:12:02,574 --> 00:12:04,492
Don’t touch it anymore. It’s fine.

226
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,206
Via—

227
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:07,078
Water?

228
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:07,699
Oh.

229
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:09,372
Thanks, Pres.

230
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:10,456
You know, that’ll heal in no time.

231
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:13,496
And by the way, you did
an amazing job earlier.

232
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:16,777
You too.

233
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:20,692
So—

234
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:22,927
- Okay, don’t touch it anymore.
- Okay, guys!

235
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:25,305
Are you guys ready for the next game?

236
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:27,457
What now? My feet are killing me.

237
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:29,025
Via’s hurt, you know?

238
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,678
You were all so happy earlier,
and now you’re acting like this.

239
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:33,288
- You should be the one playing.
- Can’t we rest?

240
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:36,065
Nope, no resting allowed.

241
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:37,191
Okay, guys!

242
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,836
Our next game is Pass the Paper.

243
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:40,903
- Jeez.
- Okay?

244
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:43,781
So here’s how it goes,
you’ll pass this piece of paper

245
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,783
from the first member to the last member.

246
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:49,037
Using any body part.

247
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:50,430
- Huh?
- Huh?

248
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:53,683
Anyway, you can’t use your hands, got it?

249
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,334
Yes!

250
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:57,962
So, the first team to
hand me five papers wins.

251
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:01,966
Let’s just use our mouths.

252
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:03,582
- That’ll be faster.
- What if it falls?

253
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:04,636
Then you’re an idiot.

254
00:13:04,636 --> 00:13:05,720
All right, mouths it is.

255
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,596
Mouths then.

256
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:09,223
Can’t we use our toes or something?

257
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:11,100
That’s gross. Let’s just use our mouth.

258
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,477
Let’s go with that.

259
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:14,937
Ready? Three, two, one, go!

260
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:16,939
Hurry up!

261
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:18,316
- Faster! Hurry!
- Let’s go, let’s go!

262
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:19,192
Come on!

263
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:20,401
We got this! Let’s go!

264
00:13:20,652 --> 00:13:21,892
- Okay.
- Come on, hurry!

265
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,063
Oh my—

266
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:29,297
- Jerk!
- Fucker!

267
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,912
You bastard!
That was my first kiss!

268
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:32,121
What? That was my first kiss too!

269
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:34,290
Who dropped the paper?
Was it me?

270
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,124
Disgusting!

271
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:37,210
Hey! You’re disgusting!

272
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,628
You even leaned in!

273
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:39,711
You even looked excited!

274
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:40,463
Huh?

275
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:41,756
Who’s an idiot now?

276
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:43,132
You’re the one who dropped the paper—

277
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:45,593
You probably like me, huh?

278
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:47,261
- You did it on purpose, didn’t you?
- What?

279
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:48,571
As if I’d like you.

280
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:51,224
Everything about you, seriously, so gross!

281
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:53,309
I can’t believe—

282
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:55,240
Ew!

283
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,065
Your kiss looked like it
was in slow motion, like this.

284
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,317
Well, maybe you two are
really meant for each other.

285
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:02,944
Kino, stop it!

286
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:03,778
Yanna, it’s fine.

287
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:05,530
At least you’ve had your first kiss now!

288
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:13,037
My dream first kiss was supposed to be
with someone handsome, kind, tall.

289
00:14:13,037 --> 00:14:14,539
My type!

290
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:17,517
Someone who’d love me forever.

291
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:18,876
Not someone who...

292
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:20,169
looks like a ladle!

293
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:23,256
I was expecting paper, and you
gave me a kiss instead.

294
00:14:23,256 --> 00:14:24,757
This is your fault!
You’re disgusting!

295
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,654
- A ladle!
- Disgusting!

296
00:14:28,685 --> 00:14:30,099
- You guys are the worst!
- What?

297
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,931
I’m not hanging out
with you all ever again!

298
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:33,891
All you do is torture me.

299
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,251
Gross!

300
00:14:36,184 --> 00:14:38,529
- Yanna!
- Apparently, you look like a ladle!

301
00:14:38,563 --> 00:14:40,990
Let me see? Let me see that ladle face.

302
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,864
Wow.

303
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:50,286
My wifey’s so talented.

304
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:53,578
Wifey? I’m not your wife.

305
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:55,329
Don’t call me wifey, Kino.

306
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:57,719
All right then, how about MUMU!

307
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,891
What?

308
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,752
My Universe and—

309
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:05,106
That’s it.
There’s not going to be a next time.

310
00:15:05,131 --> 00:15:06,318
I’m kidding!

311
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:08,966
You don’t like MUMU?

312
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:10,803
Via?

313
00:15:10,803 --> 00:15:11,919
- Pa!
- Pa.

314
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:13,677
Hello.

315
00:15:15,641 --> 00:15:16,809
How are you guys?

316
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:18,770
Are you okay, Pa?

317
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:20,490
I’m fine.

318
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:23,107
Wait, I have something to show you.

319
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:24,817
- What’s that?
- Here.

320
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:26,235
Via and I got married.

321
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,069
Too bad you weren’t there.

322
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:27,862
Look.

323
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:29,363
Arkin and Via.

324
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:30,597
Marriage certificate.

325
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,308
So, where’s the ring?

326
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:35,470
I already ate it. You want some?

327
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:37,013
There’s still one left here.

328
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:38,414
But it  just lights up like this.

329
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:39,749
Kino!

330
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,084
You guys are such goofballs.

331
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:44,003
How’s your studies?

332
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:47,507
It’s our foundation week right now,
Pa, so no classes.

333
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:48,925
Foundation week, I see.

334
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:50,718
Do you have any new friends?

335
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:54,472
You know, dear, I’m a bit worried because

336
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:57,475
the only person you ever talk to is Arkin.

337
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:01,646
You two can’t be together forever.

338
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:04,106
What if you go to different colleges?

339
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,294
Pa, I do have friends.

340
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:09,070
Really?

341
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,798
Yes. Next time, if it’s okay,
I’ll introduce them to you.

342
00:16:11,823 --> 00:16:14,283
Then bring them here, invite them over
so I can meet them.

343
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:16,577
Here, Pa. I’ll show you.

344
00:16:17,662 --> 00:16:18,704
Here.

345
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:20,832
This is Luna, and this is Kierra.

346
00:16:20,832 --> 00:16:22,834
- These are her new friends.
- I see.

347
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,503
You should invite them
over so I can meet them,

348
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:27,296
and I’ll prepare some
food for them too.

349
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:30,716
By the way, Via, did Mira
mention anything to you

350
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:33,803
about the art materials
she needs for school?

351
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,591
Huh? I don’t think she said anything, Pa.

352
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:39,392
Does she need it now?

353
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:41,227
The store might be… what time is it now?

354
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:43,104
- The stores might be closed—
- I’ll go. I’ll take care of it.

355
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:45,064
I know a place that’s
open 24/7. It’s nearby.

356
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:48,715
The one you know is near the school.
That’s far from here.

357
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,946
Don’t worry about it. I
got this. Husband duties.

358
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:55,356
Wifey.

359
00:16:56,672 --> 00:16:58,879
All right, I’ll go ahead.

360
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:00,997
Get some rest, Pa.

361
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:02,957
Pa, make sure you rest well.

362
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:04,834
All right, sweetheart.

363
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,114
Listen to your child.

364
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:08,308
Yes, sweetheart. Thank you.

365
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:14,189
I’m glad that you’re always ready to help,
even for my siblings.

366
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:18,097
I should finish this up now.

367
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:19,490
Hey…

368
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:20,975
What if I call you “honey” instead?

369
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:22,143
Wait, let me just finish this.

370
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:23,731
You don’t like to be called “honey”?

371
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:26,856
I’ll call you like, “Hon,
where’s my breakfast?”

372
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:28,403
- That’s how I’ll do it.
- Whatever!

373
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:31,669
Here!

374
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:32,945
Here’s your blanket.

375
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:36,157
You always pull mine
whenever you sleep over.

376
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:37,700
Is that how you hand someone a blanket?

377
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,118
By throwing it at their face?

378
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:41,012
Fine, give it back then.
Don’t use a blanket.

379
00:17:41,037 --> 00:17:42,129
No, give it to me.

380
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,372
No, you don’t need it anymore.

381
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:44,582
You already gave it to me.

382
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:46,000
It’s fine, I don’t mind.
I’ll use it instead.

383
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,376
No, give it to me. It gets cold at night

384
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,944
and you always point the fan at me.

385
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,137
Try not to use a blanket this time.

386
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:54,884
Arkin, thank you for the art papers.

387
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:57,903
No problem. And what do I always say?

388
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,864
If big bro can do it—

389
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:02,308
- No problemo!
- No problemo.

390
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:04,827
Good night.

391
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:05,937
- Good night!
- Good night.

392
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:07,396
All right, go to sleep, okay? Good night.

393
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,215
Come on.

394
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:30,920
Why are you laughing?

395
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:36,801
I just remembered Sevi
and Yanna’s kiss earlier.

396
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,872
They looked like magnets.

397
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:45,476
That’s exactly why Yanna doesn’t
wanna hang out with us anymore.

398
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:50,790
Oh.

399
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:52,483
Now you’re suddenly quiet.

400
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:55,152
You’re being serious.

401
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,864
Just thinking about something.

402
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,282
What?

403
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:06,664
Have...

404
00:19:06,664 --> 00:19:07,957
Have you had your first kiss yet, Via?

405
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:09,959
Me?

406
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:13,045
I don’t think about stuff like that.

407
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:15,589
Hmm.

408
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:18,426
Yeah, me neither.

409
00:19:23,472 --> 00:19:25,016
What if you become my first kiss?

410
00:19:26,517 --> 00:19:27,268
Me?

411
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:28,352
Yeah.

412
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:30,405
Why me?

413
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:34,316
It’s just, you’re always with
me for all my firsts, right?

414
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,154
And they say it’s supposed to be memorable.

415
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:41,449
Then it wouldn’t be
memorable if it’s with me.

416
00:19:43,117 --> 00:19:44,076
Just here.

417
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,202
Try it here.

418
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:47,131
On the cheek.

419
00:19:47,738 --> 00:19:48,741
Here.

420
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:50,082
Hey!

421
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:50,916
I said here.

422
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:52,115
Fine,

423
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:53,514
then you do it.

424
00:19:53,878 --> 00:19:55,069
Here. Come on!

425
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,342
Try it.

426
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:02,522
Come on.

427
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,073
Come on, you’re taking too long.

428
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:07,850
No, I don’t want to. I can’t.

429
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:08,873
Huh?

430
00:20:11,103 --> 00:20:14,440
I’m going to sleep, Via.
We still have a lot of activities tomorrow.

431
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:15,850
Good night.

432
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:20,654
Okay.

433
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,617
Why is he suddenly sleepy?

434
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,027
Where’s—

435
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:44,887
Jeez, I’ll just call Sam and—

436
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,113
Hi, guys!

437
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:47,615
- Hi, Pres!
- Hi, Pres!

438
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,975
By the way, Luna, great job
with the parlor games yesterday.

439
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:51,310
It was super fun.

440
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,020
I know, right? Thanks, Pres.

441
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,814
Via, how’s your knee doing?

442
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:57,650
It’s a bit better now, Pres. It’s healing.

443
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,195
That’s good, because I brought
this for you. It’s good for the wound.

444
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,784
You didn’t have to. Thank you, Pres.

445
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:07,535
It’s nothing.

446
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:09,011
Anyway, I’ll see you around?

447
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:10,329
Thanks, Pres.

448
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:12,081
Thank you, Pres.

449
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:18,671
Hey! What was that?

450
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:21,273
Pres seems concerned!
Something’s up between you two.

451
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:23,926
- Oh, Via…
- What? What are you saying?

452
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:28,597
No, man!  I treated you to
fishballs last time.

453
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:30,724
Now it’s your turn to buy me kwek-kwek.

454
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:33,185
You jerk. So annoying.

455
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,214
Where to now?

456
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:38,065
To the Horror Booth!

457
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:40,526
Wait! Let me call Yanna and Sam.

458
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:43,612
Sam, Yanna! Where are you? Come out here.

459
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:44,405
I’m so excited!

460
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:45,614
- What now?
- Horror Booth, bro.

461
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:47,825
Yanna, come with us.

462
00:21:47,992 --> 00:21:49,201
Sam too, come with us.

463
00:21:49,201 --> 00:21:49,869
Not interested.

464
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:51,245
Come on, join us already.

465
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:52,788
I’m not letting you kiss me again.

466
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:55,541
So, let’s go?

467
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,042
Let’s go, let’s go.

468
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:58,377
Come with us.

469
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:00,337
Please?

470
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:03,048
Let’s go. It’s gonna be fun!

471
00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:05,342
Let’s go!

472
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:10,472
Via, are you nervous?

473
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:13,225
Don’t be scared, okay?

474
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:14,643
Just hold on to me,

475
00:22:14,643 --> 00:22:15,728
all right?

476
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:17,521
I’m not scared.

477
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:19,356
- Okay.
- Let’s go.

478
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:33,329
Why are you guys even scared?
They’re just people, you know.

479
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:35,080
No screaming, okay?

480
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:38,726
I thought no one was
supposed to scream?

481
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:40,085
- See?
- It was huge.

482
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,571
The Arts Club and I did
a great job on this, right?

483
00:22:43,505 --> 00:22:44,997
Sev, you idiot, nothing’s happening yet.

484
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:49,904
Don’t hold on to me.

485
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:51,154
Kino, wait—

486
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:52,552
Kino, my shirt.

487
00:22:54,725 --> 00:22:55,935
Kino, my shirt.

488
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:03,779
Kino!

489
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:07,321
Excuse me—

490
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:11,158
Via, Via!

491
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:12,201
Via, let’s go.

492
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,373
Hey!

493
00:23:22,086 --> 00:23:23,045
There’s a severed head—

494
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:24,185
Sevi!

495
00:23:24,797 --> 00:23:26,215
You keep doing that!

496
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:55,703
You’re such a troublemaker, Arkin.

497
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,329
Why’d you punch him?

498
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,665
Hey, no I didn’t! I saw Sevi
do it. Sevi punched him.

499
00:23:59,665 --> 00:24:00,749
- I promise.
- Sevi…

500
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:02,918
Why me? You’re the one who was scared!

501
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,921
Poor guy.

502
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:07,131
Via, you okay?

503
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:10,634
Wow, you’re really asking me?

504
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:12,594
You’re the one I should be worried about.

505
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:14,638
Via, I’m sorry.

506
00:24:16,348 --> 00:24:17,349
It’s fine.

507
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:20,769
Sorry for leaving you back there.

508
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:23,397
It won’t happen again.

509
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:26,670
All right.

510
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:28,896
Hey, Yanna.

511
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:31,707
You don’t have a
choice, okay? You’re our friend now.

512
00:24:31,732 --> 00:24:33,382
We’ve been
through a lot already.

513
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:34,591
Right? Right?

514
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:37,453
- We’ve been through a lot together.
- She’s right, yes!

515
00:24:39,663 --> 00:24:40,998
Silence means—

516
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:45,169
- Yes!
- Yes!

517
00:24:46,003 --> 00:24:52,301
Group hug!

518
00:24:58,913 --> 00:25:00,289
Are they still coming?

519
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:01,935
Probably in a bit.

520
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:06,273
Sevi, Sam, and Luna got called
by the Student Council for a bit.

521
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,409
Ke’s over at the Arts Club, and

522
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:10,569
Yanna just went back to her
classroom to get something.

523
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:15,115
It’s so quiet, I’m not used to it.

524
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:17,509
Hey, it’s dismissal time.

525
00:25:17,534 --> 00:25:19,670
Are you sure it’s all right
for you to be out late today?

526
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,997
It’s fine. Pa’s coming home early anyway

527
00:25:21,997 --> 00:25:26,877
since it’s his last day at his job.
He got accepted as an in-house foreman at—

528
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:30,923
He’ll be working at... VGC?

529
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:32,633
Pa’s awesome.

530
00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:39,306
Via, Mama’s looking for you.

531
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:40,432
What did Auntie say?

532
00:25:41,016 --> 00:25:42,893
She said maybe you’d want to
sleep over at our house later?

533
00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:45,896
I’ll ask Pa. I’ll send him a message.

534
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:47,606
I’ll message Papa, too.

535
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:52,027
You know what, Hiro,
you can take this seat.

536
00:25:52,027 --> 00:25:53,445
We’re about to leave anyway.
We’re just here for a bit.

537
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:54,516
Wait…

538
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:55,709
Stay for a bit, won’t you?

539
00:25:56,698 --> 00:25:57,783
Fine.

540
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:01,036
I’m okay. Go ahead. I’ll find a seat.

541
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:04,206
There are lots of booths
around, try them out.

542
00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:06,333
Hi, is this seat taken?

543
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:08,919
It’s taken.

544
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:11,843
Taken.

545
00:26:17,803 --> 00:26:19,179
Shut up, Shan.

546
00:26:21,974 --> 00:26:23,725
Hiro, you can take this
seat. I’m heading out.

547
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:24,726
Are you sure?

548
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:26,388
I’ll walk you out.

549
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,813
I’ll be back.

550
00:26:27,813 --> 00:26:28,856
You sure?

551
00:26:29,148 --> 00:26:30,274
Hi, Pres!

552
00:26:33,694 --> 00:26:35,722
Hey, aren’t you guys gonna look around?

553
00:26:35,747 --> 00:26:37,207
Let’s go check out the booths.

554
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,408
- Yeah, let’s make the most of it.
- Let’s go.

555
00:26:39,408 --> 00:26:42,136
Hey, I just got back and
you’re already leaving?

556
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:43,245
I’ll stay here.

557
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:45,205
Okay, I’ll stay with
you. You guys go ahead.

558
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:45,747
- Okay.
- Okay.

559
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:47,057
Take care of these, okay?

560
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:48,934
- Let’s go.
- You guys can have those.

561
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,478
There’s still a lot left in that, see?

562
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:56,049
Sorry, excuse me.

563
00:26:57,229 --> 00:26:58,605
Wow, the kid’s got some attitude.

564
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,006
Come on, don’t argue with a kid.

565
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:01,213
Your brother just left.

566
00:27:01,972 --> 00:27:03,017
Come on, let’s go.

567
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,770
You want a stuffed
toy? I’ll win one for you.

568
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,813
No, Kino.

569
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:10,689
Hi, sir! Want to play?

570
00:27:10,689 --> 00:27:12,149
It’s just a waste of money, Kino.

571
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:13,692
No, I’m good at this.

572
00:27:13,692 --> 00:27:16,069
I’m a real sharpshooter, I
can knock them all down.

573
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:18,780
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

574
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,491
It’s embarrassing.

575
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:22,701
Let’s go, someone else wants to play.

576
00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:26,246
You guys want to go first?
You might run out of stuffed toys.

577
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:27,848
No, please, go ahead.

578
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:29,249
All right, if you say so.

579
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,726
Here.

580
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:31,853
Just fifty, boss.

581
00:27:32,503 --> 00:27:33,253
Here you go.

582
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:34,254
Hold on to it for now.

583
00:27:34,254 --> 00:27:35,392
Just in case.

584
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:45,641
That’s the first—

585
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:46,721
That was just the first shot.

586
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:52,940
Do you know how to play, sir?

587
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:55,067
I’ve still got two, see?

588
00:27:57,894 --> 00:28:00,521
Dude’s missing everything, huh?

589
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:06,745
Yeah, he can’t shoot to save his life.

590
00:28:06,912 --> 00:28:07,996
That’s enough. Come on.

591
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,424
- Such a waste of money—
- This thing’s rigged.

592
00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:12,209
See? The bullets are too soft.

593
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:13,085
This is a scam.

594
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:15,128
What scam? There’s no cheating here.

595
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:16,755
Plenty of people
already won prizes earlier.

596
00:28:17,047 --> 00:28:18,215
You just don’t know how to aim.

597
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:22,261
No, one more. One more.

598
00:28:22,427 --> 00:28:24,846
I know what adjustment to make this time—

599
00:28:24,846 --> 00:28:26,265
I can see it now. It’s all about the angle.

600
00:28:26,265 --> 00:28:27,324
See?

601
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:28,642
- Watch this.
- This is your last one, okay?

602
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:39,528
You’ve got no aim.

603
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:42,322
You know, the scope on this thing’s
kinda crooked. This game’s rigged.

604
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:43,991
You wanna give it a try, man?

605
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:46,344
- Go ahead.
- But it’s tough, you know.

606
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:48,912
It’s kinda off, the scope’s a bit tilted.

607
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:50,205
Lim, you have cash?

608
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:51,540
Yeah, here.

609
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:54,084
- Okay.
- Thanks, Lim.

610
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:55,586
- Go ahead.
- I’m telling you, that thing’s rigged.

611
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:57,754
The gun’s crooked, and the sight—

612
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:58,463
Crooked gun?

613
00:28:58,463 --> 00:28:59,214
Yeah.

614
00:28:59,214 --> 00:29:01,133
You’ll just waste your money, man.

615
00:29:01,804 --> 00:29:03,181
I’m warning you.

616
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:09,975
Wow.

617
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:17,816
Awesome.

618
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:25,991
That’s amazing.

619
00:29:27,993 --> 00:29:29,428
Told you.

620
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:30,871
You just don’t know how to shoot.

621
00:29:31,163 --> 00:29:32,706
Congratulations, sir.

622
00:29:33,665 --> 00:29:35,292
- Maybe—
- That’s huge.

623
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:39,588
What am I supposed to do with this?

624
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:41,423
I don’t know, maybe you can cuddle with it.

625
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:43,392
No, one more try.

626
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:45,643
- I’m not giving up.
- Lim, you get it. You paid for it.

627
00:29:46,177 --> 00:29:47,529
I don’t have a use for it.

628
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:48,388
Let me try first!

629
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:49,598
Give it to KJ.

630
00:29:50,015 --> 00:29:50,932
Hold on, I’ll try it out.

631
00:29:50,932 --> 00:29:54,770
All right, big bro’s got
a gift for you, little man.

632
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,104
- Adjust it a bit—
- I kno—

633
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:57,230
I got this. Watch me.

634
00:29:57,983 --> 00:29:59,276
I’m outta here, man.

635
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:01,360
Maybe tilt it like five degrees.

636
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:02,697
Such a killjoy.

637
00:30:13,997 --> 00:30:15,499
- See?
- There!

638
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:16,750
It wasn’t crooked.

639
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,252
Maybe you’re just lucky today, huh?

640
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:21,546
Congrats, ma’am. Here’s your prize too.

641
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:24,066
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

642
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:24,800
It’s cute.

643
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,193
It’s too small. Not good enough—

644
00:30:26,218 --> 00:30:28,887
I’ll win you a bigger one. About this big.

645
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:29,988
Leave it to me.

646
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:30,931
- That’s enough, Kino. Stop it!
- Don’t forget my change.

647
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:32,307
- I said stop!
- No, no. I got this.

648
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:35,102
So when we go home, it’ll
be bigger than the one he won.

649
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:36,133
This is embarrassing.

650
00:30:36,158 --> 00:30:37,396
It’s fine, don’t worry.

651
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:38,313
- I’m telling you—
- Others might still want to play.

652
00:30:38,313 --> 00:30:39,356
Hey, guys!

653
00:30:39,523 --> 00:30:41,733
Hi, guys! Have you seen Sevi?

654
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:42,846
No.

655
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:46,081
A penguin! That’s so cute!

656
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:48,191
You want it? You can have it.

657
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,575
There’s no need, but thank you.

658
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:51,868
Hey, you can take this one too.

659
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:54,037
Oh, wow!

660
00:30:55,455 --> 00:30:56,748
- Thank you!
- Sam?

661
00:30:56,748 --> 00:30:59,668
Sevi’s at the back, maybe
we can go see him later.

662
00:30:59,668 --> 00:31:01,294
Huh? Okay.

663
00:31:02,754 --> 00:31:04,172
Working hard, Pres.

664
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,794
Hello,  I—

665
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:09,720
Are you looking for your brother?

666
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,721
Actually I was with him a while ago—

667
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:11,810
I know.

668
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:13,515
I saw.

669
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:15,784
Nice.

670
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:16,560
Yeah.

671
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,228
By the way, I’ll go ahead.

672
00:31:19,062 --> 00:31:19,980
Okay.

673
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,130
Take care.

674
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:22,691
Keep it up, Pres.

675
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:24,856
Thank you.

676
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:26,278
Kino, don’t do that—

677
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:28,113
You’re cheating, that’s too long—

678
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:29,423
Sam, shall we go?

679
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:30,115
- Okay.
- It’s right by the red table.

680
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:31,255
Here!

681
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,327
We’ll go ahead. Bye!

682
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:36,288
- Bye, Sam. Take care.
- Via!

683
00:31:36,913 --> 00:31:37,497
We’ll go ahead.

684
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:38,039
See you around.

685
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:38,790
- Bye, guys!
- Bye, Pres!

686
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,583
Still nothing?

687
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:40,763
What the heck.

688
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,895
My Via! My Via! My Via!

689
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,397
Come here! Come here!

690
00:31:45,422 --> 00:31:47,132
- Kino, wait a sec.
- Aren’t you gonna get karma for this, man?

691
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:49,926
We’re selling some over there.
Just buy one instead.

692
00:31:53,972 --> 00:31:55,282
So you really have a crush on Pres?

693
00:31:55,307 --> 00:31:56,395
Huh?

694
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,520
Pres is just being friendly.

695
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:02,939
Just friendly? You always talk.

696
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:06,401
And he even gave you
that… antiseptic cream?

697
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:07,497
Am I right?

698
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:11,999
So you do have a crush on him!

699
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:15,489
Crush?

700
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:17,162
Do I really have a crush on Pres?

701
00:32:18,455 --> 00:32:19,708
I don’t know.

702
00:32:19,998 --> 00:32:21,333
It’s just that Pres—

703
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:23,668
He’s kind.

704
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:25,378
Smart.

705
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:27,088
Responsible.

706
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:28,591
And—

707
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:32,260
I think he’s good-looking, too.

708
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:34,821
You’ve got so many adjectives for him.

709
00:32:34,846 --> 00:32:36,014
That’s how you describe a crush!

710
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:38,141
Do I have a crush on him?

711
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:39,476
- Is that how it works?
- Yes!

712
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:41,536
Yeah, that’s how it works.

713
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:43,688
You notice so many good qualities in him.

714
00:32:43,688 --> 00:32:45,190
That means you have a crush on him.

715
00:32:48,944 --> 00:32:51,196
Does that mean I also have a crush on Kino?

716
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,157
I admire a lot of things about him too.

717
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:56,117
Probably not.

718
00:32:56,701 --> 00:32:58,078
They’re different.

719
00:32:58,453 --> 00:33:00,747
Kino’s my friend, so that’s why.

720
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:05,644
Via!

721
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:06,670
I won one for you..

722
00:33:07,379 --> 00:33:08,544
Here.

723
00:33:10,757 --> 00:33:12,259
Wow!

724
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,845
Congratulations, you finally won.

725
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:16,012
Of course.

726
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:17,806
Thank you, you’re really good.

727
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:20,684
How much did you spend?
You used up all your allowance, huh?

728
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,271
There’s a little left.

729
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:28,900
Wow! So cute!

730
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,361
- Luna, look! I won this earlier.
- That one’s cuter!

731
00:33:31,736 --> 00:33:33,572
I think this is all they had left.

732
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:36,157
By the way, Papa replied.

733
00:33:36,157 --> 00:33:37,284
Yeah?

734
00:33:37,284 --> 00:33:39,119
He said you can sleep
over at our house later.

735
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:42,539
Let’s go!

736
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,165
You haven’t been here in a while.

737
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,183
Is Auntie there?

738
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:47,335
Yup.

739
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:49,979
Hi, Ma.

740
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:51,298
- Here's Via.
- Via?

741
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:53,008
- Hi, Auntie!
- Good thing you made it.

742
00:33:53,008 --> 00:33:53,925
How are you?

743
00:33:53,925 --> 00:33:55,902
You never visit anymore.

744
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:57,279
How are you? How have you been?

745
00:33:57,304 --> 00:33:58,572
Are you doing all right?

746
00:33:58,597 --> 00:34:01,766
Ma, we just got here. You’re asking a lot.

747
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,602
- I’ve been doing okay.
- It’s been so long—

748
00:34:03,602 --> 00:34:05,645
It’s been so long since I’ve seen Via.

749
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:09,107
I’ve been fine, just got
really busy with school

750
00:34:09,107 --> 00:34:11,682
and I’ve been taking
care of Ysha and Mira too.

751
00:34:12,193 --> 00:34:13,503
How are your siblings doing?

752
00:34:13,528 --> 00:34:14,571
I’ll take you all shopping.

753
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:15,799
What?

754
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:17,841
Oh no, Auntie. There's no need.

755
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,909
It’s just a reward.

756
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:21,094
I’m sure you’ve been studying hard.

757
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,746
Let me do this.
I don’t get to do it often.

758
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:24,822
Thank you.

759
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:26,875
Via! Oh, you’re here.

760
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,168
How’s your Papa?

761
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,150
He’s fine, Uncle.

762
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,631
He just got accepted at a new company.

763
00:34:32,815 --> 00:34:33,673
- Oh wow.
- Wow.

764
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:35,108
That’s amazing.

765
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:37,260
How’s school? Especially this one here.

766
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:40,764
Is he still studying?

767
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,432
He’s always coming home late.

768
00:34:43,187 --> 00:34:45,440
He’s just been really busy
with Music Club, Auntie.

769
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:48,037
And he’s also the photographer
for our school paper.

770
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:51,316
Kino’s been really hardworking.

771
00:34:51,816 --> 00:34:52,651
Is that so?

772
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,627
Yes, Pa.

773
00:34:53,652 --> 00:34:55,779
That’s good, that’s good. I’m proud of you.

774
00:34:55,779 --> 00:34:56,780
- Thank you, Pa.
- Good job, son.

775
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:59,541
- Just enjoy your high school life. Okay?
- Yes.

776
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,034
Are you hungry? Let’s eat.

777
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:01,843
Let’s go.

778
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:02,369
Okay.

779
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:03,470
Are you hungry now?

780
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:04,996
A bit. I’m sure you’re hungry.

781
00:35:04,996 --> 00:35:05,626
You’ve been saying
you’re hungry for a while now.

782
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,014
I cooked your favorite.

783
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,040
- You’re really good at—
- The kare-kare.

784
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,125
- Of course.
- But there’s no banana blossom.

785
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,961
We only have bok choy.

786
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:20,345
Make sure the door’s closed, okay?

787
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,747
And check the windows
too, make sure they’re locked.

788
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:28,411
Mira, ask Papa if he turned off the gas.

789
00:35:28,436 --> 00:35:30,605
It might still be open.

790
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:34,693
And don’t watch TV anymore, all right?

791
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,029
Go to sleep but say your prayers first.

792
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:40,615
Okay then. Good night. Love you!

793
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:55,630
Does your wound still hurt?

794
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,673
Huh?

795
00:35:56,673 --> 00:35:58,174
Wait, I’ll get you some medicine.

796
00:35:58,174 --> 00:35:59,275
No, it’s fine.

797
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:01,455
It doesn’t really hurt anymore.

798
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:04,065
I’m just putting this
cream so it heals faster.

799
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:06,299
Okay.

800
00:36:14,315 --> 00:36:17,043
You didn’t have to. Thank you, Pres.

801
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:18,111
It’s nothing.

802
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:20,780
You notice so many good qualities in him.

803
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:22,799
That means you have a crush on him.

804
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:33,768
Oh no.

805
00:36:33,793 --> 00:36:35,545
What’s got you smiling like that?

806
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:36,921
What’s going on?

807
00:36:39,716 --> 00:36:41,468
Why are you smiling?

808
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:43,636
What is it?

809
00:36:52,604 --> 00:36:53,635
Kino…

810
00:36:54,064 --> 00:36:54,956
Yes?

811
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:56,733
I think I have a crush.

812
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,350
A crush, huh? You’ve really grown up.

813
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,362
You’ve got a crush now.

814
00:37:01,362 --> 00:37:02,447
Oh, come on.

815
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:03,948
So who’s your crush? Tell me.

816
00:37:03,948 --> 00:37:04,749
Who is it?

817
00:37:04,774 --> 00:37:05,901
Who’s your crush?

818
00:37:11,164 --> 00:37:12,499
It’s Pres.

819
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:14,487
Pres?

820
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:15,668
The President?

821
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:16,878
Acel?

822
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:18,323
Chevy?

823
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:22,008
So it’s Pres you like.

824
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,510
So, let’s make a love team for you two.

825
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,720
Like, Via-Vy.

826
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:27,924
Or Via-Chevy. How’s that?

827
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:29,991
What are you talking about?

828
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:33,578
It’s not… it’s not that serious.

829
00:37:33,603 --> 00:37:34,687
Well…

830
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:39,031
A happy crush?

831
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:41,111
A happy crush?

832
00:37:43,238 --> 00:37:44,989
So that’s your type, huh?

833
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:50,370
Smart, responsible, leader types.

834
00:37:52,747 --> 00:37:54,999
Not really.

835
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:56,876
Also…

836
00:37:59,254 --> 00:38:01,756
Pres is handsome, isn’t he?

837
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:03,842
Yeah, he is.

838
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:07,387
So, what’s your plan?

839
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,124
Huh?

840
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:11,224
- What’s the plan?
- Plan?

841
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:12,534
With what?

842
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:14,310
You want me to help you?

843
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:18,064
I can get close to Pres
first, then once we’re friends,

844
00:38:18,064 --> 00:38:20,024
it’ll be easier for you two to get close.

845
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:22,360
See? Great idea, right?

846
00:38:22,507 --> 00:38:23,878
Well?

847
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:25,321
That’s not necessary.

848
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:30,618
You know…

849
00:38:32,912 --> 00:38:33,872
I just thought of something.

850
00:38:35,248 --> 00:38:36,288
What if...

851
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:39,002
we don’t hang out too much at school?

852
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:42,519
That way, you’ll have a better
chance to get close to Pres.

853
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,842
He might think that I’m your boyfriend.

854
00:38:45,842 --> 00:38:47,124
That’d be a waste.

855
00:38:49,345 --> 00:38:50,822
Why are you laughing?

856
00:38:50,847 --> 00:38:52,740
You’re such a joker!

857
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:55,710
Why would he think you’re my boyfriend?

858
00:38:57,618 --> 00:38:59,329
Who said I’m joking? I’m serious.

859
00:38:59,856 --> 00:39:02,442
Besides, maybe that’s for the best.

860
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:04,534
For you. For your crush.

861
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:11,951
I don’t think Kino really
means what he’s saying.

862
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:14,204
Hmm...

863
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:15,955
Suit yourself.

864
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:19,286
If you think that’ll make things better.

865
00:39:28,593 --> 00:39:29,874
I’m sleepy, Via.

866
00:39:31,054 --> 00:39:32,179
Good night, Via.

867
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:36,250
You’re already sleepy?

868
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,645
So soon?

869
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:43,452
Good night, Kino.

870
00:40:06,923 --> 00:40:09,234
Let me see your homework first.

871
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:10,351
Here, Via.

872
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:12,234
Here, Via. I’m done.

873
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:15,515
Wow, very good!

874
00:40:16,538 --> 00:40:18,184
Very good!

875
00:40:18,184 --> 00:40:21,020
Here, these are gifts from Aunt Allie.

876
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,197
Because you both did a
great job on your homework.

877
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:24,207
Wow! Look, Mira!

878
00:40:24,232 --> 00:40:25,166
Thank you, Via!

879
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:26,491
- It’s so pretty.
- So pretty!

880
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:27,668
- Thank you, Via.
- You like it?

881
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:29,529
Okay, go play with it in your room,

882
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:30,780
but don’t be too noisy or—

883
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,366
you might wake Aidan up.

884
00:40:33,616 --> 00:40:34,742
Come on, Ysha!

885
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:46,062
Hello, Pa?

886
00:40:46,087 --> 00:40:47,257
Hello?

887
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:48,398
Hello?

888
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:49,773
Hello?

889
00:40:50,588 --> 00:40:51,796
Who’s this?

890
00:40:52,376 --> 00:40:53,418
Where’s Pa?

891
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,449
Are you Ranil’s daughter?

892
00:40:55,638 --> 00:40:57,890
We’re in front of your house.

893
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,017
Your dad’s drunk.

894
00:40:59,017 --> 00:41:00,124
Huh?

895
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:01,859
Wait, just a second.

896
00:41:06,941 --> 00:41:07,625
Pa?

897
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,813
Pa.

898
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:10,340
Pa? Pa.

899
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:12,755
- Come in, please.
- Careful. Be careful.

900
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,506
Pa?

901
00:41:13,531 --> 00:41:14,574
Step inside, please.

902
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:16,075
There you go.

903
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:18,077
Hey, hey, hey.

904
00:41:20,288 --> 00:41:21,205
Sevi?

905
00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:22,248
Via? What are you—

906
00:41:23,207 --> 00:41:25,001
He’s your dad?

907
00:41:25,209 --> 00:41:26,060
Via—

908
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:29,689
This is Engineer Camero. He’s
a really, really, really good man.

909
00:41:29,714 --> 00:41:30,882
He’s my boss. My boss.

910
00:41:30,882 --> 00:41:31,899
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

911
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:33,507
You’re praising me too much.

912
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:36,262
Sevi, let’s help him inside

913
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:38,023
so Via doesn’t have a hard time.

914
00:41:38,348 --> 00:41:39,390
Your name’s Via, right?

915
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,516
Yes, sir. Via

916
00:41:40,516 --> 00:41:42,143
Sevi, I’ll take this. This way, sir.

917
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,686
Come in. Inside. Sevi, over here.

918
00:41:43,686 --> 00:41:44,937
Come on in. This way, Sevi.

919
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:47,815
- Via, your dad can really drink.
- Easy, easy.

920
00:41:49,233 --> 00:41:50,151
Quiet down.

921
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:52,362
This way, sir. Careful, you might slip.

922
00:41:52,528 --> 00:41:53,863
- Step here, please.
- Over here.

923
00:41:53,863 --> 00:41:55,343
- Pa, take a step.
- You okay, Dad?

924
00:41:55,698 --> 00:41:56,674
- Pa.
- Okay.

925
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:58,326
You got this. Go ahead.

926
00:41:59,035 --> 00:41:59,869
Dito, Sevi.
Over here, Sevi.

927
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:01,095
Dad, just stay there. I got this.

928
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,257
All right.

929
00:42:02,413 --> 00:42:03,507
There you go. A little more.

930
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,291
Hurry, Pa.

931
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,105
I’m really sorry for the trouble, sir.

932
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,799
Thank you so much for bringing Papa home.

933
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:14,258
Please don’t fire him.

934
00:42:14,717 --> 00:42:19,555
Don’t worry, your dad’s not losing his job.

935
00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:21,641
He’s been a big help to us.

936
00:42:22,058 --> 00:42:25,019
Besides, he’s a good drinking buddy.

937
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,190
Dad’s a drinker too, so it’s fine.

938
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:33,319
How old are you, Via?

939
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:38,825
You seem more mature than my son.

940
00:42:39,942 --> 00:42:43,195
The first thing you thought
about was your dad’s job.

941
00:42:44,222 --> 00:42:45,431
Why me?

942
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:47,291
You’re the childish one here, Dad.

943
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:49,877
You’re the reason Via’s dad got drunk!

944
00:42:49,877 --> 00:42:54,424
You said whoever finishes the bottle first
wins a house and lot.

945
00:42:54,424 --> 00:42:56,843
- Didn’t you?
- Who knew he’d take it seriously?

946
00:42:56,843 --> 00:43:01,055
Sorry about that. But I don’t have
a house and lot to give right now.

947
00:43:02,515 --> 00:43:04,225
It’s okay, really.

948
00:43:04,225 --> 00:43:07,562
I’m really sorry.
Thank you for making sure he got home safe.

949
00:43:08,104 --> 00:43:09,231
Thanks again.

950
00:43:10,022 --> 00:43:11,983
Sorry about that, Via.

951
00:43:13,276 --> 00:43:14,652
- We’ll go ahead.
- See you, Via.

952
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,995
Tell me if this guy gives
you trouble at school.

953
00:43:19,532 --> 00:43:20,867
You talk too much. Let’s go!

954
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:24,620
Thanks again for bringing Papa home.
Sorry for the trouble.

955
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,413
Take care.

956
00:43:25,413 --> 00:43:27,415
- Sevi, thanks.
- Sure.

957
00:43:28,124 --> 00:43:29,292
- I’ll walk you out.
- I’ll help you, Dad.

958
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:30,935
Here, here.

959
00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:49,729
Pa, I got it, I got it.

960
00:43:49,729 --> 00:43:50,730
Sit down for a bit.

961
00:43:51,397 --> 00:43:52,607
I got it.

962
00:43:58,029 --> 00:43:58,738
Pa.

963
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:05,411
You know,

964
00:44:05,995 --> 00:44:08,039
I’m really lucky to have you.

965
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:13,628
I don’t even know what I did

966
00:44:16,214 --> 00:44:20,593
to deserve such a responsible kid like you.

967
00:44:25,223 --> 00:44:26,487
I’m sorry if

968
00:44:27,725 --> 00:44:33,648
sometimes it feels like you have to do
everything around the house.

969
00:44:35,566 --> 00:44:37,652
That’s supposed to be my job.

970
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:48,496
Are you crying, Pa?

971
00:44:49,038 --> 00:44:50,181
No.

972
00:44:50,206 --> 00:44:51,290
No?

973
00:44:56,379 --> 00:44:57,505
Pa.

974
00:44:59,674 --> 00:45:01,592
We’re family, right?

975
00:45:03,711 --> 00:45:07,173
Who else would help
each other out but family.

976
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:10,101
I’m okay.

977
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:13,896
Thank you, sweetheart.

978
00:45:15,231 --> 00:45:16,232
Thank you, Pa.

979
00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:20,236
Thank you.

980
00:45:22,405 --> 00:45:23,906
So, someone called me, right?

981
00:45:24,115 --> 00:45:26,592
I thought it was Papa,
but it turned out to be someone else.

982
00:45:26,617 --> 00:45:27,727
So, I went outside.

983
00:45:27,952 --> 00:45:31,722
I was so shocked to see Papa
was completely drunk.

984
00:45:31,747 --> 00:45:34,041
It’s the first time I’ve
seen him that drunk.

985
00:45:35,126 --> 00:45:38,337
Anyway, Sevi and his dad were the ones
who brought him home.

986
00:45:39,246 --> 00:45:41,868
Engineer Camero’s actually Papa’s new boss.

987
00:45:43,634 --> 00:45:45,319
I’m just glad he got home safe.

988
00:45:45,344 --> 00:45:46,767
Yeah, me too.

989
00:45:47,346 --> 00:45:51,001
By the way, I might be coming
home late for the next few days.

990
00:45:51,976 --> 00:45:54,937
They said the training for the
national competition will take longer.

991
00:46:07,575 --> 00:46:09,327
Kino’s been awfully quiet.

992
00:46:09,327 --> 00:46:10,870
I wonder if something’s bothering him.

993
00:46:11,412 --> 00:46:12,913
Via,

994
00:46:12,913 --> 00:46:14,832
do you remember what I
told you the other night?

995
00:46:15,374 --> 00:46:16,454
Huh?

996
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:21,088
Maybe it’s better if we don’t
hang out too much at school.

997
00:46:25,134 --> 00:46:27,403
People might think I’m your boyfriend.

998
00:46:27,474 --> 00:46:29,868
It would be a shame if you didn’t
get a chance with your crush.

999
00:46:35,169 --> 00:46:36,837
I’ll go ahead, Via.

1000
00:46:36,978 --> 00:46:38,188
I’ll see you later.

1001
00:46:43,444 --> 00:46:45,237
He was serious about that?

1002
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:54,830
Eat, jerk.

1003
00:46:55,956 --> 00:46:56,999
Tony!

1004
00:47:01,754 --> 00:47:03,339
Are you and Arkin fighting?

1005
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,345
Huh?

1006
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,071
Of course not.

1007
00:47:11,764 --> 00:47:12,932
Hi, Pres.

1008
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:15,768
Hey! How’s it going?

1009
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:18,562
Via wants to know what your food is.

1010
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:22,900
I’m having pasta.

1011
00:47:26,195 --> 00:47:27,462
Enjoy your meal!

1012
00:47:34,161 --> 00:47:35,371
They are fighting.

1013
00:47:36,455 --> 00:47:37,915
We’re not!

1014
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:39,083
Yeah, right.

1015
00:47:57,056 --> 00:47:58,786
Where are you, Kino?

1016
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:01,397
I’ve been waiting here for 30 minutes.

1017
00:48:01,856 --> 00:48:03,733
Are we still going home together,

1018
00:48:03,983 --> 00:48:06,068
or did he already leave?

1019
00:48:09,196 --> 00:48:10,391
Via.

1020
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:12,555
- Pres.
- You’re still here.

1021
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:15,126
Yeah.

1022
00:48:15,244 --> 00:48:17,997
Training ended late today.

1023
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,332
Are you going home?

1024
00:48:22,293 --> 00:48:23,294
Where to?

1025
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:29,008
Just by the jeep terminal.
I’m about to head home too.

1026
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:33,304
I was supposed to drop
by the computer shop, but—

1027
00:48:34,346 --> 00:48:35,723
plans changed.

1028
00:48:35,723 --> 00:48:37,767
me on, I’ll walk you to the terminal.

1029
00:48:38,142 --> 00:48:38,868
Huh?

1030
00:48:38,893 --> 00:48:40,019
I’ll walk you there.

1031
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:41,520
Oh no, Pres, it’s fine.

1032
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,606
You might have to go out of your way.
I’d feel bad.

1033
00:48:43,731 --> 00:48:44,790
It’s fine.

1034
00:48:44,815 --> 00:48:46,317
Come on, I’ll take you.

1035
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:48,611
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

1036
00:48:52,156 --> 00:48:53,407
How was training?

1037
00:48:58,496 --> 00:49:00,598
One more seat left!

1038
00:49:00,623 --> 00:49:01,957
Just one!

1039
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:03,851
I’ll take it!

1040
00:49:03,876 --> 00:49:05,329
- Pres, I’ll go ahead.
- All right, hop in.

1041
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:06,754
Thanks. Take care.

1042
00:49:07,296 --> 00:49:08,407
- Here you go.
- Take care!

1043
00:49:09,507 --> 00:49:10,883
- Your change.
- Thanks.

1044
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:13,202
- Excuse me, please.
- Boss, it’s full.

1045
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:24,313
Okay, the rest of you,
take the other jeep.

1046
00:49:24,814 --> 00:49:26,899
All right, get in, get in!

1047
00:49:33,948 --> 00:49:37,326
Seems like you’ve been hanging
out with your friends a lot lately.

1048
00:49:38,577 --> 00:49:39,995
I always do.

1049
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:45,960
Is something wrong with us, Kino?

1050
00:49:47,211 --> 00:49:48,504
No. Why?

1051
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:51,757
Nothing, really.

1052
00:49:51,757 --> 00:49:55,094
Yesterday, I thought you
were going to wait for me.

1053
00:49:55,928 --> 00:49:58,305
After training.

1054
00:49:58,305 --> 00:49:59,682
Turns out you already went home.

1055
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:04,610
Yeah. I got sleepy,
so I just went home.

1056
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,982
The music club rehearsal
was pretty tiring too.

1057
00:50:07,982 --> 00:50:09,358
I’m sorry.

1058
00:50:09,915 --> 00:50:11,292
It’s all right.

1059
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:12,903
I’ll see you..

1060
00:50:12,903 --> 00:50:14,989
What about your lunch—

1061
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:24,498
He’s taking his plan way too seriously.

1062
00:50:39,517 --> 00:50:41,603
I honestly thought you
and Arkin had a fight.

1063
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,102
What? We didn’t fight.

1064
00:50:45,102 --> 00:50:47,229
Yeah, I was even about to get worried.

1065
00:50:47,229 --> 00:50:49,356
But then I saw you two yesterday,

1066
00:50:49,356 --> 00:50:51,442
he was
waiting for you by the gate.

1067
00:50:52,276 --> 00:50:52,960
Huh?

1068
00:50:52,985 --> 00:50:54,110
Yeah.

1069
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:56,780
He went home early yesterday, didn’t he?

1070
00:50:58,157 --> 00:50:59,158
What are you talking about?

1071
00:50:59,158 --> 00:51:02,161
We literally saw him waiting by the gate,
right, Ke?

1072
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:04,705
Yeah. I even invited
him to go home with us.

1073
00:51:04,705 --> 00:51:07,750
He said he was going to wait for you,
so we just went home.

1074
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:08,918
Exactly.

1075
00:51:12,796 --> 00:51:15,257
You two are totally messing with me.

1076
00:51:15,282 --> 00:51:17,149
Pinky swear! Cross my heart.

1077
00:51:18,344 --> 00:51:19,803
Heart, heart.

1078
00:51:19,803 --> 00:51:22,681
So he didn’t really go home right away?

1079
00:51:24,725 --> 00:51:27,394
Meaning you two didn’t go
home together yesterday?

1080
00:51:27,394 --> 00:51:28,604
You didn’t see him?

1081
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:35,527
Let’s just finish this.
Ma’am might get mad.

1082
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:50,167
Seriously.

1083
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:51,502
I’ll take this off.

1084
00:51:52,294 --> 00:51:53,545
Where did you get that cut?

1085
00:51:53,545 --> 00:51:54,672
Yeah.

1086
00:51:54,672 --> 00:51:56,298
How'd that happen?

1087
00:51:59,969 --> 00:52:02,262
Should I give him his lunch box?

1088
00:52:09,144 --> 00:52:10,162
Luna.

1089
00:52:10,187 --> 00:52:11,647
Luna, can we talk?

1090
00:52:11,897 --> 00:52:12,856
Lance, no.

1091
00:52:12,856 --> 00:52:14,066
- Come on.
- Babe, please?

1092
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:15,609
Lance, I said no.

1093
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:16,443
It’ll just take a minute,
I promise.

1094
00:52:16,443 --> 00:52:17,059
Let’s just talk.

1095
00:52:17,084 --> 00:52:18,501
What did I just say? I said no!

1096
00:52:19,196 --> 00:52:20,322
Lance, what’s your problem?

1097
00:52:20,322 --> 00:52:21,490
Can’t you hear her?

1098
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:22,591
I said no!

1099
00:52:22,616 --> 00:52:23,759
It’ll just be quick!

1100
00:52:23,784 --> 00:52:25,703
Lance, she said she
doesn’t want to talk to you.

1101
00:52:25,703 --> 00:52:26,662
Listen to her.

1102
00:52:26,662 --> 00:52:27,788
Via, you’re so noisy!

1103
00:52:27,788 --> 00:52:29,123
You’re not listening to Luna!

1104
00:52:29,123 --> 00:52:30,457
- She doesn’t want to talk to you!
- I’m not talking to you, okay?

1105
00:52:30,457 --> 00:52:31,500
Leave Luna alone!

1106
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,252
You’re not even the one I’m talking to!

1107
00:52:33,252 --> 00:52:34,586
Lance, stop it!

1108
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:36,630
Hey,

1109
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:37,715
Why do you even have a packed lunch?

1110
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:38,716
What are you, in first grade?

1111
00:52:38,716 --> 00:52:41,376
At least I don’t act like one.

1112
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:42,636
That looks tasty, though.

1113
00:52:42,636 --> 00:52:43,719
Lance.

1114
00:52:44,138 --> 00:52:44,930
Lance, cut it out!

1115
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,157
What the! Make your own!

1116
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:48,142
- Give it to me!
- Lance!

1117
00:52:48,142 --> 00:52:49,518
Give it back!

1118
00:52:51,061 --> 00:52:52,665
Oops, dropped it.

1119
00:52:53,689 --> 00:52:55,821
Looks like you don’t have
a tasty lunch anymore.

1120
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:01,238
- Lance, what’s wrong with you?
- Hey!

1121
00:53:27,222 --> 00:53:28,849
Put that down.

1122
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:27,002
Hey, Arkin, want a ride home?

1123
00:54:28,534 --> 00:54:29,993
No thanks.
I’m waiting for Via.

1124
00:54:30,018 --> 00:54:31,240
She’s almost done anyway.

1125
00:54:31,778 --> 00:54:34,030
She might take a while, but all right.

1126
00:54:35,457 --> 00:54:37,793
- Take care.
- Bye!

1127
00:54:40,921 --> 00:54:43,065
- How was training?
- It was fine, Pres.

1128
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:44,174
Really?

1129
00:54:57,688 --> 00:54:58,709
Let’s go?

1130
00:55:09,508 --> 00:55:11,635
One more seat left!

1131
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,828
Just one!

1132
00:55:13,486 --> 00:55:14,139
Me!

1133
00:55:14,163 --> 00:55:16,321
I wonder if he’s going to bring Via home.

1134
00:55:16,874 --> 00:55:17,875
Thanks.

1135
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:18,897
Sure thing.

1136
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:45,485
I wonder if she got home safely?

1137
00:56:02,586 --> 00:56:04,254
You’re such an idiot, Kino.

1138
00:56:08,091 --> 00:56:09,760
Pres, you want some?

1139
00:56:13,222 --> 00:56:14,640
Hey, let’s drop by Sevi’s place.

1140
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,600
His house is just nearby, right?

1141
00:56:17,726 --> 00:56:18,785
I got you something.

1142
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:19,978
Happy birthday!

1143
00:56:21,813 --> 00:56:23,190
Don’t take it off, okay?

1144
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,442
Why is it AA?

1145
00:56:25,442 --> 00:56:27,861
So, if the guy best
friend got a girlfriend...

1146
00:56:27,861 --> 00:56:29,821
What happens then?

1147
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:33,450
Of course, he’d rather be with
his girlfriend than his friends.

1148
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,577
Are you being honest,
or are you still lying?

1149
00:56:42,424 --> 00:56:45,837
You’ve really changed
since you’ve gotten older.

1150
00:56:45,837 --> 00:56:46,846
So have you.

1151
00:56:49,675 --> 00:56:50,968
Via.

1152
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:54,346
I’ll just be right here, okay?
