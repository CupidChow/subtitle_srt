1
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:29,938
I am sure people
would love her even more

2
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:33,024
if they saw how good
her heart is every day.

3
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,859
But why are you jealous, huh?

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,736
Are you jealous of Clea?

5
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:37,696
No.

6
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:39,531
No, not at all.

7
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:42,909
It doesn’t really matter to me
how you define our relationship.

8
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:46,997
Ladies and gentlemen.
Let’s welcome!

9
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:50,291
Larkin, are you already
courting Clea?

10
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,086
No, not yet. Nothing like that.

11
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,422
Kino’s management
even had him delete

12
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,174
the pictures of us together
from his social media.

13
00:00:58,174 --> 00:00:59,718
Really?

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,303
Oh, yeah.

15
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:05,348
I think Arkin is just
looking out for you, too.

16
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:09,182
About what happened
earlier with Clea,

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,813
that was management’s order.

18
00:01:11,813 --> 00:01:15,191
I understand, and you’re right.

19
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:17,027
You are single, right?

20
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:18,486
Kino, you know what?

21
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:20,822
I want to keep you
all to myself,

22
00:01:20,822 --> 00:01:22,240
away from your fangirls.

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,328
I’m sorry.

24
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:34,252
- He doesn’t know how to kiss.
- What?

25
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:35,211
- He doesn’t know how to kiss.
- Hey!

26
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,847
The fans are going to
get mad, you’re so loud.

27
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:45,430
Surprise!

28
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:48,725
Hi, what’s your name?

29
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,486
Rye.

30
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:52,918
Okay.

31
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:27,907
Okay.

32
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,290
What?

33
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,084
This is cute. It suits you.

34
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,294
You look like a bear.

35
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,588
Luna pushed me to wear it.

36
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,257
I just gave in.
What are you talking about?

37
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,010
It looks good on you, especially
with my face right there.

38
00:03:48,052 --> 00:03:49,971
Let’s just go. I’m hungry.

39
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:52,223
What do you want
to eat? I’ll cook.

40
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:54,475
Really?

41
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:04,194
Your phone’s ringing.
Answer it.

42
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:05,486
Okay.

43
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,531
Yo, Madam.

44
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,325
Hey, where are you?

45
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:12,952
I’m at the Italian restaurant
we went to last time.

46
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,830
I’m with Director Salvino.
Remember him?

47
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,374
The one whose film got
nominated at Cannes?

48
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:21,419
You should stop by so I can
briefly introduce you to him.

49
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,422
And you can also get your
jacket from me while you’re at it.

50
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:27,713
Sure, I’ll swing by.

51
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,553
I’m with someone, though,
so I can’t stay long.

52
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:32,939
- See you!
- Okay. See you.

53
00:04:38,984 --> 00:04:40,299
I’ll just make a quick stop.

54
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:02,899
Hi.

55
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:04,796
Hey, someone might see us.

56
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:05,797
Of course, I already checked.

57
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:07,006
There’s no one around. Okay?

58
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,176
Sorry, it took a while.

59
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,928
You probably got
bored waiting in the car.

60
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:14,013
Director Salvino
was really chatty.

61
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,974
It’s fine. I just went
to the restroom anyway.

62
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:18,935
So, let’s go. Dinner?

63
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:23,745
Hey!

64
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,430
I forgot to give this back.

65
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,361
Thank you.

66
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:32,532
Wow. She really gets you starstruck.

67
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,200
Clea—

68
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:35,493
I’ll go ahead.

69
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:43,418
You'd better not get caught.

70
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:57,265
So that was Clea.

71
00:05:58,891 --> 00:05:59,892
Wow.

72
00:06:00,852 --> 00:06:01,853
Come on.

73
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,855
Come on, let’s go.

74
00:06:08,484 --> 00:06:09,569
You know,

75
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,529
I got really nervous earlier
with Director Salvino.

76
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:13,281
I felt like he was examining
my whole existence

77
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,449
just by the way he looked at me.

78
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:18,202
Then he said he wants
to get Clea for a project.

79
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:21,914
Clea told me they’re already
talking about including me, too.

80
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,291
I really hope it pushes through.

81
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:26,502
Know what,

82
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,006
that was my first time
seeing Clea in person earlier.

83
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,009
She really is beautiful.

84
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,969
I totally froze when I saw her.

85
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:38,056
Are you sure you never
had a crush on her?

86
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:40,183
Via, come on.

87
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:42,560
My whole life, you’re the only
one I’ve ever had a crush on.

88
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,519
Okay?

89
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,316
By the way, what got into
you and Luna

90
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:50,026
joining my fan club, huh?

91
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,025
Huh?

92
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:57,033
I was just forced.

93
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:58,409
Luna really
pushed me into it.

94
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,912
I just got dragged
along, that’s all.

95
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,374
That girl can be
crazy sometimes.

96
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,168
Sorry, Luna.

97
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:09,629
I know I was the one
who got you involved.

98
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,423
But you know
what’s even crazier?

99
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:13,174
Huh?

100
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:14,467
That larkinsings account.

101
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,179
It keeps uploading my
high school throwback pictures.

102
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:20,598
And they post photos where
I look like an idiot.

103
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:25,103
Oh yeah, I know that one.
Larkinsings.

104
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,733
But I feel like that’s
one of our batchmates.

105
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:31,776
Who do you think it is?

106
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:34,112
I swear, I’m this close
to blocking that account.

107
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:40,535
Let it go. They’re just a fan.

108
00:07:40,535 --> 00:07:43,162
Besides, you were cute
in high school anyway.

109
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,778
I was cute in high school?

110
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,207
Then why did you reject me?

111
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:52,205
Here he goes again, so dramatic.

112
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:53,464
Look at us.

113
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:56,801
We’re together now.
Aren’t we a couple?

114
00:07:57,885 --> 00:08:00,972
- Okay.
- Okay.

115
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:05,520
By the way.

116
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:08,788
By the way, how do you think
we should tell Papa

117
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:10,231
that we’re together?

118
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:13,693
I’m kind of nervous
about how he’ll react.

119
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:15,570
Do you want me to tell him?

120
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,088
No.

121
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:19,157
I want us to tell him together.

122
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,950
What about Luna
and the others?

123
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,493
How do we tell them?

124
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:24,322
Don’t they know already?

125
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:28,666
We haven’t officially
told them yet.

126
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:32,170
With all our flirting,
they still haven’t noticed?

127
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,129
Jeez.

128
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:38,593
Wait a minute.

129
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,555
I’ll just answer it.

130
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:49,270
Yes, Sir Matt?

131
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,189
Yes.

132
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,649
Tomorrow. I’ll pick Clea up.

133
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:55,443
Lunch time?

134
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,197
Okay, got it. All right.

135
00:08:59,197 --> 00:09:00,364
Yes. Thank you.

136
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:10,124
Via, so tomorrow—

137
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,961
I need to have lunch
with Clea for publicity.

138
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,176
And I might also
be busy this week

139
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:23,930
because of tapings and
promoting my single.

140
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,796
Sorry, Via.

141
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:27,573
We might not be
able to see each other.

142
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,856
It’s okay.

143
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,651
I also have a lot to take care
of at school anyway.

144
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:40,321
But when our
schedules line up,

145
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:41,906
we’ll see each other, okay?

146
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:44,333
Okay.

147
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:45,974
Alright.

148
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:54,230
Rising actor Larkin
Sanchez’s debut single snags

149
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:57,296
the No. 1 spot on the
Philippine music chart.

150
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:02,593
This is your fault, Larkin Sanchez.
I’m gonna cry.

151
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:04,470
Your song is making me relapse.

152
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,294
The song, written by
half of the

153
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:10,142
ArClea love team, first gained
traction on social media.

154
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:14,522
To date, the song “Golden Scenery”
has reached 5.9 million streams.

155
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,441
This song speaks of a love confession
to one’s best friend.

156
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:20,236
And the whole country can relate.

157
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,493
Via, do you have any
funny photos of Arkin?

158
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:31,076
I want to post one on my
stan account, for clout.

159
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:32,811
Or I could sell it too.

160
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:34,911
Hey, Luna, did you know—

161
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:39,922
Kino got really irritated by
that larkinsings account.

162
00:10:39,922 --> 00:10:41,757
He says he’s this
close to blocking it.

163
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:46,220
You might end up getting
reported to his manager.

164
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,097
I don’t really care.

165
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,368
I’m going to buy some fishballs.
Want some?

166
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:53,811
- I’m good.
- All right.

167
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:54,312
I’ll follow.

168
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:55,380
- Okay.
- Yeah.

169
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:05,740
Hey, Via!

170
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,285
We’re partners
for the project, right?

171
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:10,620
Want to talk about it?

172
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,297
Sure.

173
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,503
You’re looking at pictures
of Larkin and Clea.

174
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,505
Are you a fan too?

175
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:27,553
Kind of. Just a bit.

176
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:29,764
You know,

177
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,933
I’m not really
into Larkin for Clea.

178
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:35,603
She’s too good for him.

179
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:37,945
What did you say?

180
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,776
I mean,

181
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:44,445
why not?

182
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:48,074
Larkin seems okay,
don’t you think?

183
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:52,286
I feel like that Larkin guy
isn’t serious about Clea.

184
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:56,499
How can you say that?

185
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,388
What, does he look
like a cheater to you?

186
00:11:58,918 --> 00:11:59,794
You should look in the mirror,

187
00:11:59,794 --> 00:12:01,671
you look more like
a cheater than he does.

188
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:04,590
Wow, this Larkin stan
is intense.

189
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,050
I’ve been a Clea fan
for a long time.

190
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,096
I know they wouldn’t do that
unless they needed publicity.

191
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,223
They need publicity,
that’s all it is.

192
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:13,891
that’s why
they’re doing it.

193
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:18,479
I even feel like Larkin
has another girlfriend.

194
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:20,940
Probably non-showbiz.

195
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:30,700
Non-showbiz?

196
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:36,122
No way Larkin has
a non-showbiz girlfriend.

197
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:39,417
It’s Clea. Clea is
his girlfriend, okay?

198
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:41,669
Non-showbiz? Nonsense!

199
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:44,296
With his looks,
it’s impossible he’s single.

200
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:49,051
Or maybe he left
his old girlfriend for Clea.

201
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:54,265
I’ve been a Larkin fan
for a long time, okay?

202
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:55,224
Of Larkin.

203
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:57,101
A very long time. Look, look.

204
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:58,894
There. See?

205
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:01,188
I know his face really well.

206
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:02,189
That smile right there?

207
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:04,150
That’s his smile
when he’s in love.

208
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,944
The smile of a guy without
a non-showbiz girlfriend, okay?

209
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,029
All right,

210
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,240
whatever you say.

211
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:14,535
The project, let’s get
back to the project.

212
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:15,870
- Oh right. Okay.
- Seriously…

213
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:19,290
It’s so hot.

214
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,168
What are we going to do?

215
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:29,091
Just five more scenes
and I can finally sleep.

216
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,470
He looks so exhausted.

217
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,556
I should post a sweet message
using my stan account.

218
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,892
He won’t even know.

219
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:47,193
Good luck at the shoot,
baby @larkinsanchez.

220
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:52,198
Don’t forget to drink water!

221
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,164
Wow, being sweet
is actually awkward.

222
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:02,541
Even if I know Arkin
won’t know it’s me

223
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,587
and probably won’t notice,
it’s still embarrassing.

224
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:15,846
I think you
were hacked, Via.

225
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:16,514
WTF HAHAHA
I WANNA HAVE MY OWN BABY TOO.

226
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,690
Arkin, just admit it.
You posted it, right?

227
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:19,879
Wow, Via, you revived

228
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:20,993
- How to unsee?
- your account just for this?

229
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:23,020
- Jerks, I didn’t post that.
- So sweet.

230
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:24,550
Shit!

231
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:26,190
Shit, shit!

232
00:14:29,652 --> 00:14:30,736
Delete, delete—

233
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,872
Delete!

234
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,575
Okay.

235
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:50,673
Hydrating myself because
my girlfriend told me to.

236
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,427
This is so embarrassing!

237
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,519
So embarrassing!

238
00:15:05,646 --> 00:15:08,649
Baby, be careful
at the shoot today!

239
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,734
Don’t forget
to drink water!

240
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,446
Can you all
stop already!

241
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,576
This baby can’t take a joke.

242
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,999
Don’t worry. We’ve known
you two were together for a long time.

243
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,086
Only you guys didn’t know.

244
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,099
Must be nice.
Because of that,

245
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:44,685
I’m gonna drink a lot
at Sam’s party this weekend.

246
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:46,520
Hey, make sure
you guys come.

247
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,732
Yeah, we’ll go
with you. Don’t worry.

248
00:15:58,866 --> 00:16:01,952
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

249
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,830
Hi, guys! What’s up?

250
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,040
Hey, thanks for the invite!

251
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,626
Sam, you said it
was just a small party,

252
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:10,961
but it looks like
you invited everyone.

253
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:12,963
Luna, it’s a fundraising party,

254
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:15,424
so I gotta invite
as many as I can.

255
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,593
By the way, where’s Ke?

256
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,762
Oh, I already messaged her.
She said she’s on her way.

257
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:22,473
Hey, I also invited Theo, okay.

258
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:24,350
Careful, he might cry.

259
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,351
Hold on, guys.

260
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:34,068
He’s not here, Luna.
Stop looking around.

261
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:35,986
Huh?

262
00:16:35,986 --> 00:16:37,821
I’m not looking around.

263
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:40,741
And where’s your baby anyway?

264
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:42,326
She doesn’t drink.

265
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,164
Via, where’s Arkin?

266
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:48,958
Is he allowed here?

267
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,793
This place might be
too crowded for him.

268
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:55,005
Huh? He said it’s okay,
so he said he’ll come later.

269
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:56,423
- What about Yanna?
- Okay.

270
00:16:58,092 --> 00:16:59,343
She’s with Avi right now,

271
00:16:59,343 --> 00:17:00,678
so she can’t come.

272
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:04,890
Drink some more!

273
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:06,850
Wait, I’ll just get a drink.

274
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,310
What? We already
have bottles here,

275
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,645
and you’re still
getting another drink?

276
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:10,813
This one’s too strong.

277
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:13,357
It’s okay.
Just order over there.

278
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:14,733
- It’s on me, okay?
- I’ll be back.

279
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,736
Cheers.

280
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,405
You guys are trying
to get me drunk.

281
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,864
It’s not funny anymore.

282
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:26,801
- I heard
- Excuse me,

283
00:17:26,826 --> 00:17:28,966
- he’s coming, Clea.
- one strawberry margarita, please.

284
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:29,999
Thank you.

285
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:35,045
Do I look okay?

286
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:39,049
Girl, you look stunning.

287
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:42,594
But still, I feel like
I’m running out of charm.

288
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,972
Why can’t he just like me back?

289
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:48,642
Is she talking about Arkin?

290
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,437
Thanks.

291
00:18:04,408 --> 00:18:06,869
Just stop looking for him.

292
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:09,204
He’s not here.
He’s busy.

293
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:11,165
Why do you keep saying
I’m looking for him?

294
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:12,916
I’m not even looking for him.

295
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:15,753
Please, you’re going to get
a stiff neck at this rate.

296
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:18,797
What is wrong with you guys?

297
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:22,593
How am I supposed to move on
if you keep teasing me like this?

298
00:18:22,593 --> 00:18:24,136
You’re all so annoying.

299
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:28,348
Anyway, wait a minute, guys.

300
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,434
Excuse me,
I’ll step outside first.

301
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:31,393
Okay.

302
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:36,315
They’re teasing you
again. It’s okay.

303
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,443
Sam, how am I
supposed to move on?

304
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:40,402
No.

305
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,237
Oh, there’s Kino.

306
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:44,656
Oh, it’s you guys.

307
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,784
Wow, superstar.

308
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:48,535
I missed you.

309
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:49,411
Bro.

310
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:50,913
Are you an idiot, bro?

311
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:52,498
There are so
many people around.

312
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,500
Am I not allowed to sit
next to my girlfriend now?

313
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,834
Use your brain, man.

314
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,670
So, even holding hands
is not allowed?

315
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:01,757
Fine, let’s just hold hands
with each other then.

316
00:19:01,757 --> 00:19:04,593
Hey…

317
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:10,432
Kino, earlier I—

318
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:16,230
I still have somewhere
else to go,

319
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,023
so I might head home already.

320
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:19,775
Let’s go together.
I’ll take you home.

321
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:22,778
No, someone might see us.

322
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,363
It’s fine. We’ll just pass
through the back.

323
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,406
Wait, I’ll just text my driver.

324
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:28,617
- Hey, cheers, cheers!
- Let me finish this first.

325
00:19:28,617 --> 00:19:30,452
Cheers before
you leave. Cheers!

326
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:32,204
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

327
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,288
Arkin!

328
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:34,248
Is this mine?

329
00:19:34,248 --> 00:19:36,208
Yeah. Cheers!

330
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:39,670
Refreshing.

331
00:19:44,508 --> 00:19:45,509
Clea?

332
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,297
Hey.

333
00:19:48,137 --> 00:19:49,429
Dating a fan?

334
00:19:50,097 --> 00:19:51,098
Weird.

335
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:52,474
No—

336
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,475
Wait a minute.

337
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,477
I’ll just meet my driver.

338
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,563
Okay.

339
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,360
I’ll go ahead.

340
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:05,154
Wait.

341
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:07,656
Wear this.

342
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:10,742
Trust me.

343
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:13,203
I’m doing this to protect
everyone involved.

344
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:23,839
Hold on.

345
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:28,574
Here.

346
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:35,142
Thanks.

347
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:37,477
I’ll go ahead.

348
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:04,046
Shit. Good thing she
lent me her jacket.

349
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,466
Hi, Via.

350
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:09,422
Come on.

351
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:11,845
Let’s talk about the project.

352
00:21:13,847 --> 00:21:17,226
Hey, I saw that too.
It really hurt.

353
00:21:17,684 --> 00:21:18,977
My Clea.

354
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,063
But do you think
they’re really dating?

355
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:23,690
I’m still not convinced.

356
00:21:24,691 --> 00:21:27,236
Well, they don’t really need
to convince you anyway.

357
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:29,821
Aren’t you also a Larkin fan?

358
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,783
Are you really okay
with him having a girlfriend?

359
00:21:35,535 --> 00:21:36,730
Of course.

360
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,998
Of course.
As long as he’s happy.

361
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:42,793
I’m okay as long as he’s happy.

362
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:44,044
I’m not like you, okay?

363
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:45,837
Hey, that’s harsh.

364
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,715
I just don’t really like
Larkin because I feel like

365
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:52,177
he’s only sticking
close to Clea to get famous.

366
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,224
All of Clea’s on-screen partners
end up getting popular anyway.

367
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:01,536
Larkin can become
famous on his own,

368
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:04,273
even without Clea.
He can do it on his own.

369
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,526
All right, I won’t argue with
a Larkin stan anymore.

370
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,444
You might punch me next.

371
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,740
About our project, we still need
to talk about the details.

372
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,452
I’ll just buy the materials,
so it’ll be faster.

373
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:18,829
So what is it again?

374
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,914
Do you like strong perfumes?

375
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:29,673
You smell like a guy.

376
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:31,300
So you have a boyfriend, huh?

377
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:35,137
No, I don’t have a boyfriend.

378
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:36,638
I don’t have a boyfriend.

379
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:37,889
Via, are you done?

380
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,891
Yes—

381
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:42,311
Yeah, I’m done.

382
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,833
About the project, just message
me the other details, okay?

383
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:49,067
My friend’s already here.

384
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,987
Wait, Via. What about my hug?

385
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,865
- Via, come on.
- Just message me.

386
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:55,824
Okay, I’m heading out.

387
00:22:56,283 --> 00:22:57,269
Be careful.

388
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,081
Kino, someone might see us.

389
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,714
Kino, Dan was just joking, okay?

390
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:12,883
Friend?

391
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,218
I’m just a friend.

392
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:18,972
I’m sorry. I just haven’t
told him yet

393
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:22,434
that I have a boyfriend,
and he’s really nosy.

394
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,395
It’s better to be careful.
He’s also a Clea fan.

395
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,524
I’m just a friend,
not even a best friend?

396
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,613
Wow, you’re so petty.

397
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:35,915
I’m sorry.

398
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:38,465
Don’t be mad, okay?

399
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,536
Are we good now?

400
00:23:42,162 --> 00:23:44,915
Let’s go. Where should we eat?
Your condo?

401
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,585
I was thinking, your place.

402
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,548
Via, should we tell
Papa already?

403
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,394
Arkin, good thing
you dropped by.

404
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:06,978
We’ve missed eating with you.

405
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:09,481
Pa, I missed
your cooking more.

406
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,440
Seriously.

407
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:14,653
Just come by whenever
you have time, okay?

408
00:24:15,445 --> 00:24:16,738
So how’s taping?

409
00:24:17,531 --> 00:24:19,282
Are you busy?
Got a lot of projects?

410
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,077
A lot, Pa. I’m pretty busy.

411
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:23,370
That’s good.

412
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,080
Take advantage of it
while there’s plenty.

413
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:27,666
By the way, I saw on the news…

414
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,085
Looks like you’re being linked
to your love team partner.

415
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:31,233
Are you two a couple?

416
00:24:38,135 --> 00:24:41,805
Pa, we have
something to tell you.

417
00:24:42,556 --> 00:24:43,557
Well—

418
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,267
Pa, Via and I are together.

419
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:51,148
She’s my girlfriend. Not Clea.

420
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:11,168
Wow. Congratulations.

421
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,544
I knew it.

422
00:25:13,086 --> 00:25:15,172
So are we allowing this, Pa?

423
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,345
Pa, sorry, sorry.
Please don’t get mad.

424
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:24,948
We didn’t mean for it to happen.
It just kind of did.

425
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:27,142
Please don’t be mad.
Forgive me, Pa.

426
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:30,854
Wow, Via, you’re acting
like you lost out here.

427
00:25:32,022 --> 00:25:34,107
Pa, I’m sorry I didn’t
tell you right away.

428
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:37,444
Pa, do you approve
of me and Via?

429
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:41,281
Looks like you still haven’t
moved on from your crush on Via, huh?

430
00:25:42,949 --> 00:25:45,785
Pa, how could I move on
when we’re married?

431
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:47,037
We’re married!

432
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,788
We’re married!

433
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:51,082
Via and I got married.
Too bad you weren’t there.

434
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:51,708
Look, here it is.

435
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,168
Arkin and Via.

436
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,544
Marriage certificate.

437
00:25:54,544 --> 00:25:57,753
And Pa, I did try to move on.

438
00:25:57,778 --> 00:25:59,446
Via was the one
who seduced me.

439
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:00,967
- Kino, what are you saying?
- Ow!

440
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:01,801
That was back in high school.

441
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:03,178
And it was just a
marriage booth, remember?

442
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:04,638
Just a marriage booth.

443
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:06,181
- Via.
- Pa.

444
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,852
You know what’s right
and what’s not, don’t you?

445
00:26:11,732 --> 00:26:13,275
That’s fine with me.

446
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,811
And you, Arkin,
don’t you dare hurt Via.

447
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:17,859
I dare you.

448
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:19,361
Pa, why me?

449
00:26:19,653 --> 00:26:22,030
She’s the one who hurt my
feelings back in high school.

450
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Ouch!

451
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:25,340
See, Pa, she’s hurting me again.

452
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:26,929
Kino!

453
00:26:28,495 --> 00:26:30,288
But Pa, I promise

454
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:33,291
I could never do that to Via.

455
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:39,172
And Pa, since you’ve accepted
me as your son-in-law,

456
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:40,507
I have something for you.

457
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:43,510
Son-in-law?

458
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,890
Dad, alcoholic drink.
This is for you.

459
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:53,395
So you only brought this
because I gave my blessing?

460
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:54,271
If I didn’t give my blessing,

461
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:55,914
you wouldn’t give this to me?

462
00:26:55,939 --> 00:26:56,940
Come on, Pa.

463
00:26:57,524 --> 00:26:59,818
I know you wouldn’t
object anyway because

464
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:02,445
I know you love me too.

465
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:06,825
All right then,
let’s drink this now.

466
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:07,894
Okay.

467
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:10,704
Pa, wait, Kino might have
something to do later

468
00:27:10,704 --> 00:27:11,663
and need to go home.

469
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,540
And I also need to study.

470
00:27:13,748 --> 00:27:14,833
I don’t have
anything planned later.

471
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,710
Oh, so you’re available.

472
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,295
Go study, sweetheart,

473
00:27:18,545 --> 00:27:20,547
and I’ll drink with
your boyfriend.

474
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,009
Boyfriend.

475
00:27:28,388 --> 00:27:29,389
Boyfriend.

476
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,768
Ouch! Pa!

477
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:37,897
This is what you call,
tough love.

478
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:54,247
Hi, Rhythmics!

479
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:55,749
We have a set visit
this weekend

480
00:27:55,749 --> 00:27:58,043
at the shoot of
Arkin’s upcoming series.

481
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,670
Only five slots are left,
so sign up now

482
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,089
if you want to come.
Let’s go!

483
00:28:07,177 --> 00:28:10,263
A set visit? Should I go?

484
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,642
Via, are you
free this weekend?

485
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:16,061
There’s a set visit at
Larkin’s shoot. Let’s go!

486
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,146
Sure, let's go.

487
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:32,160
See you!
I’m so excited!

488
00:28:43,213 --> 00:28:44,756
It’s my first time
going on a set visit.

489
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,134
I’m excited to see how
good Larkin is at acting.

490
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:49,552
How about you, Via?
Are you excited?

491
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:50,345
Honestly, I’m excited too.

492
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:51,763
And I’m excited to
give him his gift.

493
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,265
Guys, the staff will let us
inside so we can watch, okay?

494
00:28:54,891 --> 00:28:57,936
Please behave, especially
when we see Larkin.

495
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,397
No shouting, no noise,

496
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:02,357
especially once
they’re already on set.

497
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,734
Please remain respectful
and make sure

498
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:06,611
we don’t cause
any delay for them.

499
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:09,489
We don’t want to
embarrass Larkin, right?

500
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:11,116
You may go on set now.

501
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:15,412
Thank you.

502
00:29:17,414 --> 00:29:18,748
Let’s go, let’s go.

503
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,427
Out and three, two, one,
boom mic up.

504
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,221
Action!

505
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,061
Wait.

506
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,148
What?

507
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,568
After all these years, looking
stupid waiting for you…

508
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:47,902
And now

509
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:51,114
you come back like you
didn’t completely ruin me?

510
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:52,907
That’s not how it is, Philip!

511
00:29:53,867 --> 00:29:56,327
You don’t understand
what I’ve been through!

512
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:58,455
You don’t understand me.

513
00:29:58,455 --> 00:30:00,206
Then make me understand!

514
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:03,209
He’s such an
amazing actor now.

515
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,253
You ruined me, too, Philip!

516
00:30:05,795 --> 00:30:07,046
I tried so hard to forget you,

517
00:30:07,046 --> 00:30:08,631
but I couldn’t!

518
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:16,639
Wow, Clea’s on another level.

519
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:19,934
How does she
even control her tears?

520
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:26,858
They’re just
so perfect together.

521
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,419
Cut! Very good actors!

522
00:30:48,254 --> 00:30:49,380
Beautiful, beautiful work.

523
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,758
Wow! Clea Aguilar
is really amazing.

524
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:53,593
Are you okay? Huh?

525
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:55,970
You, are you okay?

526
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,283
Rhythmics, you may come in.

527
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:19,289
Thank you.

528
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:22,205
- Arkin, they have something for you.
- Guys—

529
00:31:22,205 --> 00:31:23,581
Hi, hello, hi!

530
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:24,749
- Hi, Larkin! Hello.
- Hello.

531
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,016
Hello.

532
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:27,919
Via, give him our gifts.

533
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:29,062
Okay.

534
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,213
Do you remember her?

535
00:31:30,213 --> 00:31:31,923
She was at the Meet and Greet.

536
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,759
Yes, Rye! R-Y-E, right?

537
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:36,135
He remembers you.

538
00:31:36,135 --> 00:31:37,136
Hi, Rye.

539
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,265
The fandom wanted
to give this to you.

540
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:43,142
- Wow.
- She picked out the chocolates herself.

541
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,811
Here’s more.

542
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:47,121
These are my favorites!

543
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:48,998
- He said those are his favorites.
- You really know me a lot, Rye.

544
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:50,692
- In fairness.
- Here.

545
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,569
Can we take a picture?

546
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:53,444
Sure.

547
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,946
- Let’s go.
- Hurry, there are more people waiting.

548
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:58,992
One, two, three.

549
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:02,245
- Thank you! Thank you.
- Thank you.

550
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:04,414
- What about you, Rye?
- Thanks.

551
00:32:04,414 --> 00:32:05,665
Want to take a picture?

552
00:32:05,915 --> 00:32:07,083
Take a picture with me, come on.

553
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,351
- Me?
- Don’t be shy.

554
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:09,377
No need to be shy.

555
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,754
- Let’s take a picture.
- Please take a picture with me.

556
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:14,549
Come closer.

557
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,602
Bye.

558
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,814
- Oh my gosh!
- I’m sorry!

559
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,733
What the heck!

560
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:33,943
Seriously, we need this
for the next scene.

561
00:32:33,943 --> 00:32:35,069
I’m so sorry.

562
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:36,988
I’m sorry, I didn’t
mean to, I’m sorry.

563
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,908
Who are you and
what are you doing here?

564
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:43,286
Don’t you know how much
you’re disturbing us?

565
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,246
I’m sorry.

566
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:46,789
You guys shouldn’t even
come here on set.

567
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:48,458
You’re driving me crazy!

568
00:32:48,892 --> 00:32:50,101
I’m going nuts.

569
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:51,502
It’s okay, it’s okay.

570
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,795
There’s no need to shout.

571
00:32:52,795 --> 00:32:55,214
I don’t want disrespectful
people in our set.

572
00:32:55,214 --> 00:32:56,841
Sorry. I’ll just ask
the director

573
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,718
if we can do a different
sequence next.

574
00:32:58,718 --> 00:32:59,552
Yes, please, thank you.

575
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,412
Gine, you guys
go out for now.

576
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:04,349
I just want to check on Rye.

577
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,617
Clea, let’s go!

578
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:07,405
- I’ll go with you.
- Go change first.

579
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:09,020
So annoying!

580
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:29,791
So this is how it is here, huh?

581
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,584
There are so many lights.

582
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:34,295
Have some chocolate.

583
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:36,381
You might’ve gotten stressed.

584
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,341
But that’s yours.

585
00:33:38,341 --> 00:33:39,133
Huh?

586
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:39,801
That’s yours.

587
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:40,802
I know.

588
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:42,261
- More.
- Hold it.

589
00:33:42,804 --> 00:33:43,680
Have more.

590
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,228
So many makeup brushes.

591
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,479
Do you use all of
them on yourself?

592
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,821
Yeah, different ones.

593
00:33:52,846 --> 00:33:55,019
One for the eyes,
one for the nose.

594
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:56,651
For contouring, stuff like this.

595
00:33:56,651 --> 00:33:57,752
Contour?

596
00:33:57,777 --> 00:33:59,112
Do you still need that?

597
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:01,614
Yeah, for the camera.

598
00:34:01,614 --> 00:34:04,033
It’ll show. It’s very visible.

599
00:34:08,198 --> 00:34:09,824
- Do you know how to use that?
- Let me just—

600
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,778
Kino, Kino!

601
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,167
What the—!

602
00:34:13,543 --> 00:34:14,544
I missed you.

603
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:18,715
What the heck!
Someone might see us.

604
00:34:18,965 --> 00:34:20,508
And you even made them leave.

605
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:21,718
They might be looking for me.

606
00:34:21,718 --> 00:34:23,052
They might start noticing.

607
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:26,922
I already told them
I’d check on you.

608
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:31,185
So, are you okay?
Sorry about earlier.

609
00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:37,725
You don’t need to
apologize. It’s my fault.

610
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:42,387
But still, you shouldn’t have
been shouted at like that.

611
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,490
I’m annoyed.

612
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,801
You know, I’ll talk to
the staff about that.

613
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,161
Like—

614
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:50,038
- It’s just that—
- No!

615
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:52,040
You’re so hot-headed. Don’t—

616
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,541
Just kiss me then.

617
00:34:56,169 --> 00:34:57,353
There are people outside.

618
00:34:57,378 --> 00:34:58,046
Kiss.

619
00:34:58,087 --> 00:34:59,012
Kiss?

620
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,597
Good thing I said I’d call you.

621
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,668
The director’s looking for you.

622
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:13,385
Thanks, Clea.

623
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:15,271
I’ll step out for now.

624
00:35:15,271 --> 00:35:16,379
I’ll be right back, okay?

625
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:18,274
By the way, Clea—

626
00:35:18,274 --> 00:35:19,442
Go. It’s fine.

627
00:35:19,442 --> 00:35:20,489
Okay.

628
00:35:28,451 --> 00:35:30,078
If you’re gonna come here,

629
00:35:30,078 --> 00:35:32,580
avoid causing trouble, please.

630
00:35:33,456 --> 00:35:35,458
It’s easier to attract
attention that way.

631
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:38,252
And you don’t want
that to happen, right?

632
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:40,838
I’m sorry.

633
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,381
I’m really sorry about earlier.

634
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:43,758
I didn’t mean it.

635
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:45,760
It won’t happen again.

636
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,678
I won’t be visiting the
set again. I’m sorry.

637
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:00,900
Drink some water first.

638
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,319
I know you got nervous.
And change your shirt.

639
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,864
Coffee spilled on you, too.

640
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:12,161
You need to look fine.

641
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,165
If you’re not okay,
then Arkin’s not okay.

642
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,002
Our next scene is
especially important, too.

643
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,217
Thanks.

644
00:36:39,438 --> 00:36:40,523
Ms. Clea?

645
00:36:40,857 --> 00:36:43,234
We’ll be shooting sequence 21 first.

646
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:44,193
Okay, thank you.

647
00:36:44,193 --> 00:36:45,239
Thank you.

648
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:57,056
Wait.

649
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,601
Wear this.

650
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:00,228
Trust me.

651
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:02,605
I’m doing this to protect
everyone involved.

652
00:38:07,777 --> 00:38:08,778
Here.

653
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,531
Thank you.

654
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,581
See, Larkin?
I told you before,

655
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:23,709
you should always let me
know about things like this.

656
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:25,423
You know it’s risky.

657
00:38:26,425 --> 00:38:28,314
I’m sorry, Sir Matt.

658
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,133
Yes, yes. I’ll tell you
everything from now on.

659
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:34,220
I’m sorry, it won’t
happen again.

660
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,347
Just make sure, okay?

661
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,476
Okay, Sir Matt.
Again, I’m really sorry.

662
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:54,490
Clea.

663
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,909
Lei, you go out first.

664
00:38:56,909 --> 00:38:57,576
Okay.

665
00:38:57,576 --> 00:38:58,536
Thank you.

666
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,418
Thanks for lending your jacket.

667
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,420
You saved us there.

668
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:10,673
What are you thinking?

669
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,261
Dating a fan? I mean—

670
00:39:15,511 --> 00:39:16,846
She’s not a fan, Clea.

671
00:39:19,974 --> 00:39:23,519
Via has been my friend
since we were babies.

672
00:39:24,312 --> 00:39:25,813
She’s been with me
through everything.

673
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:27,440
The good times.

674
00:39:30,026 --> 00:39:31,402
The bad times.

675
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,197
Back when I was nothing,

676
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,241
she was the first to support me.

677
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:40,703
Via is…

678
00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:43,998
Via is extremely
important to me.

679
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:46,167
I can’t afford to lose her.

680
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,048
I didn’t know you
could be this cheesy.

681
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:56,302
You really love her, huh?

682
00:40:00,222 --> 00:40:01,599
So much. Really.

683
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,231
I understand, Larkin.

684
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:11,984
But please be extra careful.

685
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,071
You guys are treading
on dangerous waters.

686
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:22,119
Just keep in mind that whatever
you do will affect my career.

687
00:40:39,011 --> 00:40:39,887
Sorry,

688
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,889
you look so cute.

689
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,558
But I’m serious

690
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:46,435
I’m serious

691
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:48,979
Come here.

692
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,911
What is it?

693
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:04,912
I just…

694
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,332
I just wanted to ask
you both something.

695
00:41:10,418 --> 00:41:11,794
How do you do…

696
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:14,046
that?

697
00:41:15,214 --> 00:41:16,215
That?

698
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,051
That… you know.

699
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:20,719
That.

700
00:41:22,304 --> 00:41:23,347
You mean sex?

701
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,204
Huh?

702
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:27,501
How often do you do it?

703
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:30,146
- What about you, Sam?
- And you, Sam?

704
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:32,064
How often do you
and Clyden do it?

705
00:41:32,064 --> 00:41:34,650
We used to do it
around five times a week.

706
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:36,318
- Why so many?
- Five times.

707
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:37,403
That’s a lot.

708
00:41:38,112 --> 00:41:39,113
A lot.

709
00:41:52,835 --> 00:41:53,836
Let’s go, Via.

710
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,421
Who is that, Via?

711
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,881
Let’s go.

712
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,052
Kino, what are you
doing, let go of me!

713
00:42:02,845 --> 00:42:04,096
