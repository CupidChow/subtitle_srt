1
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,262
From now on,
I’ll always pay for your fare.

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,098
As long as we go to school
together every day.

3
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,018
But we already always go
to school together everyday.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,686
Since pre-school even, right?

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,104
Then we should keep it
that way until college.

6
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,897
And when we start working,
we’ll still go together.

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:23,857
No excuses.

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,651
We’ll always be with you, okay?
You can’t be alone.

9
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,277
Why me?

10
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,237
Well, you’re our friend now.
You don’t have a choice.

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,656
Fifty pesos worth
of kwek-kwek, please.

12
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:32,712
Who are you?

13
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,076
And who are you?

14
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,537
Kierra, Luna, Via,

15
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:39,095
and Via’s best friend.

16
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,250
Oh no, Via!

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,418
Via? Are you sure you’re okay?

18
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,711
How many fingers? How many?

19
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:45,879
Ten.

20
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,464
Oh no, she’s dumb now!

21
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,549
Where’s the clinic?

22
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,302
That girl’s just
obsessed with me.

23
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,180
She’s doing everything she can
to ruin what we have.

24
00:00:56,648 --> 00:00:57,962
What’s so funny?

25
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,350
You’ve got some nerve!

26
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,435
I haven’t even
kissed anyone yet!

27
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,644
Here, let me give you
your first kiss then.

28
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,604
- You’re disgusting!
- Luna!

29
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,105
- You’re disgusting!
- Luna, that’s enough!

30
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,899
- Yeah, I said you’re trash.
- Huh?

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,773
- I’m trash?
- Yes!

32
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,600
You fucking bitch!

33
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:36,986
Kino!

34
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,035
Kino, that’s enough!

35
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,207
Kino, don’t do it.

36
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,960
Kino—

37
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,298
- Kino, don’t!
- Bro!

38
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:00,180
What were you thinking?

39
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,556
Do you want to get suspended?

40
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,476
I was just trying to scare him,
I wasn’t really going to do it.

41
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,462
What happened?

42
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,485
All right, I’ll just think that
the jerk who ran off is at fault.

43
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,862
Because it really
was that idiot’s fault!

44
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,030
He's a pig!
Do you even know that?

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,240
He started it, Kino didn’t
do anything wrong.

46
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,453
Are you all okay?

47
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,414
Guys!

48
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,042
Oh my gosh, guys!
I’ve been looking for you.

49
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,793
They’re announcing
the partial results

50
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:34,047
of the election and so far,
we’re currently leading—

51
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,815
What happened to you?

52
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,885
Did something happen?

53
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:41,356
Looks like some
post-election drama, huh?

54
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,143
I think your party’s gonna win.
Congrats in advance.

55
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,355
So, what events are
you guys planning next?

56
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,065
There’s foundation
week next month.

57
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,651
That’s the one with
the yearly pageant, right?

58
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,819
Yeah, Miss Valerian.
You should join that.

59
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,612
Ouch!

60
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,682
Yeah.

61
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,865
So, guys, what
actually happened?

62
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,118
Come on, I’ll tell you.
It’s a long story.

63
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,286
Let’s go.

64
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,207
How are you?

65
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,627
You okay?

66
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,418
Why did you get into a fight?

67
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,587
Look what happened to you.

68
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,123
Does it hurt?

69
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,869
Huh?

70
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,877
Let me see.

71
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,525
Does it hurt?

72
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,475
Why did you have to—

73
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,861
Why did you do that, Kino?

74
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:33,799
What if a teacher caught you?

75
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:36,416
Wait a sec.

76
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,611
I’m good. I’m good.

77
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,073
He hurt you.
So, I’ll hurt him back.

78
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,769
Good thing Sam and Sevi are
nice and didn’t tell on you.

79
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:49,347
When Sam found out
what happened,

80
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,249
even she wanted
to go after that jerk.

81
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:52,747
She wanted to
throw in a punch, too.

82
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,918
Kino!

83
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:57,486
Don’t do it again, okay?
Don’t ever do that again!

84
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,840
You want me to
just stand there

85
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,842
while that jerk had
you by the collar?

86
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,346
If I ever see him at school,
I’ll make sure he regrets it.

87
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:13,093
Still, you shouldn’t do that.

88
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,606
What if you get expelled?

89
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,151
You should look after yourself.

90
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,739
Come on, let me see.

91
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,283
Does it still hurt?

92
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,390
No, it doesn’t.

93
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,227
Huh? You just said it did.

94
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,854
It’s fine now.
It doesn’t hurt anymore.

95
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,557
Thank you.

96
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:57,705
Hey, Via.

97
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,667
Pa!

98
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,693
Pa.

99
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,041
What happened to your lip?

100
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:05,182
Did you get into a fight?

101
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,584
Yes, Pa.

102
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,787
Pa, wait. Aidan’s crying,
hold on—

103
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,707
Why did you get into a fight?

104
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,711
Didn't I tell you and Via
not to start any trouble?

105
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,464
See, it looks like
things got physical.

106
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:23,066
Pa, someone picked
a fight with Via.

107
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,550
I couldn’t hold myself back.

108
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,178
But Via already
scolded me for it.

109
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,932
Still, just don’t do
that again, okay?

110
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:31,974
Yes, Pa.

111
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,936
But thanks for
standing up for my child.

112
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:38,769
Via’s lucky to have you.

113
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:41,549
I’m the lucky one
to have Via, Pa.

114
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:44,690
I would actually
get into a fight for Via.

115
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,072
Arkin!

116
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,588
Sorry, Pa. I was just joking.

117
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,701
And the guy you fought?
Did you beat him up?

118
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:52,065
Good, that’s how it should be.

119
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:53,791
But don’t do it again, okay?

120
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:55,383
Don’t ever do it again.

121
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,975
Jeez.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,001
This is nothing.

123
00:06:59,137 --> 00:07:02,516
His was worse, he had
one here and here too.

124
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,593
I told you guys you’d win. See?

125
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:13,933
Congratulations!

126
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,895
Guys, we need to celebrate!

127
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,816
We’re celebrating!
We’re eating out!

128
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,361
Let’s celebrate
Luna’s freedom, too!

129
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,115
Pres said he’s treating us, right?
You promised!

130
00:07:31,638 --> 00:07:34,011
I’m treating everyone at
Wing Zone. Come on, let’s go!

131
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,872
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

132
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,374
I’ll be right back, okay?

133
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,794
Congratulations!

134
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,795
Hey, Yanna!

135
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,505
We won! We won!

136
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:47,070
Well, congratulations.

137
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:49,013
Hope you don’t end up corrupt.

138
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,072
Hey, you’re joining the
Miss Valerian pageant.

139
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,807
You don’t have a choice
anymore, I signed you up.

140
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:56,757
Go ahead, try me.

141
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,269
You’ll see.

142
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:04,048
You got nothing on her, bro.

143
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:05,991
Dude, I really thought
she was gonna kiss me.

144
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,181
Why were you teasing her?
You’re crazy.

145
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:10,865
Come here.

146
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,580
I usually feel uncomfortable

147
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,082
when I’m surrounded
by a lot of people.

148
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,244
But when I’m with them,

149
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:24,604
I feel really happy.

150
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,479
Oh right, Via, don’t you
have a game today?

151
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:27,607
Can we come watch?

152
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,925
Huh? No, you might be—

153
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,592
- I want to watch!
- Right!

154
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,343
- No, maybe—
- Let’s watch!

155
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,302
You guys might be busy.

156
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:31,844
- You might be busy.
- Let’s watch!

157
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,386
No, no…

158
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,346
- Hey!
- Busy—

159
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,388
Via has a volleyball game,

160
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,681
so everyone’s required to watch!

161
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,682
- Yes!
- Everyone’s required to watch.

162
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,351
- Let’s go! Via, Via!
- Game! I’m watching too.

163
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,895
You’ve got your
own cheering squad.

164
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,230
Let’s go!

165
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,814
We’re her cheerleaders!

166
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:49,403
- Via!
- Via!

167
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:53,324
Go, Via!

168
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,617
All right!
That’s it.

169
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,719
Face here a bit. Good angle!

170
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,038
Go, Via!

171
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,706
Via!

172
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,651
Let’s go, Via!

173
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,086
Oh my god!

174
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,036
Go, Via!
Go, Via!

175
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,265
That’s my friend!

176
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:20,935
Let’s go, Via!

177
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:25,113
All right, that’s it!

178
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,541
Nice one!

179
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:31,045
Go, Via! That’s my friend!

180
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,405
– That’s my friend!
– What? You’re friends with Via?

181
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,406
You’re not her friend.

182
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,699
Hey! I’m friends with Via too!

183
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,950
- No! I’m friends with Via!
- What?

184
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,326
- She’s my friend!
- She’s my friend, too!

185
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:37,827
Guys!

186
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,287
- Via!
- Stop fighting!

187
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,122
Valeria High on three—

188
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,457
One, two, three, Valeria!

189
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,605
-Let’s go, Via!
- Let’s just watch.

190
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,173
- Let’s go, Via.
- Go, Via.

191
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:50,648
Look here for a second.
It’s a good angle.

192
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,300
Just a bit.
I just need one shot!

193
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,382
So beautiful.

194
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,742
One more shot!

195
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:55,884
That’s it!

196
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:57,238
Kino, you’re confusing me.

197
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,015
Can you stop taking
so many pictures?

198
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,812
- Go, Via!
- Let’s go, go, go.

199
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,355
- Let’s go.
- Go, go, go.

200
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,441
Hit that ball, Via!

201
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,027
Imagine that ball is my face!

202
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,378
You’re the best, Via!
You’re the best!

203
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,380
You’re such a good player!

204
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,090
Oh my god!

205
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:34,240
Oh my god!

206
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,552
Go, Via!

207
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,888
Oh my god!

208
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,640
Marry me, Via!

209
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,183
Treat us later!

210
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,559
My best friend’s amazing!

211
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,727
Oh my god!

212
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:45,853
You’re amazing, Via.

213
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,189
You’re amazing. So amazing.

214
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,690
You’re so amazing.

215
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,818
Next time, don’t watch
my game, okay?

216
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,111
You’re too distracting.

217
00:10:54,702 --> 00:10:56,496
You’re mad at me
for cheering for you.

218
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,032
You’re so noisy, and
you keep moving around.

219
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,910
You’re amazing, Via!
You’re a legend!

220
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,497
That’s my friend!

221
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,209
Congratulations!

222
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:11,458
This is nice.

223
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,090
So this is what it feels like
to have someone support me

224
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,633
besides Kino.

225
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,968
- Are you gonna keep moving around?
- No.

226
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,178
- Are you gonna be noisy?
- No more.

227
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,554
- I promise.
- Okay.

228
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:27,096
Let me see it.
Come on, just a peek.

229
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,104
Not yet—

230
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,605
- It’s a surprise.
- I said let me see!

231
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,691
Just wait for it in
the school paper.

232
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,693
Let me see!

233
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,195
If you actually give them
ugly pictures of me,

234
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,699
don’t you ever
talk to me again.

235
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,455
They look good, seriously.

236
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,732
Don’t you trust my shots?

237
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:45,635
Besides, you’re pretty, Via.
Don’t worry.

238
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:52,783
You’re ugly.

239
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:56,273
I literally just called you pretty

240
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,134
and now you’re insulting me?

241
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,511
You’re heartless,
Avianna Diaz.

242
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,929
You were so loud earlier!

243
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,390
You’re mad that
I cheered for you?

244
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,810
You’ve got such an attitude,
Avianna Rye Diaz.

245
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,565
Hi, Arkin.

246
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:19,295
Such a heartthrob.

247
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,354
They’re just messing with me.

248
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,702
I think they like you.

249
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,495
I bet that girl
has a crush on you.

250
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,038
Or maybe both of them
have a crush on you.

251
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:33,586
Well, it’s understandable.
I am good-looking.

252
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,306
Kino, do you have a crush?

253
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,645
Crush?

254
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,067
Not really. You?

255
00:12:57,147 --> 00:13:00,276
None. I’m not even
thinking about that stuff.

256
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,532
When do you plan
on getting a girlfriend?

257
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,911
Maybe when we’re
in our fourth year?

258
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:09,962
Maybe when

259
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:12,984
someone actually courts me.

260
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:20,691
And you?

261
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,802
When do you plan
on getting a boyfriend?

262
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,244
When someone courts you?

263
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,681
I’m not thinking
about that either.

264
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,135
And no one’s courting me anyway.

265
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,120
No one’s going to court me.

266
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:39,078
All right, same routine.

267
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,634
I know you’re tired.

268
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:42,386
Here.

269
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,116
He still acts like he’s
in grade school.

270
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,785
I don’t even know how
he’ll ever get a girlfriend.

271
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,954
One— Two, three!

272
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,598
You’re so light.

273
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,624
Kino.

274
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,333
Huh?

275
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,168
A lot of people have
a crush on you, right?

276
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:56,794
So?

277
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,754
But they have no idea
that you’re childish.

278
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,589
Right?

279
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,173
Oh really?

280
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,174
Yeah, you’re childish.

281
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,175
- I’m childish?
- You are.

282
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,177
- So I’m childish, huh?
- Childish!

283
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,736
- Kino!
- So I’m really childish, huh?

284
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,618
Guess I’m childish then.

285
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,019
Hey, put me down!

286
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,813
She said I’m childish!

287
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,690
You are childish!

288
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,441
Speed racer!

289
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,114
Okay, we only have
three weeks left

290
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,330
before Foundation Week.

291
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:30,177
So, obviously, we’re working
on a tight schedule.

292
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,079
As early as now,
I want to thank everyone

293
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,749
who has helped out, showed up,
and volunteered.

294
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,253
Thank you so much, I really
appreciate all of you.

295
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,546
I’ve already talked
to the club presidents,

296
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,466
and so far the
confirmed booths are—

297
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,676
the Dedication booth is one,

298
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,179
the Marriage Booth,
and the Horror Booth.

299
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,181
And for our main event,

300
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,560
which is the annual
Miss Valerian—

301
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,396
Luna and Sevi, you guys are
spearheading, right?

302
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,408
Any updates?

303
00:14:58,433 --> 00:14:59,732
Yes, Pres.

304
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,901
The Music Club’s performance
is confirmed.

305
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,237
Via, isn’t Arkin a member
of the Music Club?

306
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,405
Is he performing too?

307
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,865
Maybe.

308
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,868
That’s cool. It’ll be my first
time hearing him play.

309
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,244
I didn’t expect him
to be into music.

310
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,203
He doesn’t look like it.

311
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,747
He looks more like
a troublemaker, right?

312
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,958
But Kino’s actually
really talented,

313
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,126
and he’s smart, too.

314
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,795
Wow, look at you
praising your best friend.

315
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:26,342
Anyway, we already have
the list of contestants.

316
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,012
For first year, it’s Helena.
Second year, Irish.

317
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,430
Third year, Yanna.

318
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,557
Wait, is it really
okay for Yanna

319
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,475
to join the pageant,

320
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,769
knowing her image in
school isn’t exactly great?

321
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,521
That’s my concern too,
because if she wins,

322
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,899
she’ll basically
represent the school.

323
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,955
If she wins, I mean.

324
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,736
Is it okay for someone like her

325
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,112
to be the school’s representative?

326
00:15:47,768 --> 00:15:49,490
Why? What’s wrong with her?

327
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,576
I mean, for one, she’s boy crazy.

328
00:15:54,377 --> 00:15:55,753
Any proof of that?

329
00:15:55,778 --> 00:15:57,738
Well, that’s what a lot
of people are saying.

330
00:15:57,763 --> 00:15:58,931
That’s just hearsay.

331
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,669
I think it’s unfair for Yanna

332
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,671
if we don’t give her a
chance to show her talent

333
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,674
and capabilities just
because of malicious rumors.

334
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,509
Pres, if I may?

335
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,302
I just want to remind everyone

336
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,388
that we’re all student
leaders here.

337
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,434
We shouldn’t be adding to
or encouraging toxic rumors

338
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,853
or hate trains against
other students.

339
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,730
It’s also a form of bullying.

340
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,318
And that’s on period.

341
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,653
You nailed it, Sam.

342
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:29,704
Your spit’s flying everywhere.

343
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,215
I’m all yours, Sam.

344
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,033
I’ll follow you everywhere.

345
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,023
So, no more issues with Yanna?

346
00:16:35,048 --> 00:16:35,799
Yes.

347
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:37,492
- Okay! Perfect.
- There. Of course.

348
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:38,745
Thank you, Sam.

349
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,041
Guys, this is for everybody.

350
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:45,011
We should all lead by
example. Okay? Take note.

351
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,755
- Good example.
- Anyway—

352
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,299
My vote for Pres
didn’t go to waste.

353
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,723
No good.

354
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,122
What’s the problem?

355
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,943
How long have you
been standing there?

356
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:33,969
Just a bit.

357
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:38,270
We have this song with
a bridge that uses the chord B7.

358
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:40,005
My bandmate taught me this.

359
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,230
But it sounds kinda off.

360
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,940
I can’t press it properly.

361
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,400
Here, on the bar chord.

362
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,434
You really can’t press it down.

363
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,711
There’s another way though.
You can do it like this.

364
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,572
Here.

365
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,032
No.

366
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,033
Put it here.

367
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,702
Isn’t that easier?

368
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,558
There you go.

369
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,793
Not like that. Here.

370
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:06,835
Right there.

371
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,379
There.

372
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,758
Try again. Strum.

373
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:23,977
There you go.

374
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,191
Doesn’t it sound better?

375
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:31,496
Right?

376
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:32,939
Okay, okay, I got it now.

377
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,074
I got the B7 chords.

378
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:38,909
Why do you look so red?

379
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:40,719
You okay?

380
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:42,038
Are you sick?

381
00:18:42,063 --> 00:18:43,773
Do you have a fever?
You feel warm.

382
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:47,081
It’s kinda hot in this room.

383
00:18:47,106 --> 00:18:48,483
Maybe it’s the aircon.

384
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:49,759
But it’s on.

385
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,380
No, no.

386
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,173
Let me see.

387
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,347
I’m fine.

388
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,391
Is there something wrong with me?

389
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,600
Your face is red.

390
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:09,595
Maybe… maybe…

391
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,537
Maybe what?

392
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:12,231
Maybe we should go home.

393
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:12,860
Let’s go.

394
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,016
All right.

395
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,614
Let’s go.

396
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,699
You’re not leaving that behind?

397
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:28,174
Luna: Foundation Week
starts today!

398
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,493
Pageant day! Are we all ready?
Kierra: Wow, you’re up early.

399
00:19:30,518 --> 00:19:33,479
Kierra: Via, you on your way?
Kierra: Via?

400
00:19:33,504 --> 00:19:34,508
Via?

401
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,508
Oh come on.

402
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,926
Hey, Via!

403
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:43,794
Via, wake up! Look at the time.

404
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:45,112
We’re gonna be late!

405
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,894
If we don’t make it
to the pageant,

406
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,145
Luna’s gonna kill you.

407
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,196
What?

408
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,982
What time is it?

409
00:19:57,275 --> 00:19:58,313
We’re late.

410
00:19:58,338 --> 00:19:59,381
Yeah, we’re late.

411
00:19:59,406 --> 00:19:59,907
We’re late!

412
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,866
- We’re late!
- Their lunch boxes!

413
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,075
No, I’ll take care of it.
Don't worry.

414
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,577
- Go shower and get dressed.
- Huh? What about their lunch—

415
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,953
- I’ll take care of it.
- Huh?

416
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,895
I am so glad
you’re here, seriously.

417
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:11,582
Wait for me, okay?

418
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:15,368
I’ll be quick.

419
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:25,040
Lunch. Their lunch!

420
00:20:36,282 --> 00:20:37,783
This one’s probably better.

421
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:40,019
There, and then...

422
00:20:44,954 --> 00:20:45,955
Arkin—

423
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:50,446
why is my hotdog burnt?

424
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,334
That’s not burnt,

425
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,836
it’s toasted so it has a
smoky flavor, you know?

426
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:57,790
Then why is my egg burnt too?

427
00:20:57,815 --> 00:20:59,525
Is that stoated?

428
00:21:00,232 --> 00:21:01,568
You mean toasted?

429
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,970
No, it’s not toasted.

430
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,389
I did this on purpose so
it’s crispy when you eat it.

431
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,015
Right?

432
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,142
You guys are just
making fun of my cooking.

433
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,519
I barely even cook, you know.

434
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,229
What if I tickle you guys, huh?

435
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:13,477
Huh?

436
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,399
You’re making fun of my cooking.

437
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,192
This is one of the
few times I’ve cooked,

438
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,527
and you’re just
going to tease me?

439
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:22,296
Hey! What’s taking you
so long? Hurry up already!

440
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:23,238
We’re gonna be late.

441
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:24,491
Okay, okay, we’re coming.

442
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,451
Mira, ask Papa
to check on Aiden.

443
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,574
What?

444
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,082
Nothing.

445
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:36,687
Let’s go.

446
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,255
Hurry up, we’re gonna be late.

447
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,506
Ysha, have you eaten?

448
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,341
You’re not hungry?

449
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,150
- No.
- Huh?

450
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,246
All right then.

451
00:21:45,106 --> 00:21:47,233
Via, I’ll stop by the music room
to grab my guitar.

452
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:48,348
I’ll just check
if someone’s there.

453
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,558
They’re walking together again?

454
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,143
Guess she really
is his girlfriend.

455
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,603
- Too bad, he’s taken.
- Yeah.

456
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,564
Are they talking about us?

457
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,150
They’re together again.
They’re always together.

458
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,238
Kino, did you hear that?

459
00:22:04,174 --> 00:22:05,439
Huh?

460
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:07,090
Nothing. Come on.

461
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:08,107
Hurry up.

462
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:09,634
Come on, they said
someone’s there.

463
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,392
Hurry.

464
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,312
Hey! Arkin brought
his girlfriend.

465
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:16,942
You idiot. She’s my friend.

466
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:18,176
- Dumbass.
- Okay, if you say so.

467
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:19,327
Hey, don’t forget your guitar.

468
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:22,291
Those girls earlier
thought the same thing.

469
00:22:23,195 --> 00:22:24,189
Which ones?

470
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:25,674
The ones we passed by.

471
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:27,075
They thought
I was your girlfriend.

472
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:28,579
Are you okay with that?

473
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,558
Yeah, I’m fine with it.
How about you?

474
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:32,950
Well…

475
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,190
It’s just that maybe you’ve lost
a few potential love interests

476
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,359
since they think
I’m your girlfriend.

477
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:41,651
Nevermind.

478
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,553
Come on, hurry up.
We’re gonna be late.

479
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,005
Let’s go!

480
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,614
Hurry!

481
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,908
I still need to get the camera.

482
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,755
All right, but let’s just
improvise our jokes later.

483
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,924
Okay, fine. Just go with
whatever I do, okay?

484
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:05,967
- You okay with that?
- Why me?

485
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,052
Guys!

486
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,553
- Hi, Pres!
- Hey, Pres!

487
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,805
How are you? Hey there.

488
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,557
By the way, we wanna
make sure the tables

489
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:16,144
and scoresheets are
all set before we start.

490
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,464
Excuse me, I need your help.

491
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,358
Is the audio okay? Did we
already do a sound check?

492
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:23,652
We need to make
sure everything’s ready

493
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,112
before the program starts, okay?

494
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:25,862
Let’s go.

495
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,114
You guys handle
things here, all right?

496
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,532
Bye, Pres!

497
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,508
Bye!

498
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,534
We got this, Pres.

499
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:34,975
You guys are starting to get
on my nerves, you know that?

500
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,934
Yanna, just let us do
your hair and makeup.

501
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,961
You can’t go on
stage looking like that.

502
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,321
You look so pale.

503
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:43,104
You need a proper
pageant makeup look.

504
00:23:43,572 --> 00:23:46,826
Yeah, Yanna, just let
us handle it. We got you.

505
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,636
Why do you all have to meddle?

506
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,432
I’m in charge of everything
that happens backstage.

507
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,267
I want this event
to be successful.

508
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,854
So please, Yanna.
Take this pageant seriously.

509
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,772
We all worked hard for this.

510
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,591
Fine. Do whatever you want.

511
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,446
There’s not much to do anyway.

512
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,697
She already looks good.

513
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:10,597
Just like a lioness.

514
00:24:11,545 --> 00:24:12,940
Just make it a little darker.

515
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,256
Yanna, where’s your mom
by the way? Is she coming?

516
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:20,106
How about your dad?

517
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,710
You ask too many questions.

518
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,588
I feel like I should
just take this off.

519
00:24:24,903 --> 00:24:25,904
Then—

520
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:29,968
Much better.

521
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:39,190
Some more here?

522
00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:40,216
- Anyway—
- I’ll hold her hair.

523
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:44,253
Valerians! Good morning!

524
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:48,870
How are you all doing?

525
00:24:48,895 --> 00:24:50,897
We’re great!

526
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,785
So, today we’re officially
kicking off our Foundation Week

527
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,808
with our much awaited event.

528
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:00,794
The search for this
year’s Miss Valerian.

529
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:03,518
And of course, before we start,
let's welcome

530
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:07,088
the president of our student
council, Mr. Acel Chelvea Peña

531
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,465
for the opening remarks.

532
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,340
Good morning, everyone!

533
00:25:20,472 --> 00:25:22,349
On behalf of
the student council,

534
00:25:22,374 --> 00:25:25,335
we welcome you all to the
Foundation Week celebration.

535
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,693
Well, someone’s taking
this really seriously, huh?

536
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,196
Via, stop messing around.

537
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,490
I heard some of
the freshmen saying

538
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,784
I look handsome
when I’m serious.

539
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,208
We have prepared numerous
activities and events

540
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,961
that will showcase our
talents and school spirit.

541
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,671
Bringing us closer
as one community.

542
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,839
Are you serious? Are you sure
that was about you?

543
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,218
You think I’m lying? I swear
I heard my name.

544
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,178
They said, Arkin looks handsome
when he’s serious.

545
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,139
Really? What does your “serious"
look even look like?

546
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,435
So, let’s make the
most out of this week.

547
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,813
Happy Foundation Week,
Valerians!

548
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,855
Enjoy the show.

549
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,737
Thank you, President Acel for
that heartwarming speech.

550
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,615
And now, the most
awaited part of the event.

551
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,950
Let’s all welcome—

552
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,412
- our Miss Valerian candidates!
- our Miss Valerian candidates!

553
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,628
You guys are really
good at hosting.

554
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,433
Wait, where’s Ke?
I’ve been looking for her.

555
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,643
I think she’s outside
doing something.

556
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,666
Okay.

557
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,666
See!

558
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,443
Let’s go, Yanna!

559
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,915
Hello, everyone!
I am Helena Hernandez

560
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,543
representing
the first year batch!

561
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,838
For me, being a Valerian
means being strong,

562
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,715
kind and true to yourself.

563
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,508
And I, thank you.

564
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,733
She’s your classmate, right?

565
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:35,239
Irish? Yeah. She is not nice.

566
00:27:35,264 --> 00:27:38,059
And that other one?
She’s mean, too.

567
00:27:38,706 --> 00:27:40,250
And he badmouthed them.

568
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:41,276
Hello , everyone!

569
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:42,218
It’s true.

570
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,203
I’m Irish Gail Hermosa and today

571
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:47,707
I’m here to represent,
second year high batch!

572
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,334
I’m here to represent the youth

573
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,420
and show what Valerian
confidence is all about.

574
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,381
And I, thank you.

575
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,551
But you know what,
Irish has a crush on me.

576
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,779
You’re so full of yourself.

577
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,140
I swear! She confessed to
me just yesterday.

578
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,207
Really?

579
00:28:10,592 --> 00:28:12,052
Let’s go, Yanna!

580
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:31,902
Yanna!

581
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,004
Hi. I’m Ashianna Kim Fernandez,

582
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:43,738
representing
the third year batch.

583
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,306
Ain’t that delicious!

584
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,016
Let me have a taste!

585
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,017
Yummy!

586
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,519
Her skin’s so smooth!

587
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,603
Are you for sharing?

588
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,730
Give me a kiss!

589
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,149
These guys are so rude.

590
00:29:00,102 --> 00:29:01,979
And I’ll kill you all—

591
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,370
with kindness.

592
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,956
Oh… Kindness.

593
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:10,996
Okay.

594
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,424
Yanna looks so pretty, huh?

595
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,217
Of course, we’re the
ones who fixed her up.

596
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,177
Good job!

597
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,144
Good Day, everyone!
I am Jewel Doria

598
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,230
representing
the fourth year batch.

599
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,196
Here.

600
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,704
Via, is it time for
the talent portion?

601
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,664
Yeah. I think it’s up next.

602
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,796
Hey, Yanna! I heard my boyfriend
cheering for you earlier.

603
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,924
- What?
- You’ve got a lot of nerve.

604
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,510
How is that my fault?

605
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,469
Yes.

606
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,971
Because you’re such a slut!

607
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,140
- What did you just say?
- I said you’re a slut!

608
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,099
- You heard me.
- Yanna!

609
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,351
Excuse me, hello.

610
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,270
Yanna, get ready
for the talent portion.

611
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,272
You too, get ready
and get dressed.

612
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,279
Oh my god!

613
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,114
I hate her.

614
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,283
Now that we’ve
met our candidates,

615
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,494
it’s time to see
another side of them.

616
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,913
We all know Valerians
are talented students,

617
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:35,166
and this segment will
showcase exactly that.

618
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,085
Welcome to—

619
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,753
- The Talent Portion!
- The Talent Portion!

620
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,715
Before we proceed, I’d like
to make a few reminders.

621
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,009
Please do not make
unnecessary comments

622
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,803
about our contestants.

623
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:50,306
Right, especially stuff
that doesn’t sound nice.

624
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,767
Remember, being respectful

625
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,728
is one of Valeria High’s
core values.

626
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,729
Wow!

627
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:01,317
Amazing. My co-host has actually
memorized the school bible!

628
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,279
And now, let’s officially begin.

629
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,322
Representing the first years,

630
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,992
she’ll be performing
a hip hop dance number.

631
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,994
Let’s all give a warm
round of applause

632
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,996
for Miss Helena Hernandez.

633
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:30,972
She’s so good.

634
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,598
I know, I know.

635
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,265
You can do that.

636
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,600
- Do a sing-off.
- No, we’re here for Yanna.

637
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,601
- Right!
- You’re right.

638
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,615
We’re here for Yanna.

639
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,224
Mother!

640
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:44,986
Mother—

641
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,578
Go, Yanna!

642
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,143
Just one night, Yanna!

643
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,645
Me too, Yanna!

644
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,912
Dance for me!

645
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:21,898
Excuse me,

646
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,942
didn’t we just say that
we should all respect

647
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,401
the contestants?

648
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,903
The teachers are
right there on the side.

649
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,529
I can report you anytime.

650
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:32,890
Such a killjoy.

651
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:37,114
Hey.

652
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,721
She’s really good.

653
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,787
A sure win.

654
00:33:00,024 --> 00:33:02,860
We’ve seen our candidates
showcase their talents.

655
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,525
And now it’s time to hear
what they have to say.

656
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:06,859
Welcome to—

657
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,820
- The Q&A Portion!
- The Q&A Portion!

658
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,577
For this portion, candidates
will be picked randomly.

659
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,247
Let’s begin with
Ashianna Kim Fernandez

660
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,748
from the third year batch.

661
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,383
What happened?

662
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,926
Yanna isn’t here yet.

663
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,593
Huh?

664
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,763
I don’t know either, but
they’re calling her on stage.

665
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,115
- Yanna?
- Yes.

666
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,307
Isn’t she here?

667
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,934
Wasn’t she supposed
to enter from over there?

668
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,271
She’s not there.

669
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,206
Maybe she got stuck in traffic.

670
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,166
Let’s call her again.

671
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,626
Miss Ashianna Kim Fernandez!

672
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,646
There she is! Oh my gosh.

673
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,361
What’s that? What does it say?

674
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,738
It says she’s a flirt?

675
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,615
At least she admits it, right?

676
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,242
Yanna, are you okay?

677
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,385
Are you sure?

678
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,454
I wish you’d flirt with me, Yanna.

679
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,748
Poor girl.

680
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,543
You sure?

681
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:48,795
Are you sure?

682
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,812
Okay.

683
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,510
Okay, Miss Ashianna—

684
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,970
Please choose from
the question cards.

685
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,188
Your question is—

686
00:35:07,662 --> 00:35:09,789
What does feminism mean to you,

687
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:13,985
and how can students like us
practice it in our everyday lives?

688
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,076
For me,

689
00:35:20,808 --> 00:35:26,063
feminism isn’t about
competing with men

690
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,794
or being above them.

691
00:35:31,052 --> 00:35:36,516
Its true meaning is equality.

692
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:42,515
Equal respect and
opportunities for everyone.

693
00:35:43,372 --> 00:35:44,832
As students,

694
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:51,816
we can live this out by
showing respect to one another

695
00:35:52,908 --> 00:35:54,785
and not judging someone

696
00:35:55,673 --> 00:35:57,383
based on their clothing,

697
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,365
speech,

698
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:01,390
actions,

699
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,870
or background.

700
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:09,646
And for my fellow women,

701
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:16,841
feminism isn’t about
pulling each other down.

702
00:36:19,747 --> 00:36:25,128
It’s about working together
so that everyone rises together.

703
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,952
And I, thank you.

704
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:42,374
Yes!

705
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,626
But, oh my god—

706
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,214
- Wait a minute.
- Huh?

707
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,712
True.

708
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:02,970
Were you the one
who wrote that?

709
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,675
Girl, she really is a slut.

710
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,349
It suits her.

711
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,391
Yeah.

712
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,893
Oh my god.

713
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,436
- So it’s you?
- What are you doing?

714
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,437
- Why did you do that? Huh?
- What?

715
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,146
- Don’t get involved!
- Why?

716
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:12,813
What do you mean?

717
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,856
- What did she do to you?
- It’s fine.

718
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,649
Do you have proof?

719
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,858
- Everyone!
- It’s fine.

720
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,735
She’s the one who
sabotaged Yanna’s gown.

721
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,229
- No!
- Sam! Sam!

722
00:37:19,254 --> 00:37:21,047
- Sam, stop!
- No!

723
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,865
I will report all of you!

724
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,159
- I knew you were behind this!
- You’re all so shameless!

725
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,577
I saw you take her dress.

726
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,038
I heard you talking about Yanna
in the bathroom.

727
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,082
Well, she really is a slut.

728
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,041
What did you say?

729
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,601
- Hey, stop it—
- What did you just say?

730
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,627
She’s a slut.

731
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,379
A slut, huh?

732
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,264
Stop fighting!

733
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,432
I can handle this.

734
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,448
Come on!

735
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,270
That’s enough!

736
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,271
Stop already!

737
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,398
Enough already!

738
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,503
Enough!

739
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:01,413
Hold her!

740
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,823
- I will report you!
- Sam!

741
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,033
- No, I’ll report them!
- Enough!

742
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,578
Guys! What’s going on here?

743
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,789
What is this?

744
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,753
Yanna?

745
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,169
Excuse me.

746
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,379
Yanna!

747
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,272
Excuse me.

748
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,346
You guys!

749
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,593
Calm down. Relax. Inhale…

750
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,053
Exhale. All good?

751
00:38:26,444 --> 00:38:27,445
You guys too.

752
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,471
Enough.

753
00:38:28,522 --> 00:38:29,490
Wait.

754
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:30,516
Excuse me.

755
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,769
I said, enough!

756
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,771
Warfreaks.

757
00:38:36,154 --> 00:38:38,656
Arkin? You’re involved
in this too?

758
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,651
Huh? Why me?

759
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,445
You stay here.

760
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,380
Huh?

761
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,532
My hair, oh my god.

762
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,591
Yanna.

763
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,285
Stop crying.

764
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,871
Don’t mind them anymore.

765
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,375
You did great. Okay?

766
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,088
You were amazing.
Don’t mind them anymore.

767
00:39:03,113 --> 00:39:05,699
I knew I’d find you here.

768
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,013
And now there’s another one.

769
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,057
Just leave me alone!

770
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,809
No way. You can
cry all you want.

771
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:16,012
You don’t have to hide it
from us anymore.

772
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,189
Go away.

773
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,190
No.

774
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,608
We’re not leaving.

775
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:26,626
We’re not leaving you alone
until we’re sure you’re okay.

776
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,993
I’m fine.

777
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,620
Yeah, sure. You’re fine.

778
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,996
You’re totally fine. Okay.

779
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:34,955
Via?

780
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,245
Via.

781
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,335
Damn it.

782
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,379
You’re all crazy.

783
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:45,065
Well? Do you want us
to go beat her ass?

784
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,759
Do you want me to beat your ass?

785
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,345
You’re insane.

786
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,971
Arkin?

787
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,890
Where are you?

788
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,564
Damn it! Who else is coming, huh?

789
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,066
I just followed Arkin.

790
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,026
Pres asked me to look for Sam.

791
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,904
Sevi, where is she?

792
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,031
I swear I’m gonna punch her.

793
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,408
Keep your voice down,
we’re in the library.

794
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,367
Hey…

795
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,701
Stop crying!

796
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,955
We all hate her, don’t worry.

797
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,791
- Take my jacket—
- So childish.

798
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,880
Use it for now.

799
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,919
It doesn’t stink, okay?

800
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,463
Your makeup’s all ruined now.

801
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,301
Yanna, don’t ever think there’s
something wrong with you, okay?

802
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,344
You didn’t do anything wrong.

803
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,973
You didn’t do anything bad.

804
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,891
Right. That’s true.

805
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,353
And they’re just jealous because
you did great at the pageant earlier.

806
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,301
Yeah!

807
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:41,439
When people get jealous,

808
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,025
they want to intimidate you and
tear your confidence down.

809
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,403
Don’t let them get to you. Huh?

810
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,239
Of course not!

811
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,409
That’s the spirit!
You fight back, don’t give up!

812
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,410
He’s right!

813
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,703
Right?

814
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,330
How about we grab
food after this?

815
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,624
That’s even better!
Sam’s treating us!

816
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,917
That’s right. Sam’s paying.

817
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,419
- Sam’s gonna treat us!
- Go, Sam.

818
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,129
- Me?
- Yes!

819
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:05,921
Okay!

820
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,173
Yeah, I’m hungry too.

821
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,007
Let’s go?

822
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,341
- Let’s go.
- Later, okay?

823
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,551
Later, after the pageant.

824
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,719
All right. As long as it’s free.

825
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,928
Yeah, after the pageant.

826
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,805
- After the pageant.
- Let’s go.

827
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,433
Let’s go, guys!

828
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,392
Let’s go.

829
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,393
The water—

830
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,770
Let’s go.

831
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:26,173
Be careful.

832
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,360
So tall!

833
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,820
Wow. Okay.

834
00:41:30,403 --> 00:41:31,244
Okay.

835
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,647
There. So pretty. Let’s go!

836
00:41:40,537 --> 00:41:43,957
And our Miss Valerian
of the year is…

837
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,844
Our first year representative—

838
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,930
- Helena Hernandez!
- Helena Hernandez!

839
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,319
I hope she’s okay though.

840
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,352
She looks fine.

841
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:29,630
Stay tuned, guys.

842
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,634
Don’t go home yet because the
music club will be playing later.

843
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,302
Can’t wait for them
to serenade us.

844
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,306
Congratulations.

845
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,434
Finally, it’s over.

846
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,853
Are you okay?

847
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,898
You did well, Yanna.

848
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,651
Thanks.

849
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,070
You guys even fought for me.

850
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,905
Of course.

851
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,532
- For you.
- But I’m never gonna do this again.

852
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,117
My feet hurt so much.

853
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,289
It’s okay, Yanna.

854
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,416
You still have a chance
to join next year.

855
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,295
No way! It’s such a hassle.

856
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,840
Hey! Don’t leave yet, okay?

857
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,174
I’m going to sing. Watch me.

858
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,720
- Okay.
- Sure thing!

859
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,221
Let’s support Arkin, guys.

860
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,515
You all have to come watch him,

861
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:22,975
because he just might
cry if you don’t.

862
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:26,103
I will cry, Via,
if you don’t watch!

863
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,398
Do your best, okay?
Don’t be nervous.

864
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,400
If you start to feel nervous,
just look for me in the audience.

865
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,988
Look at me and think that
it’s just like we’re practicing.

866
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:36,572
All right then.

867
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,783
I’ll just think that
I’m singing for you.

868
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,537
By the way!

869
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:46,081
Let’s eat first. Ke’s already
waiting over there.

870
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,082
- Let’s go!
- Come on.

871
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:47,791
It’s my treat!

872
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,792
Let’s go.

873
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:49,918
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

874
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,337
- I’ll go change first.
- It’s Sam’s treat, after all!

875
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,672
- Poor you.
- Yeah, go ahead.

876
00:43:54,273 --> 00:43:55,983
Thanks for the treat, Sam!

877
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,676
Thanks, Sam!
You’re really so nice.

878
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,677
You’re the best, Sam.

879
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,803
Hope we can do this again soon.

880
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,877
You’re all so loud.

881
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:03,029
I'm just gonna grab a drink,
I’m choking here.

882
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,975
This is my spot.

883
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,226
You’re too much, dude.

884
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,270
You know what guys,
for some reason,

885
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,938
I wanna be friends with Yanna.

886
00:44:10,577 --> 00:44:12,203
I think she’s a good person.

887
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,987
But, I’m not really
good at making friends.

888
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,156
But don’t you have
lots of friends?

889
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,491
You talk to a lot
of people at school.

890
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,511
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

891
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:22,912
Doesn’t that mean
they’re your friends?

892
00:44:23,773 --> 00:44:24,845
Not really.

893
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,039
For me, I only consider
someone my friend

894
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,291
if I’ve shared something
with that person.

895
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,669
Whether it’s my time or
you know, a secret.

896
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:34,851
Just like us, Via.

897
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,135
Us? Are you guys a couple?

898
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,679
Best friends.

899
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:43,240
No.

900
00:44:43,265 --> 00:44:45,392
- Childhood best friends.
- …hood best friends.

901
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:46,751
I thought you two were dating.

902
00:44:46,776 --> 00:44:48,612
Don’t worry, we thought so too.

903
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,397
By the way, we’ll be having
parlor games this week.

904
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,440
I’m signing you guys up,
no backing out.

905
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,274
Arkin.

906
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,943
- I’ll put you in the—
- Yeah, Arkin should join.

907
00:44:55,943 --> 00:45:00,280
the three-legged race
and the tug of war.

908
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,408
I don’t want to.
Those are for kids. Pass.

909
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,992
Then I’ll just put Via’s
name down instead.

910
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,160
No, I’ll do it.

911
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,912
What was it again?
Three-legged race—

912
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,372
- tug of war.
- And tug of war. Yeah.

913
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:14,096
Then I’ll put Kierra and Via
in the pass-the-paper game.

914
00:45:14,121 --> 00:45:15,080
You joining, Sevi?

915
00:45:15,105 --> 00:45:16,815
Yeah, I like that game!

916
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,174
Pass the paper’s fun.

917
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,676
I know what Sevi likes.

918
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,679
Then I’ll put Sam
in the bring-me game.

919
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,098
What about Yanna,
is she joining too?

920
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:36,637
All right, perfect,
we’ve got our team!

921
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,002
Can I get another hotdog, Sam?

922
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,576
Go ahead, get more.

923
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:48,662
Grab more, there’s plenty.

924
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,372
Here you go.

925
00:45:54,623 --> 00:45:56,041
Mic test, mic test—

926
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,505
Hi, we’re the Music Club.

927
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,978
I’m Arkin, I play guitar
and do vocals.

928
00:46:02,003 --> 00:46:06,132
This is Zild on bass,
Rafael on electric,

929
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,308
and Gelo on drums.

930
00:46:09,756 --> 00:46:11,466
We hope you enjoy
our performance.

931
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,068
Larkin Sanchez is so handsome!

932
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:22,654
You wouldn’t think he’s
a student here, right?

933
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,530

Looks like he did really well.

951
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,324
Maybe you’ll even
join his fan club later.

952
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:53,095

- Music club!
- Yeah! Good job!

957
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,525
Is that okay now?

958
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:25,861
Guys, I checked
the booths earlier.

959
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,416
Everything’s set up nicely,

960
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:30,306
and the Dedication and Marriage
booths look really cute.

961
00:48:30,331 --> 00:48:31,290
Nice.

962
00:48:31,315 --> 00:48:32,859
Right. Even the, you know,
the Jail booth,

963
00:48:32,884 --> 00:48:34,151
you can see
the effort there too.

964
00:48:34,176 --> 00:48:37,013
Also the horror one,
let’s go there later.

965
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,167
And invite Yanna, her body
needs a little scare.

966
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,002
You always tease Yanna.

967
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:46,506
By the way, if anyone wants to
sign up for the marriage booth,

968
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,759
if you’re planning
to get married—

969
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,135
You can give your names to me,

970
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,261
I’m the one keeping the list.

971
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,846
And for those
of you with partners,

972
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,807
maybe you want
to marry them too.

973
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,310
You never know, they might
change their mind later, right?

974
00:48:58,533 --> 00:48:59,578
True.

975
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,313
What if there’s no partner?

976
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,525
Don’t you have a crush?

977
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,192
If you do,
I’ll even help you out.

978
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,080
Come on, let’s handcuff them,
they might try to escape.

979
00:49:08,105 --> 00:49:08,921
Escape?

980
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,589
What’s that supposed to mean?

981
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,907
There’s no getting away now.

982
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,909
I might get punched though.

983
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,286
I’ll fight them. You see this?
Can you see it?

984
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,538
I can fight. See this?

985
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,832
Excuse me, can I sign up?

986
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,209
Huh?

987
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,711
You have someone
you want to marry, Arkin?

988
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,797
Oh wow, who is it?

989
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,091
Hey! Are you keeping
a secret from us?

990
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:33,111
Let’s list them down already.

991
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,096
Here, a pen.

992
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,223
- So, what are the names?
- Give it to me, I’ll write it down. Hurry.

993
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,516
- Go, come on.
- How many?

994
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,475
Sorry,  it should only be one.

995
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,476
Tell us.

996
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,352
It’s... it’s...

997
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,353
- Who?
- Who?

998
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,704
- And what time?
- Hurry up.

999
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,481
- Sam!
- Yeah?

1000
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,440
Can you come here, they
have issues with the games.

1001
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,817
Okay.
Hold on.

1002
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:47,943
We’ll be back.

1003
00:49:48,095 --> 00:49:49,111
Yes?

1004
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,570
- What is this about?
- What’s up?

1005
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:54,950
Via.

1006
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,201
Huh?

1007
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,080
Let’s get married.

1008
00:50:51,892 --> 00:50:52,924
I’m just going backstage
for a bit, okay?

1009
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:53,994
All right, go ahead.

1010
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,637
Ma’am, excuse me.

1011
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,222
- Yes, ma’am?
- Can I order some water?

1012
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,599
Sure! I’ll get some for you.

1013
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,933
Do you need anything else?

1014
00:51:27,242 --> 00:51:28,827
Have you had your
first kiss yet, Via?

1015
00:51:31,473 --> 00:51:32,807
What if you become
my first kiss?

1016
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:35,926
Me?

1017
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,719
Have you been here long?

1018
00:51:37,744 --> 00:51:38,868
Yeah.

1019
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:41,501
Volleyball practice ended a bit late.

1020
00:51:41,526 --> 00:51:43,445
Come on, I’ll walk you
to the terminal.

1021
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:47,724
Kino, I think I have
a crush on someone.

1022
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:50,107
Who? Who’s your crush?

1023
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,066
It’s Pres.

1024
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:55,529
Maybe it’s better if we don’t
hang out too much at school.

1025
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,321
Huh?

1026
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:59,157
People might think
I’m your boyfriend.

1027
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,985
It would be a shame if you didn’t
get a chance with your crush.

1028
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,038
Huh?

1029
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,921
Pres, you want some?

1030
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,299
Sure.
