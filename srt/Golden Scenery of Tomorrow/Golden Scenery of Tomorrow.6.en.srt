1
00:00:25,227 --> 00:00:27,187
Kino, there are so many people.

2
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,732
Everyone’s watching.
I don’t think I can do this.

3
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:31,525
Just keep your eyes on me. Okay?

4
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:33,193
- for you…
- for you…

5
00:00:33,193 --> 00:00:34,611
Wonder…

6
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:35,796
About to kiss?

7
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:37,339
She just wiped something off my face!

8
00:00:37,364 --> 00:00:39,967
Didn’t we agree that our first kiss
would be with each other?

9
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:42,177
For me, you were
the best one out there.

10
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:45,039
If I were really that good,
then we should’ve won, right?

11
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:46,140
I’ll just be here, okay?

12
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:47,896
Let me do the chores for now, okay?

13
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:50,044
Via’s feeling down.

14
00:00:53,047 --> 00:00:55,424
Group hug!

15
00:00:56,842 --> 00:00:59,136
The reason why…

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,721
Return anew—

17
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:01,555
You passed.

18
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:03,248
Thanks for making me join.

19
00:01:06,507 --> 00:01:08,509
Would you get mad if I kissed you?

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,961
No.

21
00:01:10,516 --> 00:01:11,599
I wouldn’t get mad.

22
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:16,879
- I just really don’t know what to do.
- You were really out of—

23
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:19,336
Kino, what are you doing? Get up.

24
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:20,443
Are you crying?

25
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:21,867
Via…

26
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:23,786
I think I have feelings for you.

27
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:38,013
Via…

28
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:42,406
I think I have feelings for you.

29
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:52,365
What did you say?

30
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,510
Via, I have feelings for you.

31
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,842
Maybe you’re just confused.

32
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:05,304
Come on, let’s go home.

33
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,876
How am I confused, Via?

34
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:15,576
With this.

35
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:17,836
With us.

36
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:23,357
Maybe we’re just too used
to always being together.

37
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:26,903
It’s making you confused.

38
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:31,830
You don’t have feelings for me, Kino.

39
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:36,793
We’re just used
to each other’s presence.

40
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:40,005
And if you’re just saying that
so I won’t drift away from you,

41
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:41,632
you don’t have to.

42
00:03:41,632 --> 00:03:43,300
Don’t do this again, okay?

43
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,010
Via.

44
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:03,862
Maybe—

45
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,868
we should also try
spending time apart?

46
00:04:11,995 --> 00:04:14,164
What do you mean, Via?

47
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:19,586
Meet other girls.

48
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:23,840
So you’ll realize that what you
feel for me isn’t real.

49
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:26,802
Because it’s impossible, Kino.

50
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:29,721
We’ve been friends for so long.

51
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:31,765
You’re just confused.

52
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:38,146
Yeah, maybe I am just confused.

53
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:42,359
You go ahead, Via.
I’ll take a walk first.

54
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,694
Huh?

55
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:46,697
Let’s go home together.

56
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,907
No, it’s okay. I need
to pass by somewhere,

57
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:51,034
so you go ahead.

58
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:52,828
Come on.

59
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:57,040
No, it’s fine
I’ll see you tomorrow.

60
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,668
You sure?

61
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:03,297
Take care, okay?

62
00:05:03,922 --> 00:05:05,173
You, too.

63
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:29,239
Should I still prepare his lunchbox?

64
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,461
Don’t take it off, okay?

65
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:43,462
Promise?

66
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:49,968
Via, isn’t Arkin here yet?

67
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:51,803
Via?

68
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:53,055
Huh?

69
00:05:57,476 --> 00:05:59,728
He might not be able to drop by today.

70
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:02,606
Hurry up now
or you might be late.

71
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:06,735
Are you sure, Via?
He might suddenly show up.

72
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:11,740
Mira, help Ysha put on her shoes.

73
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,325
- Kino, wait a minute. Let me fix this first.
- Okay.

74
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:15,702
Wear your shoes now
so we can all head out.

75
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:45,816
We go to school together
everyday, don’t we?

76
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:48,026
Since pre-school even, right?

77
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:49,986
Then we should keep it
that way until college.

78
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:51,613
And when we start working,
we’ll still go together.

79
00:06:51,613 --> 00:06:52,614
No excuses.

80
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:55,033
You’re so clingy.

81
00:06:57,702 --> 00:06:59,830
You’ll get used to it, Via.

82
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:13,093
Did he come to school today?

83
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,431
Via! Hey!

84
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:19,433
We’ve been looking for you.

85
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:21,893
Arkin arrived early, so we
thought you were already here.

86
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:25,689
By the way,
Sam’s asking if it’s okay

87
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:27,732
for you to be part
of her 18 candles?

88
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:30,986
She sent a message in our group
chat but you haven’t seen it yet.

89
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:34,531
Of course. It’s fine,
and I’ll be there.

90
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:36,741
Okay. We’ll confirm it then.

91
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:41,496
And tell Arkin to let
Sevi know about it

92
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:43,498
since they’re not in
our girls’ group chat.

93
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:45,041
Maybe…

94
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,502
Maybe Sevi should just
be the one to tell him.

95
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:50,422
Why? Are you okay?

96
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:53,842
Should I tell them?

97
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:57,679
Maybe not. Kino and I can
handle our own problems.

98
00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:02,267
Yeah, I’m fine. Just tired.
I did a lot earlier.

99
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,311
All right.

100
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,645
Just know that whatever
your problem is,

101
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:09,149
big or small,
we’re here to listen, okay?

102
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:10,734
We’ll back you up.

103
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:23,622
I wonder if Kino already ate?

104
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:24,956
He probably has.

105
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:26,208
Hey, there’s Arkin.

106
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,545
You should do this with your
hands so it won’t hurt.

107
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,547
You just don’t want to listen to me.

108
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:37,219
Come on!

109
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:39,304
- The debut!
- The debut.

110
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:40,555
You already said yes, right?

111
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:41,932
You said yes?

112
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:43,433
- You said yes.
- Yes. I did.

113
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,514
- You gave your yes.
- Also—

114
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:44,967
Yes.

115
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,857
Right, I’m actually
excited about the dresses.

116
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:55,028
Your hand just
needs to get used to it,

117
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:56,613
and when you blend,

118
00:08:56,613 --> 00:09:00,784
your mind will also
get used to the tone—

119
00:09:01,618 --> 00:09:03,328
Why does it look so easy for you?

120
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:04,996
It’s not. You just
need muscle memory.

121
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:06,414
So just keep practicing.

122
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:07,374
My—

123
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:08,375
There you go.

124
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:13,505
My melody, reflecting—

125
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:20,095
It’s like how you focus on
the tone when you sing along.

126
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:21,096
Okay.

127
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:26,101
Listen to my melody—

128
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:29,854
Look at you two. You might
actually end up together.

129
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:32,232
You look good together.
Why don’t you just go for it?

130
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:34,943
Right, you’re both talented anyway.

131
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:36,903
Admit it, Arkin. You have
a crush on Naya, don’t you?

132
00:09:36,903 --> 00:09:39,239
Stop it, guys.

133
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:42,284
He’s just teaching me.
You all sound ridiculous.

134
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:45,287
Oh, Via’s here.

135
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,080
You and Arkin are
close friends, right?

136
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,249
Would you approve of Naya if ever?

137
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:59,426
There you go!
Approved by his friend!

138
00:10:02,846 --> 00:10:04,347
This is better.

139
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:08,059
So Arkin will realize he
doesn’t actually like me.

140
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:10,916
And so our friendship
can go back to normal.

141
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:14,232
Hi, guys!

142
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:16,651
- Hi, Pres.
- Hi, Pres.

143
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:18,458
Welcome to our general assembly.

144
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,700
But before we start, maybe Arkin
and Naya can sing for us first.

145
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:27,412
They prepared a song for us.

146
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,347
One, two, three, go.

147
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,267
- Listen—
- Listen to—

148
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:33,084
One more.

149
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:34,085
- My bad.
- I’m sorry.

150
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:35,378
I’m sorry, one more time.

151
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:36,212
Okay.

152
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:37,213
- Okay.
- You ready?

153
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:38,173
Okay.

154
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:39,174
Okay, ready—

155
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,801
One, two, three, go.

Wow.

165
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:38,024
You’ve improved so much from
the first time you started to now.

166
00:11:38,024 --> 00:11:39,609
You’re so quick at changing chords.

167
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:40,777
Your guitar skills are really good now.

168
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:42,754
But you should
still practice at home.

169
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,657
Arkin, you should walk Naya home.

170
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:47,200
Right?

171
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,910
No. Let’s just all
go together. Let’s go.

172
00:11:48,952 --> 00:11:51,746
Come on, so you two
can have your moment.

173
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:52,956
Come on, let’s go.

174
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:53,957
Let’s go.

175
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,643
I’ll go ahead. I’m heading home.

176
00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:04,884
We’ll walk you home.

177
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,469
We’ll stay at your place first.

178
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:09,681
Yeah. We’re not doing
anything anyway,

179
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:10,865
so we’ll just hang out.

180
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,975
Right! Is that okay with you?

181
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:18,690
You both just want to walk me home

182
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,984
because Arkin and I
aren’t going home together.

183
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:23,211
I’m fine. I can handle myself.

184
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:25,530
Come on, we’re just worried
because you’ll be walking alone.

185
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:26,589
- That’s all it is.
- And—

186
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:28,992
You have siblings, right?
We want to meet them!

187
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:31,745
Her siblings are super cute, right?

188
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,887
Come on!

189
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:35,331
Aren’t you going to ask
what happened to us?

190
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:40,670
You know, if you’re not comfortable
telling us, that’s totally fine.

191
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:43,214
Just know that we’re here for you.

192
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:45,133
Yeah. That’s more than
enough for us.

193
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:46,426
You know we’re here, okay?

194
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:48,650
Yeah, and if you do tell us,
that’s just a bonus.

195
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:50,314
Right?

196
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:53,016
I want to tell you guys,

197
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,977
but this is our problem.

198
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:59,963
Then it’s your problem.
No problem.

199
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:01,816
So, are we gonna hang out?
Come on.

200
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:02,650
Let’s go home?

201
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,693
Perfect.

202
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:12,786
- I’m excited!
- It’s so messy here at home.

203
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:14,537
Come on in.

204
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:15,789
- Sorry, it’s messy here, okay?
- Wow!

205
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:16,498
Hi!

206
00:13:16,498 --> 00:13:18,099
- Hello!
- It’s so messy.

207
00:13:18,124 --> 00:13:20,251
- Hi!
- Sit down here first, sit down.

208
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:21,252
Thanks.

209
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:23,171
- Hi, guys!
- Hey, don’t!

210
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:24,422
Hello, hello.

211
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:28,276
- Pa, we’re here, I’m with my friends!
- Hi. Oh, what’s this?

212
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:29,761
Hello!

213
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:31,262
- Huh? What did you say?
- Say hello—

214
00:13:31,262 --> 00:13:32,972
- I’m here with my friends, Pa.
- Hi!

215
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:33,890
- This is Kierra.
- Hello.

216
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,766
- This is Luna.
- Hello.

217
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:35,767
Luna, Ke, this is Papa.

218
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:36,893
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

219
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:37,894
So polite of you.

220
00:13:37,894 --> 00:13:39,729
Okay, have a seat.
Make yourself at home.

221
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:41,105
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

222
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:42,774
Say hi. Introduce yourselves!

223
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:43,775
Hello.

224
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:44,776
- Hello!
- I’m Mira.

225
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:45,777
- Mira.
- Hi!

226
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:48,446
- I’m Ysha.
- Ysha!

227
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,074
Hi, Ysha! So pretty.

228
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:52,075
I’m Aidan.

229
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:53,535
- So cute!
- Hello, Aidan.

230
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,245
Sit over here. Come here.

231
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:58,957
Can I take you home?

232
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:00,708
Don’t go home yet, okay?

233
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,918
Have some snacks here first.

234
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,127
- Huh?
- Sure, thank you.

235
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:04,337
Pa, they just brought me home.

236
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:05,463
They’re going home soon.
They might get home late.

237
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:06,756
What? It’s fine.

238
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:09,188
Our parents aren’t home
yet anyway, so it’s all good.

239
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,510
Yes, we’ll just have someone
pick us up later

240
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,886
so we can stay late.

241
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:13,179
Let’s play first.

242
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:14,180
All right then.

243
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:15,849
Nice.

244
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,741
Let’s play here.

245
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:20,144
Come on, feed me.

246
00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:21,771
- I’m the princess, okay.
- I got two. Here.

247
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:27,110
Oh my god, it’s so good.
Uncle, this tastes amazing.

248
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,986
Thank you.

249
00:14:27,986 --> 00:14:30,547
Sorry, Uncle, we ate a lot.

250
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:33,199
What? It’s fine, just keep eating.

251
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,284
Okay. Give it to me.

252
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:35,702
- Just keep eating.
- You guys are so sweet.

253
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:37,871
You know, this is
the first time Via

254
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:39,432
has ever brought friends home.

255
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:41,330
Hold on a minute.

256
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,334
The camera’s a bit blurry, though.

257
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:47,338
But I can clearly feel
how special this moment is.

258
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:49,479
- Via, I’ll take a picture of you guys.
- Huh?

259
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:50,675
Papa, come on.

260
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:51,801
Go there and join them. Quick.

261
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,011
- Stay here.
- Here.

262
00:14:53,261 --> 00:14:53,970
Come here!

263
00:14:54,304 --> 00:14:55,338
Okay.

264
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:57,432
- All right.
- Smile, baby.

265
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,019
Okay, smile. One, two, three—

266
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:02,145
One more.

267
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:04,814
- One, two, three, smile!
- So handsome.

268
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:06,232
There you go.

269
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:08,192
Cute, so cute!

270
00:15:08,443 --> 00:15:12,286
You know, I can tell that
you’re all good friends to Via.

271
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,479
Of course, Uncle.

272
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:15,158
And Via is really good to us too.

273
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:16,784
We can tell who she takes after.

274
00:15:17,535 --> 00:15:19,078
Yes and Uncle, she’s not just kind.

275
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:20,538
Your daughter has
a beautiful voice,

276
00:15:20,538 --> 00:15:22,248
and she knows
how to play guitar, too.

277
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:25,126
So you sing at school, sweetheart?

278
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:31,382
That was just one time, Pa.
At school.

279
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:33,760
It… it won’t happen again.

280
00:15:34,104 --> 00:15:35,803
I know you can play guitar,

281
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:38,097
but I didn’t know
you liked singing too,

282
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:39,330
just like your mom.

283
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,612
Pa, we have other friends
aside from Luna and Ke.

284
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:53,322
Yeah.

285
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:54,932
There’s Sevi, Sam, and Yanna.

286
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:57,033
- You’ve met Sevi already, right?
- Yes.

287
00:15:57,075 --> 00:15:58,993
Next time, if it’s okay,

288
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:00,995
I’ll introduce Sam
and Yanna to you too.

289
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:02,055
Sure.

290
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,084
Luna, Kierra, are you
also friends with Arkin?

291
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:07,585
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

292
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,844
Yes.

293
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,010
Pa, Sam’s having her
18th birthday party next week.

294
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,970
We’re attending.

295
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,388
- Her debut?
- Yes, Uncle.

296
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:19,681
Do you have something
to wear already?

297
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:21,349
Okay, I’ll save up for it.

298
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:25,770
No, Uncle, it’s fine.
Sam will be providing our gowns.

299
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,647
We’ll also be
the ones to pick up Via,

300
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,732
so you don’t have
to worry about anything.

301
00:16:29,732 --> 00:16:31,275
Oh, wow. Thank you.

302
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,151
Yes.

303
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:33,361
Go ahead, eat.

304
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:34,696
Hotdog! Give Via a hotdog.

305
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:35,947
Luna wants a hotdog.

306
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:38,610
- Via, you should eat first.
- Just eat, there’s plenty more.

307
00:16:43,744 --> 00:16:46,079
Girls, thank you so much
for picking up Via, okay?

308
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:49,127
It’s fine, and we’re excited too.

309
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:50,521
Is she ready?

310
00:16:50,546 --> 00:16:51,547
Yes, she’s ready.

311
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:53,631
She’s already dressed.

312
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:14,527
Wow.

313
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:16,404
Oh my god.

314
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,826
We’re frozen.

315
00:17:22,785 --> 00:17:24,162
Via.

316
00:17:25,872 --> 00:17:28,124
Via, you look so beautiful.

317
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:29,542
Are you the debutante?

318
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:32,879
Jeez. You guys look beautiful too.

319
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,756
Your hair looks great.

320
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:37,133
Papa did my hair.

321
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:38,134
What?

322
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:39,761
Uncle, you know how?

323
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:42,472
Of course. I used to help her mom,

324
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:44,766
so I learned how to do hair.

325
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:47,685
By the way, Pres is coming later.

326
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:49,270
He’ll probably check her out.

327
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:56,569
But she’s moved on already.

328
00:17:58,071 --> 00:17:59,322
Pa, we’ll go ahead.

329
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:00,490
Oh, okay.

330
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,449
Bye.

331
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:02,867
- Take care, okay?
- Thanks again.

332
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:03,618
Uncle, goodbye.

333
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:04,118
Enjoy.

334
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:05,495
- What are we going to do?
- Hurry.

335
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,705
- Pa, bye.
- Just be careful, girls, okay?

336
00:18:16,297 --> 00:18:18,466
Wow, it’s so beautiful.

337
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:23,304
Oh!

338
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:25,681
You're wearing contact lenses?

339
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,059
Yes, I'm wearing them.

340
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:29,685
I don’t really use them much.

341
00:18:29,685 --> 00:18:31,187
I’m not comfortable wearing them.

342
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:33,415
But I put them on for now.

343
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:34,899
Beautiful. It suits you.

344
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:38,402
What is this? Smells rich. Like—

345
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:40,071
Where’s the after party?

346
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:41,405
Let’s go to the after party.

347
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:42,907
It’s a drinking party,

348
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:44,524
and we’re not allowed to drink yet.

349
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:47,912
Where are they now?
Where’s Arkin?

350
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:48,871
Is Arkin coming?

351
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,873
I can’t contact him either.

352
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:52,708
Have you talked to Arkin yet?

353
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:53,969
Huh?

354
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:57,713
Not yet. It’s been a while
since we last talked.

355
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:07,461
Wow. Yanna looks amazing.

356
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:09,430
Are you talking about me?

357
00:19:09,892 --> 00:19:11,494
Front stabbers, huh.

358
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,105
Wow. So dramatic.
We just missed you.

359
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:16,999
Via!

360
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:21,237
Wow. You look so beautiful,
like a guest of honor.

361
00:19:21,445 --> 00:19:22,822
Hi, ma’am. Hello.

362
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:27,410
These two helped me get ready.

363
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:28,870
In the car.

364
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:29,912
- And me?
- Approved.

365
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:31,122
No one’s gonna compliment me?

366
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:32,498
Huh? Huh?

367
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:35,376
Sevi, it’s okay.
Your outfit’s fine.

368
00:19:35,406 --> 00:19:36,423
It’s good.

369
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:39,797
I should be the one
doing the 18 shots

370
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:42,258
because I can handle all 18.

371
00:19:42,258 --> 00:19:44,886
Huh? You can’t even drink much.

372
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:46,888
- Huh? Says who?
- I can drink more than you.

373
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,347
- That’s true.
- Okay, then. Let’s see.

374
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:49,015
Right?

375
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:50,725
So?
You’re so full of yourself.

376
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:52,143
Hey! Sorry, I’m late.

377
00:19:52,143 --> 00:19:53,686
- Hey, bro! You made it.
- Hey!

378
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:55,938
Hello.

379
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:57,398
Hey.

380
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:20,588
Bro, come with me for a bit.

381
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:21,339
Where, bro?

382
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:22,173
Just over there. Come on.

383
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:23,424
Go with him already.

384
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:26,844
What’s up with that?

385
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:28,638
Are you two fighting?

386
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:31,182
What did I miss?

387
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:31,933
Huh?

388
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:32,850
What was that?

389
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,643
What?

390
00:20:33,643 --> 00:20:34,977
Why are you ignoring each other?

391
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:36,479
Huh? No, we’re not.

392
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:37,939
We’re not.

393
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,983
Know what, let’s just
enjoy the night.

394
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:42,902
I’m excited to see Sam later.

395
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:44,737
Right, we’re all
so pretty. Let’s go!

396
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,854
Sam, ever since I met you,

397
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:02,189
you’ve always been
the sunshine of our group.

398
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,651
Always kind, calm,

399
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:09,238
and you always
put others before yourself.

400
00:22:10,323 --> 00:22:12,408
Even when I know you’re tired,

401
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:14,660
you still make sure we’re okay.

402
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:16,203
Thank you so much.

403
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:18,414
Thank you for
being that kind of friend.

404
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:22,960
You deserve all the happiness
and love in this world.

405
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:25,629
I’m happy I met you.

406
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:27,965
Thank you so much.
We love you.

407
00:22:28,257 --> 00:22:31,344
Happy birthday. Happy debut.
I wish you happiness.

408
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:29,402
Happy birthday, bitch.

409
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,991
Cheers!

410
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,910
Cheers!

411
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,830
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

412
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,498
Cheers.

413
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:48,838
First of all I wanna thank all of you
for coming here tonight—

414
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:51,632
for going out of
your way for the debut

415
00:23:51,632 --> 00:23:54,260
of our only daughter, Samantha.

416
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:57,847
Sam, happy 18th birthday,
sweetheart.

417
00:23:57,847 --> 00:24:02,560
My wish for you is that you
continue to shine like mommy.

418
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:07,314
And that you walk with grace and
confidence in everything that you do.

419
00:24:08,065 --> 00:24:12,778
And I wish you everything,
the best that this life could offer.

420
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:14,530
Because for me, you’re perfect.

421
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:19,076
And also if there’s one thing
that I want you to remember,

422
00:24:19,076 --> 00:24:21,704
Sam, never forget yourself.

423
00:24:23,456 --> 00:24:26,125
Don’t forget our family.

424
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,419
Our name.

425
00:24:29,503 --> 00:24:35,801
Because you are Selene Vera
and Senator Vera’s daughter.

426
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:37,094
Only daughter.

427
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:41,599
And we love you so much.

428
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,662
Okay?

429
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:43,934
Kiss mom.

430
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:47,062
Isn’t she perfect, you guys?

431
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,690
She is so beautiful, right?

432
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,861
You look so beautiful, sweetheart.

433
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:08,918
Thank you everyone for
celebrating today with me.

434
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:12,630
I hope you enjoyed this
special day as much as I did.

435
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:16,383
Let’s go, Sam!

436
00:25:19,303 --> 00:25:22,640
But the night is not over yet.

437
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,891
It’s just getting started.

438
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:28,270
So, let’s get ready to party!

439
00:25:31,524 --> 00:25:33,025
Party!

440
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:43,827
- Birthday!
- Happy birthday!

441
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,177
I wonder where Kino’s at…

442
00:26:03,138 --> 00:26:05,266
Happy birthday, Sam!

443
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:10,396
- Happy birthday, Sam.
- She’s already drunk.

444
00:26:10,396 --> 00:26:11,564
Happy birthday, Sam.

445
00:26:11,564 --> 00:26:13,649
- Happy birthday, Sam.
- Yanna, I think you should sit down.

446
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:14,817
Sit down for now.

447
00:26:14,817 --> 00:26:15,943
Seriously…

448
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:19,530
There’s more.

449
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:22,950
Wow, you’re strong.

450
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,368
Yanna, what does that taste like?

451
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,913
You’ll try it when you’re eighteen.
Drink some water first.

452
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:29,206
- Youngsters!
- Stingy.

453
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:30,833
Guys, I forgot to tell you,

454
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:34,670
Kierra’s in my hotel room,
just taking care of something.

455
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,132
But why are we missing someone?

456
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:39,258
Where’s Arkin?

457
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:41,093
Oh yeah, where’s he?

458
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:45,389
Arkin said he went home
first but he’ll be back later.

459
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:49,810
Wait guys.

460
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,811
Here.

461
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:52,313
- This one!
- What’s that?

462
00:26:52,313 --> 00:26:54,565
I tried this earlier.
It’s so good.

463
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:55,858
Try this, guys, come on!

464
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:58,152
This is really good.

465
00:26:58,152 --> 00:26:59,403
Sam, what are you doing?

466
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:03,157
You keep giving out alcohol,
I’m getting dizzy.

467
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:06,368
Can I try that, Sam?

468
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,871
Of course, this is for you!

469
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:09,872
No!

470
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:11,749
Wait a minute.

471
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:13,751
Just this for now. A mocktail.

472
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:16,503
No, no. No, just a mocktail.

473
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:17,671
- Much better.
- Mocktail.

474
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:18,505
Youngsters!

475
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:19,673
Ignore them, don’t listen to them.

476
00:27:20,591 --> 00:27:21,967
Where did you get that, Luna?

477
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:23,218
From the waiter.

478
00:27:25,804 --> 00:27:27,097
Mocktail for you.

479
00:27:27,556 --> 00:27:28,766
Hold on. I’ll be back.

480
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:33,020
Come on, let’s party
before this ends.

481
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:37,441
Hey!

482
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:38,442
I’m sorry.

483
00:27:38,442 --> 00:27:40,069
Oh, Pres, it’s you.

484
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:42,363
I’m sorry, I didn’t see you.

485
00:27:42,821 --> 00:27:45,407
Just call me Acel,
I’m not your president anymore.

486
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:48,369
Chevy!

487
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:52,289
Via—

488
00:27:52,956 --> 00:27:54,583
It’s nice to see you
but I gotta get going.

489
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,335
- Sure.
- See you again next time.

490
00:27:59,755 --> 00:28:00,631
What’s up?

491
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:01,882
Wait, how do I look tonight?

492
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:04,426
Is it good?

493
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:07,471
What? What’s wrong?

494
00:28:08,263 --> 00:28:10,015
I don’t feel anything anymore.

495
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,601
I really don’t have
a crush on Pres anymore.

496
00:28:13,727 --> 00:28:17,189
Know what, it’s fine.
Let’s go, I’m really hungry.

497
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:25,197
Via! Via.

498
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:28,742
Let’s go up to my hotel room.
We’re the only ones left here.

499
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:30,452
Okay, let’s go.

500
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:31,453
Let’s go.

501
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,042
Just a sip, okay?

502
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,086
Finish your shot!

503
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:41,505
Hold on. I’m teaching Via.

504
00:28:41,505 --> 00:28:43,298
You’re making Yanna mad,
quiet down already.

505
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:44,591
You ladle-face!

506
00:28:45,175 --> 00:28:46,135
So annoying.

507
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,469
- You do it like this.
- Okay, go.

508
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:49,096
Grab a lemon.

509
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:50,556
- Okay. Then?
- Like this.

510
00:28:50,556 --> 00:28:51,557
And then…

511
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:55,477
- Wow, learn from the master, Via.
- There’s some left.

512
00:28:58,147 --> 00:28:59,148
Your turn.

513
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:04,319
- Okay, Via’s turn. Go! Good job!
- Let’s go, Via!

514
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:08,073
- Via, Via!
- Via, Via, shot, shot!

515
00:29:08,073 --> 00:29:09,324
- Shot, shot.
- Say what?

516
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:10,868
- Put it— on the—
- Here you go.

517
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:13,287
Step by step.

518
00:29:14,831 --> 00:29:15,923
Go, Via.

519
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:19,460
- Drink, you’re so slow!
- Come on!

520
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:22,312
Here’s the salt.

521
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:23,338
What?

522
00:29:24,715 --> 00:29:25,698
Hey!

523
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,349
You’re back.

524
00:29:29,094 --> 00:29:30,804
Have a drink already. Shot.

525
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:31,555
Shot!

526
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:33,056
- Catch up, man.
- Let’s go! Let’s go.

527
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,310
Via, can we talk for a moment?

528
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,485
Go on, guys. Talk about it.

529
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:45,527
- We’re good here.
- Go!

530
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:46,987
Right? Right? It’s all good, right?

531
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:47,988
Yes!

532
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:49,323
- Do the shot!
- Do the shot!

533
00:29:49,323 --> 00:29:50,532
Drink!

534
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:51,533
Go!

535
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,373
Don’t waste the alcohol.

536
00:29:58,373 --> 00:29:59,792
- Yeah.
- Just take the shot first.

537
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:00,918
Drink it, girl!

538
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:02,049
Huh?

539
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:04,838
Huh? Huh?

540
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,178
Sevi—

541
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:12,763
What are we supposed to talk about—

542
00:30:13,222 --> 00:30:14,223
You guys—

543
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:16,558
What is it?

544
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:18,936
What do you want to talk about?

545
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,188
Hey! Hey!

546
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,733
What are you doing?

547
00:30:27,653 --> 00:30:28,862
You were right, Via.

548
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,449
I don’t like you.

549
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,452
I was probably just
confused back then.

550
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:42,209
And I never liked you at all.

551
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:48,006
I’m not gonna say it
again so please…

552
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:50,926
Enough of this.

553
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:54,555
How long are we
going to be like this?

554
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:57,057
Because Via,

555
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,269
I can’t do this anymore.

556
00:31:02,187 --> 00:31:05,023
Are you just saying that
because you want things to go back

557
00:31:05,023 --> 00:31:06,149
to how we used to be?

558
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:08,151
No, no.

559
00:31:10,028 --> 00:31:11,488
I like someone else.

560
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:14,658
I just thought it was you.

561
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,953
I just thought so.

562
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,583
Maybe I just got used to having
you around so I got confused.

563
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:31,300
Okay.

564
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:35,512
So, are we good now?

565
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:39,867
Yeah.

566
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:44,396
Finally, thanks.

567
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:50,444
But who is it that you like?

568
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:52,654
Seriously, Kino.

569
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:53,822
Is it Naya?

570
00:31:56,617 --> 00:32:00,120
Wow, you can’t even answer.

571
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,204
So it’s her?

572
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:04,333
So you don’t want to tell me yet.

573
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,126
Come on, let’s go.

574
00:32:28,607 --> 00:32:29,691
Take a shot!

575
00:32:29,942 --> 00:32:31,276
- They’re okay now.
- Catch up.

576
00:32:31,276 --> 00:32:34,279
- Hey, they’re okay now.
- Catch up with us.

577
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:36,490
- Too slow, man!
- Take a shot!

578
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:47,250
Papa left us.

579
00:32:48,537 --> 00:32:50,038
I never thought it was possible.

580
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:55,926
Realizing that you’re not
really meant to be together

581
00:32:55,926 --> 00:32:57,803
even if you already have kids.

582
00:33:04,468 --> 00:33:06,178
I’m so sorry, Sev.

583
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:08,981
We’re just here
if you need anything, okay?

584
00:33:09,858 --> 00:33:11,526
We’re going to listen.

585
00:33:15,153 --> 00:33:17,656
I don’t really have
anything else to say.

586
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:22,035
I just really feel
bad for my siblings.

587
00:33:24,162 --> 00:33:26,331
But maybe Yanna
has something to say.

588
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:28,458
I saw her at the billiards hall
fighting with someone.

589
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:31,878
You wanna say something, Yanna?

590
00:33:39,011 --> 00:33:46,226
I just feel like no guy
will ever genuinely love me.

591
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:48,562
Because—

592
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:50,699
Because of my past.

593
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:55,901
You all heard about it
back in high school, right?

594
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,781
My mom—

595
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:06,605
posed for adult magazines.

596
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:16,214
So people look at me like…

597
00:34:20,886 --> 00:34:23,055
I’m indecent.

598
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:32,898
I only survived high school because—

599
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,282
because I met you guys.

600
00:34:50,207 --> 00:34:51,458
Yanna—

601
00:34:53,043 --> 00:34:54,669
We love you.

602
00:34:55,003 --> 00:34:57,089
We’re here for you.

603
00:34:58,215 --> 00:35:02,427
And the real love you’re
looking for, that’s us.

604
00:35:02,886 --> 00:35:04,638
We’ll give that to you.

605
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:12,979
Thank you.

606
00:35:17,442 --> 00:35:21,279
I feel lighter now that I got
to share this with you.

607
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,911
How about you, Sam?

608
00:35:37,963 --> 00:35:40,674
I don’t like what’s
going on in my family.

609
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,011
I have a half-sister.

610
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:49,641
But she’s distant to me.

611
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:57,632
I can’t even introduce
her to you, guys.

612
00:35:58,483 --> 00:35:59,943
‘Cause my dad hides her.

613
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:06,783
My parents control
everything in my life.

614
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:11,913
So, I had to sell myself out.

615
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,668
So I could choose my
own program and move out.

616
00:36:19,796 --> 00:36:22,090
Even my freedom has a price.

617
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:26,295
And it sucks so much.

618
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:33,810
I know I don’t really open
up to you guys.

619
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:36,383
It’s hard for me.

620
00:36:38,565 --> 00:36:41,735
You know how it is, I just don’t
wanna be a burden to anyone.

621
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:45,724
Sam, what are you talking about?

622
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:49,743
You’re not a burden, okay?
You’re not a burden.

623
00:36:50,452 --> 00:36:53,788
You can open up to us,
to me, anytime.

624
00:36:54,873 --> 00:36:57,209
I don’t really have
big problems anyway.

625
00:36:58,793 --> 00:37:01,421
Maybe there’s one thing.

626
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:07,886
I don’t really see my parents much
because they’re busy with work.

627
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:14,976
But it’s fine with me. It’s okay.

628
00:37:16,645 --> 00:37:18,855
It’s not really a big problem.

629
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:21,358
So don’t worry about it, okay?

630
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:25,612
How about you, Via?

631
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:27,697
Don’t you have anything to say?

632
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:42,545
I don’t know what to say.

633
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:48,969
Maybe I just want to clear up

634
00:37:50,845 --> 00:37:53,848
that I hope you can be
a little more patient with me.

635
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:58,520
I’m not someone who gets
comfortable with people quickly.

636
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:01,147
My whole life,

637
00:38:02,232 --> 00:38:04,484
Kino has always been
the only one I’m with.

638
00:38:05,235 --> 00:38:08,780
He’s the only person
I ever called a friend.

639
00:38:10,156 --> 00:38:12,450
So I’m still not used to

640
00:38:13,702 --> 00:38:14,703
having others.

641
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,211
I’m the eldest
among my siblings.

642
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:29,592
My mom is gone.

643
00:38:30,593 --> 00:38:34,931
So I’m the one who
takes care of my siblings.

644
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:39,477
My dad works in construction,

645
00:38:39,477 --> 00:38:42,230
so he’s barely
home the entire day.

646
00:38:44,983 --> 00:38:48,111
I’m basically standing
as a mother to my siblings,

647
00:38:48,111 --> 00:38:53,283
so sometimes I really
need to go home early.

648
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:05,003
I still don’t know what course
I want to take in college.

649
00:39:07,297 --> 00:39:11,718
But I heard you
applied for architecture?

650
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:15,388
Yeah, I did. Architecture.

651
00:39:15,388 --> 00:39:17,515
I know how to draw.

652
00:39:18,975 --> 00:39:21,728
I can do other things too, but…

653
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:26,191
But I still haven’t figured out
what direction I want.

654
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,568
It’s not clear yet.

655
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:33,031
Maybe it’s because my whole life

656
00:39:33,031 --> 00:39:39,829
I was focused on my family and
taking care of my siblings.

657
00:39:41,456 --> 00:39:46,544
I lost the time to look for
and explore…

658
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:51,549
what I really want.

659
00:39:58,264 --> 00:40:00,051
Where I’m actually good at.

660
00:40:05,049 --> 00:40:06,301
Come on, Via.

661
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:10,276
As long as you keep
trying, that’s enough.

662
00:40:12,614 --> 00:40:16,950
I’m scared that while
I’m taking Architecture,

663
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,747
I might suddenly realize…

664
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:21,758
Realize what I actually want.

665
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,551
I’m scared that…

666
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:27,690
That I might suddenly lose interest.

667
00:40:28,628 --> 00:40:30,463
Don’t lead with fear.

668
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,404
Trust yourself that you’ll
figure it out someday.

669
00:40:34,676 --> 00:40:36,845
Just take it one step at a time.

670
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:40,680
You know, this is also
a reminder for myself.

671
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,194
I don’t have anything to say.

672
00:40:47,189 --> 00:40:49,673
Maybe when I get
a problem someday.

673
00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:53,027
Same here.

674
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:56,906
I don’t really have a problem.

675
00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:02,175
If you guys ever have a problem,

676
00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:05,498
we’re always here to listen, okay?

677
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:16,325
I’m happy because this is
the kind of friendship we have.

678
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:21,071
Oh no, she’s crying.

679
00:41:21,723 --> 00:41:22,932
So are you!

680
00:41:27,097 --> 00:41:28,682
I love you guys.

681
00:41:33,443 --> 00:41:35,695
I love you guys, too.

682
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,239
Sevi!

683
00:41:38,656 --> 00:41:39,866
Oh, come on.

684
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:43,661
You’re making me tear up, too.
I was okay!

685
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:45,121
Stop making me tear up.

686
00:41:45,121 --> 00:41:47,290
- I’m fine!
- Everybody!

687
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,708
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

688
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,084
Let’s drink to this!

689
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:50,877
- Shot!
- Shot!

690
00:41:50,877 --> 00:41:52,003
We look so ugly.

691
00:41:52,003 --> 00:41:53,213
- Let’s take a shot.
- Via, Arkin.

692
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,797
We don’t wanna look ugly.

693
00:42:13,775 --> 00:42:15,693
Oh. Arkin, you’re here.

694
00:42:16,154 --> 00:42:17,180
Hi, Pa.

695
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:19,656
You two were fighting
for quite a while.

696
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,784
Good thing you’re okay now.
What were you even fighting about?

697
00:42:23,368 --> 00:42:24,869
It’s nothing, Pa.

698
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:27,407
It was just a small
misunderstanding, Pa.

699
00:42:27,622 --> 00:42:32,252
Don’t worry. What matters
is we’re okay now.

700
00:42:32,544 --> 00:42:33,670
Okay.

701
00:42:35,296 --> 00:42:36,506
- Wait, Aidan’s crying.
- I’ll go.

702
00:42:36,506 --> 00:42:37,966
No, I got it. Papa
will take care of it.

703
00:42:37,966 --> 00:42:39,092
I’ll leave this here.
You kids take care of it.

704
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:39,884
Okay.

705
00:42:39,884 --> 00:42:41,052
- All right.
- Just a moment.

706
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:13,157
Kino, you’re lucky, you know that?

707
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,671
You already know what
you want to do in life,

708
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:18,464
and you’re good at everything.

709
00:43:19,507 --> 00:43:20,967
Not everything.

710
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:23,011
I’m lucky because I have you.

711
00:43:23,595 --> 00:43:25,221
If you weren’t around,

712
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:27,432
I probably wouldn’t know
what to do either.

713
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:30,977
Of course you would.

714
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:32,645
When you become an actor,

715
00:43:32,979 --> 00:43:34,606
I might actually be
your number one fan.

716
00:43:35,648 --> 00:43:38,985
The question is, do I
even want to be an actor?

717
00:43:40,111 --> 00:43:41,904
I know I’m handsome, Via.

718
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:46,492
But you also know
I’d still choose studying.

719
00:43:46,701 --> 00:43:48,036
And you better!

720
00:43:48,036 --> 00:43:51,706
If you dare mess up your studies,
I’ll really get mad.

721
00:43:52,123 --> 00:43:53,416
Study first. I promise.

722
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:54,876
- Promise?
- I promise.

723
00:43:57,545 --> 00:43:58,546
By the way,

724
00:43:58,546 --> 00:44:01,633
the entrance exam results
are coming out soon.

725
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:04,802
I’m claiming it already.

726
00:44:05,053 --> 00:44:07,889
We’re both getting into
the school we want.

727
00:44:13,144 --> 00:44:21,819
You, from the past,
the present, and forever.

728
00:44:23,237 --> 00:44:24,238
Your new song?

729
00:44:24,489 --> 00:44:26,991
Just now. That line was nice.

730
00:44:27,408 --> 00:44:30,536
You, through the past,
the present, and forever.

731
00:44:38,836 --> 00:44:42,298
We passed España!

732
00:44:42,298 --> 00:44:44,008
I’m so happy!

733
00:44:44,008 --> 00:44:46,928
Oh my gosh. Dream school.
Is this real?

734
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:49,097
Hey!

735
00:44:49,097 --> 00:44:51,140
Why do you look sad?

736
00:44:51,808 --> 00:44:53,309
Of course, I’m happy.

737
00:44:53,685 --> 00:44:55,353
But I’m still waiting for
the results from Diliman.

738
00:44:55,353 --> 00:44:56,729
It’s free there, right?

739
00:44:56,729 --> 00:44:59,482
So it’ll help Papa save money.

740
00:44:59,982 --> 00:45:01,150
You’ll pass.

741
00:45:01,787 --> 00:45:03,414
If you don’t, I’ll protest.

742
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:07,080
“Let Via pass.”
“Let her pass.”

743
00:45:07,502 --> 00:45:09,796
Hey! Prom night!

744
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:16,541
Oh no, February 18?

745
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:18,751
That’s the day before my birthday.

746
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:20,002
What if it goes on ‘til midnight?

747
00:45:20,002 --> 00:45:21,212
Are you going?

748
00:45:21,212 --> 00:45:22,964
I don’t have anyone to go with,

749
00:45:23,073 --> 00:45:25,283
so I kind of don’t
want to go anymore.

750
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:26,426
I’ll go with you.

751
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:27,694
Huh?

752
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:28,928
Did you already ask Naya?

753
00:45:28,928 --> 00:45:30,096
You should invite her!

754
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:32,890
Why? Can’t you be my date?

755
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,601
Isn’t it that when you go to prom,

756
00:45:35,601 --> 00:45:39,272
you have to go with
the person you like?

757
00:45:40,732 --> 00:45:41,899
You’re shy, aren’t you?

758
00:45:41,899 --> 00:45:43,067
Do you want me to help you?

759
00:45:43,067 --> 00:45:44,402
We can plan your promposal.

760
00:45:44,402 --> 00:45:46,696
No. I got it.
I can handle it.

761
00:45:47,155 --> 00:45:49,282
- Are you sure?
- Arkin can handle it.

762
00:45:51,284 --> 00:45:52,285
Wait.

763
00:45:52,285 --> 00:45:55,079
Is it okay if we all go together?

764
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:56,581
Just the three of us?

765
00:46:00,918 --> 00:46:01,711
I’m already excited.

766
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:02,628
I wonder what outfits we’ll wear.

767
00:46:02,628 --> 00:46:03,671
What should we wear?

768
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:04,964
Oh, right, Via.

769
00:46:05,798 --> 00:46:07,133
I just remembered something.

770
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:08,092
What?

771
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:10,511
Mom said that
if we’ll go to prom,

772
00:46:11,137 --> 00:46:13,639
she’ll buy your prom dress.
She said you can’t say no.

773
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:14,640
Huh?

774
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,893
- That’s nice.
- Okay?

775
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:18,603
Okay.

776
00:46:27,737 --> 00:46:29,989
Auntie, thank you so much.

777
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:33,117
Thank you for everything you’ve
done for me and my siblings.

778
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:35,036
I’m happy to do it, Via.

779
00:46:35,036 --> 00:46:36,954
You’re already a part of our family.

780
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:41,876
I’m sure your mom
would be really happy.

781
00:46:42,084 --> 00:46:44,086
If only she could see you now.

782
00:46:45,296 --> 00:46:48,466
Her daughter has grown up to be
such a beautiful young lady.

783
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,057
Via, can you promise me one thing?

784
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,350
What is it, Auntie?

785
00:46:58,518 --> 00:47:00,311
Enjoy your prom, okay?

786
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:04,232
I will.

787
00:47:04,732 --> 00:47:06,234
Thank you so much.

788
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:12,114
- You better go, you might be late.
- Thank you.

789
00:47:12,448 --> 00:47:13,157
- Take care.
- Bye.

790
00:47:13,157 --> 00:47:14,158
Thanks again.

791
00:48:59,597 --> 00:49:01,140
You look beautiful.

792
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,434
Your outfit looks great.

793
00:49:04,518 --> 00:49:05,937
Just my outfit?

794
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:08,856
All right, ladies and gentlemen

795
00:49:08,856 --> 00:49:12,151
may we go back to our respective
seats as our program

796
00:49:12,151 --> 00:49:13,861
- is about to begin.
- Hi, Arkin!

797
00:49:13,861 --> 00:49:15,321
Hi, Via.

798
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,781
So, shall we?

799
00:49:18,925 --> 00:49:20,368
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

800
00:49:34,006 --> 00:49:35,049
Best dressed.

801
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:36,175
Wait a minute.

802
00:49:36,175 --> 00:49:37,635
Personality.

803
00:49:40,012 --> 00:49:41,555
Right, personality?

804
00:49:41,555 --> 00:49:42,556
Thank you.

805
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:57,196
And our next award
is the face of the night!

806
00:49:57,947 --> 00:50:00,074
And the winner is...

807
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:03,202
Avianna Diaz!

808
00:50:04,996 --> 00:50:05,788
It’s you!

809
00:50:05,788 --> 00:50:06,580
Go in front!

810
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,957
- Why me?
- It’s you!

811
00:50:07,957 --> 00:50:08,666
Why me?

812
00:50:08,666 --> 00:50:09,542
Hurry up!

813
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:10,573
- Huh?
- It’s you.

814
00:50:16,716 --> 00:50:19,385
- Via, Via!
- So beautiful!

815
00:50:29,186 --> 00:50:31,063
I just wanna go home.

816
00:50:34,316 --> 00:50:35,109
Thank you.

817
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:37,194
Once again, congratulations, Via!

818
00:50:37,194 --> 00:50:38,446
You may now have your seat.

819
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:40,281
Go, Via!

820
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:41,866
- So pretty!
- Congrats, Via!

821
00:50:41,866 --> 00:50:43,993
- Congratulations, Via.
- Thank you.

822
00:50:43,993 --> 00:50:45,286
That’s my friend.

823
00:50:45,286 --> 00:50:46,287
Let me see.

824
00:50:46,287 --> 00:50:48,164
Wow, gorgeous!

825
00:50:48,164 --> 00:50:49,623
How about this—

826
00:50:49,623 --> 00:50:50,833
Nice dress.

827
00:50:53,419 --> 00:50:57,339
And now, It’s the moment
we’ve been waiting for.

828
00:50:57,798 --> 00:51:04,305
With a landslide of votes,
our Prom King and Queen are—

829
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:08,934
Larkin Sanchez and Naya Madrigal!

830
00:51:27,953 --> 00:51:29,371
They deserve it!

831
00:51:40,758 --> 00:51:44,303
May we request our
Prom King and Queen

832
00:51:44,303 --> 00:51:46,680
to have their first dance together.

833
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:51,227
Once again, let’s give it up
for Larkin and Naya!

834
00:52:03,364 --> 00:52:04,990
They’re so sweet.

835
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:07,076
So sweet.

836
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:17,086
Kino really looks
all grown up now.

837
00:52:17,517 --> 00:52:19,707
He’s not that runny-nosed
little kid anymore.

838
00:52:20,464 --> 00:52:24,885
Before, I used to feel sad about
how our lives were changing.

839
00:52:25,094 --> 00:52:29,140
But now, I’m slowly
starting to accept it.

840
00:52:36,313 --> 00:52:38,649
He really likes Naya.

841
00:52:38,649 --> 00:52:40,818
I’m happy for Kino.

842
00:52:40,818 --> 00:52:44,530
The important thing is that
our friendship is still okay.

843
00:52:57,084 --> 00:52:58,002
Excuse me.

844
00:52:58,002 --> 00:52:59,461
I’ll just step outside for a bit.

845
00:53:11,182 --> 00:53:12,349
Ow!

846
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:41,466
You already got hurt.

847
00:53:42,296 --> 00:53:43,589
I have a band-aid here.

848
00:53:49,974 --> 00:53:51,768
Why do you have a band-aid?

849
00:53:52,056 --> 00:53:54,099
Because I know you’re not
used to wearing heels.

850
00:54:24,296 --> 00:54:25,673
Thanks.

851
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:42,398
Go back inside, your partner
might be looking for you.

852
00:54:44,733 --> 00:54:46,318
Why are you bossing me around?

853
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:52,825
Are you mad?

854
00:54:53,284 --> 00:54:54,285
No.

855
00:54:56,537 --> 00:54:57,955
I’m just annoyed because

856
00:54:58,956 --> 00:55:02,418
we agreed to be each other’s first.

857
00:55:03,919 --> 00:55:06,171
And now my first dance ended up
being with someone else.

858
00:55:08,966 --> 00:55:09,967
Wow.

859
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:11,927
What can I do?

860
00:55:12,469 --> 00:55:16,724
Is it my fault
you became Prom King?

861
00:55:17,266 --> 00:55:18,892
What do you want me to do?

862
00:55:20,227 --> 00:55:21,645
What do I want?

863
00:55:25,566 --> 00:55:27,109
Dance with me now.

864
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:28,068
Huh?

865
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,696
I don’t want to.

866
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:35,034
Perfect timing.
There’s music.

867
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:44,418
Can I have this dance,
Ms. Face of the Night?

868
00:55:49,256 --> 00:55:51,884
Sure, Prom King.

869
00:55:54,803 --> 00:55:55,888
Is your foot okay now?

870
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,433
It’s fine.

871
00:56:06,273 --> 00:56:07,649
Is it okay if I hold you?

872
00:56:56,281 --> 00:56:58,075
Happy birthday, Kino.

873
00:57:00,661 --> 00:57:02,204
Thank you, Via.

874
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:07,084
What now,

875
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:09,670
I’m just going to be
your second dance then.

876
00:57:10,087 --> 00:57:11,338
For the dance, yes.

877
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:13,632
But in my mind,

878
00:57:14,216 --> 00:57:15,759
you’re first in everything.

879
00:57:40,534 --> 00:57:43,078
How am I supposed
to get over this, Via?

880
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:06,393
Kino.

881
00:58:06,935 --> 00:58:07,936
Hm?

882
00:58:10,022 --> 00:58:14,902
I’m happy we’re still friends
even after everything.

883
00:58:17,696 --> 00:58:18,697
Kino?

884
00:58:18,697 --> 00:58:19,698
Huh?

885
00:58:19,698 --> 00:58:20,908
I hope

886
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:24,203
even after we graduate high school,

887
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,957
nothing will change, okay?

888
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:32,679
Of course.

889
01:00:29,023 --> 01:00:29,828
Kikiam is really good.

890
01:00:29,828 --> 01:00:31,288
- This is my favorite.
- So good, dude!

891
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:32,914
Hey, bro,

892
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:34,499
my game
is coming up.

893
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:35,876
You better watch, okay?

894
01:00:36,209 --> 01:00:37,210
Of course.

895
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,421
Even if you play like a noob,
I’ll still watch you, bro.

896
01:00:39,421 --> 01:00:42,215
Noob? You’ve seen me play, right?

897
01:00:43,258 --> 01:00:45,719
Do you already have a girlfriend
who’ll cheer for you there?

898
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:47,846
None, bro. I’m focused on
basketball right now.

899
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,349
And you? When you get to college

900
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:52,531
you might start looking for
someone right away.

901
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,816
Bro, it’s still her.

902
01:01:00,275 --> 01:01:01,276
It’s only her.

903
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,168
Who? Via?

904
01:01:07,574 --> 01:01:10,035
What the! I thought you took it
back after you confessed?

905
01:01:10,452 --> 01:01:14,206
I did, but my feelings for her
didn’t go away.

906
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,752
I only took it back so
we wouldn’t ruin our friendship.

907
01:01:20,629 --> 01:01:22,881
Bro, looks like you’re never
getting over that.

908
01:01:30,305 --> 01:01:31,723
Sir, can I get more of that?

909
01:01:32,635 --> 01:01:34,137
Kikiam!

910
01:01:37,437 --> 01:01:38,715
I want you to listen to this.

911
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,033
I wrote it.

912
01:01:41,817 --> 01:01:46,822
Left thinking in the
midst of the chaos…

913
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:49,825
Don’t take this off, okay?

914
01:01:50,659 --> 01:01:52,077
I’m your only best friend.

915
01:01:53,578 --> 01:01:55,455
You’re important to me, Kino.

916
01:01:56,415 --> 01:01:58,583
Are you kids lost?

917
01:01:59,126 --> 01:02:00,919
- Sevi!
- Sevi!

918
01:02:00,919 --> 01:02:03,422
Welcome to college!
I missed you guys.

919
01:02:04,664 --> 01:02:06,833
Let’s try to meet up often, please.

920
01:02:07,092 --> 01:02:09,720
It’s only the first day
and I already miss you.

921
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:14,307
Oh wow, his clinginess
is acting up again.

922
01:02:14,307 --> 01:02:16,476
Mom’s acquaintance
who’s a talent manager

923
01:02:16,476 --> 01:02:18,109
wants me to join a workshop.

924
01:02:18,645 --> 01:02:19,646
Really?

925
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,606
I seriously have
a girl crush on this person.

926
01:02:21,606 --> 01:02:22,983
Who?

927
01:02:22,983 --> 01:02:26,069
What? You don’t know
Clea Zorel Aguilar?

928
01:02:26,177 --> 01:02:27,345
How about you, Kino?

929
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:29,631
Do you like someone—

930
01:02:29,656 --> 01:02:30,907
You.
