1
00:00:04,495 --> 00:00:06,198
(spotlight lighting sound)

2
00:00:07,198 --> 00:00:10,594
(Musashi)

3
00:00:07,198 --> 00:00:10,594
Okay, okay, let's have lunch!

4
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:14,396
(Kobayashi) Let's go for ramen.

5
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:16,066
Eh!

6
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,924
Yesterday, the day before that, and the day before that

7
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,924
You went to ramen, didn't you?

8
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:20,594
Today too!

9
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:22,594
(Kobayashi) It's troublesome, I'm going on an adventure.

10
00:00:22,594 --> 00:00:24,264
Eh

11
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:26,660
oh dear

12
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:26,660
But ramen would be fine.

13
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,429
I, Kobayashi, look delicious.

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,429
If I see you eating

15
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,693
That's all

16
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,693
It'll fill you up.

17
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:35,924
What is that scary?

18
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:39,264
I want to do something interesting

19
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:43,726
Got it! Would you like to swim naked in the lake?

20
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:47,231
(Nino) Ah, thank you for your hard work.

21
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:47,231
(Musashi/Kobayashi) Thank you for your hard work

22
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:50,132
How does it feel?

23
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:50,132
It's over now

24
00:00:50,132 --> 00:00:52,924
Ah, good thing I made it in time

25
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:55,033
Ah, actually, I'll be at home next time.

26
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:58,759
music video shooting

27
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:58,759
Looks like I've decided to do it

28
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,066
This is for local residents

29
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,066
It's an audition for the role.

30
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:07,429
audition?

31
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:07,429
It's super interesting!

32
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:10,528
Well, let's do it with a typhoon.

33
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:10,528
I don't know though

34
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:14,066
Yoji Kamiya...! Yo-chan!!

35
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,726
Who is it?

36
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:17,462
I really like it

37
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:17,462
From a long time ago!

38
00:01:17,462 --> 00:01:19,561
Yoji Kamiya!

39
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:22,330
destiny? This is too dangerous!

40
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,495
It's decided. Okay, let's go, Kobayashi!

41
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:26,462
When was it decided?

42
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:26,462
(Nino) Ah, can you come out?

43
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,132
(Kobayashi) Oh no.

44
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,132
I won't come out because it's too troublesome.

45
00:01:28,132 --> 00:01:30,594
(Nino) Ah...

46
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:34,528
no~

47
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:34,528
Typhoon It's good that it happened, but...

48
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:37,594
Ah, sorry

49
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:37,594
Where is the audition venue?

50
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:40,726
Ah, over there at the front desk.

51
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:40,726
I hope you can guide me

52
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,495
thank you

53
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:45,594
Yo-chan's favorite thing is

54
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:45,594
Like a junior

55
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,891
Also, my face is small.

56
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:49,891
I thought it was cute.

57
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:49,891
I think so

58
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:51,660
thank you

59
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,066
(Tadokoro) Thank you

60
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,066
Next one

61
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:57,099
Yes, this is Takezawa Musashi.

62
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:01,759
Well, I work in the electrical field.

63
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:01,759
I am also in charge of this hotel.

64
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,924
Eh, I love Yoji Kamiya.

65
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,759
Anniversary one-man too

66
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,759
I went

67
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,462
It was the first

68
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,825
(Tadokoro) This music video

69
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,825
It's a love song

70
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,957
If you like

71
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:13,957
Unforgettable memories of love

72
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:15,627
May I ask you to tell me?

73
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:18,561
yes! ah…

74
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:21,561
One year ago at Christmas

75
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:21,561
Homemade full course

76
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:23,660
surprise her

77
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:23,660
I made it

78
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,330
(Kishimoto) That's great!

79
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,099
But she too that day

80
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,792
Food fight-like food

81
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,792
Get takeout

82
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:31,594
I feel like I'm on fire

83
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:34,000
Eat everything like you're going to die

84
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,231
I was rushed to the hospital in the middle of the night due to gastroenteritis.

85
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:41,759
But she

86
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:41,759
Thank you for coming to visit me every day

87
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,561
Something

88
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,561
That's a very important memory

89
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:46,231
It's very nice

90
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:49,264
Music video appearance

91
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:49,264
What did she say?

92
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:54,594
Ah, she... that...

93
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:58,462
like a migratory bird

94
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:58,462
flew away from me

95
00:02:58,462 --> 00:03:00,693
To the sky

96
00:02:58,462 --> 00:03:00,693
Because I started to fly away

97
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:02,660
it's okay!

98
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:02,660
(Everyone laughs)

99
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,495
Sorry for the difficult question.

100
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,495
Well, it's hard though.

101
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:09,165
But what I remember is

102
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:09,165
I'm also happy

103
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:10,858
thank you

104
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:10,858
Very nice...

105
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,099
Ah, then just one from me too.

106
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,330
Um... he's really strong, isn't he?

107
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,330
Are you training?

108
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,297
Oh just a little bit

109
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:21,165
The shock of heartbreak

110
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:21,165
turned into muscle

111
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:22,957
I go 7 days a week

112
00:03:22,957 --> 00:03:24,891
Probably 8 a week

113
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:27,957
Can I just take a quick look?

114
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:27,957
Ah, not enough to show it like that.

115
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,462
(Kishimoto) No, just a glimpse.

116
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,462
Ah, that’s it! Ah then...

117
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:32,495
(Tadokoro) Then don't push yourself too hard.

118
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:32,495
Ah, I'll show you!

119
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:35,462
Just a little dirty

120
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:35,462
Excuse me!

121
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,330
(Kishimoto) Oh!! Hahahaha

122
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,330
(Tadokoro) Wow!

123
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,363
(Kishimoto) Hahahahaha That’s amazing.

124
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,363
(Tadokoro) Wonderful

125
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:46,363
(Tadokoro) No~

126
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:46,363
(Sound of door opening)

127
00:03:46,363 --> 00:03:48,726
Sorry for being late!

128
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:52,000
Sorry!

129
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:52,000
I was delayed due to traffic regulations!

130
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,528
My name is Rena Saijo.

131
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:57,363
Yo-chan

132
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:57,363
I'm a big fan of Yoji Kamiya.

133
00:03:57,363 --> 00:04:00,627
Please let me take it!

134
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:03,660
Also as an anniversary one-man

135
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:03,660
I went

136
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,627
It was the first one!

137
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:09,594
♬〜

138
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:13,330
Yoji Kamiya's

139
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:13,330
The music video for the new song...

140
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,000
Sorry Kobayashi, I'm going home.

141
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,792
Why? a little bit

142
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:23,462
My ex-girlfriend is participating~

143
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:27,825
picture?

144
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:27,825
Look, that border.

145
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:31,891
picture…

146
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:31,891
Is it the old one? Is it recent?

147
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:35,264
Most recent 1 year ago

148
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:38,429
Ah, gastroenteritis!

149
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:38,429
That's right

150
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,957
Right after that, I got a man and got dumped.

151
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:44,759
Sorry, that's not possible at all! Sorry

152
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:49,825
Hey, I'm going home too.

153
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:49,825
Alone Tarui Tarui

154
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:52,231
(Tadokoro) Takezawa Musashi

155
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,165
What happened? Please

156
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,660
Ah, sorry, I...

157
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,693
The other person is... Rena Saijo!

158
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:03,099
Anniversary one-man

159
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:03,099
The two of us just met

160
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:05,429
(Tadokoro) Yeah.

161
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:05,429
(Kishimoto) Please!

162
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,627
thank you

163
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:15,396
《Eeeeeeeee! 》

164
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:21,165
《I couldn't go home...》

165
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:23,264
《I want to go home! 》

166
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:25,726
(Lighting sound)

167
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:30,396
"bus stop…"

168
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,165
《Confession》

169
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,198
《Confession⁉》

170
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:44,561
《I want to go home! I want to go home! 》

171
00:05:47,924 --> 00:05:50,759
《I can't go home...》

172
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,132
Are you okay?

173
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:56,000
Alright, let's start!

174
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:56,000
(sound of clapping hands)

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,660
Ah uh...

176
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,297
"Aren't we too close to be friends?"

177
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:08,660
《Holy crap!

178
00:06:05,396 --> 00:06:08,660
My lines My lines! 》

179
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,858
《No, no, no, no! 》

180
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:16,528
《I can't say it to my ex-girlfriend who dumped me.

181
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:16,528
I can't say this! 》

182
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:20,792
Sorry

183
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:20,792
They won't tell me anything.

184
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:24,429
《Huh!? Hey!

185
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:24,429
Too many auditions! 》

186
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:27,099
(Tadokoro) That's right...

187
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:30,363
(Kishimoto) Do you think it will work?

188
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:32,726
…yes!

189
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:39,363
“Oh… about me…”

190
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:41,759
《What do you say to the person who got dumped?

00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:41,759
Too humiliating! 》

“Su-su-su… you like me, right?”

193
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,660
“Did you find out?”

194
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,396
《How do you feel?

195
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,396
Are you saying that now?

196
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,627
"It's obvious..."

197
00:06:56,627 --> 00:07:00,858
"But my feelings too

198
00:06:56,627 --> 00:07:00,858
Isn't it obvious? ”

199
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:04,033
"Hey sweetheart..."

200
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,330
《No, no, no, no! 》

201
00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:16,000
This... (Sound of swallowing)

202
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:19,561
picture?

203
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:25,330
“Koibitoninarouca?”

204
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:34,462
“I’m happy about me.

205
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:34,462
Will you make me your girlfriend?”

206

"what? That face

207
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:39,297
《Why like that?

208
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:39,297
Can't you see me? 》

209
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:42,528
《Is that face really an act? 》

210
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:47,495
《Or maybe

211
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:47,495
About me yet...! 》

212
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:54,429
《Yes! 》

213
00:07:49,363 --> 00:07:54,429
《Good! 》

214
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:56,264
《Don't even eat mu anymore》

215
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:59,363
《Because the food looks delicious.

216
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:59,363
cute"

217
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:01,891
《That is the happiest thing for me》

218
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:04,198
《What is that? What is that? 》

219
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:06,726
《It comes with》

220
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:06,726
"yeah! 》

221
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:09,594
《Hehe, sorry...

222
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:09,594
What looks delicious? 》

223
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:14,297
《Rena looks happy

00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:14,297
My happiness》

《Hehe...》

226
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:25,363
"That's why you're closest to me

227
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:25,363
Will you be the happiest? ”

228
00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:29,825
It's impossible! Absolutely impossible!

229
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:33,528
Huh?

230
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:33,528
Ah, I made a mistake

231
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:38,693
"Yes, I'd be happy!"

232
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:40,693
Is it an izakaya?

233
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:43,528
(Tadokoro) Yes, it's okay.

234
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:43,528
Thank you very much!

235
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:48,429
(Kishimoto) Okay, then what's next?

236
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:48,429
With Hanako Nanao...

237
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:53,099
“Did you find out?”

238
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:53,099
"It's obvious, but..."

239
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:57,066
《Is it impossible?》

240
00:08:57,066 --> 00:09:01,726
"Because I don't have any feelings

241
00:08:57,066 --> 00:09:01,726
Can’t you do it normally with me too?”

《“With pleasure!”

Oh my back hurts already

248
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:40,561
Please use this script next time.

《Hey hey! 》

252
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,858
Oh!

253
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,528
《I see, it's Yo-chan! 》

254
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:01,363
《I want to pass! 》

255
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:04,594
《I understand, Rena! 》

256
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:07,858
Sorry

257
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:07,858
I was nervous earlier

258
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,561
Say that again, please!

259
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,561
(Kishimoto) Oh, that's good.

260
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:17,330
《Rena, I want your happy face

261
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:17,330
If you can see it, that's fine! 》

262
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,528
Hello again, let's start!

263
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,528
(sound of clapping hands)

“You know, the food is delicious too.

The one who is always waiting for me

266
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:29,792
It's the best though

267
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:33,990
more freely

268
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:33,990
I want you to live, right?"

269
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:38,528
"That's what I was thinking."

00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:43,495
``Freedom?

271
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:43,495
I want you to live as you please.”

“I

273
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:46,165
It’s not about what I want to do.”

274
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:50,099
"yeah? Something

275
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:50,099
Sounds familiar》

276
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:56,132
“I love you.”

I want you to do what you want to do

《What is this script?》

281
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:12,297

"Always what I like

Don't try to make it come true

284
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:18,264
Okay.”

285
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:24,792
《Rena, isn't this script terrible? 》

286
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:28,693
《Doesn't it look similar? 》

287
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:33,363
"that's why

288
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:33,363
It would be fine if it was decided in Hokkaido》

Great summer vacation》

"yes

《Okay

299

Let's practice being selfish》

00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:51,330
《I'm selfish if I don't have one! 》

00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,099
《My favorite place in Mu

that…

306
00:11:59,924 --> 00:12:04,396
Is there any opposition?

00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,924
(loud)

309
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:11,198
(Kishimoto) Huh? Haha...

310
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:15,561
Is it no good?

311
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:19,363
Ugh

312
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:23,066
Then start from the beginning

313
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,198
I'll start from the beginning

314
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:37,660
“You know, the food is delicious too.

I don't have it."

324
00:13:04,264 --> 00:13:06,627
“I love you.”

325
00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:11,264
“What I want to do more

00:13:06,627 --> 00:13:11,264
I want you to do it

327

Practice being selfish.”

328
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,363

Ad-lib?

"what? Rena》

344
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:13,297
I wanted to know more

345
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:20,066
Tell me

346
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:20,066
Why don't you say anything?

347
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:28,099
Hey

348
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:28,099
Why are you trying to suit me like that?

349
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:30,759
...Is that so bad?

350
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,462
what I want to do to you

351
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,462
If you want me to do it

I am

I really wanted to see Rena happy.

354
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:51,297
Do you seriously think so?

355
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:53,594
That's right

356
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:58,660
Well then

357
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:58,660
Give me a hundred steps, I'll eat the food.

358
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,066
Good travel destination too

359
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:05,429
But it's different, isn't it?

360
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:08,462
"Other man please"

361
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:10,132
Who said "go ahead"...

362
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:11,825
Because that's...

363
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:16,792
I wish you happiness

364
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:16,792
What should we do if we break up due to a misunderstanding?

365
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,023
…teeth?

366
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:31,934
《Sorry

367
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:31,934
This place doesn't seem like a good location.

368

(Tanaka)《That's right》

369
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:36,670
《A little bit for young girls

370
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:36,670
Maybe the cafe is different.

(Two people laughing)

372
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,132
《I'm sorry.

373
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,132
I made you carry your feet.》

"home"

00:15:45,066 --> 00:15:48,769
《Rena, maybe?

376
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:53,330
Were you near the back of the bar district? 》

377
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:57,703
"what? 》

378
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:02,373
"what? 》

379
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:11,033
《I was with a man.

380
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:11,033
When I saw it

381
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:13,571
"Yeah"

382
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,066
《It's like searching for something.

383
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:25,000
don't say what you want to say

384
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:25,000
in the way you say it

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,736
First of all, I was annoyed.

386
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,231
《I thought about it for a while.

387
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:33,967
I wonder if it's someone I like

388
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:37,472
Then what should I do?

389
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:42,099
"Yeah…"

390
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:47,000
《And if so

391
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:47,000
What are you going to do? 》

392
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,802
《If so

393
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:52,066
Hmm

394
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,406
It can't be helped.》

395
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:57,769
"I can't help it? 》

396
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:03,538
《I want to respect it, so I

397
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:03,538
Rena's feelings》

398
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:08,165
《...So what Rena wants to do.

399
00:17:03,538 --> 00:17:08,165
I respect it.

400
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:16,802
《Look, I want Rena to live happily.

401
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:16,802
Because that is the main premise.

402
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:23,132
《What kind of stupid thing are you saying?

403
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:26,198
All I have to say is

404
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:26,198
I knew》

405
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:31,406
"but

406
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:31,406
For Rena For Rena

407
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:34,637
I don't try to think of anything on my own

408
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:34,637
this person

409
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:39,637
How long will I forgive?

410
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:39,637
I also got angry》

411
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:51,736
《Then let's break up》

412
00:17:55,637 --> 00:17:58,439
picture? Was it wrong?

413
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:01,439
No! It's the person I work with!

414
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:03,099
Yeah, yeah!?

415
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:06,505
I accidentally misunderstood

416
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:06,505
Don't be a tragic heroine!

417
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:11,066
Tell me!

418
00:18:06,505 --> 00:18:11,066
No, because I... yeah!?

419
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:14,703
No, what? Then why?

420
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:17,264
Why do you want to break up with me...

421
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:23,439
That's what happened when I noticed it

422
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,538
Yeah...

423
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,571
I don't want to break up

424
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,571
I wish you'd told me

425
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:32,066
First of all, just ask, "Who is that person?"

426
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:32,066
If you listen

427
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:35,472
I didn't want anything to happen.

428
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:38,967
Good luck Musashi-san

429
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:48,505
It's me. That's why I'm treated kindly.

430
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:48,505
I'm happy but...

431
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:55,165
But Mu and more properly

432
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:55,165
I want to face you

433
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,406
I wanted to be there

434
00:18:57,406 --> 00:19:01,802
No... it's me Reina it's me

435
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:03,901
To be kind

436
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:07,670
Prioritizing Rena

437
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:07,670
I don't think it's bad

438
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,505
I didn't think so at all...

439
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:15,538
that's why…

440
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:20,769
If that's not good for Rena.

441
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:20,769
Fix it at all

449
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,033
But let me just say this.

Yo-chan

451
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:59,066
Because I was the one who recommended it to Rena.

452
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:04,264
Yes, certainly!

453
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:08,637
recommended by someone

454
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:08,637
It's the first time I've been so addicted to it.

455
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:11,373
Mu changed my life

456
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:22,330
Ooooh!

457
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,505
Something like this?

458
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:29,132
Yes, this is what it is!

459
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,000
Sometimes I'm selfish Part 1

460
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,967
Say what you think Part 1

461
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:44,198
