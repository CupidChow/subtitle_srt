1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
(Youji)《What is that? 》

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
(Sai)《E》

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,198
《If you draw the red lottery

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,198
Try your luck to succeed in the future

5
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:13,528
(Yoji)《Ah》

6
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:13,528
"yes"

7
00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:15,198
"now? 》

8
00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:15,198
"now"

9
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:17,000
《Eh! 》

10
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:22,033
《Then this》

11
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:22,033
《Hey then this》

12
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:24,264
《I'm going to draw it.》

13
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:24,264
《ＯＫ》

14
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:26,000
《Seno! 》

15
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,462
(Keita) Ah, how was it?

16
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:45,462
(Akira)

17
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:45,462
No, I knocked, but there was no response.

18
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,132
Eh!

19
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,132
(Ryuuka) Well...

20
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:50,231
Could you please give me an extension at the front desk?

21
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:50,231
(Ryuuka Akira) Yeah

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,495
(Akira) What about the phone?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,495
Not connected

24
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:04,132
(Keita) Hey, let's check out something.

25
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:04,132
It seems like he is doing it though

26
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,792
What?!

27
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,792
Eh, when?

28
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,627
No, I don't know

29
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:09,759
good morning

30
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:09,759
(Keita) Oh Youji

31
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,924
(Keita)

32
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,924
Hey, you haven't seen Sai, have you?

33
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:15,759
Rhinoceros? I haven't seen it

34
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:15,759
(Keita) That's right...

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,330
Hey, what's wrong?

36
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,825
(Keita) No, I feel like I'm back home.

37
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,825
What?!

38
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:23,693
(Keita) No, not yet.

39
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:23,693
I just don't understand.

40
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:25,957
Just in case

41
00:01:23,693 --> 00:01:25,957
I've been on the phone all the time, though.

42
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:28,495
(Yoji) Eh, luggage and stuff.

43
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:28,495
Does that mean no?

44
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:31,132
perhaps

45
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:31,132
(Yoji) Eh!

46
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:35,165
(Sato) Are you okay? Friends?

47
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:38,660
Yes, my friend is Shinohara.

48
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:38,660
role of bartender

49
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,066
Eh, Shinohara-san!?

50
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,066
yes

51
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:45,726
Eh, sorry, what should I do?

52
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:45,726
No, Mr. Shinohara, actually yesterday.

53
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:49,396
I also want to resign

54
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:49,396
I got a call, right?

55
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:54,330
Yeah? From now on, it's a bit

56
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:54,330
It may be difficult

57
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,528
📱 Of course

58
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,528
I know that, but...

59
00:01:56,528 --> 00:01:58,792
(Sato) Oh, I'm sorry.

60
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:00,759
Sorry

61
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:00,759
Well, the host of the festival is

62
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,495
The usual Ota-san

63
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,495
My schedule doesn't match this year.

64
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:06,165
yes

65
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:06,165
📱 Hello? Can you hear me?

66
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:08,462
Hello, I'm listening, I'm listening

67
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,099
Yes, so this way

68
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,099
I'm looking for someone else

69
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,099
It's okay because it's working now

70
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,627
hello?

71
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,627
📱 Yes

72
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:19,561
Sorry, I went back and forth.

73
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:22,132
📱 No, welcome

74
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:22,132
Sorry for the inconvenience.

75
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:26,033
📱 Because you said that

76
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:26,033
It's okay now

77
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:30,264
(Akira)

78
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:30,264
Um, maybe it is

79
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:33,330
That rhinoceros

80
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:33,330
I heard that your resignation was accepted.

81
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,132
Isn't there a possibility you think?

82
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,132
…yes?

83
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:40,231
As for now

84
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:40,231
The remote story and the phone story

85
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:43,231
It's also a mess

86
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:43,231
I wonder if there is

87
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:51,792
I can't connect after all

88
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:51,792
It seems like the power isn't on.

89
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:55,594
(Keita)

90
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:55,594
What do you mean by resigning?

91
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:59,099
But there are also various rhinos.

92
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:59,099
Isn't there something you thought about?

93
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:04,792
What do you mean?

94
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:04,792
(Akira) No, I don't know.

95
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:10,891
Compared to Yohji, I am an actor.

96
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:10,891
I'm not able to perform as well as I would like.

97
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,033
It's not something I'm going to meddle with.

98
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,033
I know it's not there.

99
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,297
May I ask?

100
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,297
(Yoji) Yeah

101
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:26,099
Yoji and Sai

102
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:26,099
Something happened, right?

103
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:34,891
Did Sai say something?

104
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:37,759
Ugh

105
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,858
《I'm going to draw it.》

106
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,858
《ＯＫ》

107
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:41,660
《Seno! 》

108
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,330
《Okay! 》

109
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,330
《Oh! 》

110
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,330
《Oh! 》

111
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,330
《Oh! 》

112
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,000
《Amazing! 》

113
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,000
《Amazing》

114
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,495
《Both of you are blushing.

115
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,495
Amazing》

116
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,495
《I got it right》

117
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,429
《Quite likely... Wait a minute.

118
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:54,660
This is all red! 》

119
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,891
《No, so no matter what

120
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,891
That means it's 100% okay.

121
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:02,132
《Me and you》

122
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:02,132
"what? That logic》

123
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:06,033
《Seriously us?

124
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:06,033
It doesn't scream or fly now, but

125
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's do our best》

126
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:08,000
"Yeah"

127
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,132
《If one sells first

128
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,132
With a little connection like this

129
00:04:13,132 --> 00:04:15,231
Even if I pull either one up

130
00:04:13,132 --> 00:04:15,231
It might be possible》

131
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:17,891
《What is a connection?

132
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:17,891
It's a bit unpleasant though.

133
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,429
I agree

134
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,429
It would be nice if we could do something together.

135
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:23,660
《Absolutely

136
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:23,660
Your music video will appear. Me.

137
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,726
《Well then, about Sai's drama.

138
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,726
Let me do the theme song》

139
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:27,594
《It's obvious! 》

140
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:30,000
《What if I was an extra in a drama?

141
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,099
Keita or Akira

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,099
Let's call it Chocho.

143
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:35,462
"ah! But

144
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:35,462
Akira: It looks surprisingly delicious though.

145
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:37,297
Keita Are you okay? 》

146
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:40,561
《He’s not good at exercise.

147
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:40,561
Because I'm nervous

148
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:43,264
When you stand in front of the camera, your right hand and right foot

149
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:43,264
Aren't they coming out at the same time? 》

150
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:45,660
《That’s terrible.

151
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:45,660
If you see a drama》

152
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,825
《No, but if that happens

153
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,825
I'm really happy》

154
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:51,066
《I can do it right away》

155
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:54,198
《Because both of us

156
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:54,198
Because it turned red》

157
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:54,198
《Dana》

158
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:58,165
《(Approaching footsteps)

159
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,297
(Keita) Hey! The phone was connected!

160
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:01,957
(2 people) Huh!

161
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:01,957
real?

162
00:05:01,957 --> 00:05:04,132
(Akira) Sai, where are you now?

163
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:08,066
picture? What? I can't hear well

164
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:11,660
Yeah sorry, what? Yeah

165
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:15,825
It broke

166
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:15,825
(Yoji) Huh?

167
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:18,297
Is it possible to go to a place where the signal is bad?

168
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:21,693
waste tunnel

169
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:21,693
(Keita) Huh?

170
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:23,957
Look, I used to have a secret base.

171
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,957
That's amazing

172
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,957
It's hard to connect to the radio waves.

173
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:28,198
(Akira) Ah, that’s true.

174
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:28,198
Yeah

175
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:31,726
(Sato) Ah, Youji! sorry

176
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:31,726
I think I'll be able to find a replacement somehow.

177
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:34,231
Even if I ask already

178
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:34,231
Is it okay?

179
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:39,198
I'm sorry, Sato-san.

180
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:39,198
I just got in touch with Sai.

181
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:41,198
...It looks like he'll be back soon.

182
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:45,198
Ah, is that so?

183
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:45,198
Yes, I'm sorry but

184
00:05:45,198 --> 00:05:47,198
Substitute: Can I ask you to refuse?

185
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:49,066
Well, that's good, that's good.

186
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:51,891
I haven't asked for this yet either.

187
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:51,891
It's totally okay

188
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,693
Well then, just a moment

189
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,693
I'll make that call

190
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,693
yes

191
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,198
(Akira) You put on a cool face and lie like that

192
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,528
What should I do?

193
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,528
(Keita) Hey!

194
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:12,033
i'm going

195
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:12,033
(Akira Keita) Yeah?

196
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:14,033
Abandoned tunnel!

197
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,726
(Keita) No, but not yet.

198
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,726
It was decided that it would be a waste tunnel.

199
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:18,099
But it's better than doing nothing, right?

200
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:21,726
We were finally able to get together

201
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:21,726
I hate how it ended like this

202
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,660
Sai's appearance scene

203
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,660
I'll take a picture at the end

204
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,033
If you can come back by then

205
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,033
I think it's okay

206
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,033
(Keita) I see.

207
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:33,000
This time's director

208
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:33,000
Because he is famous for being a picky person.

209
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,396
Retake the photo many times

210
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,396
I guess I'll press the schedule.

211
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:40,627
(Akasaka) Yes, cut!

212
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:40,627
(Aoba) Yes, cut!

213
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:43,000
(Akasaka) Okay!

214
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:43,000
(Aoba) Cut Okay!

215
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,429
(Akasaka) Yoji-kun is perfect.

216
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:47,726
thank you

217
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:49,792
(Akasaka) Next

218
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:49,792
(Qingyu)

219
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:49,792
Okay, then I'll prepare the next thing.

220
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,792
(Akasaka) Yes, let's go next.

221
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:51,792
(Staff) Yes.

222
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:57,033
No, it's really smooth

223
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:57,033
Deliberately submit NG.

224
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,066
Well, the guy who does that kind of thing

225
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,066
There isn't.

226
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:02,198
I'm serious at heart

227
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:06,957
It can't be helped. I have no choice but to do it.

228
00:07:06,957 --> 00:07:08,627
…yeah?

229
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:10,429
This is Touko Higashijima who plays Kumiko.

230
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,231
(Toko) This is Toko Higashijima.

231
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,231
thank you

232
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,924
Yes, thank you very much.

233
00:07:13,924 --> 00:07:16,792
(applause)

234
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:19,726
(Akasaka) Hey, yes!

235
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:23,264
(Nanao) “Wow!”

236
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:23,264
(Youji) "I'm looking forward to it."

237
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:25,330
(Nanao)

238
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:25,330
"Yeah, it's a really clean hotel."

239
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,891
(Yoji) "Hey, that's good."

240
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,891
(Nanao) "Yeah, that's good."

241
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,495
(Yoji) "Surprisingly, there aren't many people there."

242
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,495
(Nanao) “Yes, it’s a good time.”

243
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,462
《(Keita) Eye it!!

244
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:41,462
Itte! Itte!

245
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,528
(Akasaka) Cut!

246
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:43,528
(Aoba) Cut!

247
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,924
(Keita) Ita!!

248
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,924
(Aoba) Oh, what happened?

249
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,594
(Keita) I'm sorry

250
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,594
(Aoba) Ah, are you okay?

251
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:49,264
(Keita) I'm sorry, I'm sorry

252
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:49,264
Sorry itte!

253
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:50,924
(Aoba) Are you a head?

254
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:50,924
(keita) feet feet

255
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:52,594
(Aoba) Feet Feet Feet

256
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:52,594
Oh, are you hurt?

257
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:54,264
(Aoba) Dai Dai Dai

258
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:54,264
OK?

259
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,693
(Akasaka) Hey, yes!

260
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,858
(Nanao) "Then I'll go."

261
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,858
(Yoji) “Yeah.”

262
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:01,957
(Nanao) "Yeah."

263
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,099
(Akasaka) Cut!

264
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,099
(Aoba) Cut!

265
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,759
sorry

266
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,759
(Aoba) Ah yes

267
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,627
I've been here for a while

268
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,627
People are reflected

269
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:14,495
(Aoba) Oh, I'm sorry.

270
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,825
(Aoba) Hey everyone.

271
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,825
Please wait patiently

272
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:19,561
(Aoba) Ah, sorry.

273
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:21,627
If you come here already

274
00:08:19,561 --> 00:08:21,627
Just go to the front

275
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,660
Thank you for letting me go

276
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,660
It's okay, yes.

277
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,561
Ah, but just in case

278
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,561
It's my first time coming to a hotel.

279
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:29,792
I wonder what's in the lobby?

280
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:29,792
I think about it and usually do it.

281
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,594
ah

282
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,594
What do you mean by just looking at nothing?

283
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,264
I think it's a little strange

284
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,264
I thought about it

285
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:35,462
Ah, it's totally fine

286
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:38,000
Um, just like that, without thinking about anything.

287
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:38,000
If you could walk towards the front

288
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:52,726
《(Approaching footsteps)

289
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:55,056
Hey!

290
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:55,056
Wow!

291
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:57,891
Wow, I was surprised.

292
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:00,792
I'm drowning in sentimentality

293
00:08:57,891 --> 00:09:00,792
It's bad though

294
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,990
I'll go back, I don't have time.

295
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,924
What do you mean?

296
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,924
Eh, why are you here?

297
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:09,561
Do you want to explain everything?

298
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:09,561
It's too much trouble, can I do it later?

299
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:13,264
For now, rhino music video

300
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:13,264
I'm not supposed to have resigned.

301
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:16,891
teeth? No, I'm fine

302
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:16,891
I told Yoji's manager.

303
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:21,056
Yes, so there are many things

304
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:21,056
There was a misunderstanding.

305
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:22,891
Eh

306
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:26,429
Well, that's what it is

307
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:26,429
Anyway, let's go back soon.

308
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:31,528
No... that's impossible.

309
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:31,528
why?

310
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:34,891
Even if I go back now

311
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:34,891
There's no face to match, right?

312
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:37,924
Because Youji didn't keep his promise?

313
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:44,056
Have you heard anything from him?

314
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:47,297
No, I don't know the details.

315
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,023
It's not that big of a promise.

316
00:09:56,924 --> 00:10:00,056
If one sells first

317
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:03,594
Let's be the strength of the other person

318
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:09,132
That's it

319
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:09,132
I've been procrastinating for a long time

320
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:12,990
You mean you're angry?

321
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:12,990
There's no way!

322
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:17,858
rather the opposite

323
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:24,495
For that reason

324
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:28,924
The person who was called out to me

325
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:28,924
I don't like it

326
00:10:28,924 --> 00:10:33,528
Youji is also too polite.

327
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:38,396
Forever in the story of the past

328
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:38,396
There's no need to be tied down

329
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:42,726
Are you tied up?

330
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:42,726
Isn't that what you're talking about?

331
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,990
Youji is probably

332
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,990
I wish I could do something with Sai

333
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,561
I've been waiting sincerely

334
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,825
Hey, that's what Sai is really about.

335
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,825
Don't you understand?

336
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:58,627
Maybe so though

337
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:08,165
I can work side by side with him.

338
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:08,165
It's not worth it

339
00:11:08,165 --> 00:11:12,056
I know best

340
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:17,792
to my job

341
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:17,792
I'm thinking of taking the plunge

342
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:22,528
Finally like that

343
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:22,528
I'm starting to think

344
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:27,627
If you want to chase me again

345
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:27,627
It's so cool I'm dying

346
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,132
end?

347
00:11:31,132 --> 00:11:33,231
end

348
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,056
Ita!! Eh, low kick?

349
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:51,726
Itta…

350
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:53,825
I'm about to shoot

351
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:53,825
I stopped making faces.

352
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:56,726
That's why I'm not going back!

353
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:56,726
Don't go back!

354
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:02,858
What about rank?

355
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:02,858
Are you saying something ridiculous?

356
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:06,726
If you want to chase your dreams again

357
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:06,726
All you have to do is chase me

358
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,132
Rhinos are so uncool

359
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,132
I've known it for a long time!

360
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:12,891
Always like an idiot

361
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:15,627
Just say how you're doing

362
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:15,627
Just kidding

363
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:18,693
That I couldn't follow through on my words

364
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:18,693
There are tons of them.

365
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:20,759
but

366
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:23,627
I love working as an actor

367
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:27,990
Actually

368
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:27,990
I've been working hard behind the scenes

369
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,297
Because that's what I know

370
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:34,099
So for Sai's dream

371
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:36,957
I have various thoughts

372
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:36,957
I swallowed it

373
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:46,363
no…

374
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:50,990
my feelings are

375
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:50,990
I don't care though

376
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:09,891
ah

377
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,924
Uze

378
00:13:24,132 --> 00:13:26,429
Stop it

379
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:32,297
Should I go back?

380
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,297
Come on, quickly

381
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,363
Thank you

382
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,330
(Akasaka) Cut!

383
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,330
(Aoba) Yes, cut!

384
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,297
(Akasaka) Okay!

385
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,297
(Aoba) Okay!

386
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:12,198
(applause)

387
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:14,231
(Aoba) Yes, then.

388
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:14,231
Let's prepare for the last scene

389
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,099
Mr. Kamiya

390
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,099
Please wait a little while

391
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:18,396
Mr. Higashijima

392
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:18,396
Please wait on the sofa

393
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:22,891
Ah, sorry, my name is Ayato Shinohara.

394
00:14:19,396 --> 00:14:22,891
Are you already on site?

395
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:28,924
Ah, who received Mr. Shinohara?

396
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:28,924
Please respond if you have

397
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:31,264
Umm

398
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:31,264
Ah yes

399
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:33,528
Sorry I'm late

400
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:33,528
This is Ayato Shinohara.

401
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:35,726
thank you

402
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:35,726
thank you

403
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:37,396
please

404
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:37,396
(All) Please

405
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:39,297
Shinohara-san changing clothes and make-up

406
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:39,297
It will be here

407
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,264
I will guide you

408
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,264
Yes please

409
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:44,231
(Aoba) Everyone

410
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:44,231
Please wait for a while

411
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:00,132
sorry

412
00:15:04,132 --> 00:15:05,990
(Yoji) Rhinoceros

413
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:09,891
(Youji) This

414
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:22,396
(2 people) Se-no!

415
00:15:22,396 --> 00:15:25,264
oh! Ah, amazing!

416
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:30,792
No matter what happens

417
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:30,792
I hope you will succeed 100% from now on...

418
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,858
picture?

419
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:38,165
No, I'm really trying my luck!

420
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:38,165
Haha, is that so?

421
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:41,858
No, it's you! Eh!

422
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:41,858
Hehehe

423
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,528
"(knock)

424
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,528
yes

425
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:45,198
(Aoba) Excuse me.

426
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:45,198
When you two are ready

427
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:47,792
Please standby

428
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:47,792
(2 people) Yes

429
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:50,495
Carefully

430
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:50,495
Call them too

431
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:52,693
Keita was moving his arms and legs at the same time.

432
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:55,660
Ha! on second thoughts!

433
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:55,660
(laughter)

434
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,495
(Youji) As expected!

435
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,495
Hahaha

436
00:15:57,495 --> 00:16:00,561
Oh no! Was this how you did it?

437
00:15:57,495 --> 00:16:00,561
(Yoji) Yeah

438
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:23,165
(Yoji) Well then, cheers!

439
00:16:19,406 --> 00:16:23,165
(All) Good luck!

440
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:27,066
(Nagisa) Okay, put it here.

441
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:27,066
(Nino) Yes

442
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,363
(Nakahara) Thank you

443
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:29,363
I'll take it

444
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:34,099
(Amemiya) Ah, sorry.

445
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:34,099
I'm at the second table...

446
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:36,363
Yoji is

447
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:36,363
How long can you stay here?

448
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,505
I'll stay until tomorrow night.

449
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:41,835
Spend time with friends after shooting

450
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:41,835
Mr. Sato asked me if I could do it.

451
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,538
(Akira Keita) Hey!

452
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,330
(Keita) I'm a little clumsy though.

453
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,330
That's the best part, Mr. Sato.

454
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,297
(Keita) Hehehe, I looked it over.

455
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,264
I'm sorry

456
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,264
It really bothers everyone

457
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:51,934
It's true!

458
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:54,703
At first, I was just an annoying fan.

459
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:54,703
Because it was thought that

460
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:57,033
(laughter)

461
00:16:57,033 --> 00:17:00,802
But it was really good

462
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:04,934
I was able to reunite with everyone in this way.

463
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:09,967
Well, that's right

464
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,736
Yeah

465
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:15,637
(Youji)

466
00:17:11,736 --> 00:17:15,637
come here and spend time with everyone

467
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:18,703
What I have done

468
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:18,703
It wasn't a mistake

469
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:22,132
I thought it was true

470
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:28,802
So... thank you

471
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:34,033
(Akira) Oh?

472
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:34,033
(Keita) Was it a moving speech?

473
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:37,033
(Yoji) No, that's not true.

474
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:37,033
(laughter)

475
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:42,297
Thank you Ryuka

476
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:42,297
Yeah? Fufufu…

477
00:17:42,297 --> 00:17:45,472
I couldn't perform

478
00:17:42,297 --> 00:17:45,472
I regret it though

479
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:48,769
I'm really sorry about that!

480
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:48,769
Ugh

481
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:54,538
So what do you think?

482
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:54,538
How do you feel now after filming?

483
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:59,604
I thought I'd try again

484
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:04,802
Not cool though

485
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:04,802
Hmmm

486
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:08,297
That's fine, that's it

487
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:08,297
Yeah

488
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:12,967
Fufufu…

489
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:12,967
Well then, let's go back to everyone.

490
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:17,132
Ah, one more thing

491
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:17,132
There's something I want to talk about.

492
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:19,198
Yeah? what?

493
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:26,802
Me too, about Ryuka.

494
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:26,802
I loved you forever

495
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:35,802
But as an actor

496
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:35,802
I feel like I haven't achieved anything.

497
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:42,363
Because we're childhood friends

498
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:42,363
Making excuses for various things

499
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:47,505
So until the end

500
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:47,505
I couldn't express my feelings

501
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,330
Ryuka's favor too

502
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,231
I hurt Ryuka back then.

503
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,231
Even though I know that...

504
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:03,505
I'm really sorry

505
00:19:11,406 --> 00:19:13,538
Well then

506
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:17,231
At that time, I was ambivalent.

507
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:17,231
forever

508
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,637
Yeah

509
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:27,363
But it's not about those days.

510
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:33,934
I still think so

511
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,736
I'm sorry I couldn't say it for a long time

512
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:44,099
I liked it, not

513
00:19:45,736 --> 00:19:50,835
I love you, Ryuka.

514
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:58,132
It's already late

515
00:20:03,505 --> 00:20:06,472
I know it's already late

516
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:11,901
Yeah it's already late

517
00:20:15,769 --> 00:20:18,297
sorry

518
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:31,000
but

519
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,703
No matter how late you think it is

520
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,835
Actors work really hard, right?

521
00:20:45,264 --> 00:20:47,472
Yeah

522
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:54,099
Well then

523
00:20:56,264 --> 00:21:00,604
It's already late though

524
00:21:00,604 --> 00:21:03,934
I'll try again too

526

I liked it, I didn't.

527
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,769
I love you too.
