(Miku) Sasaki is

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,330
Are you going to sleep here?

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,396
(Sasaki) Because

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,396
Miku: Are you going to sleep here?

5
00:00:08,396 --> 00:00:11,396
(Nagisa) From today on, I

6
00:00:08,396 --> 00:00:11,396
Apparently he's in charge of Jin-kun's education.

7
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:14,528
(Nino) There are always many things for Nagisa-san.

8
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:14,528
Thanks for letting me know...

9
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:14,528
Mr. Senzaki

10
00:00:14,528 --> 00:00:16,198
Are you feeling better?

11
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:18,396
Are you happy with me?

12
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:20,198
I'm happy because I like it

13
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:22,528
Love means that

14
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:22,528
You mean as a friend?

15
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,462
Let me continue to be Miku's boyfriend

16
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,462
I thought again that I want it

17
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:28,297
(Miku) It's my first time...

18
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:33,495
(Nagisa) I recently got divorced.

19
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:33,495

Second time... right?

22
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:02,330
It's the second time

23
00:01:09,297 --> 00:01:12,000

No, I mean it's been since yesterday.

31
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:37,099
Ever since we started dating

32
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:41,165
Because I've been working hard

33
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:41,165
Do you understand?

34
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:44,957
I understand

35
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:44,957
thank you

36
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:52,726
From now on, Sasaki will be for me.

It's my turn to do my best.

38
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:57,231
Yes, I'll do my best

Hey hey

44
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:24,099
It's really great though

45
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,330
Oh well, head spa too.

46
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,330
Because I'm studying every day

47
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,891
Hard work every day

48
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,891
No, no

49
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,462
Eh, school is what it is.

50
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,462
Yeah

51
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:42,660
Do you actually cut hair?

52
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,792
Oh no, I won't actually cut it.

53
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,231
wig only

54
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,231
Hmm, that's right

55
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:50,495
Yeah yeah yeah

56
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,462
Eh, it's a wig.

57
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,462
Yeah

58
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:58,792
How do you cut it? On people?

59
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:01,033
Oh no

60
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:01,033
That's not what a wig is

61
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,891
It's a training mannequin.

62
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,891
Ah, that's called a wig.

63
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:08,561
Yeah yeah yeah

64
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:08,561
Hmmm

65
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,660
Okay

00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:16,165
Yes, the end

Eh! Hey, just a little more

68
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:18,825
No, if you do it too much

69
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:18,825
Because it is a burden on the scalp

70
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:21,627
Eh!

71
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:21,627
Okay, let's go have dinner?

72
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:24,165
Hey, are you listening?

73
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:24,165

80
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:36,330
No, something from school.

81
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,132
Wait?

82
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,132
ah…

83
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:40,297
No, it's fine

84
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:40,297
It might take a while

85
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:42,792
Hmm, don't be too late.

86
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:44,891

96
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,759
It was when I was in high school.

Last chance this year

103
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:35,825

(Nakahara) Ah, something...

135
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:45,660
I'm not used to Ayase-san.

136
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,066

So you're from Niigata?

Oh no

142
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:57,066
That's not the case though

143
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:02,429
My previous hotel assignment was in Niigata.

144
00:05:57,066 --> 00:06:02,429
I met my husband there too.

145
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:12,396
How was the holidays?

146
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:16,825
(Nagisa) Well, I guess it was hectic.

147
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:19,825
It was about divorce, right?

148
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:21,627
Yeah that's right

149
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:26,165
I mean divorce.

150
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:26,165
Are there various procedures?

(Nino)

152
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:29,165
Is there a procedure?

153
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:30,825
Well, if you change your last name

154
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,297
There are many things that need to be done

155
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,297
There is, right?

156
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:38,033

Oh... no, but I'm fine.

162
00:06:56,528 --> 00:07:00,033
(Nino) How about Mr. Senzaki?

163
00:06:56,528 --> 00:07:00,033

165
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:03,891
Ah... Ayase-san, I'm sorry.

166
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,363
No, it's fine, but

167
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:14,198
Well, what about Ayase-san?

168
00:07:15,495 --> 00:07:17,165
What is it?

169
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:20,858
(Nino)

170
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:20,858
Oh no, I hope you're okay.

171
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,627
ah

172
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:26,033
Well, I'm fine too.

173
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,759
(Nino) That was good.

174
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:37,627
That Ayase-san...

175
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:40,561
(Miku) Ah, my stomach is full.

176
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:47,759
That Miku...

177
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,759
what?

178
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,396
Umm

179
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,396
There's something I want to say to Mik

180
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:56,825
What do you want to say?

181
00:07:56,825 --> 00:08:01,561
I mean what I want to say

182
00:07:56,825 --> 00:08:01,561
There's something I want to tell you

183
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:06,858
Ah, um, sorry.

184
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:06,858
Does it have to be now?

185
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:10,429
I mean, it's not now...

186
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:18,033
Well, I guess it's better now.

187
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:20,825
Eh, is it okay if I brush my teeth first?

188
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,924
Oh yeah

189
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:24,627
Eh, but you did it earlier too, right?

190
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:28,033
Yeah, I did it earlier too.

191
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:28,033
Because I want to eat it

192
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:33,957
Ah... well of course

193
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:33,957
Okay, after I brush my teeth.

194
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:38,000
(Miku) Yeah, then...

195
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:58,056
From next month

196
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:58,056
I'm going to London

197
00:08:58,056 --> 00:09:01,528
You know, what we talked about before

198
00:08:58,056 --> 00:09:01,528
It was there, right? story of london

199
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:03,990
That...

200
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:03,990
(sound of door opening)

201
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:09,726
Sorry, please

202
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:13,089
Ah... that's right.

203
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:17,825
no…

204
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:20,594
what?

205
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:24,198
(Sasaki) Yeah...

206
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,363
The meal was delicious, wasn't it?

207
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,056
(Miku) That's right.

208
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,056
Eh, have you ever eaten carp?

209
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:36,363
(Miku) No, it's not.

210
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:39,462
That's what carp tastes like

211
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:39,462
I learned it for the first time

212
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:41,132
Sasaki...

213
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:43,759
This is what love tastes like

214
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:43,759
I learned this for the first time

215
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,429
Nino-kun

216
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,429
(Nino) Yes, what is it?

217
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:49,627
At work

218
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:57,429
Sorry...

219
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:10,231
But really

220
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:10,231
Until I met Ayase-san

221
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:13,462
I've never felt this way before

222
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:13,462
There wasn't.

223
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,792
The period when I can't meet Ayase-san

224
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,792
I was feeling very distressed.

225
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:28,891
I feel like I'm from the beginning

226
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:28,891
Do you mean it's changing?

227
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:32,990
More and more

228
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:32,990
I mean it's getting weird

229
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:42,627
I fell in love with someone so much

230
00:10:37,132 --> 00:10:42,627
I thought about people

231
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:45,726
It's really my first time

232
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:53,089
thank you

233
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,561
Of course I feel happy, but

234
00:10:57,561 --> 00:11:03,627
Even if you say that, to me

235
00:10:57,561 --> 00:11:03,627
I can't do anything for you

236
00:11:03,627 --> 00:11:09,528
my feelings are

237
00:11:03,627 --> 00:11:09,528
It hasn't changed since before

238
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,891
(Nagisa) Sorry

239
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:25,165
Something

240
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:25,165
It was like the rap from earlier.

241
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:30,495
(Nagisa) What?

242
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:36,726
In agony, from the root

243
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:36,726
It's getting weird

244
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:39,825
ah!

245
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:44,396
In agony... fundamentally... more and more

246
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:47,495
london

247
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:51,462
picture?

248
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:53,561
(Sasaki) Did you know?

249
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:57,990
《(Sasaki) Well, what we talked about before.

250
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:57,990
There is, right? story of london

251
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,693
《That was officially decided.

252
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,693
Starting next month...

253
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:05,528
Congratulations

254
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:09,462
No, but not yet

255
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:09,462
I didn't decide to go.

256
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:13,330
teeth? why?

257
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:13,330
No, because

258
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,165
Mikuto

259
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,165
Even though we've just started dating

260
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:18,396
Eh, no way

261
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:18,396
So you're not going?

262
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:20,363
Because, isn't it?

263
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:20,363
Are you stupid?

264
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:23,759
I'm not stupid!

265
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,023
Miku has been having a hard time

266
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,023
I've spent a lot of time

267
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:31,528
What are you saying?

268
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:31,528
That doesn't matter now, right?

269
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:34,198
That's not true.

270
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:34,198
Because it's about the two of us.

271
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:36,231
Even if it's about the two of us

272
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:39,858
Sasaki About me

273
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:39,858
You don't understand anything

274
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:41,561
I know!

275
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,561
Because

276
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,561
Because we've been together forever

277
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:49,198
That's why I am more than anyone else.

278
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:49,198
Because I was by Sasaki's side

279
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:53,165
For Sasaki

280
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:53,165
How important is that?

281
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:56,528
Because I understand it properly.

282
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:58,528
Miku…

283
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:06,528
That's why Sasaki is for me.

284
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:06,528
Are you willing to sacrifice anything?

285
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:09,660
I won't allow that

286
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:18,990
Of course you can say that

287
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:18,990
I'm happy though

288
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,264
But it's not

289
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:25,924
that's why

290
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:25,924
I told you to do your best.

291
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:32,297
Sasaki's dream is

292
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:32,297
It's my dream too, right?

293
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:37,693
thank you

294
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:42,089
That's right, isn't it?

295
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:48,495
No, but I'm sorry

296
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,924
Hey Sasaki

297
00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:56,660
(Sasaki) What?

298
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,495
Can I say just one thing selfishly?

299
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:02,891
Yeah what?

300
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:09,759

301
00:14:04,693 --> 00:14:09,759

I don't want to cry, but I might cry

307

(Sasaki)

308
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,858
Hehehehe, no, I don't mind crying though

309
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,231
No, it's going to collapse

310
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,891
(Sasaki) What do you think?

311
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:05,396
Yeah, I'm the prettiest person I've ever been in my life.

312
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:07,056
(Sasaki) Hehehehe

313
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:11,132
Yeah I think so too

314
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:13,693
(sigh)

315
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:13,693
Huh?

316
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:17,231
At times like this

317
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:17,231
Instead of “I think so too”

318
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:20,264
I'll put it into words properly

319
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:20,264
Hahaha

320
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:22,561
Oh sorry

321
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:25,627
Don't apologize, just say it

322
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:28,089
Yeah

323
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:35,726
It's very beautiful

324
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:40,792
how far in the future

325
00:15:36,957 --> 00:15:40,792
Even if the technology is acquired

326
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:43,891
I can't do more than today

327
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:43,891
As much as I think

328
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,231
(Miku) Hehe

329
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,231
(Sasaki) Hehehehe

330
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:55,264
thank you

331
00:15:55,264 --> 00:15:57,957
I think so too

337
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,759
(Sasaki) Um, sorry.

338
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,759
(Nagisa) Yes

339
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,231
Well...

340
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:55,792
I know it's impossible

341
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:55,792
I have a request.

342
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:02,703
I'm very sorry

343
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:06,066
This facility is

344
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:06,066
Opening to the general public

345
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,429
We have not done so.

346
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:12,066
Ah, that's right...

347
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:18,396
(Nino) Ah, that...

348
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,637
Can I ask you a favor?

349
00:17:24,703 --> 00:17:27,736
Yes, thank you

350
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:31,934
But there are only weaving-related businesses here.

351
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:31,934
Because it's a place you can't enter

352
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:35,231
But it's the banquet club, right?

353
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,769
To Amemiya-san

354
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,769
I'll check it out in a bit.

355
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:43,703
Ah, please wait a moment

356
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,033
(Sasaki) Thank you

357
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,033
(Miku) Thank you

358
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:56,604
What?

359
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:56,604
(Nino) No... it was.

360
00:17:56,604 --> 00:18:00,132
(Nagisa) Isn't that so?

361
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:02,231
Sorry

362
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:06,472
I'll apologize to those people.

363
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:11,538
why do you do that

364
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:11,538
Are you rushing through everything?

365
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:19,868
Hear that request

366
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:19,868
I don't like not being able to do anything

367
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:24,538
But there are things that are impossible, right?

368
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:27,637
If you think about it, you'll understand.

369
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:33,538
Maybe you can figure it out if you think about it

370
00:18:28,637 --> 00:18:33,538
I don't know but

371
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:39,637
Still, something more important

372
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:39,637
I thought there might be

373
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,165
(Nino) Sorry.

374
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:50,769
(Nagisa) Nino-kun

375
00:18:46,934 --> 00:18:50,769
…yes

376
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:58,736
While I was talking to Mr. Amemiya

377
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:58,736
Check availability of makeup room

378
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,901
Making a reservation on the day

379
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,901
Because it's unlikely

380
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:05,099
(Nagisa) Today's portion is

381
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:05,099
If even one room is vacant

382
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:08,396
You should definitely be able to use that.

383
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:10,363
Nagisa-san...

384
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:13,330
Mr. Ayase

385
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:13,330
(Nino) Ah...

386
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,472
Let's go!

387
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:19,769
yes

388
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:25,571
(Nagisa) I'm really sorry!

389
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:25,571
I'll tell you a lot of things.

390
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:28,934
(Nagisa) Look! Apologize again!

391
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:28,934
Ah, sorry!

392
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:32,901
(Amemiya) No... I can't help either.

393
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:32,901
I'm really sorry

394
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:34,901
(Nagisa) No, no, no, no!

395
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:34,901
I'm really sorry

396
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:37,033
you're welcome

397
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:37,033
(Amemiya) No, please don't apologize.

398
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:39,967
Something like that, really.

399
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:39,967
I feel like it's a bad idea

400
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,934
It's no longer flexible

401
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,934
Really...

402
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:44,198
(Nagisa) But how do you feel?

403
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:44,198
It's so conveyed

404
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:47,000
(Amemiya) No, really.

405
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:47,000
I really want to cooperate.

406
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,703
This is what a hotel is like

407
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,703
I'd say it's pretty solid.

408
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:51,901
(Nagisa) I understand.

409
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:51,901
(Amemiya) I can't say anything either.

410
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:55,604
(Amemiya) I'm really sorry.

411
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:55,604
I'm so pathetic

412
00:19:55,604 --> 00:19:57,637
(Amemiya) What should I do?

413
00:19:55,604 --> 00:19:57,637
No, there...

414
00:19:57,637 --> 00:19:59,297
(Amemiya) I want to help

415
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:00,967
thank you

416
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:05,198
(Nagisa) I'm sorry.

417
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:05,198
Returning the key to the trash can

418
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:07,363
Ah, thank you for your hard work

419
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:09,901
Well then, sorry to trouble you.

420
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:09,901
I would like the bookkeeping please.

421
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,769
yes

422
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,000
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

423
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,000
yes

424
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,033
It's kind of a garbage bin.

425
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,033
It's becoming difficult to open

426
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,033
yes

427
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:20,571
Maybe this

428
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:20,571
Isn't the key a little bent?

429
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:22,505
(Staff) Huh?

430
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:24,802
(Nagisa) This part

431
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:24,802
Isn't it bent?

432
00:20:24,802 --> 00:20:26,472
(Staff) Nope.

433
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:30,736
It seems a little crooked

434
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:30,736
I can't see it though

435
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:35,000
copper? Did it go back to normal?

436
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:41,736
I agree…

437
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:47,000
Ah, I don't know the origin.

438
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:50,736
Ah, sorry...

439
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:54,802
If you get angry

440
00:20:50,736 --> 00:20:54,802
Let's sincerely apologize at that time.

441
00:20:54,802 --> 00:20:57,033
yes

442
00:20:57,033 --> 00:21:00,165
If something happens

443
00:20:57,033 --> 00:21:00,165
Let's get fired together~

444
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:01,967
Understood

445
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:05,066
No no no

446
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:05,066
That's no good if you get fired.

447
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:07,901
(Nino)

448
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:07,901
It's okay if I'm with Nagisa-san.

449
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't like it~

450
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:15,769
Nagisa-san

451
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:17,637
(Nagisa) What?

452
00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:22,132
Thank you very much for today

453
00:21:17,637 --> 00:21:22,132
thank you

454
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:30,868
Thank you very much.

455
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:37,901
Something important

456
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:37,901
I feel like it reminded me

457
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:40,472
To Jin-kun

458
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:44,769
Jin-kun

459
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:48,472
Yeah Jin-kun

460
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:54,429
I met Jin-kun for the first time in a while.

461
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:54,429
After all, it was my favorite Jin-kun.

462
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,297
Nagisa-san

463
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:10,472
Am I divorced?

464
00:22:10,472 --> 00:22:13,571
It doesn't matter

465
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:17,231
(Nagisa) It's troublesome.

466
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:17,231
I think he's more likely to do things like bondage.

467
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:19,363
it's okay

468
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:23,297
I tend to get angry

469
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:23,297
I say everything with my mouth

470
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:43,297
♬〜

471
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:47,330

475
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,703
But what I don't know is

476
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,703
♬〜I don’t care

477
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:06,505

480
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:17,505
audition?

481
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:17,505
Sorry for being late!

482
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:19,802
My ex-girlfriend is participating~

483
00:23:19,802 --> 00:23:21,472
Will you make me your girlfriend?

484
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:24,571
Rena looks happy

485
00:23:21,472 --> 00:23:24,571
my happiness

486
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,363
I wanted to know more

487
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,472
with me again

488
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,472
please be with me
