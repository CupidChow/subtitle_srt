Ah, it looks like it's going to be difficult Shinkansen

I'm asking for it.

No, actually, from our perspective

ah

130
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:38,660
(Ryuuka) Did you break up?!

131
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:38,660
Yeah

132
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,462
Haha! Eh, why!?

133
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:42,594
why…

134
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:44,264
Because I got dumped

135
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,396
No, that's why

136
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,396
I'm asking you the reason.

137
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,627
No, it's okay, my story is

138
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:51,429
What about Sai?

139
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:51,429
(Say) Huh? I'm fine...

00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:07,627
Yeah

145
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:10,462
Even though we are local, are there any?

146
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:12,528
But around here

147
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:12,528
Because a hotel will be built

148
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:14,429
A lot of things have increased.

149
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:16,429
There may be quite a few that I don't know about.

150
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:19,726
Well, certainly

151
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,363
Look, here.

152
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,363
Doesn't it look delicious?

153
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:28,759
...Ah, isn't it good?

154
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:33,957
Hey, there's a place like that.

155
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:37,000
Shall we go?

156
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:37,000

Hey Akira, let's shout something!

160
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:03,264
Go ahead

161
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:06,165
I would never do that!

162
00:07:07,165 --> 00:07:09,462
Huh!

163
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:14,089
Yeah! Delicious

164
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:17,231
Keita I really like curry

165
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:19,495

Hey

168
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,924
Yeah

169
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,924
Yeah

170
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:38,627
Hey, how did you manage to open such a stylish store?

171
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:38,627
I learned it for the first time

172
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:43,858
Well, even if I stay forever

173
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:43,858
There are things I don't notice

174
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:48,264
Also, I don't usually do that much.

175
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:48,264
Because it won't come this way

176
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:51,198
surely

177
00:07:51,198 --> 00:07:54,264
This is here

178
00:07:51,198 --> 00:07:54,264
Did something happen in the first place?

179
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:57,528
Hmm, what do you think?

180
00:07:57,528 --> 00:08:00,957
Somehow, when a new building is built

181
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:03,627
what happened

182
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:03,627
Can't remember at all?

183
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,891
I understand

184
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:12,759
...What's going on lately?

185
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,429
yeah?

186
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:18,858
...No, look, I broke up with my ex-girlfriend.

187
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:18,858
It's been a long time

188
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:20,990
ah…

189
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:25,231
No, not at all since then.

190
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:28,023
Eh... seriously?

191
00:08:29,023 --> 00:08:30,726
That's a shame

192
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:33,297
Hehehe

193
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:33,297
Hehehe

194
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:38,528
What about Keita?

195
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:40,528
What...

196
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:43,231
I don't have anything special

197
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,891
Hmm

198
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,429
That's a shame

199
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,089
Annoying

200
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:57,462
Well that's fine I am

201
00:08:57,462 --> 00:08:59,561
Keita is here

202
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:04,231
...What is that?

203
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,122
Wow, nostalgic!

204
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:15,594
After school, I'm always here

205
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:15,594
You were playing a game, weren't you?

206
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:18,858
I really didn't have much free time. Those days.

207
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,363
a~!

208
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,363
Go back to a life where you don't have to work

209
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,056
Hehehe

210
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:27,957
I mean, with Saito and Sugiyama and the others.

211
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:27,957
I want to drink it again

212
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:31,528
But Saito wife next month

213
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:31,528
You said you were planning to give birth.

214
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:35,023
Ah, I see.

215
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:38,462
Well then, after a while

216
00:09:35,023 --> 00:09:38,462
Is it better?

217
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,792
Are you there?

218
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:45,198
…thank you

219
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,990
Delicious

220
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,660
Yeah

221
00:09:56,891 --> 00:09:58,858
But it's kind of amazing, isn't it?

222
00:09:58,858 --> 00:10:00,528
picture?

223
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:05,165
No, marriage, children, etc.

224
00:10:00,528 --> 00:10:05,165
ah

225
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:08,561
Something about me

226
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:08,561
I mean, I can't even imagine it.

227
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:10,825
Well

228
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:12,528
And it's that Saito.

229
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,363
What! Destroy that drink bar

230
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,363
Saito was angry

231
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:18,891
It was there.

232
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:18,891
Hehehe

233
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:32,759
Now that I think about it, here...

234
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:40,297
yeah? what up?

235
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:44,231
...No, nothing

236
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,122
What? I'm curious though

237
00:10:48,122 --> 00:10:50,396
It's nothing

238
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:55,462
(Female student)《I like it...》

239
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:59,264
《About Akira-kun》

240
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:04,858
《Will you accompany me? 》

241
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:10,627
《…If it's okay with me》

242
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:14,165
(Female student)《Really? 》

243
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:14,165
"Yeah"

244
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:18,825
(Female student)《I'm so happy! 》

245
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:29,495
(Rain sound)

246
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:32,165
It came all of a sudden

247
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:58,858
It seems to stop after 5 minutes.

248
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,825
Is it raining?

249
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:20,297
what? It's suddenly quiet

250
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:23,825
It's normal anyway

251
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:26,056
I see.

252
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:33,792
It's been a while

253
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:38,231
We'll be together all day like this

254
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:42,330
…Yeah

255
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:55,297
How often will we see each other from now on?

256
00:12:58,231 --> 00:13:04,462
You know, the one who got married.

257
00:12:58,231 --> 00:13:04,462
I don't see you much

258
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:07,858
As usual in the past

259
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:07,858
We were together though

260
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:10,660
Don't change, everyone.

261
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,660
I wonder what will happen to us too.

262
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:20,990
... Nothing will change, right?

263
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:26,891
I see.

264
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,924
That's right

265
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:38,858
…Takasa

266
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:41,165
Is Keita really not there?

267
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:46,363
picture?

268
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:46,363
No, she or something

269
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:52,396
When it comes to stories like this all the time

270
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:52,396
You say "nothing"

271
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:55,231
I wonder what it's actually like

272
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:59,462
I don't know... there's nothing special about it.

273
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:06,528
but…

274
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:09,759
If it's Keita

275
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:09,759
I'm sure there are good people out there.

276
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:15,759
Is it unnecessary care?

277
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:32,462
…That’s it.

278
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:38,122
...I liked it

279
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:42,660
Always about you

280
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:57,726
《…Aaaa》

281
00:14:57,726 --> 00:15:00,165
《Why would I say that?》

282
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,769
《(Rain sound)

283
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:15,571
(knock)

284
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,835
(unlock sound)

285
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:28,264
Inside okay?

286
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:29,934
picture?

287
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:33,396
…ah

288
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:04,538
Aren't you going to sit down?

289
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:29,967
…sorry

290
00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:34,802
What?

291
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:38,736
No... I think I pulled it.

292
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:45,604
I don't have anything to say about pulling it though.

293
00:16:47,363 --> 00:16:51,670
...Because

294
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:57,967
I pretended like nothing had happened until now

295
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:57,967
Even though I'm next to you

296
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:01,198
Every time you get a girlfriend

297
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,703
It's already a mess...

298
00:17:07,637 --> 00:17:11,396
For example, from here on

299
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:18,769
Suppose Akira... marries someone.

300
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:22,505
nevertheless

301
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:22,505
Pretend you don't care about anything

302
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:26,099
Like laughing out loud.

303
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:30,769
...Maybe I can't do it anymore...

304
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:39,670
I'm sorry we couldn't be friends properly.

305
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:48,670
...I said, "I liked it."

306
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:48,670
What does it mean?

307
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:52,132
No, that's why...

308
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:54,231
I said I've loved you for a long time...

309
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:57,033
“It was”?

310
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:57,033
No, that's why...

311
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,835
Don't you like it?

312
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:02,000
now

313
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:19,297
i like it

314
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:21,835
About Keita

315
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:28,472
now in progress

316
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:32,538
no…

317
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:37,066
No, no, no, no

318
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:37,066
No, no, no, no!

319
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:41,637
Because you've been

320
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:41,637
I've been dating a girl...

321
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:44,637
Maybe it's because I feel sorry for you

322
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:44,637
That's definitely true!

323
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:55,967
Last New Year, we all drank together.

324
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,934
At that time, something...

325
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:06,604
My heart is pounding for Keita

326
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:14,637
…I simply

327
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:14,637
Rather than having a girlfriend or falling in love

328
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:19,396
It's more fun to hang out with friends

329
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:19,396
I thought it was the type

330
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:22,264
But...

331
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:26,165
《Hey, wait》

332
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:26,165
"what? what? I was surprised》

333
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,297
《I want to eat meat》

334
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,297
《Eh, meat? No good, I'll eat it.

335
00:19:29,297 --> 00:19:30,967
"why? picture? Eh⁉》

336
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:33,297
(Sai)《What! why? 》

337
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,165
(Say)《You can eat this.》

338
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,165
(Ryuuka)《What? 》

339
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:37,396
(Sai)《This is edamame》

340
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:37,396
(Ryuuka)《Eh this gala container》

341
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:39,505
(Ryuuka)《It's not in there anymore.

342
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:39,505
Hey"

343
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:42,769
(Ryuuka)《Ah, I'll give you this too》

344
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:42,769
(Say)《That's not included》

345
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,429
(Ryuuka)《Well then

346
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,429
I'll give you this》

347
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:47,132
(Say)《Is this included? 》

348
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:47,132
(Ryuuka)《Not included》

349
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:52,967
Honestly, I was confused too.

350
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:52,967
I was worried but...

351
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:58,033
About Keita

352
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:58,033
That's why I like it...

353
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:05,396
Somehow... it makes sense.

354
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:17,330
Are you serious about that?

355
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:27,099
Yeah

356
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:34,396
...I'm pretty heavy, right?

357
00:20:34,396 --> 00:20:39,396
Because it's been going on since elementary school.

358
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:41,066
Yeah

359
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:44,637
...And dealing with it means

360
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:47,132
What is the relationship like before?

361
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:47,132
It's completely different...

362
00:20:47,132 --> 00:21:07,198
♬〜

363
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:27,198
♬〜

364
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:39,835
♬〜

365
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:45,472
Things like this...

366
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:45,472
I thought I wanted to

367
00:21:47,868 --> 00:21:50,967
What is that...

368
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:54,330
It's too sudden~

369
00:21:57,637 --> 00:21:59,637
sorry

370
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:04,670
Because you were on your way home earlier.

371
00:21:59,637 --> 00:22:04,670
Because you've been silent for a long time

372
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,967
I thought it was completely over

373
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:11,429
No, that's because

374
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:11,429
Because you speak in the past tense

375
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:14,099
I guess I got dumped on the other hand.

376
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,934
You are serious...

377
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:19,472
sorry

378
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:19,472
already!

379
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:22,000
Not anymore I'm sorry

380
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,538
Don't make me cry!

381
