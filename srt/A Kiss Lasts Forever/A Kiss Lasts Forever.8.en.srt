1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,231
(Tetsuo)《That smile

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,231
I just wanted to watch it forever》

3
00:00:16,363 --> 00:00:18,363
(Keita) What are you going to do after this?

4
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:23,066
(Ryuuka) Hmm, I came last night.

5
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:23,066
I haven't seen anything yet

6
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,462
The original form of school? What's left

7
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,462
I might want to go if there is

8
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:28,627
(Keita) Original form?

9
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:28,627
Yeah

10
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:31,297
Oh, there was a blackboard in the lobby.

11
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:31,297
(Akira) Yeah

12
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,132
Eh, lie, I didn't notice.

13
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,132
Also the gymnasium

14
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:36,660
Looks like it's still there

15
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:36,660
It was on the map

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,330
Hey, I might want to go

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,330
Yeah, are you going?

18
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,198
Yeah yeah

19
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,198
Yeah

20
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:44,033
What's that?

21
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:44,033
Once upon a time in a secret base

22
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,891
Everyone

23
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:45,891
You buried a time capsule.

24
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:47,957
Wow, you filled it out!

25
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:47,957
hey!

26
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:50,363
Eh, nostalgic! Is it still there?

27
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:52,363
No, isn't it? normally

28
00:00:50,363 --> 00:00:52,363
Seriously?

29
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:54,033
Of course there is

30
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:54,033
Yeah

31
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:57,033
Do you want to take a look around for now?

32
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:57,033
Yeah, let's do that, yeah

33
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:03,429
What's that?

34
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:03,429
Sai is coming today, right?

35
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:07,825
Yes, before shooting something.

36
00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:07,825
They said there would be costume matching.

37
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:11,198
Wow, he looks like an actor

38
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:16,000
I mean, my childhood friend

39
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:16,000
Become an artist

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,693
And in that music video

41
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:20,033
A childhood friend

42
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:20,033
I'm going to appear as an actor.

43
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:23,297
Isn't it very emotional?

44
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:23,297
(Akira) That's amazing, both of you.

45
00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:24,957
(Smartphone notification sound)

46
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:28,363
(Keita) Yeah, it’s delicious.

47
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:30,066
(Akira)

48
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:30,066
(Keita) Yeah

49
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:33,825
picture?

50
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:33,825
yeah? What's wrong?

51
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:37,198
Hmm...

52
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:37,198
Somehow, my boyfriend came.

53
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:40,627
Eh, where?

54
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:40,627
E here

55
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:42,297
here⁉

56
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:42,297
Yeah

57
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:43,957
From Tokyo?

58
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:43,957
Yes, I think...

59
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:46,627
Hmmm

60
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:46,627
Eh, something happened?

61
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:50,792
No, I don't know but...

62
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:50,792
But they're already at the lobby.

63
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:53,330
picture!

64
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:53,330
Why don't you just go?

65
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,264
Yeah, we're not at all.

66
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,264
Stroll around and comb

67
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,264
Yeah

68
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:58,924
TRUE?

69
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:58,924
(2 people) Yeah

70
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:01,132
Well then

71
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:01,132
Sorry, I'll go in a bit.

72
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:02,792
(2 people) Yeah

73
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,528
a

74
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,528
Ah, okay, okay

75
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:06,330
Keita is going to eat it.

76
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:06,330
I?

77
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah

78
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,000
I left it to you

79
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,660
It’s me!

80
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,330
See you later

81
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,330
(2 people) Yeah

82
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,000
…a

83
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:32,363
…long time no see

84
00:02:32,363 --> 00:02:35,132
…long time no see

85
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:38,132
What happened? suddenly

86
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:43,396
Ah... well...

87
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,066
a little bit

88
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:49,231
…Yeah

89
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:57,231
...You remembered it well.

90
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:58,924
picture?

91
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:02,231
I'm going to stay here

92
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:02,231
That's what you said

93
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:06,330
…Ah yeah

94
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:11,231
How did you come? to this point

95
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:15,759
Ah, by car

96
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,561
Car share near me

97
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,561
Borrow...

98
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:21,627
Ah, but

99
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:21,627
It took less than 2 hours

100
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:24,000
It was closer than I thought

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,924
I see.

102
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:32,066
...I'm sorry, but I suddenly barged in.

103
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,924
No, it's okay

104
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:40,099
It's been 2 months... or something.

105
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,429
Yeah

106
00:03:56,726 --> 00:03:59,396
...Breakup?

107
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,693
Ah... no...

108
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:08,231
I thought maybe...

109
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:13,429
…no

110
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:19,330
Sorry, that's right

111
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,594
I think so...

112
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:33,000
keep your distance for a while

113
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:33,000
I started thinking about it...

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,033
But somehow

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,033
It's just that time has passed...

116
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:44,132
that's why…

117
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:46,924
I want to face you properly

118
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:46,924
Thinking

119
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:49,924
Ryuka and...

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,066
Well... I guess that's it...

121
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:05,528
…I see.

122
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:17,792
Ah, nothing has changed!

123
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,924
Did you do physical education here?

124
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:24,429
Yes, I also play during recess.

125
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:29,528
Graduation ceremonies, morning meetings, etc.

126
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:34,000
...Before, basketball, skating, etc.

127
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:34,000
I went to many places where I could do many things.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,429
Ah, I went

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,429
Yeah

130
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:39,660
Tetsuo's athletic ability was hopeless.

131
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,033
Yeah

132
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,033
My whole life has nothing to do with sports.

133
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:44,726
I'll say it loud and clear

134
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:47,396
Oh, and that...

135
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:47,396
Take photos of Purikura too.

136
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:49,693
I took that photo. That was awesome!

137
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:52,198
The eyes were already like this, right?

138
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:55,660
I didn't know who it was anymore

139
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,924
Hahaha

140
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,462
…it was good

141
00:06:00,462 --> 00:06:02,132
picture?

142
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:07,429
Ah, that kind of face

143
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:07,429
It's been a while since I saw it

144
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:15,429
a…

145
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:15,429
Maybe it's some kind of excuse

146
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:17,825
I have work lately.

147
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:22,198
With Ryuka

148
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:22,198
I think we passed each other...

149
00:06:22,198 --> 00:06:27,363
Yeah... well, we're both busy.

150
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:32,462
I hadn't been able to go on any dates...

151
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:36,132
Let's talk properly, etc.

152
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:40,363
That kind of obvious thing

153
00:06:36,132 --> 00:06:40,363
It wasn't done, right?

154
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:43,297
…Yeah

155
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:50,660
Hehe... I'll say it again.

156
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:50,660
I don't know what to say.

157
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,198
surely

158
00:06:56,858 --> 00:07:01,165
"(footsteps)

159
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:03,264
《Oh, isn't that good?

160
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:08,330
oh! Ryuka and others too

161
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:08,330
I came here

162
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,000
…Yeah

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,495
(Sai) Thin

164
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:14,198
...Eh, Sai, when did you come?

165
00:07:14,198 --> 00:07:17,693
some time ago

166
00:07:14,198 --> 00:07:17,693
And when I arrived, these guys were there.

167
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:22,495
Well, it hasn't changed at all.

168
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:22,495
Hey

169
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:24,231
It's your boyfriend, right?

170
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:28,165
Ah yes Tetsuo

171
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:32,429
My childhood friend Akira Keita Sai

172
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:32,429
It's Keita

173
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:35,330
(3 people) Nice to meet you.

174
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:35,330
nice to meet you

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,198
Eh, what should I do anyway?

176
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:44,165
What?

177
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:44,165
No, like basketball?

178
00:07:44,165 --> 00:07:45,858
Eh, is there a ball or something?

179
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:48,429
There is, right?

180
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:48,429
No, isn't it normal?

181
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:55,000
(Say) Ah, I'm trapped.

182
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:55,000
(Akira) Huh? to whom

183
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,825
Let's divide by goo and pa!

184
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:10,495
Let's separate!

185
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,198
Whoa

186
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,198
oh!

187
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,396
yeah

188
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,396
thank you

189
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,957
(Say) Yay!

190
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,957
(Keita) It’s been a long time since I last saw you.

191
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:22,924
Huh? Does it look okay?

192
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:25,594
Ah, I've done it before...

193
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:27,825
Just like an elementary school student

194
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:27,825
Yeah

195
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:31,231
Is it okay to start from here?

196
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:31,231
Yeah, okay

197
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:37,198
Hey!

198
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:37,198
Hey!

199
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:38,858
(Keita) Abune

200
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:41,198
Aah! Sorry!!

201
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:41,198
(Keita) Hahaha, it's crazy now.

202
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:43,297
(Akira) No, Keita was also like before.

203
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:43,297
It was pretty good, though.

204
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:47,594
(Keita) Hey, who has no sense of exercise?

205
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:47,594
(Akira) I didn't say that.

206
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,066
Okay, let's go from here.

207
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,066
Hey

208
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:52,627
yes

209
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:52,627
Hey

210
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:55,891
Hey!

211
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:55,891
No, I got the one just now.

212
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:59,264
teeth? Noisy!

213
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:59,264
(Say) Come on, hurry up, hurry up

214
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:01,594
quickly

215
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:01,594
Hey!

216
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:04,363
Un!

217
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:04,363
(Keita) OK OK OK!

218
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:06,693
(Say) Fine.

219
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:06,693
yes

220
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:09,330
(Say) OK! yes~

221
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,990
Un!

222
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,462
(Say) Aah!! Ah~ Shit

223
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,462
Wow dasser

224
00:09:13,462 --> 00:09:15,528
(Say) No, wait a minute...

225
00:09:13,462 --> 00:09:15,528
Eh Dassa Eh?

226
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:17,495
(Say) Referee!

227
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:17,495
(Akira) Cy out

228
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:20,264
(Say) Seriously?

229
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:20,264
yes quickly quickly

230
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:22,561
(Sai) Annoying!

231
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:22,561
Wait a minute, really...

232
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,099
(Akira) Here!

233
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,099
Next time, if you fight, you'll be kicked out.

234
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:27,924
(Yes) No. Isn't the referee strict?

235
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:27,924
Hey, hurry up

236
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:30,462
(Sai) Oh, hey, it's a little...

237
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:32,198
What are you talking about? What are you doing?

238
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,165
(Say) Follow me on the right side

239
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,165
I'm going to the left.

240
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:36,330
That's enough, that's enough!

241
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:36,330
(Sai) No, no, no, no, no, no.

242
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,099
(Yes) Follow me on the right side.

243
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:41,066
Hey, hurry up

244
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,726
(Keita) What?

245
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,726
(Yes) I'm on the left I'm on the left

246
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:45,066
So hurry up and it's enough

247
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:45,066
(Keita) Ah, I'm on the right.

248
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:49,165
(Akira) Something

249
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:49,165
sports play style

250
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:51,726
person's personality

251
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:51,726
I thought it would come out really well

252
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:54,264
(Akira) Especially Sai.

253
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:54,264
(Say) Why?

254
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:56,660
(Akira) No, I guess it means being too persistent.

255
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:56,660
(laughter)

256
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,198
There's nothing wrong with that, just because you're a hard worker.

257
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,023
It's popular

258
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,023
Don't be funny!

259
00:10:01,023 --> 00:10:03,528
What about me?

260
00:10:01,023 --> 00:10:03,528
No, Keita

261
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:05,396
before play style

262
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:05,396
Is it a problem?

263
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,495
Terrible!

264
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:10,990
Well, if you say that, Tetsuo-kun too.

265
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:10,990
It felt pretty good, didn't it?

266
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,660
Huh?

267
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,660
Ah... well yeah

268
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,396
Tonton?

269
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,396
Wow

270
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:17,594
No, I was trying my best.

271
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:17,594
For Tetsuo

272
00:10:17,594 --> 00:10:20,429
No. Is that a follow?

273
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:22,099
picture? Was it no good?

274
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:25,396
Oh no, well... yeah

275
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:27,924
(laughter)

276
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:30,693
What's that?

277
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:30,693
How did you two meet?

278
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:33,528
He was a regular at our cafe.

279
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:35,561
hey?

280
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:35,561
Ah yes

281
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:37,297
Ah, Mitaka?

282
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:37,297
Yeah

283
00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:39,264
(Keita) Eh, Sai, have you ever been there?

284
00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:39,264
Yeah

285
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,066
Ryuka came to Tokyo

286
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,066
Because it was soon

287
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,726
Although it was quite a while ago

288
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,023
Me Ryuka's Instagram

289
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,023
I've seen it before

290
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,023
Yeah me too

291
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:49,528
(clerk)

292
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:49,528
Sorry to have kept you waiting~ It's meat tofu.

293
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:52,660
(Say) It's here!

294
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:52,660
(Keita) The rhinoceros one is out!

295
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,330
(Yes) This is what I wanted to eat.

296
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,165
(Akira) Excuse me, one green tea high.

297
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,165
(Clerk) 1 piece of green tea high

298
00:10:57,165 --> 00:10:59,264
Eh, how?

299
00:10:57,165 --> 00:10:59,264
Did you end up dating?

300
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:03,660
Oh, um...

301
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:03,660
Confess to me and then

302
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,891
Oh, that's right

303
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:10,660
I want to meet Ryuka even just a little bit.

304
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:10,660
I always read books at the store.

305
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,759
I was reading a book

306
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,759
Was that what you meant?

307
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,132
…Ah yeah

308
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,759
Because I wanted to stay as long as possible

309
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,429
Eh, I didn't know

310
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,924
Thanks to you

311
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,924
The amount of reading has increased explosively

312
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:24,066
(Say)

313
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:24,066
Wow, you're so dedicated!

314
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:27,924
Oh no, not at all

315
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:27,924
That's what it is...

316
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:29,594
(Akira) Is there anyone else?

317
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:32,297
Yeah... Tetsuo, what do you need?

318
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:35,528
Ah, um...

319
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:35,528
Oh, chilled tomatoes?

320
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,198
Yeah, that's fine

321
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,198
Yeah

322
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,495
Okay, chilled tomatoes.

323
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,495
1 cup of oolong tea

324
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:42,561
(clerk)

325
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:42,561
Oolong tea and one chilled tomato

326
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:44,528
tomato

327
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:44,528
Are you able to eat now?

328
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:47,363
Yeah, well... I can't eat it.

329
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:50,297
(Say) Ah, one more life.

330
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:50,297
(Clerk) 1 piece

331
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:52,264
Is the above correct?

332
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,858
That's all

333
00:11:52,264 --> 00:11:54,858
(Salesperson) Yes.

334
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:57,726
Sorry, take a moment to go to the bathroom.

335
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:57,726
Ou

336
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:05,891
Ah, this is so good

337
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:05,891
Try it

338
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,198
Ah then...

339
00:12:11,627 --> 00:12:15,023
...We're good friends, aren't we?

340
00:12:11,627 --> 00:12:15,023
picture?

341
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:17,396
Ah... with that Ryuka.

342
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:21,792
Ah well

343
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:21,792
She's like a little sister.

344
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:28,495
He's not being honest, is he?

345
00:12:29,594 --> 00:12:32,990
...Well, that's what I'm thinking.

346
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,297
Because they don't say much

347
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,594
I guess I've always had a tendency to hold back.

348
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:40,825
There are places where it is easy to accumulate

349
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:46,726
Well, take care of it.

350
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,165
(Say)...Sabu!

351
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:54,165
I wonder what you're saying.

352
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:56,297
(Keita) What are you talking about?

353
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:58,198
(Say) No, no, not really.

354
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:00,396
(Akira) Looks so bossy

355
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:00,396
You made an older move.

356
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:02,066
(Yes) Were you listening?

357
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,759
(Keita) What is that?

358
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:03,759
(Say) Huh?

359
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,627
(Keita) Eh, did you say something?

360
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,627
(Staff) Sorry to have kept you waiting.

361
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:09,495
(Clerk) Highball

362
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:09,495

364
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:17,561
Also, Japanese sake.

365
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:20,023
(Yes) Who ordered sake?

366
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:20,023
(Keita) It's me

367
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:22,561
(Yes) I got really drunk before.

368
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:22,561
I regretted it

369
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,231
(Keita) Hehehehe

370
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:28,858
Does Tetsuo-kun drink too?

371
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:28,858
Ah, Tetsuo is weak.

372
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:31,099
Oh no, I'll take it.

373
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,023
picture?

374
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,023
Sorry

375
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:36,858
Eh, are you okay?

376
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:36,858
…Yeah

377
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:40,792
(Sai Akira) Oh...

378
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,726
Are you really okay?

379
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:45,726
Are you okay

380
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:47,792
Ah, thank you for the meal.

381
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:51,528
Ah, can I have another helping?

382
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:51,528

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,429

385
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:08,396
Oh, then coffee...

00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:08,396

387
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:10,627
Hmm, do you have any recommendations?

388
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:12,660
Eh, do you recommend it?

389
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:12,660
Yeah

390
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,330

Oh later

394
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:22,023
This tart is delicious. It's made with bananas.

395
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:23,825
Ah, then a tart.

396
00:14:22,023 --> 00:14:23,825
yes

397
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:26,264
I'm going to become a goth

398
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:26,264
No, I'm not sorry.

399
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:28,627
(Yes) But...

400
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:28,627
Huh? Oh hey hey

401
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:30,561
Something

402
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:30,561
Like a friend set

403
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:34,165
Haha, I haven't written it.

404
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,297
I didn't write that. I didn't write that.

405
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:38,462
(Sai) Friend discount

406
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:38,462
I haven't written it

407
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,462
It's a drink set.

408
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,462
Are you writing?

409
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:44,297
(unlock sound)

410
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,066
Yes, can I go?

411
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,066
(Sai) Ah! Huh...

412
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:50,759
Yes, I'm here. Are you okay?

413
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:50,759
In front

414
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,198
Yeah Seino

415
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,198
(Sai) Seino!

416
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,099
(Say) My back hurts haha...

417
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:00,066
I'm sorry

418
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:00,066
I asked you to help me

419
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,099
(Yes) No, not at all

420
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,891
Huh...

421
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,297
...Are you okay?

422
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:18,231

423
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:18,231
No, boyfriend

424
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:20,759
You came here suddenly

425
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:20,759
Because Keita and others said so.

426
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,627
Ah... yeah

427
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,594
(Yes) Did something happen?

428
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,495
...It's better to face it properly

429
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,495
Isn't it okay?

430
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:43,023
All the way to this point

431
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:43,023
That's why I've been chasing you

432
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:48,561
Yeah…

433
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:55,330
What about Sai? recently

434
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,330
picture? I don't need a girlfriend right now

435
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,726
"Right now, I just want to concentrate on acting."

436
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,726
I was cumming saying that.

437
00:16:03,726 --> 00:16:06,924
When are you talking about?

438
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,066
Well...

439
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:12,165
I wonder what it's like

440
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:18,023
...Good night then

441
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:21,330
Yeah good night

442
00:16:18,023 --> 00:16:21,330
(Say) Yeah

443
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:27,066
(Sound of door opening and closing)

444
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:51,297
Was that happening?

445
00:16:58,122 --> 00:16:59,957
what happened?

446
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,990
Are you okay?

447
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,990
Are you feeling unwell?

448
00:17:58,396 --> 00:18:00,990
…sorry

449
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,297
Shall we break up?

450
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,825
...Do you look okay driving?

451
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:28,825
Yeah, let alone a hangover.

452
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:31,759
On the contrary, I feel sorry

453
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:31,759
I feel refreshed

454
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,089
Don't force yourself to drink anymore

455
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,089
Really, stop it?

456
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:38,089
yes sorry

457
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:38,089
yes

458
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:47,891
...It's Sai-san, right?

459
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:51,924
picture?

460
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:51,924
Oh, Ryuka was in front of me.

461
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,858
"I've always loved you"

462
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,858
the person who said

463
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,594
a…

464
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:03,089
Attack me all the time

465
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:03,089
We met though

466
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:07,495
Even now and forever

467
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:07,495
Where Ryuka is looking

468
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:11,089
I think Sai-san will be there.

469
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:14,363
I was suddenly feeling anxious...

470
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,792
Ah, that's lame

471
00:19:19,363 --> 00:19:21,594
...That's not true.

472
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:30,023
Things have been tough since I moved to Tokyo.

473
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:30,023
A lot happened though

474
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:34,429
Because Tetsuo was there

475
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:34,429
I did my best

476
00:19:39,528 --> 00:19:43,990
...I really liked it.

477
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,693
Yeah I know

478
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:58,264
But... I'm Ryuka

479
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:01,165
A place where you can laugh like Ryuka

480
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:01,165
I want you to stay

481
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:09,330
…sorry

482
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:09,330
Why does Ryuka apologize?

483
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,396
Ah... well, but

484
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:20,330
What I don't like about tomatoes

485
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:20,330
I wanted you to tell me~

486
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,627
No, I can eat it now...

487
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:25,858
In spirit?

488
00:20:23,627 --> 00:20:25,858
Don't overdo it!

489
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,627
I haven't

490
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,627
