00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,693
An elementary school that closed several years ago

3
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:13,726
built and renovated

4
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:13,726
A certain hotel>

Currently open for pre-opening period>

< 卒業生の中には いろいろな方が

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,726
I'm here...>

10
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:35,627
(Yoji) This is heavy, isn't it?

11
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:35,627
(Sato) Ah, it's okay, it's okay.

12
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,396
OK

13
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:39,396
《(Keita) Youji!

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,660
Ou! Ah, Mr. Sato, that's not true.

15
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,660
They're all my childhood friends

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,198
ah! Someone you know

17
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:51,693
(Keita) Become a big fan

18
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:51,693
You can get it wrong...

19
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:53,363
No, I'm sorry!

20
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:56,594
Manager too

21
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:56,594
I don't mean any harm, but

22
00:00:56,594 --> 00:01:00,660
No, but somehow

23
00:00:56,594 --> 00:01:00,660
Looks like it's going to be tough, Yohji too.

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,957
What?

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,957
Well, there are various things

26
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:07,132
Hey

27
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:07,132
(Ryuuka) That's right.

28
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:09,561
Because the manager

29
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:09,561
There are almost

30
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:11,627
(Akira) Yeah, sure.

31
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:14,165
Oh, please apologize to that person later.

32
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,891
I'm not the kind of person who cares about that at all.

33
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,891
It's okay because there isn't.

34
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:19,594
I'm sorry too, really.

35
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:19,594
(Ryuuka) Ugh

36
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:22,363
Or should I say

37
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:22,363
Because I knew that

38
00:01:22,363 --> 00:01:25,000
Didn't the rhino come too?

39
00:01:22,363 --> 00:01:25,000
ah…

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,627
Come to think of it

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,627
Isn't Sai the same?

42
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:31,924
Ah, I called you.

43
00:01:27,627 --> 00:01:31,924
I said okay, I'll see you later.

44
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:34,000
music video meeting

45
00:01:31,924 --> 00:01:34,000
There is, right?

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,165
Oh yeah

47
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:40,297
Eh, by the way

48
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:40,297
Shooting that music video

49
00:01:40,297 --> 00:01:43,561
Who else is coming?

50
00:01:40,297 --> 00:01:43,561
Ah, that's about it

51
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,693
Um, if you don't mind

52
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,693
Can everyone come out too?

53
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,429
yeah?

54
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,429
(Ryuuka) Huh?

55
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:50,429
What does it mean?

56
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:50,429
No, it's a music video

57
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:53,099
I want you to appear on the show.

58
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,033
No, no, no, no!

59
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,198
Yeah?

60
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,198
No no, it's impossible

61
00:01:57,198 --> 00:01:58,858
No, we are amateurs.

62
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:01,792
No, of course

63
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:01,792
It's not like I act like that.

64
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:06,297
It's true, but it looks a little

65
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:06,297
...Is it no good?

66
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:09,132
(Keita) No, I mean no...

67
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,825
What do you think?

68
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:16,099
(Ryuuka) What do you think...

69
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,396
First of all, suddenly

70
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,396
Is it okay to leave? us

71
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:22,693
Of course it's a big deal

72
00:02:19,396 --> 00:02:22,693
I want everyone to come out too.

73
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:25,528
I'm begging you...

74
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:25,528
(Keita) No, but like that.

75
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:29,363
It's like appearing in Yoji Kamiya's work.

76
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:29,363
That's not us.

77
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:31,231
Stop calling me Yoji Kamiya.

78
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:33,858
Because

79
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:33,858
Yoji Kamiya is now a star!

80
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:35,528
I'm not a star.

81
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:39,132
But there's also live shows.

82
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:39,132
It's all decided, right?

83
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:40,891
It's not so much bang bang

84
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:44,000
You've been doing drama songs recently, haven't you?

85
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:44,000
Ah, I did it!

86
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,528
That was from the same office.

87
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,528
Because it happens to be out

88
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:49,726
We just decided on a tie-up

89
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:49,726
(Keita) That’s amazing! It's a star!

90
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:52,165
Not great at all

91
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,132
(Keita) That's amazing!

92
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:54,132
(Ryuuka) Yeah

93
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,759
(Nino) After all, seeing it live

94
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,759
There's an aura

95
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:01,528
…I agree

96
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,825
(Nino) The song is also good.

97
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:22,231
(knock)

98
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:23,891
It's the front desk

99
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:30,297
Sorry to have kept you waiting

100
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:38,792
I'm sorry I couldn't come back

101
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:43,198
I can't help it

102
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:43,198
Now is the time to win

103
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:44,957
Yeah…

104
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:49,297
But thank you

105
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:49,297
What?

106
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,759
Thanks to Chi-chan

107
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,759
I had this opportunity

108
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,033
Ah... it's not really my fault.

109
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,693
no…

110
00:03:56,693 --> 00:04:01,033
But the people at the office too.

111
00:03:56,693 --> 00:04:01,033
I told you to stay at this hotel.

112
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,693
That's right

113
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,693
Yeah

114
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:06,033
No, but it's a nice hotel.

115
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:09,000
I can't believe that school

116
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:09,000
I never expected it to turn out like this

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,429
Well, this is the best room.

118
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:14,594
That's right

119
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:14,594
Yeah

120
00:04:14,594 --> 00:04:18,066
Same size as here

121
00:04:14,594 --> 00:04:18,066
I have another room

122
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:20,132
Hmmm

123
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:23,165
That's Toko Higashijima

124
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:26,099
Oh that's right

125
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:30,627
To the two stars

126
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:30,627
the biggest room

127
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:32,858
Stop it!

128
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:36,396
a…

129
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:40,627
how do you do that

130
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:40,627
Do you decide who will appear?

131
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,396
ah

132
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:46,099
Touko-san

133
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:46,099
We met through a magazine interview project.

134
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,429
We became good friends there

135
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:50,099
Hey

136
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,627
I guess that's what I asked for.

137
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:57,330
That kind of thing too

138
00:04:54,429 --> 00:04:57,330
Will Youji do everything?

139
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,132
I don't usually do it though

140
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,198
This time it's local soup stock

141
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,198
I started planning it myself for the first time.

142
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,264
That's amazing, you're making your dreams come true

143
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,429
Eh, that's not true.

144
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:14,462
Even Chi-chan is fine.

145
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:14,462
I'm doing work that helps people.

146
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:16,759
I guess so

147
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:21,132
Oh, do you want to drink coffee?

148
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:24,924
I'll have a meeting soon after this.

149
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:24,924
Is it okay now?

150
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,792
I see.

151
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,792
Yeah

152
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:30,462
Ah, then I'll go back.

153
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,462
Chi-chan

154
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,462
Yeah?

155
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:39,924
Chi-chan's break time

156
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:39,924
I think I'll be free

157
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:43,462
Can we meet here?

158
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:46,099
Yes, I understand

159
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:48,627
Well, I'll be waiting.

160
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:48,627
Yeah

161
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:51,000
see you later

162
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:08,990
(Aoba) Everyone

163
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:08,990
Is the above okay?

164
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,825
(all) yes

165
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,825
(Aoba) Yes, thank you.

166
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:12,957
(Aoba) May I be the director?

167
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:12,957
(Akasaka) Yeah, it's okay.

168
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:16,231
(Aoba) Yes, thank you.

169
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:16,231
Well, for the convenience of filming.

170
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:19,462
This scene will be tomorrow

171
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:19,462
This will be the last cut

172
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,429
Thank you all for your support

173
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,429
yes

174
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:23,099
(All) Thank you for your support.

175
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,957
(Aoba) Well, that's it for today.

176
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,957
Thank you for your hard work

177
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:27,099
(All) Thank you for your hard work.

178
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,759
I'll talk a little bit.

179
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,495
(Sato) He's out first.

180
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,495
yes

181
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:35,726
rhinoceros

182
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:35,726
(Say) Yeah?

183
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:38,165
Nice to meet you

184
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:38,165
ah

185
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:44,957
Well, I finally kept my promise

186
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:44,957
I'm relieved

187
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:47,056
I'm relieved

188
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:49,660
Ah, I'm not relieved.

189
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:49,660
sorry

190
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,198
But I made a promise, so I'll do it like this

191
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,198
Isn't that why you called me?

192
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:55,858
No no no

193
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:55,858
I called you because I wanted to do it together.

194
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:00,792
You've changed

195
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,759
Eh, I guess so

196
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,990
No, sorry

197
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,990
you haven't changed anything

198
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,231
Sorry, I'll leave

199
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,561
Yeah

200
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:15,396
Thank you for calling me.

201
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:17,561
(sound of door opening)

202
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:23,023
Sorry for the long time.

203
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:25,792
(Ayataka)

204
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:25,792
Ah, hello, it's been a while.

205
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:28,363
No, I'm busy.

206
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:28,363
Thank you very much

207
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:31,627
No, thank you for your help this time.

208
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:31,627
This is Higashijima

209
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:33,957
(Toko) This is Toko Higashijima.

210
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:33,957
thank you

211
00:07:33,957 --> 00:07:36,561
you're welcome

212
00:07:33,957 --> 00:07:36,561
Yoji will take care of you

213
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:38,891
No, that embarrassing story

214
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,023
Youji

215
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,023
This is my first time doing a kissing scene.

216
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:42,990
Sorry for the inconvenience

217
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:42,990
I may be sorry for the inconvenience, but

218
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,660
Please forgive me.

219
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,660
No, no

220
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,660
I'm still not good at it either.

221
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:55,429
(knock)

222
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,363
Huh...

223
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:01,429
(sound of door opening)

224
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,099
Sorry I'm late

225
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:06,594
No, it's okay

226
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:06,594
Thank you for being busy

227
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:09,693
What is this?

228
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:11,363
birthday

229
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:15,023
Huh? Whose?

230
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:15,023
Chi-chan's

231
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:17,990
Ah, over a month ago

232
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,132
Yeah, well, that's true.

233
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:24,132
The celebration is

234
00:08:21,132 --> 00:08:24,132
Don't do it when you meet in person

235
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:28,363
What, you can do that?

236
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:28,363
Isn't it only 2-3 days even if there is a delay?

237
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:31,891
Is that so?

238
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:31,891
Yeah

239
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:35,792
Well, but thanks

240
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:35,792
Yeah

241
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:40,396
eat?

242
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:40,396
picture?

243
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,462
Yeah

244
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,462
Yeah

245
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,990
yes

246
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,990
thank you

247
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,858
The plate is Chi-chan's.

248
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,858
thank you

249
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:53,990
I'll enjoy having this

250
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:53,990
I'll have it

251
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,561
Isn't this amazing?

252
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,561
Yeah

253
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:03,165
Yes, it's delicious!

254
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:03,165
Hehehe

255
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:07,231
Yeah! Delicious

256
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:12,023
Hey

257
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:12,023
Yeah?

258
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:15,165
Why just now?

259
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:15,165
Did you ask, "Do you want to eat?"

260
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:19,495
Hmm, Chi-chan is at work.

261
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:19,495
I wonder if there will be more after this

262
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:22,429
I can't convey it

263
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:22,429
If you don't say that much

264
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,759
sorry

265
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,495
Something like that

266
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:31,165
It will never change, Youji.

267
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:36,056
Is that so?

268
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:36,056
Yeah, it won't change

269
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:41,056
Because it's about me

270
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:41,056
I don't really understand

271
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:44,165
Don't you know it's about you?

272
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:44,165
Yeah

273
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:49,693
Because everyone is changing

274
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:49,693
Isn't that just how it looks?

275
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:52,726
Everyone?

276
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:52,726
What about the friend you met today?

277
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:54,858
Or something

278
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:59,462
Then maybe me too

279
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:59,462
No, Chi-chan is different.

280
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:02,297
That's right

281
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:02,297
Yeah

282
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:08,924
Even the people around you

283
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:08,924
There are various things.

284
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:14,099
Is that so?

285
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:14,099
Yeah

286
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:16,561
Because Yoji is special

287
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:21,023
That's not true.

288
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:21,023
Are you with everyone?

289
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:23,561
but

290
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:23,561
Even if I want to be like Youji

291
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:27,528
People who can't become

292
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:27,528
I think there are a lot of them?

293
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:30,330
Yes, I understand that.

294
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:39,561
Music video now

295
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:39,561
Yeah

296
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:42,198
I hear there's a kissing scene

297
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:44,627
Oh yeah

298
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:49,396
I see.

299
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:49,396
sorry

300
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:52,792
Eh, why are you apologizing?

301
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:52,792
no~

302
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:56,297
Because you thought I was mad?

303
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:56,297
No, no, that's not it!

304
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:59,990
for the work

305
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:59,990
Is this a necessary scene?

306
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,660
Yeah…

307
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,891
If so...I think it's necessary.

308
00:11:05,891 --> 00:11:08,023
think?

309
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:10,990
Eh, didn't you plan it yourself?

310
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,495
Yeah sorry

311
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:16,825
need

312
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:19,528
a…

313
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:23,858
Something...

314
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:28,627
I'm also thinking about Youji.

315
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:28,627
I'm starting to get confused

316
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:31,561
I want to always be on Youji's side.

317
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:31,561
That's what I'm thinking

318
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:34,264
Yeah

319
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:34,264
Chi-chan is always on my side

320
00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:35,990
Huh...

321
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,957
But then, Youji

322
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:40,495
What do I usually think?

323
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:40,495
Are you having a good time?

324
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:42,759
Have you thought about it?

325
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:47,363
My birthday is over a month away

326
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:47,363
If you don't, you won't be able to celebrate.

327
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:50,627
of course

328
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:50,627
I'm glad that Yoji is doing well.

329
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,693
I can't tell anyone

330
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,693
Hanging out with Yoji

331
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:58,660
That's it

332
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:58,660
How lonely must it be?

333
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,023
A sparkling world

334
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,023
To Youji who is always by my side

335
00:12:01,023 --> 00:12:03,429
You don't understand, right?

336
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,099
Chi-chan I'm sorry

337
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,957
But that's the intention

338
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,957
I didn't say that.

339
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:09,198
Ah... no, sorry

340
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:12,330
No, I don't want to fight either.

341
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:12,330
It wasn't there though

342
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,990
It's no good after all

343
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,056
In the end, it's just like another secret meeting.

344
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,056
Because I can't

345
00:12:17,056 --> 00:12:19,726
That's right...

346
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:22,561
I'm really sorry, always

347
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:28,462
Thank you for taking the trouble to buy it for me

348
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:28,462
Sorry I left it there

349
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:32,429
Good luck tomorrow

350
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:32,429
Chi-chan

351
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:36,023
Chi-chan!

352
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:40,099
(Akira) But again, I'm deeply moved.

353
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:40,099
(Ryuuka) Yeah?

354
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:42,627
Yohji's music video

355
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:42,627
There's going to be a rhinoceros

356
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:45,132
Is that so?

357
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:45,132
That's right

358
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,990
Ah, but not just rhinos.

359
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,660
We too just a little bit

360
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,660
I decided to go out

361
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,330
Ah, that's right!

362
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,330
Yeah

363
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,023
first

364
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,023
I wasn't really into it though

365
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:54,165
well now it's

366
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:54,165
Full of spirit

367
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:56,858
(Akira) That's just Keita, right?

368
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:59,132
The actor is

369
00:12:56,858 --> 00:12:59,132
I have preparations for tomorrow

370
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:01,099
Shall we go home soon?

371
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:02,759
Too excited

372
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,561
But I guess I'll go soon.

373
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,561
Yeah

374
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:09,924
It's rhinoceros

375
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:09,924
Did something happen with Youji?

376
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:11,594
...Why?

377
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:13,726
No, since yesterday

378
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:13,726
Every time Yoji's story comes up

379
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,792
I think you're having a strange reaction

380
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,792
It's just my imagination

381
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,891
yes?

382
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,891
Yeah, nothing special.

383
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:21,099
Hmm, that's fine.

384
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:41,505
a…

385
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:43,330
I'm sorry at a time like this

386
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,670
No, it's up to this time anyway.

387
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,670
Because it was work

388
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,505
Thank you for staying late.

389
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,505
thank you

390
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:56,066
Um...

391
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:59,472
Sorry about earlier

392
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:59,472
As for earlier...

393
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:02,000
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

394
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,769
I said it in a way that I didn't like.

395
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,769
no…

396
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,670
I can't say anything either

397
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:12,165
Umm

398
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:15,429
If you don't mind, why don't we walk for a while?

399
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:19,637
Okay, but is Yoji okay?

400
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:22,165
Yeah, it's okay

401
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:34,231
Hey, childhood friend too

402
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:34,231
I was told the same thing as Chi-chan.

403
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:40,297
Little by little, I become a person

404
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:40,297
It's becoming known

405
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:45,363
What I said to someone

406
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:45,363
I wonder how it will be received

407
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:52,571
The more I think about it...

408
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:52,571
I can't say anything anymore

409
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:58,264
Well originally

410
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:58,264
I'm a man of few words, though.

411
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,363
I agree

412
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:05,637
But in Chi-chan's words

413
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:08,231
Still, my old self

414
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:12,363
more properly

415
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:12,363
I felt like I was facing people.

416
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:21,198
come here

417
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:21,198
It's not my place

418
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,637
I guess I wanted to make sure

419
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,637
That kind of thing

420
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:36,000
various things

421
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:36,000
How should I tell you?

422
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,264
The more you worry, the more you worry

423
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,264
I don't understand anymore...

424
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:49,429
Chi-chan's anxiety too

425
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:54,000
at once

426
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:54,000
It may be difficult though

427
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,396
I want to fix it properly

428
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,472
that's why

429
00:16:02,472 --> 00:16:05,264
I want you to continue to be with me

430
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,802
Eh, no...

431
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,099
I don't want to be with you

432
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,099
I didn't say that

433
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:17,330
I understand

434
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,165
But I

435
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:26,132
When we met and now

436
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:26,132
I love Chi-chan

437
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:31,000
No matter how far I go towards my dreams

438
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,429
If Chi-chan wasn't here

439
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,429
I don't think it means anything

440
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:41,967
thank you

441
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:47,835
Since I met you too

442
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:47,835
until this moment

443
00:16:47,835 --> 00:16:50,363
I love Youji

444
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:59,198
good~!

445
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:59,198
Fufufu…

446
00:17:01,472 --> 00:17:04,000
Hehehe

447
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:24,297
Eh, why?

448
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:28,363
If I make 10 more songs

449
00:17:24,297 --> 00:17:28,363
Should I say it?

450
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:33,637
Hehe...

451
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:33,637
Hehehehe

452
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:49,264
Hehehehe

453
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,396
That's cheating, Youji.

454
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,396
picture⁉

455
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:56,099
Cunning!

456
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:56,099
What?

457
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:59,604
It's so sneaky!

458
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:59,604
What do you mean by sneaky?

459
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:07,769

Where do you think this is? 》

464

《Ah, sorry

465
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:17,297
I thought there was no one...》

466
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:20,670
《If you're good at it, that's fine.

467
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:20,670
I'm really bad at it》

468
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,363
《Sorry

469
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,363

Have you made this many songs? 》

473
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,033
《Well, if you're serious about it.

474
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,033
This is the bare minimum.

475
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:51,472
《No, but that's not the case at all.

476
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:51,472
I didn't say that.

477
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:55,505
《Not so much about this kind of thing

478
00:18:51,472 --> 00:18:55,505
It's not about appealing to people.

《Sorry, I don't understand》

《It's amazing》

488
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:24,363
``I can't believe it's good for people.''

489
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:24,363
I couldn't even think about it.

490
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:27,637
《I guess so》

《Eh

506

Yoji Kamiya is just like that.

《Yeah, something like that.

508
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:20,297
I can't think of anything good

509
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:24,396
I feel more like myself when I use my real name

510
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:24,396
I think it's the best.

511
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:27,505
《Well, that's kind of it too.

512
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:27,505

Hey Sai, you haven't seen it, have you?

00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:03,472
Rhinoceros? I haven't seen it

Hey, what's wrong?

What?!

567
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,538
I wish I could keep my promise sooner

568
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,538
I wonder if we can still be friends

569
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:22,670
For Sai's dream, I

570
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:22,670
Even though I swallowed all kinds of thoughts

571
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,330
I loved Ryuka too.

572
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,472
It's already late
