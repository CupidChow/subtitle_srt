Ah yes it's okay

73
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:16,132

《What, do you mean you want to break up? 》

77
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:55,561
《Yeah... I guess that will happen》

78
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,066
《Eh...》

79
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:07,198
《Seriously?》

80
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,825
"…sorry"

81
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:20,198
《...Eh, why? 》

82
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:29,660
《Because suddenly... hey》

83
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:38,264
《Even from now on,

84
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:38,264
That we'll be together forever

85
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:41,627
I can't imagine it.

86
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:46,693
"it is

87
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:46,693
Does that mean you don't want to get married? 》

88
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:53,594
《Or should I say I hate it...》

89
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:58,132
《Eh Sayuri is

90
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:58,132
Can you imagine it the other way around? 》

91
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:02,066
"picture? …》

92
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:08,330

Thank you in advance

97
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:40,099
I asked him to take the photo for me...

98
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:44,033
ah…

99
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:44,033
I'm used to it so it's okay

100
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:53,858
Ah... ah then

00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:10,000

(Aihara) Welcome.

106
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:29,825
Is it okay for one person?

107
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,726
yes

108
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,825
(Aihara) Click here please.

109
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,056

110
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,627
As expected, we meet too often.

111
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:47,561
That's right

112
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,924
Good...

113
00:08:57,396 --> 00:09:01,363
Are you working? that…

114
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:03,023
Ah yes

115
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:06,056
I know the manager here.

116
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:06,056
I was asked to take a photo shoot for the website.

117
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:09,363
Ah, that's right

118
00:09:11,023 --> 00:09:12,825
What did you ask?

119
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:18,990
picture? Ah, um, that B...

120
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,132
Ah, it looks delicious

121
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,792
Sorry

122
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,792
(Aihara) Yes

123
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:29,627
Well,

124
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:29,627
Please give me this pasta from B.

125
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:32,023
Yes, young chicken and lemon

126
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:32,023
It's cream sauce pasta

127
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:35,056
Yes later

128
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:35,056
I'd like an iced coffee, please.

129
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:38,528
Yes, drinks before and after meals

130
00:09:35,056 --> 00:09:38,528
Which one would you like?

131
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:41,429
Well, before dinner

132
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:41,429
I got it

133
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:43,297
please

134
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:53,891
Are you a graduate of this school?

135
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:57,297
Ah well, just in case...

136
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,924
Even if I say that

137
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,924
I transferred schools in 6th grade.

138
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:03,198
I've only been attending for one year.

139
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:03,198
Hey

140
00:10:03,198 --> 00:10:05,396
So, are you a neighbor?

141
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,891
Ah, I have a family home.

142
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,891
Usually in Tokyo...

143
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:12,957
Tokyo?

144
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:12,957
Eh, I'm in Tokyo too, Nakameguro.

145
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:14,990
Wow!

146
00:10:12,957 --> 00:10:14,990
What's that?

147
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,495
Because like that

148
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,495
A town where only fashionable people live

149
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,627
Eh, where is it?

150
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,099
…Banqiao

151
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,099
Eh, it's totally fine, isn't it?

152
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:28,528
No no no

153
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:28,528
Compared to Nakameguro, it's already

154
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,396
It's a nice town, isn't it?

155
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:40,693
picture? Is it Itabashi?

156
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:40,693
No, here

157
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:42,792
The scenery is nice too

158
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:49,429
Ah, what do you think?

159
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,099
Well, I'm used to seeing it locally.

160
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:55,891
(Aihara) Sorry for keeping you waiting.

161
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:55,891
It's iced coffee

162
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:58,198
thank you

163
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:02,594
picture? 29? 30 people this year?

164
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:02,594
yes

165
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:06,198
Ah, it's free

166
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:06,198
Oh, that's a lie!

167
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,990
yes

168
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,990
Born in 1995?

169
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,957
Yeah

170
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,957
Ah, it's true, it's just normal!

171
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:15,495
Apparently it's a generational joke

172
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:15,495
I thought it would go really well

173
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:17,330
If you have finished

174
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:17,330
Is it okay if I put it down?

175
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,891
Ah please

176
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,891
Please take your time

177
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,429
What happens after this? What are you going to do?

178
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:32,297
Ah... Honestly, I didn't have a plan.

179
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:35,330
Well then

180
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:35,330
Please show me somewhere around here.

181
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,330
I finished work too.

182
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,165
I said I could stay one more night.

183
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,165
Because I was told

184
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:43,660
No, not at all...

185
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,264
Huh, there's really nothing around here?

186
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:50,792
There's never going to be anything, right?

187
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:50,792
Eh...

188
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:06,231
Right after I transferred here

189
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:06,231
I came here for an elementary school field trip.

190
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:07,990
Hey, that's right

191
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,528
Because I had zero friends

192
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,528
It was surprisingly unbearable

193
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:13,990
Hehe, such bitter memories...

194
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,132
All I can do is keep climbing silently

195
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,132
There wasn't a mountain, right?

196
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:23,264
But now, with my classmates at that time

197
00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:23,264
Aren't you going to meet me?

198
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:25,363
No, not at all!

199
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:28,495
Or rather, no one

200
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:28,495
I don't think you remember me

201
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:33,330
Oh, by the way.

202
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,264
Snacks for excursions

203
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,264
What did you buy?

204
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,891
You know that donut thing?

205
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,231
ah

206
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,231
The one with those three in it?

207
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:44,396
That and marshmallow

208
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:44,396
I bought the big cutlet every time.

209
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,099
Ah, I remember big cutlet.

210
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,495
(shutter sound)

211
00:12:51,792 --> 00:12:53,990
(shutter sound)

212
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:58,693
Did you get a picture?

213
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:58,693
Yeah

214
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:00,627
Wow, beautiful!

215
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:00,627
Okay, right?

216
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:03,099
Yeah

217
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,759
(shutter sound)

218
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,429
yes

219
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,429
Ah, thank you

220
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:11,198
Good, take it slow

221
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:11,198
Yeah

222
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:21,528
Wow amazing

223
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:30,693
Ha... it's so beautiful

224
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:38,891
Hey, it was so beautiful...

225
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:42,099
(shutter sound)

226
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:44,396
picture? Lie! Did you take the picture just now?

227
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:44,396
Yeah

228
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:46,792
Eh, hey, no, no, no

229
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:46,792
You definitely looked weird.

230
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,462
I haven't

231
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,462
(shutter sound)

232
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:50,627
Oh no, just a little bit more

233
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:50,627
Yes, look this way

234
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:52,495
Oh, just stop it.

235
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:52,495
(shutter sound)

236
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,198
Yes yes yes

237
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,198
Hey, hey, that's enough

238
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,594
Yes, with a smile

239
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,594
Just wait, it's already

240
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:58,891
(shutter sound)

241
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:58,891
Because I took too many pictures!

242
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:02,660
(shutter sound)

243
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,132
thank you

244
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:07,056
What?

245
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:12,056
No, something...

246
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:18,891
I'm glad I came

247
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:26,132
It's definitely just me

248
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:26,132
I've never climbed a mountain like this.

249
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:31,099
Yeah

250
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:57,868
Ah, I'm pretty tired~

251
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:57,868
I feel like my muscles will be sore!

252
00:14:57,868 --> 00:14:59,736
It was quite a good exercise, wasn't it?

253
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:02,198
Often used by elementary school students

254
00:14:59,736 --> 00:15:02,198
I made him climb that mountain.

255
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:04,472
surely

256
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:06,769
Ah sorry

257
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:19,769
...You seem popular, right?

258
00:15:16,604 --> 00:15:19,769
picture?

259
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:23,967
Because something like this

260
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:23,967
It's normal to bite~

261
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:27,231
With that face, with the cameraman

262
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,330
Eh, on the other hand, there's no way they're not popular, right?

263
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,406
Hmm...

264
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:35,165
What do you think?

265
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:38,802
Wow! Challa!

266
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:38,802
Hahahaha

267
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:45,538
why

268
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:45,538
Have you thought about becoming a photographer?

269
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:51,066
Ah yeah...

270
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:55,670
My grandpa used it at home.

271
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:55,670
I have an old camera

272
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,099
So get it

273
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,099
While I was absorbed in taking pictures...

274
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:05,099
Like

275
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:05,099
Hey

276
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,571
Is your work fun?

277
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:10,099
Hmm...

278
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:14,231
oh dear

279
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:14,231
There are many difficult things going on though

280
00:16:14,231 --> 00:16:16,538
oh dear

281
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:24,538
What about that? How's work?

282
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,198
usually

283
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:32,231
Is it normal?

284
00:16:32,231 --> 00:16:35,802
Yeah normal

285
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:56,297
It's a private matter, but

286
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:56,297
Oh, what happened all of a sudden?

287
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:58,670
Hehehe

288
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:04,099
We broke up

289
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:04,099
With my boyfriend of 6 years...

290
00:17:06,264 --> 00:17:10,901
The other person was someone from my workplace.

291
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:15,868
Marriage, etc. Well

292
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:15,868
There were times when I thought

293
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:25,670
By now

294
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:25,670
did you want to marry him

295
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,264
Or

296
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,264
Did you just want to get married?

297
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:44,901
I came here in 6th grade.

298
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:44,901
Somehow I feel uncomfortable...

299
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:50,802
I wonder if something will change if I go to Tokyo?

300
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:50,802
There were times when I thought that

301
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:53,406
not at all…

302
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,066
It's been a long time

303
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:59,967
all all all the time

304
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:59,967
Unable to face each other...

305
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:08,165
What are you doing now that you're 30?

306
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:17,835
terrible! It created a strange atmosphere

307
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,703
I was too drunk

308
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:27,165
oh dear

309
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:27,165
Haven't you worked hard enough?

310
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:31,538
Sayuri is

311
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:31,538
No, not at all

312
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:34,066
Teka name

313
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:34,066
picture?

314
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:37,604
I'll call you suddenly

315
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:37,604
Yes, I tried calling.

316
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:51,835
Me too, for various reasons

317
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:51,835
He was running away, wasn't he?

318
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,439
as a cameraman

319
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,439
become independent rather quickly

320
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:04,264
Well, to put it simply

321
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:04,264
Looks like I was getting carried away

322
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:07,297
Just by force

323
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:07,297
There are things I can do...

324
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:11,066
what I want to do

325
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:15,099
Only now

326
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:15,099
I don't really understand anymore

327
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:23,066
This time's work is also a bit

328
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:23,066
I'm thinking of changing my environment

329
00:19:23,066 --> 00:19:25,571
received

330
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:31,901
I see.

331
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,967
Has anything changed since you came here?

332
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:52,703
Wow, scumbag

333
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,703
Yeah

334
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,703
So it's better to stop

Please check out

342

yes

343

Mr. Shimada, right?

picture?

345
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:37,670
When I was 6th grade

346
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:37,670
We were in the same class...

347
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,802
Ah, Aihara-san?

348
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,066
yes! Ah, so nostalgic!

349
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:48,967
No, when I saw it at the store yesterday

350
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:48,967
I thought, "That's cool."

351
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:55,330
Oh... you remembered it well.

352
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,099
See, I haven't been there for a year...

353
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:01,835
I remember!

354
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:01,835
Mr. Shimada had a strong character.

355
00:22:01,835 --> 00:22:04,967
picture? me like that

356
00:22:01,835 --> 00:22:04,967
It was thought

357
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:08,835
Yeah, it was a really strong punch.

358
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:08,835
Ah, that's right

359
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:12,604
Yes, that's why

360
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:12,604
I thought you'd like to talk

361
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:15,505
《I hated this town》

362
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:20,099
《But you

363
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:20,099
The view taken through the viewfinder

364
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:22,802
It kind of makes me want to cry

365
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:22,802
It's beautiful...》

Asahi Elementary School site

I'm talking about turning it into a hotel.

Let's go together if possible

382
00:23:19,406 --> 00:23:21,571
There are so many memories there

My life has changed too

See you in the next life

385
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:28,406
Were you happy with me?
