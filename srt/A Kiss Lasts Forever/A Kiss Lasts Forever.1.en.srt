This is Kanda, where I made a reservation.

(Sasaki)

21
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:45,594
These are Sasaki and Tamayama, who were reserved.

22
00:00:45,594 --> 00:00:48,264
Ah, this is the invitation I received.

23
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:50,165
thank you

24
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:54,099
Mr. Sasaki and Mr. Tamayama.

25
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:54,099
I've been waiting for you

26
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:56,231
Welcome to "ASAHI HOTEL"

27
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:03,627
(Miku) Huh?

28
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:03,627
Eh, amazing!

29
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:06,000
Wow, it's actually a hotel.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,066
Huh, isn't it so beautiful?

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,066
Hey

32
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:11,132
picture~

33
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:16,462
Hey, which bed would you like?

34
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:20,759
Eh, which one?

35
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:20,759
What about Sasaki? Which one is better?

36
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,231
Eh, what do you think?

37
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:25,231
Is it this way?

38
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:25,231
Ah, me too

39
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,231
What?

40
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:27,231
Okay, Miku, come here.

41
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:30,099
Ah yes, thank you...

42
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:34,231
Yo!

43
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,495
Haa

44
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:42,363
No, what?

45
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:42,363
A hotel bed is nice.

46
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:47,165
This crispy texture

47
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:47,165
It's like I can't say anything

48
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:48,858
I agree

49
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:57,462
Here is the Sasaki quiz Yes

50
00:01:57,462 --> 00:02:00,396
This place was originally

51
00:01:57,462 --> 00:02:00,396
What room was it?

52
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:04,000
Eh, it's the library.

53
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:04,000
Eh, that's correct. I understand.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,924
Well, that little rise

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,924
It's definitely a library.

56
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, I guess it was easy.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,429
Well then, what should I do next?

58
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:18,198
Hey Sasaki

59
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:18,198
Yeah?

60
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:20,891
Can I do that too?

61
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,693
What?

62
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,693
sleep

63
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:25,396
picture? Ah, okay, but

64
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,957
Ah, I'm sorry.

65
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:27,957
The bed might not be as crispy.

66
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, okay

67
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:30,000
picture

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,627
Ah, then I'm sorry.

69
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:36,066
Not much there anymore

70
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:36,066
I might want you not to sit down.

71
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:38,429
If you don't sleep

72
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:38,429
Eh, why?

73
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:40,726
no

74
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:40,726
I know I'm being greedy.

75
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:42,396
If you'll take the trouble to replace me

76
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,660
Crispy again

77
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,660
I want to taste it properly

78
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,330
picture?

79
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,033
Ah Sasaki

80
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,033
Are you going to sleep here?

81
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:52,000
Eh, yeah, that's right.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,759
Eh, because

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,759
Miku: Are you going to sleep here?

84
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,429
Yeah

85
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,429
Yeah

86
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:57,363
Oh, do you mean change the beds too?

87
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:57,363
Eh, why?

88
00:02:57,363 --> 00:02:59,594
Eh no

89
00:02:57,363 --> 00:02:59,594
It's not crispy here.

90
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:02,099
No, I have a crisp bed

91
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:02,099
I didn't say it was good, right?

92
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,660
Ah... but

93
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,660
You want to sleep here, right?

94
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,231
Yes, that's why...

95
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,924
No, that's fine.

96
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:16,297
Well, sorry then.

97
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:16,297
I said it wrong

98
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,264
just the place

99
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,264
Can I have it replaced?

100
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,957
Oh no, of course I'd be happy to do that.

101
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:22,726
How much

102
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:22,726
I like crispy beds

103
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:24,594
No, there's no one who doesn't like it.

104
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:24,594
crisp bed

105
00:03:24,594 --> 00:03:30,000
(ringtone)

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,462
yes

107
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,132
Ah, no, yes

108
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:41,528
Ah, that's right

109
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,132
yes

110
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:48,396
Ah, I'd love to hear from you, yes.

111
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:50,693
Thank you for your support.

112
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:54,693
who?

113
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:54,693
Eh, hotel people

114
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,297
Isn't that so?

115
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,297
No, because I asked who it was.

116
00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:00,198
Who and what call do you mean?

117
00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:00,198
usually

118
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:04,132
Oh no, something like that

119
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:04,132
The hotel also has leisure facilities.

120
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:07,726
The gymnasium and mushroom plaza

121
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:07,726
It seems like they're leaving it as it was before.

122
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:10,792
What if you have time?

123
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:10,792
Hmm, that's right

124
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,759
Yeah, how about it?

125
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,759
What?

126
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,891
You said you'd be happy to visit.

127
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,891
by yourself

128
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:19,132
No, I thought I would go.

129
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:19,132
Yeah, that's fine though

130
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,231
Eh, where are you going?

131
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:24,231
Hmm

132
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:27,726
Would you like to take a look at the gymnasium?

133
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,693
Okay okay

134
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:34,000
Eh, if there was that

135
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't you want to do it for the first time in a while?

136
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,429
《The index finger is

137
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,429
Make sure both are in the center.

138
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:42,099
《Yes, yes》

139
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:45,495
《The side is

140
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:45,495
Spread it out so that you can fit one hand in it.

141
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,759
《Yes, try throwing it.》

142
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:52,429
(2 people) Ah!

143
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:52,429
It's no good

144
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:55,825
No, because it's been a while.

145
00:04:52,429 --> 00:04:55,825
why? Are you not doing it anymore?

146
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:59,627
It's hard when your hand gets injured.

147
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:59,627
Oh, as expected of a hairdresser

148
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:02,000
Hairdresser apprentice

149
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:08,660
Oh amazing

150
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:08,660
Hehe, yes, then 1-0.

151
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,462
Eh!

152
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:13,429
Okay, Seino-ho.

153
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:15,759
ah!

154
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:15,759
ah

155
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,528
Use your wrists more

156
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,528
Better throw it

157
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,957
Well, if that's the case then

158
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,957
It doesn't reach me

159
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,858
Lend me a little

160
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,957
Yeah

161
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:30,924
If you want to fly far

162
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:33,891
index finger

163
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:33,891
Hold both so that they are centered

164
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:37,297
Yeah

165
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:37,297
And the armpit is about the size of a fist.

166
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:41,627
Yeah

167
00:05:37,297 --> 00:05:41,627
Yes, if you throw it in an arc,

168
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:45,693
oh!

169
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:45,693
I guess it's like that

170
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,363
yes

171
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:53,066
Well...

172
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,264
Is this okay?

173
00:05:57,264 --> 00:06:00,759
Ah, not

174
00:05:57,264 --> 00:06:00,759
Just a little more, you can close it.

175
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,528
Yeah, about this.

176
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,528
Yeah

177
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:09,858
Yes, the line of sight is

178
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:09,858
Don't distract from the goal

179
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:12,165
Okay

180
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:12,165
Okay?

181
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:18,297
Look at the goal, not at me

182
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:18,297
Ah sorry

183
00:06:18,297 --> 00:06:20,660
Okay...hehe

184
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,693
Ah, what a shame! What a shame!

185
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,693
ah!

186
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:26,264
difficult~

187
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,099
"yes"

188
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:34,000
《Is this okay? 》

189
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:34,000
《Ah, not》

190
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
《More here》

191
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,297
《Yes, yes

192
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,297
Then spread the sides a little more.

193
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:40,957
《Yes, this much》

194
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:44,000
《The perspective is

195
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't distract from the goal》

196
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,066
《Okay? 》

197
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,066
"Yeah! 》

198
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,165
《Ah, not this way.

199
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,165
Look at the goal

200
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:53,132
《Ah, sorry》

201
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,000
(2 people)《Here in! 》

202
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,198
Hey Sasaki

203
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,198
what?

204
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:18,198
With me

205
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:18,198
Yeah

206
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,264
Are you happy?

207
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:24,198
why?

208
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:26,528
Because I don't see it that way

209
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:30,099
Eh... Eh, why? I'm happy

210
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,759
Doesn't it look like that?

211
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,198
Hmm, I wish that were the case.

212
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:41,825
What about Miku? Aren't you happy?

213
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:46,594
no

214
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:46,594
If Sasaki thinks so

215
00:07:46,594 --> 00:07:48,891
I'm happy, me too

216
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:53,561
No, because

217
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:56,056
Miku in high school

218
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:56,056
I got a boyfriend in an instant.

219
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:59,099
At that time

220
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:59,099
It was so troublesome.

221
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,099
What?

222
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:07,198
No, I have a boyfriend.

223
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:07,198
I've been told that I'm too friendly.

224
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:10,165
But if we meet

225
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:12,957
They don't say things like that.

226
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:12,957
to no one

227
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:18,429
picture? Huh, that's the reason?

228
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:21,594
What?

229
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:21,594
No, we're dating

230
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:27,023
No, the reason we're dating is

231
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:27,023
It's because I like it

232
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:30,495
But it's not that

233
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:30,495
It's a matter of whether you're happy or not.

234
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:34,660
Hey, row properly.

235
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:34,660
It won't progress

236
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:46,924

night?

239
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:49,759
Yeah

240
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,165
Eh, which one do you like?

241
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,165
Eh!

242
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,693
What about Miku? yes

243
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:59,132
Hmm...

244
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:03,023
Rock, paper, scissors

245
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:03,023
Okay

246
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:06,297
(2 people) At first it was like rock, paper, scissors.

247
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:08,132
It's Aiko right?

248
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:20,297
It's amazing. You can do so many things.

249
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:23,924
You know, there used to be nothing.

250
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:29,891
Yes, that's why

251
00:09:23,924 --> 00:09:29,891
We became good friends though.

252
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:32,099
Well

253
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:39,924
That's Sasaki

254
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:41,924
what?

255
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:45,660
Ugh

256
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,056
Let's continue to get along well

257
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:52,396
picture? What now?

258
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:54,825
I'm going to go to the toilet for a while.

259
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:54,825

268
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:34,528
The two of us were always slacking off.

00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:37,561

I'm home~

286
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:54,792
It was pretty slow.

287
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:54,792
Yeah

288
00:12:12,155 --> 00:12:13,825
Wow!

Huh? Huh?

Oh wait!

Wait, what are you doing?

Sorry I spilled it.

Are you okay? Are you okay? No, no, no

Ah… towel towel towel

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,561
Where is it?

296
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:23,693
No, everything. I just went to the bathroom.

297
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:23,693
I think I took it.

picture? ah…

299
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,924
Oh, I guess I should ask the hotel staff.

300
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,924
You might get a new futon.

301
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,594
No, okay, okay, don't go that far.

302
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:34,264
No, it's soaked.

303
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:34,264
Well then

304
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:38,792
Eh but

305
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:38,792
You can sleep there too, right?

306
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:43,188
Ah... certainly

307
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:46,363
Ah sorry

308
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:46,363
No, sorry, this is it

309
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,825
No no no

310
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,825
I'm sorry, I'm not that nice.

311
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:51,155
Okay, let's change.

312
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:54,495
picture?

313
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:54,495
picture? No, let's change the bed.

314
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:57,891
Ah, sorry, I might not like this side.

315
00:12:57,891 --> 00:13:01,264
What are you saying?

316
00:12:57,891 --> 00:13:01,264
picture?

317
00:13:01,264 --> 00:13:03,023
After all, the wind is blowing there.

318
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:05,924
Hey, I don't know?

319
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,924
Um... what?

320
00:13:09,924 --> 00:13:12,297
this situation

321
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:14,023
Is the bed wet?

322
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:16,759
Well, that's true too.

323
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,330
Does that mean it doesn't dry quickly?

324
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,330
teeth? why?

325
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,924
picture? ...Will it damage the bed?

326
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:25,297
Do you think we're talking about that now?

picture…

328
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:27,627
Isn't that what we're talking about now?

329
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:30,122
Eh, that's wrong, right?

330
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:32,363
What? It will change

331
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:34,924
What? That kindness

332
00:13:32,363 --> 00:13:34,924
I don't need it though

333
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:40,759
Ah... I'm sorry.

334
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:54,056
Eh... Let's sleep together.

335
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:54,056
Isn't that so?

336
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:13,231
air…

337
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:13,231
Do you mean me and Mikuga?

338
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:17,561
teeth? Who else is there?

339
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:17,561
Well, I was just trying to say it.

340
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:20,396
No, don't say it

341
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:20,396
It's such a bad thing right now

342
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:24,122
sorry…

343
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:30,957
Why is it always like that?

344
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:35,693
Is it always like that?

345
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:38,122
It won't change, even if we're together

346
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:40,330
Ever since I was a child

347
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,693
picture…

348
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,693
What, why are you dating?

349
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:50,858
no…

350
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:50,858
Of course I like it

351
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:55,264
Yes, that's why I love you

352
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:55,264
That's just as a friend, right?

353
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:57,056
No, that's not true.

354
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:57,056
Then what?

355
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:59,528
I've never been kissed

356
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:59,528
We've never even held hands

357
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:03,957
Do you really hate me that much?

358
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:03,957
Is it that embarrassing?

359
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:06,264
That's not true.

360
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:25,089
today

361
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:25,089
I was thinking about that all day...

362
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:27,495
Maybe I want to break up after all

363
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:43,023
…why?

364
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:43,023
You know why, right?

365
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:50,330
no…

366
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:54,759
No...I don't want to break up.

367
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,122
Eh, because

368
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,122
Is there any point in dating?

369
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,363
It makes sense, of course.

370
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,363
Then what? What does that mean?

371
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,660
Because... I like it.

372
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,188
Yes, that's why

373
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,188
Sasaki treats me as a friend

374
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,891
You just want to keep it connected, right?

375
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,891
like in high school

376
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:14,363
No, no... that's not it.

377
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:16,693
I think I like her as a girlfriend.

378
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:16,693
properly

379
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:19,396
That's because this is the situation right now.

380
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:19,396
just saying that

381
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,297
Once you've calmed down properly

382
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,297
I think it's better for us to break up

383
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:23,759
I think it will be after all

384
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,429
picture…

385
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:30,396
It's not just now, really.

386
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:34,429
Eh, okay already

387
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,462
I feel... tired and all sorts of things.

388
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:45,990
sorry

389
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:51,792
I can't believe you made me think like that

390
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:51,792
Because I didn't think so

391
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:55,122
Yes, that's why I said it's fine.

392
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:03,023
I'm sorry it's my fault

393
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:08,396
That bed...

394
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:08,396
I'll let you sleep half the time.

395
00:17:25,396 --> 00:17:29,693
Hey, we're still talking.

396
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:34,990
When I wake up tomorrow morning

397
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,627
Me and Sasaki are already friends.

398
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:42,693
Then it's like before again

399
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:42,693
You'll be able to laugh properly

400
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:45,990
…Miku

401
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,957
Ah, I'm looking forward to it

402
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:57,627
(Birds chirping)

403
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,660
good morning

404
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,155
good morning

405
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:15,089
I was awake

406
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:15,089
…Yeah

407
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:17,297
I must have been awake for a long time

408
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:22,792
That's right

409
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:22,792
Yeah

410
00:18:28,462 --> 00:18:31,759
Can we talk for a moment now?

411
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,660
Yeah

412
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:54,056
I've been thinking about it for a long time

413
00:18:55,122 --> 00:19:03,363
No, I've been thinking about it for a long time.

414
00:18:55,122 --> 00:19:03,363
I was thinking

415
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:07,089
What is Miku?

416
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:07,089
We've been together too long

417
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:09,429
It's like a family.

418
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:12,891
It's important though

419
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:18,726
to its importance

420
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:18,726
Or rather, I didn't notice it.

421
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:26,122
start a new relationship

422
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:31,891
What has been until now

423
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:31,891
Everything might break

424
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:37,122
That's what

425
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:37,122
I think I was scared somewhere in my heart.

426
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:42,660
but…

427
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,825
After all, from now on too

428
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,825
He wants me to be Miku's boyfriend.

429
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:47,693
I thought again

430
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:51,122
Not friends

431
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:54,627
Hmm...

432
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,924
why?

433
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:03,528
Because I like it

434
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:08,396
That's all I'll say

435
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:08,396
No. Is there anything else?

436
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:12,429
Yeah, well, that's true.

437
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:18,792
Huh! Eh, wait a minute

438
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:18,792
what?

439
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:22,429
Did you try to kiss me?

440
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:22,429
Yeah

441
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,429
No, now's not the time.

442
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,429
Ah, umm

443
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,297
I really love you from the bottom of my heart

444
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:36,726
I've always thought so

445
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,627
Eh, no, that's not it.

446
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,627
It's not that I don't like words;

447
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:46,858
Waking up

448
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:50,155
Oh? Ah sorry

449
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:54,561
It's my first time, so I know the rules.

450
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:54,561
I don't understand.

451
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:57,023
Is it against the rules to wake up?

452
00:20:57,023 --> 00:21:02,330
I mean it's against the rules

453
00:20:57,023 --> 00:21:02,330
If I do, I want to brush my teeth properly.

454
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,990
Eh, why?

455
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:09,429
No, as soon as I wake up in the morning, it's in my mouth

456
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:09,429
Bacteria are multiplying a lot, aren't they?

457
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:12,957
Oh... no, including Miku's bacteria.

458
00:21:12,957 --> 00:21:14,627
I want to continue to be with you

459
00:21:12,957 --> 00:21:14,627
I'm thinking

460
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:17,957
No, it's fine, I don't think so.

461
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:17,957
Bacteria will disappear eventually

462
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:21,660
No, I'm really saying it.

463
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,231
I want to prepare myself mentally.

464
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:26,759
It's my first time too...

465
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:31,231
Got it

466
00:21:44,363 --> 00:21:47,924
The most precious toothpaste in the world

It's my first time

477
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:06,264
from now on

478
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:06,264
thank you

479
00:23:06,264 --> 00:23:09,330
Ah, that's a bit...

480
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:13,660
Hey, why?

481
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,396
From today I

482
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,396
Apparently he's in charge of Jin-kun's education.

483
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,056
Nino-kun is so funny

484
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:22,231
Thank you for your hard work

485
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:22,231
Are you feeling better?

486
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:25,297
If you don't like me

487
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:25,297
Why are you doing this?

488
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:28,231
Even if you know the real me

489
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:28,231
Can you say the same?
