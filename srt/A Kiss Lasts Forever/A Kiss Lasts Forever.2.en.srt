1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,957
This is chicken nanban and cooked rice.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,957
It will be a set of soaps

3
00:00:06,957 --> 00:00:09,396
Well, imagine a school lunch...

4
00:00:09,396 --> 00:00:13,363
(chee)< here

5
00:00:09,396 --> 00:00:13,363
An elementary school that closed several years ago

6
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:17,132
built and renovated

7
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:17,132
A certain hotel>

8
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:20,957
< 現在は まもなく始まる

9
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:20,957
For pre-opening

10
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:23,462
We are in the preparation period>

11
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:27,693
(Nino) It's over.

12
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:27,693
(Nagisa) Thank you

13
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,825
Sorry, after all

14
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:30,825
Please stay with me until late

15
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:33,165
home

16
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:33,165
For Nagisa-san, always before opening.

17
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:35,693
You taught me a lot of things...

18
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:35,693
Mr. Senzaki

19
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:40,066
To Senzaki-san

20
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:40,066
Thank you for teaching me many things.

21
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:42,462
I'm really grateful

22
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:47,363
Okay, I'm done with this one too.

23
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:47,363
Shall we go home?

24
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:50,066
The larger one

25
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:50,066
If you can't eat it all in one sitting

26
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:52,462
Refrigerate properly

27
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:55,132
The rest can be refrigerated

28
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:58,429
Preferably in about 2 days

29
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:58,429
I might want you to eat it all.

30
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:02,924
Nagisa-san

31
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:02,924
Aren't you hungry?

32
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:06,231
It's so empty

33
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:08,495
Well then

34
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:08,495
Let's eat together

35
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:12,627
Eh, okay

36
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:12,627
I only made it for Jin-kun.

37
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:15,264
No, but

38
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:15,264
I can't eat it all by myself anyway.

39
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,528
Hey, that's why you were listening?

40
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:21,792
Freeze what you can't eat.

41
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:21,792
I told you, right?

42
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:24,330
No, I heard that.

43
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,033
Jin-kun, I didn't make it.

44
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:30,000
Usually something proper

45
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:30,000
You haven't eaten, have you?

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,165
Eh, that's not true.

47
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:37,099
So what did you eat last night?

48
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:37,099
No, yesterday happened to be

49
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,792
It was cup ramen though

50
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,792
Look!

51
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:42,264
No, it's true yesterday

52
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:42,264
I happened to come home late.

53
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:44,231
I don't have much time...

54
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:48,033
Hey, when we open now

55
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:48,033
There are also night shifts.

56
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:52,033
It really hurts my body

57
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:52,033
I have to be careful on a regular basis.

58
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,858
Are you going home?

59
00:01:53,858 --> 00:01:56,396
Yeah, I'm going home

60
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:59,891
A little more

61
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:59,891
Would you like to take it easy?

62
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:01,726
Yeah…

63
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:03,627
I have an early shift tomorrow too.

64
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:06,858
No, but I wish we could be together more.

65
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:10,924
Same as before.

66
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:10,924
I guess I don't have to worry about it...

67
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:18,891
What? The one from earlier

68
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:18,891
No, that eating habits.

69
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah

70
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:23,000
So please always be careful

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,693
properly

72
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,693
No, not...

73
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:30,231
I wish we could be together on a regular basis

74
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:30,231
in a sense

75
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,330
If that's the topic...

76
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,033
I'm going home after all

77
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:44,264
Oh no

78
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:44,264
Ah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

79
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,924
Oh wait a minute

80
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,924
I'm sorry I'm sorry

81
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:47,924
don't wait

82
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:47,924
Eh, but then

83
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:51,165
If you don't like me

84
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:51,165
Why are you doing this?

85
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:55,396
I don't like Jin-kun

86
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:55,396
What have you ever said?

87
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:58,792
Then why?

88
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:58,792
Won't you go out with me?

89
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,462
What?

90
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:04,033
For Jin-kun

91
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:04,033
Is dating really that important?

92
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:06,693
Normal, isn't it?

93
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:09,660
Because it's normal

94
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:09,660
Does that mean you want to hang out?

95
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,627
no…

96
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,627
It's not because it seems normal.

97
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,561
but

98
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,561
I have a feeling of love

99
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:20,660
make it into something

100
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:20,660
What I want to express is

101
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,033
Isn't that normal?

102
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:26,528
Then, with a child who thinks that's normal

103
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:26,528
It would be nice if we could hang out

104
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:28,792
Eh, why is that?

105
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,033
Because I don't think so.

106
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:37,297
Even so

107
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:37,297
When someone I love says that to me

108
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:41,957
how do i feel

109
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:41,957
do you understand?

110
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:51,792
Because it's the same story over and over again.

111
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:51,792
everytime

112
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:56,726
I'm dating someone now

113
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:56,726
Even if you say you can't think of it,

114
00:03:56,726 --> 00:03:58,693
Well, not with me.

115
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:01,825
Maybe I just want to hang out with someone

116
00:03:58,693 --> 00:04:01,825
I think so.

117
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,561
no

118
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,561
That can't be true, right?

119
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:07,099
Yeah…

120
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,462
So that's enough about this story.

121
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:13,066
It's not good

122
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:16,924
sorry

123
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,231
I guess I'll go home today after all

124
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:25,726
(Sound of door opening and closing)

125
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:29,132
This time

126
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:29,132
Due to my clumsiness

127
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:33,231
We apologize for the inconvenience.

128
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:33,231
I am very sorry.

129
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,066
Well then

130
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,066
We look forward to seeing you again.

131
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:41,792
yes

132
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:44,495
Senzaki was in charge today.

133
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:46,957
Please excuse me then.

134
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,033
(Hanging up sound)

135
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:55,891
I'm sorry

136
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:59,132
Yeah…

137
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:03,858
Well, I'll change the schedule anyway.

138
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:03,858
Because it's okay now

139
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:07,528
for now

140
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:07,528
Enough about this, but...

141
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:11,066
The date and time is

142
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:11,066
Be sure to check repeatedly

143
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:14,033
yes

144
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:17,231
And with that

145
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:17,231
When an irregular case comes

146
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:21,627
don't judge yourself

147
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:21,627
Be sure to get confirmation from your superior

148
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:26,033
Have you explained it many times?

149
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:26,033
Why didn't you?

150
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:29,000
Sorry

151
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:37,429
It's good that I'm getting used to it

152
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:37,429
Everyone makes mistakes, but

153
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:40,363
I've been feeling a little slack lately.

154
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:43,198
Sorry

155
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:43,198
I hope this doesn't happen again

156
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:45,759
be careful

157
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,066
(Sound of door opening and closing)

158
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:57,033
(Nakahara) What happened?

159
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:01,792
Oh, about that music video

160
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:01,792
Wasn't it?

161
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:05,627
Oh Yoji Kamiya?

162
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:05,627
Yes that's right

163
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:07,330
The camera staff

164
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,957
Visit the shooting location in advance

165
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,957
There was a story about

166
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:15,330
On that day, I was preparing for the pre-opening.

167
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:15,330
It's a day when vendors come and go all day.

168
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,858
Ah, 5 days?

169
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,858
Yes that's right

170
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,561
Ah, I see.

171
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:24,462
And now I'm going to give Mr. Senzaki the day of the tour.

172
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:24,462
I was delayed from the 5th.

173
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:26,297
I see

174
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:26,297
Sorry

175
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:29,858
No, you don't have to apologize to me.

176
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:29,858
yes

177
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:34,396
(sound of curtains opening)

178
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:40,198
(Sound of approaching footsteps)

179
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:42,594
I'm sorry

180
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:47,099
too depressed

181
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:51,165
But to various people

182
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:51,165
Because I caused you trouble...

183
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:59,462
If only I could look like that forever

184
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:59,462
Will everyone hate me?

185
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:02,165
Sorry

186
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:06,726
I'm already hated

187
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:06,726
I can't laugh

188
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:10,363
But I love you.

189
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,165
picture?

190
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:23,330
I love you, Jin-kun.

191
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,660
I love you too, Nagisa-san.

192
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,495
Yesterday I was with someone else

193
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,495
It's okay if we get along

194
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,264
I said that...

195
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:43,231
I don't really think so.

196
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:47,561
I understand, just fine.

197
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:52,099
I'm sorry

198
00:07:54,495 --> 00:08:00,528
With no one now

199
00:07:54,495 --> 00:08:00,528
I can't hang out with you though

200
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:06,660
nevertheless

201
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:06,660
Because I think it's really important

202
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,066
About Jin-kun

203
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:14,132
Me too

204
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:34,396
Are you feeling better?

205
00:08:34,396 --> 00:08:36,363
yes

206
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:42,198
Well then

207
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:42,198
Let's do our best this afternoon too.

208
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,429
yes

209
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,660
It will look like this

210
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:57,660
Ah, it's in three stages.

211
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,627
That's right, yes

212
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:01,297
So, shall I try it next time?

213
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:01,297
Ah yes

214
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:03,297
yes alone

215
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,000
thank you

216
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:20,264
(Obayashi)

217
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:20,264
My girlfriend and I are both graduates of this school.

218
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:22,099
You can also do weddings.

219
00:09:20,264 --> 00:09:22,099
When I heard it

220
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:24,023
I definitely want to do it here

221
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,726
(Amemiya) Is that so?

222
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:29,660
it is

223
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:29,660
thank you very much

224
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,297
this is here

225
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,297
We are proposing

226
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:34,363
It's a list of plans.

227
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:36,264
Maybe the customer

228
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:38,396
wedding ceremony here

229
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:38,396
It may become the first

230
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:41,594
(Kobayashi) Huh? Is that so?

231
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:41,594
Yes, if you wish.

232
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:44,066
Feel free to do anything

233
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:44,066
Please tell me

234
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,264
Let's make it a nice ceremony

235
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:47,990
(Obayashi) Yes, thank you very much.

236
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,462
We look forward to seeing you again

237
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,462
(Obayashi)

238
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:53,462
thank you

239
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:00,990
Phew... Okay!

240
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,594
Thank you for your time today despite your busy schedule.

241
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,594
thank you

242
00:10:06,594 --> 00:10:09,693
No, to Mr. Senzaki

243
00:10:06,594 --> 00:10:09,693
From the previous hotel

244
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,297
I really appreciate your help

245
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:15,528
Nino

246
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:17,759
Ah yes

247
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,330
Today is

248
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,330
take your precious time for me

249
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,561
thank you very much

250
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,198
Work in a different department

251
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,198
Thank you for visiting

252
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:28,495
even more

253
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:28,495
to work at a hotel

254
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,165
I have come to terms with it.

255
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,165
I learned a lot

256
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:33,297
thank you very much

257
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:36,759
It was so hot!

258
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,198
Eh, this kid

259
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,198
Is it always like this?

260
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:44,363
Well... I'm serious.

261
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:47,957
Hehe, ah, but what do you think?

262
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:50,495
Wedding too

263
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:50,495
It's pretty good, isn't it?

264
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,330
Yes, that's right

265
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,132
As expected, that's what it is.

266
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,132
When I see happy people

267
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:59,198
Someday I'll feel like I'll be there too

268
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:59,198
I can make you

269
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:02,891
That kind of work is

270
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:02,891
I think it's worth doing after all.

271
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:05,693
Well then

272
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:05,693
If Senzaki-san doesn't like it

273
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:07,957
Come to the banquet club anytime

274
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:07,957
You can request a transfer.

275
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:11,726
No, that's it! Mr. Senzaki

276
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:11,726
He's a really great senior.

277
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:13,660
As a person

278
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:13,660
I really respect you

279
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,792
How can I hate Senzaki-san?

280
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:19,066
no matter what

281
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:19,066
Absolutely impossible

282
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:23,561
I want it! joke joke

283
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:23,561
Sorry

284
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:27,660
(TV audio)

285
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:27,660
《(Sound of cooking)

286
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,924
I hope it's a good ceremony

287
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,627
Yeah…

288
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,759
Oh sorry, what are you talking about?

289
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,099
I'm going to have a wedding meeting today.

290
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,099
The two people who came

291
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:48,231
Ah yes, that's right

292
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:02,594
Ah... I'm sorry, that's it.

293
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:02,594
Is it okay?

294
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:04,825
Ah yes

295
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:10,924
Is Jin-kun someone you want to get married to?

296
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,825
No, well

297
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:19,693
I have just become a member of society

298
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:19,693
That's it though

299
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:23,066
Eventually... I guess

300
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:26,330
You mean you want to?

301
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,132
That's right, yes

302
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:35,023
That's right...

303
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:35,023
what do you mean?

304
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:40,759
Well, it's kind of like that

305
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:40,759
I thought it wouldn't fit.

306
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,132
Me and Jin-kun

307
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:46,693
What do you mean?

308
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:49,495
Hmm

309
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:55,693
I don't want someone like Jin-kun

310
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:55,693
Is it because it's too wasteful?

311
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:58,198
No, that's not the case.

312
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:01,891
Why do you think so?

313
00:13:01,891 --> 00:13:04,561
Why...

314
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:10,924
Because I like it

315
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,858
I love you so what?

316
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:19,627
I like it so it's a waste

317
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:19,627
I don't think so.

318
00:13:19,627 --> 00:13:22,561
normally

319
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:27,363
What do you like about Jin?

320
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:27,363
Is that justice?

321
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:31,264
I mean justice...

322
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:33,792
But the feeling of love

323
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:37,957
Even if I suppress all my emotions

324
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:37,957
It's a priority

325
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:40,891
I think so

326
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:46,792
Well...

327
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:51,858
Even if you know the real me

328
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:51,858
Can you say the same?

329
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:56,792
what? The real me

330
00:13:56,792 --> 00:14:00,495
Because you don't know, right? about me

331
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,858
No, of course

332
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:09,099
I don't know everything

333
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:09,099
No, but

334
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:13,297
Look at what you know

335
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:13,297
So I fell in love with it.

336
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:16,792
It doesn't matter what I don't know

337
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:21,693
What Nagisa knows

338
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:21,693
I like everything

339
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:28,023
But then

340
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:28,023
Jin-kun's favorite Nagisa-san

341
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:33,858
Is that really about me?

342
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:33,858
Isn't it obvious?

343
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:37,023
He Zhu?

344
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:40,528
What is "Nanagisa"?

345
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:45,231
No, last name

346
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:45,231
What do you mean?

347
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:48,165
It's Nagisa Senzaki, right?

348
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:54,594
Ayase...

349
00:14:57,627 --> 00:15:01,693
Ayase?

350
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:06,198
Ayase Nagisa My maiden name

351
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:16,792
What do you mean?

352
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:23,693
Name before marriage: Ayase Nagisa

353
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:26,792
Is that also me who likes Hitoshi?

354
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:40,627
Huh… are you kidding?

355
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:44,957
It's not a joke

356
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:47,891
I can't laugh

357
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:50,495
I'm not trying to make you laugh

358
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:56,066
Because...

359
00:15:57,066 --> 00:16:03,396
picture? Ke... Marriage?

360
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:08,495
Well, but marriage is in the past tense.

361
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:16,099
I recently got divorced

362
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:16,099
I'm single now, but just in case.

363
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:23,726
Eh, marriage is past tense and recently divorced?

364
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:26,023
Yeah

365
00:16:26,023 --> 00:16:31,330
Huh... Um, are you serious?

366
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,627
I'm serious.

367
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:45,495
I love you even if you suppress all your emotions

368
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:45,495
It's fair enough to be prioritized

369
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:49,023
some time ago

370
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:49,023
Jin-kun, you told me, right?

371
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:51,627
yes…

372
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:58,957
But maybe that's it

373
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:58,957
I just made you say it, right?

374
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:04,594
I think they bought insurance before I told them.

375
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:08,132
Sneaky, right?

376
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,792
I'm sorry

377
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:20,363
Hey, that

378
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:20,363
Please wait a moment!

379
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:23,693
I wasn't told otherwise.

380
00:17:23,693 --> 00:17:26,099
I thought it myself and said

381
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,924
Love is justice

382
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:34,957
I still think so

383
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,165
Jin-kun is so kind until the end.

384
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,891
Is it the last one?

385
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:55,660
Because it's about me

386
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:55,660
You can't accept it, can you?

387
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:59,594
Already married?

388
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:59,594
I definitely don't want to

389
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:02,924
Oh, there's nothing special about marriage...

390
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:02,924
That marriage is everything

391
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:05,792
I don't think so either

392
00:18:07,023 --> 00:18:09,429
I have a desire to get married

393
00:18:07,023 --> 00:18:09,429
Did you just say that?

394
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,825
That's what I talked about with Nagisa-san.

395
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,495
That doesn't mean it's okay for anyone.

396
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,495
No

397
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:20,594
thank you

398
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:26,363
Just by saying that

399
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:26,363
That's enough

400
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:33,693
So Jin-kun

401
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:33,693
Find someone suitable for Jin-kun

402
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:36,957
I want you to be happy with that person

403
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:43,165
That... that...

404
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:43,165
Are you serious about that?

405
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:46,957
I'm serious.

406
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:51,023
But before

407
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:51,023
I don't really think so

408
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,297
This time I really think so.

409
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:09,792

410
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:21,627
♬〜

411
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,429
I'm sorry

412
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:30,660
good bye

413
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:55,891
Ah, Nino-kun, are you okay?

414
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:55,891
Ah yes

415
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:58,297
Have you heard about Mr. Senzaki?

416
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,957
home…

417
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:04,495
About a week due to family circumstances.

418
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:04,495
I've decided to go back home.

419
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,990
Nino-kun, you're okay now, right?

420
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,056
What is it?

421
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,056
Ah work

422
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:14,462
Well, it's just right

423
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:14,462
I don't mean that.

424
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:16,924
Nino-kun too soon

425
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:16,924
No follow from Senzaki

426
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,462
have to stand alone

427
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,462
I thought it was time.

428
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:23,396
Well at first

429
00:20:20,462 --> 00:20:23,396
I may be insecure though

430
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:26,759
If something happens, be around me

431
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:26,759
You can rely on me for anything.

432
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:33,363
There were no abnormalities on each floor.

433
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:38,396
Thank you for your hard work, even though it's a pre-game

434
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:38,396
I was really tired on the first day.

435
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:40,396
I agree

436
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:45,264
Nino-kun, you can take a break first.

437
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:45,264
Ah thank you

438
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:14,396
《Ah, thank you for your hard work》

439
00:21:09,023 --> 00:21:14,396
《Ah, thank you for your hard work! 》

440
00:21:14,396 --> 00:21:18,330
《Ah, okay, stay seated》

441
00:21:14,396 --> 00:21:18,330
《Sorry》

442
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:23,792
《This is Senzaki.

443
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:23,792
thank you"

444
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:27,429
《Ah, thank you very much.

445
00:21:23,792 --> 00:21:27,429
This is Nino》

446
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:30,297
《Ah, sorry》

447
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:30,297
"yeah? 》

448
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:35,858
《Jimbo-kun? 》

449
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:35,858
《Oh no, it's Jinno》

450
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:40,693
《Ah Nino》

451
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:40,693
"yes"

452
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:45,056
《Something about Nino

453
00:21:40,693 --> 00:21:45,056
Isn't it hard to say? 》

454
00:21:45,056 --> 00:21:48,297
《Sorry》

455
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:52,693
``Why do you apologize? 》

456
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:52,693
《Ah》

457
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:57,330
``Don't you have a nickname? 》

458
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,396
《Nickname? 》

459
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:06,297
《Ah, that's right... I don't think so》

460
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:11,759
《Wow, that's rare》

461
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:11,759
《Sorry》

462
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,990
《Hmm》

463
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:18,693
``Then I'll go with Jin-kun!'' 》

464
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,957
《Jin-kun? 》

465
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,957
《What? 》

466
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:27,495
《Ah, no, it's okay》

467
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:30,825
《Nice to meet you, Jin-kun》

468
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:35,891
《From today I

469
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:35,891
It seems like she is in charge of Jin-kun's education.》

470
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:40,792
《Ah, thank you》

Can I take a picture if you like?

475
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:19,396
Thank you, I'm glad you came

476
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:22,462
Haven't you worked hard enough?

477
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:22,462
Sayuri is

478
00:23:22,462 --> 00:23:24,891
From various things

479
00:23:22,462 --> 00:23:24,891
He was running away, wasn't he?

480
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:28,165
I'm sure forever

481
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:28,165
I don't think I'll forget it
