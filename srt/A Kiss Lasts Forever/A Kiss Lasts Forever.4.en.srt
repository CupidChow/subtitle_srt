32
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:35,495

Ah, then you're the same as me, aren't you?

No, it's like this

Well, in the first place

112
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:38,396
Ever since we had a child

113
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:42,165
I feel like my tension has been constantly slipping away.

114
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:42,165
It's already dangerous though

115
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:46,396
After all, I can have a child.

116
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:46,396
It's going to change, right?

117
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:52,000
We don't have any children.

118
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:52,000
Ah, that's right.

119
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:59,297
But that's better

120
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:59,297
I feel like the couple has always been good friends.

121
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:02,033
I understand too

122
00:05:59,297 --> 00:06:02,033
Isn't it deep?

123
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:10,099
...Just because we're a couple

124
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:10,099
It doesn't necessarily mean that we will understand each other.

125
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:13,330

00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:06,165
The first thing I looked for when I came to stay was

276
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,000
I was a regular at the nurse's office.

277
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,198
At first, when it came time for math

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,198
I feel sick

00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:20,868
I couldn't enter the classroom

280
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:24,736
Then it got worse and worse...

281
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:46,505
What I am now is

282
00:15:41,736 --> 00:15:46,505
It's because Harumi-sensei was there.

283
00:15:59,363 --> 00:16:02,670
《I feel dizzy...》

284
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,835

288
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:17,406
I just feel bad

289
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:17,406
Something disappeared and I

290
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:22,033

291
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:22,033
