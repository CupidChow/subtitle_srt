00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,590
Miss Zhou.

4
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,789
Miss Jiang.

5
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,830
Are your injuries better?

6
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,470
Much better now.

7
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,550
That's good.

8
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,070
Did you find the thing you lost last time?

9
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,550
Do you want me to get someone to help you?

10
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,110
Thank you.

11
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,670
But there's no need.

12
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,030
Some things,

13
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,750
even if they're precious,

14
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,340
are lost forever

15
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,420
once you lose them.

16
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,310
He's hurt you so much.

17
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,310
I think

18
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,390
Yanzhou must feel just as miserable as you do.

19
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,880
Sorry, Miss Zhou.

20
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,000
I've always wanted to find an opportunity

21
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,270
to apologize to you.

22
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,590
Is this about me and Yanzhou?

23
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,390
Miss Jiang...

24
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,680
Young Marshal,

25
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,590
I want to talk to you.

26
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,820
It's windy here.

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,870
Let's go inside.

28
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,860
Young Marshal.

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,230
Miss Jiang.

30
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,210
You can talk to me.

31
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,610
Maybe I can help you.

32
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,480
I just wanted to ask him

33
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,890
when I can leave here.

34
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,950
You'd better not.

35
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,110
I'll ask for you.

36
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,410
But really,

37
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,110
with Chi and Yumian so perfectly matched,

38
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,220
there's no reason for you to stay here.

39
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,630
This isn't about that.

40
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,620
During the hardest

41
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,120
and the most humiliating years of Chi's life,

42
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,000
it was thanks to Yumian that he got through it.

43
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,680
When he first arrived in Jiangbei,

44
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,960
he was penniless and had no proper identity,

45
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,820
so he had to work as a porter,

46
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,020
a laborer.

47
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
No one would take on the dirtiest, hardest jobs,

48
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,110
but he did.

49
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,710
Even so,

50
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,750
he could barely scrape by.

51
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,710
After years of that, his health suffered terribly.

52
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,230
Even now, his stomach

53
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,750
still hurts from time to time.

54
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,300
What am I saying all this for?

55
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,550
It's cold out here. Go back inside.

56
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,260
Miss Jiang can't see us anymore.

57
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:33,610
Yanzhou.

58
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,590
This has nothing to do with her.

59
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,840
Godfather specifically called to remind me

60
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,030
to take good care of you.

61
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,630
Put it on.

62
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,750
Is there still some misunderstanding

63
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,990
between you and Miss Jiang?

64
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,070
Something unsaid?

65
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,159
I don't think she's as heartless as you say.

66
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,630
Maybe she—

67
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,630
Don't be fooled by her kind facade.

68
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,480
She's a master at emotional manipulation.

69
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
I won't fall for it again.

70
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,030
You'd better stay away from her too.

No one would take on the dirtiest, hardest jobs,

76
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,260

78
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,290
[To: Yamai Taichi]

79
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,430
Why is there a letter for Yamai Taichi?

80
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,680
What are you doing?

81
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,290
I...

82
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,240
Get out.

83
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,790
Maybe I should investigate this next time.

84
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,670
You're still at Chi's Mansion?

85
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,000
That's good.

86
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,300
Du Jianshan's been looking for you recently.

87
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,180
Staying there is actually safer for you.

88
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,280
Just now, in Chi Yanzhou's room,

89
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,200
I found a letter addressed to Yamai Taichi.

90
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,140
Recently, he's been assigned to represent Japan,

91
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,750
negotiating with Du Jianshan about railway cooperation.

92
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,190
Does Chi Yanzhou

93
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,010
also want to get involved?

94
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,710
It wouldn't be surprising.

95
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,640
With him showing up in Ao City at such a crucial time,

96
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,330
his purpose must be more than what it seems.

97
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,840
Not to mention,

98
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,450
the Chi family already has a history of colluding with the enemy.

99
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,740
He won't.

100
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,150
But anyway,

101
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,900
I will get to the bottom of this.

102
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,010
Until I figure it out,

103
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,960
don't report to the organization just yet.

104
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,630
Alright.

105
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,810
But Jiang Yao,

106
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,320
if you find out that he,

107
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,670
just like Du Jianshan,

108
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,950
has dealings with Japan,

109
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,950
will you take matters

110
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,450
into your own hands?

111
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,580
I hope you're mentally prepared.

112
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,690
The day you're forced to face him again with weapons

113
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,030
will come sooner or later.

114
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,600
Just like how we'll have to

115
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,870
deal with Du Jianshan.

116
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,049
If I can find the letter,

117
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,159
I can know whether Chi Yanzhou

118
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:46,010
really has ties with Yamai.

119
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,400
Come out.

120
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,570
Tell me,

121
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,300
what's your goal this time?

122
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,830
Is it intelligence about Japanese

123
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,120
or Du Jianshan?

124
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,310
I wasn't here for that.

125
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,760
You weren't?

126
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,560
Then what were you doing in my study?

127
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,800
Speak!

128
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,910
I came to bring you soup.

129
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,800
The soup's on the table.

130
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,200
I know you don't want to see me,

131
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,710
so I didn't want to run into you either.

132
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,610
I didn't expect you to come back so early today.

133
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,540
I had no choice but to hide.

134
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,950
Bringing me soup out of nowhere?

135
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,170
A weasel wishing the chicken well?

136
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,740
If you insist on being the chicken,

137
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,160
there's nothing I can do.

138
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,840
What did you say?

139
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,030
I said, the soup is from Miss Zhou.

140
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,390
She asked me to bring it to you.

141
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,100
I heard your stomach isn't too good.

142
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,150
And Ji Nan told me

143
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,260
these past few years haven't been easy for you.

144
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,590
How dare you bring up these past few years?

145
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,630

146
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,510
to have tortured a man like this—

147
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,850

no matter what I say or do now,

151
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,330
it is useless.
