You've been away on business for almost half a month.

If you hadn't come back today,

your mom would have called the police.

13

just so I could

193
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,560
feed you steak, did you?

194
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,590
I'm not that free.

195
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,550
Has someone forgotten

196
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,340
what our relationship is now

197
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,610
to Du Jianshan?

198
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,420
What?

199
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,980
Are you trying to two-time, Miss Jiang?

200
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,540
I'm not that stupid.

201
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,830
Besides, Wenlan and I

202
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,320
are just friends.

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,300
Our engagement

204
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,790
was also an agreement between friends.

205
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,650
I don't love him,

206
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,750
and he doesn't love me either.

207
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,390
Really?

208
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,070
Last time at the Du family,

209
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,310
you acted so sincere.

210
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,080
Looks like that's your specialty.

211
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,760
Uncle, buy your girlfriend a bouquet of flowers.

212
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm not his girlfriend.

213
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,410
Yeah.

214
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,760
How could a love fraud like her

215
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
get a boyfriend?

216
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,390
If she's not your girlfriend,

217
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,430
why did she feed you steak?

218
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,780
Thank you.

219
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,740
Come to see me at Chi's Mansion at 7 p.m.

220
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,440
You left your book at my place.

221
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,550
The winter here is so beautiful.

222
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,270
Isn't it a pity

223
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,330
to leave now?

224
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,520
But, my lady,

225
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,320
you fail to win over the Young Marshal this time.

226
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,470
The Governor is definitely going to be angry with you when you go back.

227
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,140
If I go back now

228
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,840
and break off the engagement with Yanzhou,

229
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,980
he will be furious.

230
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,380
My Lady, what did you say?

231
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,010
Nothing.

232
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,580
Xiu,

233
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,220
how does this dress look on me?

234
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,380
Isn't it a bit weird?

235
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,300
No.

236
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,790
Just like those celebrities in those flyers outside.

237
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,810
You look beautiful.

238
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:44,960
My Lady,

239
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,380
why are you dressing up now?

240
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,600
I'm going out later.

241
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,530
You don't need to follow me.

242
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,470
Go out at this hour?

243
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,990
It's already dark outside.

244
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,990
That's exactly why I'm going out now.

245
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,780
I've heard

246
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,040
that in Ao City, it's different from Jiangbei.

247
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,910
The ladies here

248
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,630
enjoy an active nightlife.

249
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,100
They

250
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,960
can drink and dance

251
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,240
to their heart's content.

252
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,280
So this time,

253
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,000
I want to fully experience it.

254
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,580
Just take it as a chance to see the world.

255
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,030
You want to drink

256
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,940
and dance?

257
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,060
No, absolutely not!

258
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,860
My Lady,

259
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,870
if the Governor knows about this,

260
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,410
I'll be finished.

261
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,980
Yes, so

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,360
don't let the Governor know.

263
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,170
[Cute Dream Studio]

264
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,690
You, come here.

265
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,810
That girl came in alone?

266
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,880
Yes, she came alone.

267
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,810
It seems that she really hasn't seen much of the world.

268
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,950
What can I do for you, Ms. Man?

269
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,240
An exceptional girl like her

270
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,520
would definitely fetch a good price

271
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,240
if I put her in my marketplace.

272
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,410
You, bring her here.

273
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,430
Yes.

274
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,550
Hello, Miss.

275
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,250
Our Ms. Man wants to see you.

276
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,860
Please.
