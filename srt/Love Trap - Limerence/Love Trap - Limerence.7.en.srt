The wound on her back is infected.

00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,930
The fever won't go down.

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,060

8
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,870

00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,310
Hey, bro,

10
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,350
where's the pharmacy?

11
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,230
Over there.

12
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,310
Over there? Got it, thanks.

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,310
Where is she?

14
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,310
Miss Jiang.

15
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,430
We've arrived.

16
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,079
Who are you?

17
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,870
Why did you bring me here?

18
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,780
Get off.

19
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,220
Why did you bring me here?

20
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,420
Du Jianshan already has people watching me.

21
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,070
He must suspect there's more behind my broken engagement.

22
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,090
Showing up so openly

23
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,670
will only get you into trouble.

26
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,790
Mr. Chi, you're overthinking it.

27
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,280
If Du Jianshan finds out,

28
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,020
the medicine raid will be exposed.

29
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,010
The Flying Bird Society won't be able to hide it either.

30
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,550
That's perfect.

31
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,110
Bringing you back is just

32
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,880
in case you crack one day

33
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,660

Her wound is infected,

64
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,120
and she spent that whole night freezing.

65
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,350
That's why the fever won't break.

66
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,910
I just gave her medicine.

Let some air in—it'll feel better.

77

What is this?

78
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,990
Don't touch it.

What's so precious about it?

80
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,040
An engagement token.

81
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,780
From Wenlan?

82
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,120
You treasure what Wenlan gave you

83
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,190
so much that you won't

84

Chi Yanzhou, are you crazy?

95
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,300
Isn't it precious to you?

96
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,820
If it's so important,

97
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,750
go find it yourself!

98
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,870
You've had a sour look on your face all day.

99
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,070
Who pissed you off?

100
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,920
What do you want to say?

101
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,870
Japan will soon send Yamai Taichi

102
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,470
to Ao City to negotiate with Du Jianshan.

103
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,150
Should we do something?

104
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,580
Du Jianshan has failed several times

105
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,700
and lost the Jiang family marriage alliance recently.

106
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,710
These have already made the Japanese

107
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,830
question his competence.

108
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,630
We just need to push a little more,

109
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,830
and they'll abandon him completely.

110
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,150
So, what's the plan?

111
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,230
Find someone to monitor Yamai Taichi.

112
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,230
Track when he enters Ao City,

113
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,820
and from where.

114
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,500
Inform me immediately.

115
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,910
Jiang Yao?

116
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,150
What is she doing?

117
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,030
She's looking for something.

118
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,870
She's looking for something

119
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,270
in this heavy snow?

120
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,840
How long has she been at it?

121
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,540
A while now.

122
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,780
I tried to stop her,

123
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,340
but she insisted on looking

124
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,230
and wouldn't let Xiu or me stay with her.

125
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,800
It must be

126
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,920
something really important.

127
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,910
She's burning up with a fever

128
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,530
and badly injured.

129
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,220
What is more important than her life?

130
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,980
This is crazy.

131
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,020
Done already?

132
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,390
After all that fuss?

133
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,710
So your love for Wenlan

134
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,220
wasn't so deep after all.

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,830
It's over between us.

136
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,470
There's no going back, ever.

137
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,800
Since it's lost,

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,330
I don't want it anymore.

139

140

What?

141
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,690
Kissing me is that painful?

142
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,930
That humiliating?

143
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,340
If it were Wenlan,

144
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,720
would you accept it gladly?

145
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,750
Can you stop being so unreasonable?

146
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,710
And,

188
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,160
♫People surge, but love never calms♫

189
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,070
Why did you bring me here?

190
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:20,860
♫Regret losing you, also losing myself♫

191
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,870
This is where we first met.

192
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,070
Close your eyes.

193
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,540
♫Listening to the rain, drop by drop, thinking of you♫

194
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,180
You...

195
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,230
What?

196
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,590
♫Missing piles up, drowning your voice♫

197
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,580
What's with that reaction?

198
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,910
You don't want to marry me?

199
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,520
♫Too many memories, slipping through my fingers♫

200
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,990
Of course not.

201
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,550
I'll take that as a yes.

202
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,130
♫Can't hold onto you♫

203
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,950
Although this ring is ugly,

204
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,660
♫Listening to the rain, pitter-pattering like teardrops♫

205
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,990
I made it myself.

206
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,750
I hope you like it.

207
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,210
♫People surge, but love never calms♫

208
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:07,750
♫Regret losing you, also losing myself♫

209
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,590
Jiang Yao.

210
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,980
I want to marry you.
