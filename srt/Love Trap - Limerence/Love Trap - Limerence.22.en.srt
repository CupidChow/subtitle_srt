[Episode 22 You are still here]

3
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,840
Bring out Mr. Du!

4
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,080
Pay back the money you owe the bank. Hurry up!

5
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,520
-Yes, pay the money back! 
 -That’s right, pay it back!

6
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,630
-Pay it back! 
 -Exactly, hurry and pay!

7
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,170
Everyone, calm down!

8
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,390
Our young master is grieving right now.

9
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,200
Please allow us a few days of leniency.

10
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,150
Get out of the way!

11
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,880
Bring out your Mr. Du to pay us back.

12
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,750
Hurry up!

13
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,950
Now that Military Governor Du is gone,

14
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,180
if we don’t come to collect,

15
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,060
this debt will turn into a bad loan!

16
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,870
That’s right!

17
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,520
Ladies and gentlemen,

18
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,030
there’s no one here to take charge.

19
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,150
What are we supposed to do now?

20
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,780
If there’s no one in charge, find someone to take charge!

21
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,050
Don’t just stand there!

22
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,260
If you have something to say,

23
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,430
say it to me.

24
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,270
And who are you?

25
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,150
Exactly.

26
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,350
You’re just a young woman.

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,289
What can you do?

28
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,430
Who are you to talk?

29
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,920
What authority do you have?

30
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,760
Xiu, bring out a chair.

31
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,750
Bring a table too.

32
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,710
Housekeeper, prepare paper and pen for me.

33
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,390
Yes.

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,110
What's Yumian doing?

35
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,030
Go help her.

36
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,630
Me?

37
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,270
Alright, I’ll help.

38
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,470
Now, each of you

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,590
take turns clearly stating

40
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,920
which bank you’re from,

41
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,910
when the debt was incurred,

42
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,079
how much was borrowed, and the interest rate.

43
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,360
I will write it all down clearly

44
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,510
and pay each debt one by one.

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
You’re just a young woman.

46
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,590
Can you really handle this?

47
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,050
Well, sir,

48
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,310
why don’t you go first?

49
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,670
Fine.

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,390
I represent Jincheng Bank.

51
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,310
Three years ago,

52
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,820
Military Governor Du took out a loan with us.

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,600
She's really taking charge.

54
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,030
Mine.

55
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,350
Mine.

56
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,590
And mine.

57
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,580
Mine.

58
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,630
Mine.

59
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,550
Young Marshal Chi, what's on your mind?

60
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,270
Is this even the Zhou Yumian I know?

61
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,900
This young woman is actually stepping up to handle things.

62
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,820
Are you sure

63
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,340
you ever truly knew

64
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,310
the real Zhou family heiress?

65
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,910
Looks like I’ve missed out on a lot.

66
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,350
Alright,

67
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,640
I’ve written everything down.

68
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,530
Xiu, take this list

69
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,990
and guide them to the bank to collect their money.

70
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,860
-Let’s go.
-Wait a second.

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,990
Today’s repayments

72
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,200
will come out of my account.

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,320
Yanzhou.

74
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,630
You’re just a young woman,

75
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,490
not even married yet, and you’re already covering such a large debt.

76
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,910
If your father finds out

77
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,670
that I, as your elder brother, just stood by and watched,

78
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,410
he’d break my legs!

79
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,660
Let’s go.

80
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,610
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

81
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,500
Wenlan,

82
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,750
write a promissory note later

83
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,340
and give it to Yumian.

84
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,510
Thank you for

85
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,440
what you just did.

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,230
No need.

87
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,000
What are your plans now?

88
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,950
My father is gone.

89
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,950
This family has fallen apart.

90
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,920
I plan to dismiss the people under my father,

91
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,600
then liquidate the assets

92
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,950
and repay the bank debts.

93
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,470
And what about yourself?

94
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,710
I plan to study medicine.

95
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,070
You once said,

96
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,670
even if hope is faint,

97
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,380
it is still precious.

98
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,590
I want to be part

99
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,550
of that hope.

100
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,130
Alright.

101
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,960
No matter what you do,

102
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,150
I will support you

103
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,830
and always be by your side.

104
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,650
Thank you.

105
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,110
Sorry,

106
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,170
we didn’t disturb you, did we?

107
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,100
Wenlan,

108
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,920
what happened between your father and me

109
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
has nothing to do with you.

110
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,520
-If it bothers you, I... 
 -Uncle...

111
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,220
I understand everything.

112
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,409
And I will never blame you.

113
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,730
Also, Yao, both of you are victims.

114
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,550
Thank you.

115
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,200
If there’s anything I can do to help,

116
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,510
just let me know.

117
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,710
Alright.

118
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,560
Wenlan,

119
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,590
My condolences.

120
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,020
Thankfully, Miss Zhou is with him,

121
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,470
so we can feel a little more at ease.

122
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,180
By the way,

123
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,730
do you have time tonight?

124
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,700
You want to ask me out?

125
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,540
There’s a temple fair tonight.

126
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,670
I wonder if you

127
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,540
would honor me with your presence?

128
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,960
The last time I attended a temple fair

129
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,020
was five years ago.

130
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,100
I’m not one for crowds,

131
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,050
but if a fair lady invites me,

132
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,230
I might consider it.

133
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,110
Then you must consider carefully.

134
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,900
I’m heading to the orphanage first.

135
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,110
I promised Hai

136
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,620
to take them to the temple fair.

137
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,370
If you make up your mind,

138
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,510
meet me at the usual spot.

139
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,920
Here's your little bunny.

140
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,280
One little bunny.

141
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,440
It’s mine!

142
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,070
Come, take it and try it.

143
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,110
Is it sweet?

144
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:37,970
Sweet!

[Sugar figurines]

146
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,890
You’re here.

147
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,130
Have you been waiting long?

148
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,640
I almost thought

149
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,240
you were going to leave me waiting here.

150
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,120
Sister Jiang Yao,

151
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,630
isn’t he a traitor?

152
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,110
Why are we walking around the temple fair with him?

153
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,970
I don’t want to play with a traitor.

154
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,310
I only want to play with you!

155
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,060
Hai,

156
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,360
I made a mistake.

157
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,160
He’s never been a traitor.

158
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,160
He’s a good person.

159
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,700
Are you really the kind of good person

160
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,270
who can drive bad guys away?

161
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,670
Yes.

162
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,310
Alright then.

163
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,560
In that case, I’ll be willing to play with this uncle.

164
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,480
Let’s go explore over there.

165
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,290
-Let’s go. 
 -Yanzhou...

166
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,310
Come here quickly.

167
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,570
Sister Jiang Yao,

168
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,150
is he your boyfriend?

169
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,220
He’s definitely not my boyfriend,

170
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,320
because he once said,

171
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,680
someone like me

172
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,340
doesn’t deserve a boyfriend.

173
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,350
So Miss Jiang really holds grudges, huh?

174
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,750
How about I take back what I said?

175
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,680
Sister Jiang Yao, let’s go play over there.

176
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,380
This is yours.

177
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,990
-I was holding it for you just now. 
 -Thank you.

178
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,790
This is yours.

179
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,830
The second one is mine.

180
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,210
Here, take it.

181
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,400
Go buy something fun for everyone.

182
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,220
Alright.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,010
Let’s go buy toys!

184
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:31,930
Alright!

185
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,880
Let's go!

186
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,670
Come on. Come on.

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
What are you laughing at?

188
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,670
What’s so funny?

189
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,140
This way.

00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,030
Sir,

192
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,750
can you draw him?

193
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,020
Someone this handsome?

194
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,610
I’ve got to put in my best effort.

195
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,700
♫Was our meeting a test of fate?♫

196
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,520
♫At least I felt your tender affection♫

197
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,390
♫Longing wells up in my heart♫

198
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,840
Wait a moment.

199
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,880
♫Farewells are often scenes of sorrow♫

200
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,480
♫Yet I'm grateful we once shared a past♫

201
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,350
♫Even if it was just for a fleeting moment♫

202
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,680
Here, this is for you.

203
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,880
May you two have a long and lasting bond.

204
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,700
♫I often yearn for those fragments of memories♫

205
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,980
Thank you.

206
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:44,360
♫These unforgettable scenes form the most beautiful arc of my life♫

207
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,950
The last time I saw you like this

208
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,420
was five years ago.

209
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,590
♫My world was once a barren wasteland♫

210
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,250
Actually, in these five years,

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,960
♫Until the moment you appeared♫

212
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,120
I’ve always avoided places like this.

213
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,600
♫Since then, my life has been vibrant and colorful♫

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,970
Because I’m afraid the sights will stir up memories,

215
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,140
♫Like the sunset painting the horizon red♫

216
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,540
afraid they’ll remind me of everything between us.

217
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,510
♫Everything about you, I would choose without hesitation♫

218
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,140
♫Right or wrong, as long as it's passionate at this moment♫

219
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,140
Miss Jiang,

220
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,020
are you confessing your feelings to me?

221
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,660
Consider it so.

222
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:18,750
♫The road ahead is long, so let's cherish this moment instead♫

223
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,260
And you?

224
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,840
How have you been living these past five years?

225
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,860
I heard

226
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,180
you’ve been risking your life constantly,

227
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,590
suppressing rebellions and fighting bandits.

228
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,210
There were many times

229
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,900
I almost died on the battlefield.

230
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,980
But I kept thinking that I couldn’t die yet.

231
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,710
I had to stay alive and return to Ao City.

232
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,090
♫Farewells are often scenes of sorrow♫

233
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,220
I needed to find Du Jianshan and avenge my father.

234
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,780
♫Yet I'm grateful we once shared a past♫

235
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,230
♫Even if it was just for a fleeting moment♫

236
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,400
And,

237
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,670
I also needed to find a liar

238
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,670
and demand an explanation.

239
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:52,980
♫I often yearn for those fragments of memories♫

240
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,980
It was these convictions

241
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,230
that supported me

242
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,730
through the toughest times

243
00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:02,200
♫These unforgettable scenes form the most beautiful arc of my life♫

244
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
and kept me alive.

245
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,720
Did you get the explanation you wanted?

246
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,060
More than I imagined.

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,870
♫My world was once a barren wasteland♫

248
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,250
♫Until the moment you appeared♫

249
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,920
I’m sorry.

250
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,120
I’ve already accepted your apology.

251
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,930
♫Since then, my life has been vibrant and colorful♫

252
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,830
Let’s not talk about this anymore.

253
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,380
♫Like the sunset painting the horizon red♫

254
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,500
Let me take you to a nice place.
