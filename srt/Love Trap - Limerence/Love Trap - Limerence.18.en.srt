00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,850
[Episode 18 I won't fall into your trap again]

3
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,520
Young Marshal, I've looked into it.

4
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,800
It was indeed Du Jianshan's men

5
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,180
who ambushed us today.

6
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,020
It seems

7
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,340
he had realized

8
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,900
that you were behind all of this.

9
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,300
What should we do now?

10
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,300
We'll be signing a contract with Yamai soon.

11
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,660
I don't think he'll find anything out.

12
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,400
I heard that Du's army had been short on
military funds recently.

13
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,740
They are scheming against each other,

14
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,259
and planning to rebel.

15
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,780
You can tell this to the Japanese bank.

16
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,540
They'll know what to do.

17
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,500
Yes, sir.

18
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,860
This

19
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,260
was yours in the first place.

20
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,460
I don't want it anymore.

21
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,740
Here's your ring back.

22
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,240
I didn't expect Chi Yan to be so lucky.

23
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,260
He managed to escape it.

24
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,490
Other than him,

25
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,060
Chairman Jiang's daughter was also in the car.

26
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,260
I found that

27
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,060
Chi Yanzhou really cared about Jiang Yao.

28
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,100
He was protecting her during the shooting.

29
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,220
And also,

30
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,770
Jiang Yao is very good at fighting.

31
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,370
She's not like an ordinary teacher.

32
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,140
It reminded me of something.

33
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,140
What?

34
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,100
The last time Mr. Yamai visited Ao City,

35
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,630
he was ambushed by the Flying Bird Society.

36
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,100
There was masked person

37
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,500
who looked like Jiang Yao.

38
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,690
Do you mean

39
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,870
Jiang Yao belongs to the Flying Bird Society?

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,190
I'm just speculating.

41
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,220
This is Du Mansion.

42
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,340
What is it?

43
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,220
It was from the Japan Bank.

44
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,220
They say

45
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,180
they're going to take back all our loans.

46
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,579
Governor, without the bank's support,

47
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,990
it's going to be a hard time for us.

48
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,460
The news that I won't be working with Yamai Taichi

49
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,430
spread to the Japan Bank so quickly.

50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,340
It must be Chi Yanzhou.

51
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,900
It must be him.

52
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,300
How dare you!

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,100
If you don't make it easy for me,

54

64
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,490
I'm okay.

Silly guy.

You've done too many bad things.

78

at midnight?

Miss Jiang,

80
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,690
please open your purse.

81
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,700
This way.

82
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,400
If it weren't for Uncle Jiang,

83
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,810
I would never have come to

84
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,460
a place like this.

85
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,680
I already told you

86
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,440
this kind of ball is boring.

87
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,990
You can leave

Nothing.

will officially sign the railway contract

Miss Jiang, you are so well-informed.

You are not changing your mind?

99

Would you change your mind?

100
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,690
I don't see any reason to do that.

101
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,460

I've already fallen for your tricks once.

00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,440
Do you think I'll fall for it again?

113
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,180
I'll be at the lounge.

114
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,710

is everything okay?

117
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,260
Keep an eye on Jiang Yao.

118
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,320
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,660
Sorry.

Miss Zhou,

121
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,650
you said you've recovered?

122
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,250
I didn't know

123
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,030
Miss Zhou also liked to

124
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,300
tell lies.

125
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,020
Right.

126
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,700
I haven't fully recovered,

127
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,360
but I don't need to

128
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,860
tell the truth to everybody.

129
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,900
Besides,

130
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,930
Mr. Du is not my friend.

131
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,790
Fine.

132
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,400
You are going to be my aunt.

133
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,020
I don't think it's appropriate

134
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,630
for me to treat your shoulder.

135
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,150
Do you have the medicine?

136
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,100
I'll ask my uncle to apply the medicine.

137
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,130
Don't leave.

138
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,120
We're not in that kind of relationship,

139
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,470
so don't bother him.

140
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,770
What did you say?

141
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,260
Wait.

142
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,430
You're not being clear.

143
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,800
So,

144
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,340
you're not my aunt,

145
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,550
right?

146
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,400
Yes.

147
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,890
I'm not your aunt.

148
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,860
I'm not the one Yanzhou likes.

149
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,330
There's no way he and I are getting married.

150
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,070
So can I leave now?

151
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,540
What about

152
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,390
you?

153
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,050
Do you like him?

154
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,020
You don't like him either,

155
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,860
right?

156
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,210
I hope you say no.

157
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,510
Because

158
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,140
I won't like it. I'll be jealous.
