00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,310
Mr. Yamai,

4
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,509
what do you mean by this?

5
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,320
Young Marshal Chi,

6
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,880
since you say you're not her accomplice,

7
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,830
then prove it.

8
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,510
Kill her.

9
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,430
Show us

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,400
with your actions.

11
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,000
What?

12
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,930
You can't do it?

13
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,730
Could it be, as Du Jianshan claimed,

14
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,840
that she's not only your accomplice,

15
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,920
but also your lover,

16
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,410
and you can't bring yourself to kill her?

17
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,210
You misunderstood.

18
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,430
I'm not used to your gun.

19
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,500
Jiang Yao,

20
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,470
are you afraid of death?

21
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,630
Chi Yanzhou,

22
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,920
you're nothing but a traitor,

23
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,310
a dog for the Japanese.

24
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,770
You won't have a good end doing this.

25
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,940
Fine.

26
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,130
Then let me send you on your way.

27
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,970
A pleasure working with you.

28
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,060
A pleasure working with you.

29
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,120
We're finally going back to Jiangbei.

30
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,070
I'm going to soak up some sun

31
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,030
and go fishing by the sea.

32
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,040
Then...

33
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,730
Chi, you'll come with me, won't you?

34
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,880
Chi.

35
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,390
I know you just killed

36
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,630
the woman you love.

37
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,050
No matter how I try to comfort you right now,

38
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,320
you're probably hurting too much to hear it.

39
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,490
But time will make it easier.

40
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,040
Excuse me.

41
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,330
May I sit here?

42
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,270
No, you can't.

43
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,470
There are so many other seats.

44
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,260
Jiang...

45
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,450
Yao?

46
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,300
Move.

47
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,730
Move.

48
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,159
Wait—hold on. What's going on here?

49
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,460
Didn't Chi shoot you,

50
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,610
sending you tumbling off a cliff?

51
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,870
And that old fox Yamai even

52
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,610
went to personally check your body.

53
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,070
Don't tell me there's some medical miracle

54
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,510
that can bring people back to life now.

55
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,750
Actually, we had blood packets planted beforehand

56
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,930
and swapped the bullets for blanks.

57
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,310
Our people were already waiting

58
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,250
at the bottom of the cliff to catch me.

59
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,120
I only suffered minor injuries.

60
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,520
So, the body at the bottom of the cliff

61
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,110
wasn't even you, right?

62
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,950
Well played, both of you.

63
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,660
Even I was fooled by your act.

64
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,380
If we couldn't fool even you,

65
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,860
how could we ever fool Yamai?

66
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,400
But speaking of which,

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,030
how did you know about Yamai's plan?

68
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,480
The day Jiang Yao's combat skills

69
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,760
were exposed to Du Jianshan's men,

70
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,090
we anticipated something like this would happen.

71
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,340
So, we prepared in advance.

72
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,440
You two are really…

73
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,710
Cunning old foxes,

74
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,260
a match made in heaven!

75
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,120
Thanks for the compliment.

76
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,030
You're welcome.

77
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,240
Why are you here?

78
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,840
You're heading back to Jiangbei, aren't you?

79
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,290
Of course I'm going back with you.

80
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,170
You know Jiangbei is dangerous.

81
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,730
If they find out,

82
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,890
there's a good chance we won't make it back alive.

83
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,610
If it weren't dangerous,

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,000
I might not be interested in going.

85
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,350
Because I said,

86
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,000
no matter what the future holds,

87
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,540
I'll stay by your side.

88
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,400
Also,

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,770
I lost my ring.

90
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,150
Okay.

91
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,010
I get it now.

92
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,220
So, it's us—

93
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,610
just the two of us—

94
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,950
who are the extras here, huh?

95
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,720
Take it.

96
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,590
What's about you two?

97
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,050
I plan to go to Jiangbei

98
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,620
and formally propose to Uncle Zhou.

99
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,110
My godfather

100
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,380
cherishes his daughter dearly.

101
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,010
If you want to marry Yumian,

102
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,130
you'll have to endure some challenges.

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,400
That's fine.

104
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,870
No matter what difficulties lie ahead,

105
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,890
I'm willing to face them.

106
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,360
Due to the engineering challenges,

107
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,680
the Japanese attempt to construct the railroad

108
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,820
has temporarily failed,

109
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,280
resulting in a loss of nearly 1.6 billion

110
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,620
and severe setbacks.

111
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,650
Both Jiangbei and the Japanese realized 
that Chi Yanzhou had sabotaged the project,

112
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,720
and they joined forces to hunt him down.

113
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,930
But despite their efforts, Chi Yanzhou disappeared without a trace.

Okay, Mom.

118
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,440
Did you come out

119
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,960
just to pick me up?

120
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,750
Dad, I think you really need

121
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,870
to talk to Mom about something.

122
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,710
What?

123
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,010
Did she ruin the kitchen again,

124
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,830
or did she wreck your appetite?

125
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,360

129
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,500

What will you change it to?

187
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,740
and dedicated ourselves to educating the next generation.

188
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,430
♫Love buried deep in the abyss, deliberately entombed♫

189
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,230
Wenlan also became a doctor.

190
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,780
Each of us, in our own way,

191
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,290
♫I can't understand your unpredictability♫

192
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,350
♫It's love that breaks the cage, no longer hiding♫

193
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,310
protected what we held dear.

194
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,670
♫We never forget♫

195
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,690
[The End]
