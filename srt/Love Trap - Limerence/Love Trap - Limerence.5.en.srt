[Episode 5: Wishing You a Long and Happy Life]

3
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,009
My father-in-law and mother-in-law are right there.

4
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
You need to step it up.

5
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,440
Find someone as good as Wenlan.

6
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,960
Yao, let's go over there.

7
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,840
Okay.

8
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,050
Mr. Peng.

9
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,640
Long time no see.

10
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,520
Yao, wait for me a moment.

11
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,360
Okay.

12
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,530
Who is this?

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,759
I knew Chi Yanzhou wouldn't be so easygoing.

14
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,200
There're bombs on that ship.

15
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,360
Our people are trapped on the ship and can't get off.

16
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,960
What?

17
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,920
You didn't stick to our agreement.

18
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,760
The consequences will be yours to bear.

19
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,760
Yao.

20
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,650
Wenlan.

21
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,970
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,919
Let's cancel

23
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,200
our engagement.

24
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,320
What's going on?

25
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,280
This...

26
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,210
Such an important occasion,

27
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,250
and she's making a scene.

28
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,370
Calm down.

29
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,400
What?

30
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,760
Afraid Jiang Yao won't come?

31
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,490
She wouldn't dare.

32
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,070
She is, after all, your nephew's wife.

33
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,440
It's not good

34
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,690
to treat her like this.

35
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,450
What?

36
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,530
You feel sorry for her?

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,770
Not really.

38
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,580
I'm concerned for your Wenlan.

39
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,530
His fiancée was randomly snatched away by his uncle.

40
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,300
No, no, no.

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,680
I mean...

42
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,290
When the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer.

43
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,790
How tragic.

44
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,060
I'm actually helping him.

45
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,770
He's young,

46
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,020
can't judge people properly,

47
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,880
and mistook the wrong person for a good match.

48
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,780
As his uncle,

49
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,390
it's my responsibility to help him stop the damage in time.

50
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,010
Such a good uncle.

51
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm almost moved.

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,290
But let's put it this way.

53
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,880
With the failed marriage plan between the Du and Jiang families,

54
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,520
the Du family has lost

55
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,480
a bargaining chip for negotiating with Japan.

56
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,410
Du Jianshan is probably so angry

57
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,000
his lungs are about to explode.

58
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Jiang Yao will find it difficult

59
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,570
to explain herself now.

60
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,020
Is that so?

61
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,510
That suits me just fine.

62
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,770
Young Marshal, Miss Jiang has arrived.

63
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,610
Let her wait outside.

64
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,530
Mrs. Zhang.

65
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,930
Fill the tub.

66
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,500
I want to take a bath.

67
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,550
Look at how your Young Marshal looks now,

68
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,370
like a villain who has just gained a little power.

69
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,950
Young Marshal

70
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,010
is not a villain.

71
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,740
You have no sense of humor.

72
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,880
I also want to take a bath.

73
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,650
Miss Jiang, you can't enter right now.

74
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,610
Young Marshal is...

75
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,500
Sorry,

76
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,740
Miss Jiang, you're so eager to see me.

77
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,370
Are you here to bathe me?

78
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,480
I've already called off the engagement.

79
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,950
So?

80
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,760
What does that have to do with me?

81
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,140
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,700
This matter is indeed my fault.

83
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,160
I shouldn't have

84
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,560
broken our agreement.

85
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,020
I sincerely apologize to you.

86
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,170
Young Marshal Chi,

87
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,640
please show

88
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,170
some mercy

89
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,780
and let them go.

90
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,850
It's too late.

91
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,580
I gave you a chance.

92
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,510
Wu Rong,

93
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,409
notify our people on the sea...

94
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,210
So, what should I do

95
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,490
to appease you?

96
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,280
That's something you should consider.

97
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,210
Well, now it's done.

98
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,250
Jiang Yao has left.

99
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,590
What do you plan to do with the people on the sea?

100
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,120
Are you really going to kill them?

101
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,030
The weather is getting colder.

102
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,640
The weather forecast also says there will be the first snow tonight.

103
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,360
Quick, close the window.

104
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,409
It was still warm during the day,

105
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,240
but it's going to snow at night?

106
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,240
This weather in Ao City

107
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,650
is just like the heart of a young girl,

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,520
unpredictable and hard to figure out.

109
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,780
Chi.

110
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,360
It really is snowing outside.

111
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,660
Jiang Yao?

112
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,010
Chi...

113
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,860
She seems so cold.

114
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,620
But what is she doing?

115
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,010
Is she trying to use a self-inflicted punishment

116
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,360
to gain your sympathy?

117
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,400
Or does she know

118
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,280
you don't want her to have it easy,

119
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,659
so she's using this form of self-torture to cool your anger?

120
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,750
A waste of effort.

121
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,370
♫The distance between us, with indifferent tones♫

122
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,780
♫Turns out we've already reached the conclusion♫

123
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,230
♫Our past when we were shoulder to shoulder, the closest intimacy♫

124
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,890
♫But unfortunately, we both understand, it didn't stay in place♫

125
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,280
♫Since we met, separation was already destined♫

126
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,620
♫Hate is the mark of love♫

127
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,110
♫I repeatedly drown in it, how can I completely withdraw?♫

128
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,210
♫Listening to the rain, drop by drop, thinking of you♫

129
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,120
♫Missing piles up, drowning your voice♫

130
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,110
♫Too many memories, slipping through my fingers♫

131
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,700
♫Can't hold onto you♫

132
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,290
♫Listening to the rain, pitter-pattering like teardrops♫

133
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,790
♫People surge, but love never calms♫

134
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:06,910
♫Regret losing you, also losing myself♫

135
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,850
For the comrades on the ship,

136
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,480
I will insist until you change your mind.

137
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:15,900
Yanzhou.

138
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,370
Can I come in?

139
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,010
Come in.

140
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,960
It's cold today.

141
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,320
I specially asked the kitchen

142
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,800
to make a bowl of warming soup.

143
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,280
Make sure to drink it while it's hot.

144
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,650
Thank you.

145
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,580
Then you go ahead and be busy.

146
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,810
I won't disturb you.

147
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,240
The snow scene tonight is beautiful.

148
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,320
Did you see it?

149
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,570
You came just to experience

150
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,880
Ao City's uniqueness, right?

151
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,440
The snow scene is beautiful.

152
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,440
It's different from Jiangbei's.

153
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,550
So his real intention

154
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,880
was something else.

155
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,630
Miss Jiang.

156
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,600
I don't know what happened

157
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,930
between you and Yanzhou,

158
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,240
but I guess

159
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,010
you wouldn't agree to

160
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,710
either go inside or leave.

161
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,660
You'll freeze wearing so little.

162
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,190
Thank you.

163
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,230
Miss. I appreciate your kindness.

164
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,060
But I can't accept

165
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,980
the cloak.

166
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,660
My Lady, look at her.

167
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,220
She really doesn't know what's good for her.

168
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,480
I said we should offer no help

169
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,690
and let her freeze outside.

170
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,950
Xiu, stop talking.

171
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,170
It's not that I don't appreciate your kindness,

172
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,940
but if I accept the cloak,

173
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,620
I'll probably freeze through tonight.

174
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:11,840
But if you wear...

175
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,860
Miss. I still don't know how to address you.

176
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,050
I'm Zhou Yumian.

177
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,470
You can call me Yumian,

178
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,510
just like Yanzhou does.

179
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,320
Miss Zhou, nice to meet you.

180
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,060
I'm Jiang Yao.

181
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,140
Miss Jiang,

182
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,700
nice to meet you.

183
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,390
Quick, take your lady inside.

184
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,910
It's freezing out here.

185
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,370
She'll catch a cold.

186
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,810
My Lady, let's go back quickly,

187
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,020
I'm freezing to death.

188
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,410
-Miss Jiang...
-I'm fine.

189
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,800
You and Yanzhou

190
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,620
are both so stubborn.

191
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,690
Miss Zhou.

192
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,940
Miss Jiang.

193
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,810
Have you changed your mind?

194
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,450
You're so kind.

195
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,650
Yanzhou must be very happy

196
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,290
to be with you.

197
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,880
I wish you both

198
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,220
a long

199
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,940
and happy life.

200
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,110
♫The wind and snow rage on, with tears falling♫

201
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,740
♫Love and hate engulfed, drowning each other in torment♫

202
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,100
Young Marshal.

203
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,330
♫It's hard to say who's more sorrowful♫

204
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:47,200
♫Is it that the more bitter it is, the deeper it becomes?♫

205
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,790
♫Helpless, forced to remain silent♫

206
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,710
♫Let the pain pull at my heart♫

207
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,690
♫If there's a fire ahead, please hold me tightly♫

208
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,970
Out this late,

209
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,730
don't freeze yourself.

210
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,750
♫Love grows in chaotic times, drifting and wandering♫

211
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,220
Go back.

212
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,440
-But Miss Jiang...
-Let her stand.

213
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,620
♫Trapped in broken pasts♫

214
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,540
♫In a daze, in a once familiar place, I see your face♫

215
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,100
Thank you for your blessings, Miss Jiang.

216
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,520
♫Love buried deep in the abyss, deliberately entombed♫

217
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,490
We will live a long

218
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,440
♫I can't understand your unpredictability♫

219
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,230
and happy life.

220
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,530
♫We brushed past each other, frozen gazes hiding panic♫

221
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,850
♫It's my fault for not forgetting♫

222
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,000
♫I want us to remember♫

223
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:31,970
Did you see that?

224
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,880
Our Young Master treats My Lady so well.

225
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,340
♫Every moment of parting and reunion♫

226
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,850
I advise you,

227
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,680
to straighten out your misguided thoughts.

228
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,110
♫We should hold hands tightly♫

229
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,560
Otherwise, tonight,

230
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,030
♫Until the sea dries up♫

231
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,840
even if you'll freeze to death here,

232
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,010
our Young Master won't even spare you a glance.

233
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,540
Are you really not going to care about her?

234
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,560
♫Love grows in chaotic times, drifting and wandering♫

235
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,990
She deserve to freeze to death.

236
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,840
If you're truly willing to let her freeze,

237
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,490
♫Trapped in broken pasts♫

238
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,420
why even come out?

239
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,320
♫In a daze, in a once familiar place, I see your face♫

240
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:01,210
♫Love buried deep in the abyss, deliberately entombed♫

241
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,000
♫Seeing through your heartless lies♫
