[Ao City Train Station]

193
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,260
This way, please.

194
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,090
Rest assured, Mr. Yamai.

195
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
This place is completely secure.

[Ao City Train Station]

197
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,700
Alert!

[Ao City Train Station]

199
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,310
Cover Mr. Yamai's retreat!

200
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,920
Cover Mr. Yamai!

[Ao City Train Station]

202
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,590
Mr. Yamai, hurry, get in the car!

Chi Yanzhou.

204
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,360
Jiang Yao.

205
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,980
I knew he wasn't that simple.

206
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,230
We've all been deceived.

207
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,560
Impossible.

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,190
He must have had no other choice.

209
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,900
At this point,

210
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,330
you still believe in him?

211
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,630
♫The distance between us, with indifferent tones♫

212
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,240
He provided us with Yamai Taichi's whereabouts,

213
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:45,940
while on the other,

214
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,270
he played the hero and rescued Yamai.

215
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,200
Such elaborate schemes.

216
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,030
♫Turns out we've already reached the conclusion♫

217
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,820
I'm afraid

218
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,110
stopping Yamai Taichi's

219
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,640
railway plan is just a front.

220
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,830
His real goal is

221
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,670
to replace Du Jianshan.

222
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:03,560
♫We passed shoulder to shoulder, the closest intimacy♫

223
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,180
Jiang Yao.

224
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,590
We're all just pieces

225
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,070
on his chessboard.

226
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,230
Who do you want to...

227
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,170
I want to speak to Chi Yanzhou.

228
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,790
Jiang Yao?

229
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,830
Chi isn't in the Mansion.

230
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,080
You know how it is—

231
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,590
he's meeting someone important.

232
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,420
But if you really want to find him,

233
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,370
you can try the Sakai Japanese Restaurant

234
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,410
on Qingyun Road.

235
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,410
[Sakai Japanese Restaurant]

236
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,590
I once thought Ao City, governed by Du Jianshan,

237
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,680
was the safest place.

238
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,320
Yet as soon as I arrive,

239
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,030
such chaos unfolds.

240
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,330
It seems Du Jianshan's power

241
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,860
isn't as formidable as I've heard.

242
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,260
Let's not bring up unpleasant matters

243
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,090
at your welcome dinner, Mr. Yamai.

244
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,990
Today's narrow escape—

245
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,510
I owe it all to you, Young Marshal Chi.

246
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,550
I promise

247
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,270
you will be greatly rewarded.

248
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,030
You're too kind, sir.

249
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,530
-Please.
-Please.

250
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,830
But I must say,

251
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,480
that Flying Bird Society truly is detestable.

252
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,610
In the past two years,

253
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,830
many of our key officials

254
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,210
have fallen to their hands.

255
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,240
Until they're eradicated,

256
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,240
I won't rest easy.

257
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,410
Especially

258
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,120
that masked woman from tonight—

259
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,370
if she ever falls into my hands,

260
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,440
I'll make sure

261
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,790
she suffers a thousand cuts.
