[Episode 6: No More Next Time]

3
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,140
Young Marshal, have you calmed down a bit?

4
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,130
No more next time.

5
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,570
Thank you, Young Marshal, for your mercy.

6
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,650
I'll leave now.

7
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,170
Flowers! Come and see the flowers!

8
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,930
Come and see the flowers!

9
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,530
Uncle, would you like a newspaper?

10
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,400
Flowers for sale!

11
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,210
How much are the flowers?

12
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,610
It depends on which one you choose, but they're all cheap.

13
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,570
Miss, how about buying a flower?

14
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,010
Help me pick a bunch.

15
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:29,650
Alright.

16
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,010
Everything is going smoothly.

17
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,370
The medicine has been unloaded from the ship.

18
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,010
Chi Yanzhou hasn't tampered with it.

19
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:39,660
Du Jianshan wants to use my father's business association

20
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,250
to talk business with the Japanese.

21
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,090
It's not a big loss that the marriage

22
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,970
was called off.

23
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,490
That's true.

24
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,050
However, Chi Yanzhou

25
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,410
suddenly came to Ao City,

26
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,130
took Yan Xuan's medicine,

27
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,730
and now he's handing it over to us like this.

28
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,570
Could it really just be to mess with you?

29
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,570
I'm afraid

30
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,090
his intentions aren't simple.

31
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,290
I'll keep an eye on their movements.

32
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,280
Jiang Yao,

33
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,890
there's one more thing.

34
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,490
Don't think I'm meddling,

35
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,720
but you and Chi Yanzhou

36
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,610
have a deep enmity.

37
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,810
No matter what,

38
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,730
don't get yourself caught in it again.

39
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,560
I wouldn't dare.

40
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,330
Flowers!

41
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,460
Come and take a look!

42
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,650
Miss Jiang,

43
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,940
the Governor has requested your presence.

44
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,250
Young Marshal,

45
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,570
Miss Jiang has been taken away.

46
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,130
She called off the engagement just like that.

47
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,490
She really doesn't care about my face.

48
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,610
This matter

49
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,450
does deserve a good explanation,

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,130
but they're still young and don't understand.

51
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,570
Brother-in-law, don't let this upset you.

52
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,220
Please.

53
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,690
Here comes the person

54
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,130
we're talking about.

55
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,010
Uncle Du.

56
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,570
Don't call me Uncle,

57
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,409
I'm not worthy of it.

58
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,290
Since I invited you here today,

59
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,010
I won't beat around the bush.

60
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,850
Give me a good reason for calling off the engagement.

61
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,090
If it's reasonable,

62
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,010
you can leave.

63
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,330
Otherwise,

64
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,890
don't blame me

65
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,850
for not giving your father,

66
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,830
Chairman Jiang, face.

67
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,410
This time, calling off the engagement

68
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,990
is indeed my fault.

69
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,240
As for the reason,

70
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,820
I don't have one.

71
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,630
I don't have one.

72
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,600
Miss Jiang, you didn't tell the truth, did you?

73
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,720
You called off the engagement

74
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,130
so decisively.

75
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,830
Miss Jiang, could it be that you

76
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,280
have someone else in your heart besides Wenlan?

77
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,180
Young Marshal Chi, you're overthinking.

78
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,250
I think you're

79
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,810
someone who only believes things

80
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,970
once you see the coffin, aren't you?

81
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,409
Dad,

82
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,770
don't make trouble for Yao.

83
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,530
This has nothing to do with her.

84
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,500
This has nothing to do with you. Get back to where you belong.

85
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,290
Dad!

86
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,610
Yao has her reasons.

87
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,290
Having reasons doesn't justify calling off the engagement.

88
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,010
Brother-in-law,

89
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,220
why not first listen to what my little nephew

90
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,290
has to say?

91
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,990
If Miss Jiang is wronged,

92
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,410
it's hard to explain

93
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,610
to Chairman Jiang.

94
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,720
The entire Ao City is under your control.

95
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,370
If you really want to do something to her,

96
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,730
she can't run away.

97
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,090
That's right.

98
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,410
Uncle is right.

99
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,120
Alright,

100
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,090
I'll listen to you

101
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,970
and hear the whole story.

102
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,490
Dad,

103
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,910
if anyone's to blame for this,

104
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,480
you can only blame your son.

105
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,890
It's not Yao's fault.

106
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,560
It's my mistake.

107
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,240
I hurt Yao first.

108
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,090
Dad, please sit down.

109
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,210
Dad,

110
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,690
you know,

111
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,360
I'm usually

112
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,450
charming and charismatic.

113
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,530
Yao was completely devoted to me.

114
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,720
She always said she couldn't live without me.

115
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,820
But then,

116
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,760
on the day of the engagement, she found out

117
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,580
that I don't love her at all.

118
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,460
She couldn't bear this injustice,

119
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,470
so,

120
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,970
she called off the engagement on the spot.

121
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,420
Yes, I admit,

122
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,380
Yao threw quite a tantrum,

123
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,650
but that was because

124
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,040
she loved me too much.

125
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,260
So, tell me,

126
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,430
can this be blamed on her?

127
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,050
If anyone is to blame,

128
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,040
it's your son who is too likeable.

129
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,110
Miss Jiang,

130
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,250
is what he's saying

131
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,730
true?

132
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,720
Dad, I swear,

133
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,830
I'm not lying about a single word.

134
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,170
Yao,

135
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,460
quickly tell my dad and my uncle.

136
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,770
Don't you love me a lot?

137
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,260
Yes,

138
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,710
I love Wenlan a lot.

139
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,470
So,

140
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,530
I can't stand him not loving me.

141
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,330
Calling off the engagement was a spur-of-the-moment decision,

142
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,160
which led to the consequences we have now.

143
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,840
Miss Jiang, you really are deeply devoted.

144
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,300
You've truly earned my respect.

145
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,280
Dad, see,

146
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,970
I didn't lie at all.

147
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,820
You little brat, how dare you say that?

148
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,870
I'll beat you to death!

149
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,710
Wenlan!

150
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,830
Yao!

151
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,880
Are you still protecting him?

152
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,570
Just wait until I skin you alive!

153
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,640
Brother-in-law,

154
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,340
this whip has already taught him a lesson.

155
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,100
If Wenlan were hurt,

156
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,110
you'd be the one to feel bad.

157
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,390
Yao,

158
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,780
are you stupid?

159
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,090
My dad trains soldiers and has great strength.

160
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,620
He could punch through a cow.

161
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,600
I can't just watch you get hurt

162
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,370
and do nothing.

163
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,550
If you don't want to get whipped again,

164
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,720
go apologize to your dad properly.

165
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,390
Dad,

166
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,620
Dad,

167
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,240
please don't be angry anymore.

168
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,360
Yao and I

169
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,710
both know we were wrong this time.

170
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,430
Lieutenant Zhang,

171
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,600
lock him up immediately.

172
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,290
Yes, Sir.

173
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,420
Without my orders,

174
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,690
he's not allowed to go anywhere.

175
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,750
Miss Jiang,

176
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,680
I won't see you off.

177
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,460
Thank you, Uncle.

178
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,950
Young Master, please.

179
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,850
What are you doing?

180
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,370
I still need to take Yao to the hospital.

181
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,570
Your dad's still angry.

182
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,560
If you keep acting so willfully,

183
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,670
you're just asking for trouble.

184
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
You don't have to worry about me.

185
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,450
I'm sorry,

186
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,130
I've dragged you into this.

187
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,380
Stop saying that.

188
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,580
Take care of your injury first.

189
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,860
Uncle,

190
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,730
please help me take Yao to the hospital,

191
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,170
and look after her for me.

192
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,430
No need.

193
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,210
I can go by myself.

194
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,340
That's not possible.

195
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,270
This injury is because of me.

196
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,230
-I must...
-Lieutenant Zhang...

197
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,060
Why haven't you taken Wenlan away?

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,800
Let's go, Young Master.

199
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,820
Uncle.

200
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,590
Uncle!

201
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,750
Please remember to take her to the hospital.

202
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,270
Young Marshal Chi,

203
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,660
I'll take my leave.

204
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,460
Governor.

205
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,970
Miss Jiang has already left.

206
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,230
What should we do next?

207
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,810
Send someone to keep an eye on her.

208
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,810
She thinks her poor excuse earlier

209
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,150
could fool me?

210
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,250
If anything suspicious happens,

211
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,450
report to me immediately.

212
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:07,930
Understood.

213
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:08,940
Go ahead.

214
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,240
It seems

215
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,250
Du Jianshan is already suspicious of this matter.

216
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,670
Let's go.
