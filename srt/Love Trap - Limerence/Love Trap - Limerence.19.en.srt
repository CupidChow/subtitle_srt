00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,580
[Episode 19: What are you afraid of?]

3
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,660
Do you like him?

4
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,850
Then, you don't like him either,

5
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,580
right?

6
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,979
I hope you say no.

7
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,270
Because...

8
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,900
I wouldn't like that. I'd be jealous.

9
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,180
Mr. Du, you've probably

10
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,330
said this to many girls, right?

11
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,300
I swear on my honor, I have never.

12
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,389
You're the first.

13
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,270
Then, that day,

14
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,050
what about the girl who received that bouquet of flowers?

15
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,480
Or

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,030
Mr. Du, do you give flowers

17
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,690
just to any girls?

18
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,710
I really brought this on myself.

19
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,490
Believe it or not,

20
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,770
those flowers that day

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,840
were meant for you!

22
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,350
It's just that later,

23
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,430
I saw Ji Nan at the door.

24
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,590
Only then did I realize

25
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,720
that you were the Miss Zhou

26
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,900
from Jiangbei.

27
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,850
I knew about your engagement to my uncle.

28
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,000
But I really didn't know

29
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,260
you had already cleared up this matter.

30
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,190
Anyway...

31
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,690
It's all my fault.

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,790
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,329
So...

34
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,700
Miss Zhou,

35
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,030
are you being jealous?

36
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,660
I'm not.

37
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,980
Yes, you are.

38
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,020
I'm not talking to you anymore.

39
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,020
I'm not talking to you anymore.

40
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,260
Everyone!

41
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,270
Thank you

42
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,900
for attending my birthday party.

43
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,700
In the future,

44
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,960
thank you for your guidance and support.

45
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,540
I hope you all enjoy this evening.

46
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,500
-Thank you, Mr. Yamai.
-Thank you, Mr. Yamai.

47
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
Mr. Yamai.

48
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,120
Who are you?

49
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,020
I'm Jiang Yao.

50
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,670
My father is Jiang Yueming.

51
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,340
My father has been unwell recently,

52
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,220
so he can't attend your birthday banquet.

53
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,540
He deeply regrets it.

54
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:19,100
You're Chairman Jiang's daughter.

55
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,399
Chairman Jiang is too kind.

56
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,930
We'll have another chance in the future.

57
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,810
However,

58
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,680
I'm lucky to have a chance

59
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,620
to meet such a beautiful lady like you, Miss Jiang.

60
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,740
It's really a pleasant surprise.

61
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,150
This...

62
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,020
is a gift that I specifically prepared for you.

63
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,700
What is this?

64
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,980
A tie.

65
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,740
I hope you'll like it.

66
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,900
I like it.

67
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,540
I like it very much.

68
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,240
Miss Jiang,

69
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,720
if you could come to my room

70
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,340
to put it on me yourself,

71
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,580
I would like it even more.

72
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,060
I would be honored.

73
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,660
What's wrong?

74
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,790
Jiang Yao went into Yamai Taichi's room.

75
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,070
The one she is trying to kill is not you,

76
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,860
but Yamai Taichi.

77
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,990
There's no reason for this.

78
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,590
If she dares to make a move against Yamai Taichi,

79
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,460
she won't be able to get out of this venue alive.

80
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,590
I'm afraid she didn't plan

81
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,420
to leave this venue alive.

82
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,860
She wants to die with Yamai Taichi?

83
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,180
Young Marshal, Jiang Yao wants to kill you!

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,980
Why go to the trouble of saving her?

85
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,740
Step aside!

86
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,340
Miss Jiang.

87
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,950
Don't be upset.

88
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,500
They've already searched me at the main gate.

89
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,300
Why do I have to be searched again when I come in here?

90
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,970
They're all crude men.

91
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,860
Not just anyone

92
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,780
can enter my room.

93
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,540
Besides, Miss Jiang,

94
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,400
didn't you already come in?

95
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,300
You smell so good.

96
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,540
Mr. Yamai.

97
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,380
This is the gift I personally selected for you.

98
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,510
I would be so disappointed

99
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,760
if you didn't try it on.

100
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,770
Okay.

101
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,440
I'll listen to you.

102
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,700
I'll try it on.

103
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,880
Young Marshal Chi,

104
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,650
why are you here?

105
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,040
Sorry.

106
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,570
I didn't know you had another guest.

107
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,640
I just want to discuss the details

108
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,180
of our cooperation.

109
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,110
Please forgive me, Mr. Yamai.

110
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,480
Okay.

111
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,920
I'll be right there.

112
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,250
Mr. Yamai,

113
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,830
it won't take long

114
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,340
to try on a tie.

115
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,380
Miss Jiang,

116
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,550
your fiancé is still waiting for you downstairs.

117
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,610
If you don't go down now,

118
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,420
he will come looking for you.

119
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,050
I still have serious business to attend to.

120
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,580
Once I'm done,

121
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,410
I'll come find you.

122
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,240
Mr. Yamai,

123
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,430
see you later.

124
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,770
If you hadn't ruined my plan,

125
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,900
I'd have already injected Yamai Taichi with my tranquilizer

126
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,800
and killed him by now.

127
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,940
Then you'd have been full of holes by now.

128
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,420
That's still better than

129
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,180
watching your cooperation go through.

130
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,890
Since you really don't want me to work with him,

131
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,580
why don't you just kill me

132
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,620
instead of Yamai?

133
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,420
You said you wouldn't hurt Chi Yanzhou,

134
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,700
but would kill Yamai instead?

135
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,780
If we kill him,

136
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,420
we can still stop this cooperation.

137
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,380
Jiang Yao.

138
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,620
Have you thought it through?

139
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,700
If you want to kill Yamai,

140
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,980
you'll

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,220
die.

142
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,620
That's still better than letting the tragedy

143
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,900
from five years ago repeat itself.

144
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,740
I've already done wrong to Yanzhou once.

145
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,050
I can't do it again.

146
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,340
You can't bring yourself to kill me.

147
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,270
I just think even if I were to kill you,

148
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,600
Yamai would simply work with others.

149
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,250
I might as well kill Yamai Taichi

150
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,980
and solve it once and for all.

151
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,580
Now that's at least a reasonable excuse.

152
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,280
What are you doing?

153
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,580
I'm giving you a chance.

154
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,000
Kill me.

155
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,500
At least this way, you can ensure

156
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,860
that I won't sign the contract

157
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,980
with him.

158
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,670
Do it.

159
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,340
Why are you hesitating?

160
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,050
Haven't you already prepared to die?

161
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,410
What are you afraid of?

162
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Chi Yanzhou.

163
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,150
Don't push me.

164
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,770
You don't want to kill me.

165
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,010
So, you'd rather choose

166
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,030
to die alongside Yamai instead.

167
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,820
I didn't.

168
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,420
Wh-What's going on with these two?

169
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,970
Let's go over there.

170
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,050
Don't disturb them.

171
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,520
Let's go.

172
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,220
-No one is allowed to come here.
-No.

173
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,740
It's a once-in-a-blue-moon thing for my uncle.

174
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,820
I have to go ask him.

175
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,100
Since you don't want to kill me...

176
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,800
don't blame me for not giving you a chance.

177
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,120
Chi Yanzhou.

178
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,870
What are you doing, Chi Yanzhou?

179
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,670
To prevent you from ruining my plan.

180
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,040
Chi Yanzhou,

181
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,400
put me down!

182
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,460
Chi Yanzhou, are you crazy?

183
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,710
Put me down!

184
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,240
Put me down!

185
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,550
Chi Yanzhou, what do you want?

186
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,580
Stay here.

187
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,330
If you change your mind and decide to kill me,

188
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,220
wait for me to come back.

189
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,330
Then, you can kill me to your heart's content.

190
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,880
Let me out now!

191
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,440
Chi Yanzhou!

192
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,950
Strange. Where did he go?

193
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,270
He vanished right after coming out.

194
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,100
I must find them and get the truth about

195
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,790
how many things they've been hiding from me.

196
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,250
Bastard.

197
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,850
What is this?

198
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,640
[Ao City Railway Route Map]

199
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,920
This is the railway design

200
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,030
that Chi Yanzhou provided to the Japanese.

201
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,240
Why does it look so strange?

202
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,400
So, this is Chi Yanzhou's real plan.

203
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,020
Miss Jiang,

204
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,230
the Governor wants to see you.

205
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,590
Lieutenant Zhang?
