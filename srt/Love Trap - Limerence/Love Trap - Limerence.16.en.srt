[Episode 16: I Return Your Deceit]

3
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,490
The Young Marshal is meeting

4
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,500
with a very important guest.

5
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,460
He has specifically instructed

6
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,890
that no one is to disturb him.

7
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,479
You look so distracted.

8
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,800
Could it be...

9
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,090
The debt of love you owe?

10
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,580
It's alright.

11
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
I've got plenty of time and energy for this.

12
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,930
Mr. Yamai, shall we continue, then?

13
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,790
Women are always the hardest to deal with

14
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,450
when you want to get rid of them.

15
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,250
Excuse me for a moment.

16
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,570
I'll be back soon.

17
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,950
Go, don't keep her waiting too long.

18
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,450
Do you want to die?

19
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,720
Even if I die,

20
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,390
I won't die alone.

21
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,110
Are you threatening me?

22
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,890
You were the one who used the Flying Bird Society first.

23
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,760
You've acted unjustly,

24
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,800
so don't blame me for being ruthless.

25
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,110
Fine.

26
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,710
Go ahead and try.

27
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,910
See if Yamai believes

28
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,870
the Flying Bird Society,

29
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,430
or if he believes the truth I've shown from Jiangbei.

30
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,950
You can take a gamble—

31
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,630
see who ends up losing more:

32
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,860
Me, or the Flying Bird Society.

33
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,680
You rushed here to see me.

34
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,530
I'm guessing it's not just to threaten me.

35
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,470
Ah, now I remember—

36
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,120
You came here to settle a score, didn't you?

37
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,060
Fine.

38
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,290
I'll give you five minutes.

39
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,510
You can start now.

40
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,870
Your purpose

41
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,230
is to cooperate with Japan?

42
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,740
It is obvious.

43
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,740
From the moment you seized the medicine,

44
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,269
to breaking my engagement with Wenlan,

45
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,580
you've been plotting all this.

46
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,780
Otherwise,

47
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,030
do you think

48
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,690
I'm just jealous over you?

49
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,290
You're disappointed?

50
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,510
The fact that you're disappointed now is laughable.

51
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,430
You should know better than anyone that

52
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,790
from five years ago,

53
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,890
we were never meant to be the same kind of person.

54
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,020
Whether the world

55
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,560
is heaven or hell

56
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,150
has nothing to do with me.

57
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,380
All I want is money

58
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,170
and power.

59
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,750
Money and power are really so important

60
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,960
that you'd sell your dignity

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,590
and become the Japanese's lackey?

62
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,510
That day at the orphanage, you didn't say it like this.

63
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,680
If I hadn't acted that way,

64
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,630
would you have believed me?

65
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,590
And would the Flying Bird Society have helped me?

66
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,520
Jiang Yao.

67
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,440
To put it bluntly,

68
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,370
I've been using you.

69
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,340
Does that make you sad?

70
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,909
Speaking of which,

71
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,680
I learned this from you.

72
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,780
How does it feel to be deceived?

73
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,050
I'm just giving you

74
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,740
a taste of

75
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,260
what you made me feel.

76
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Chi Yanzhou.

77
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,630
You can deceive me.

78
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,820
You can use me.

79
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,390
But you shouldn't collude with the Japanese

80
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,580
and become a traitor to your own people.

81
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,470
You've really let me down.

82
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,100
Let you down?

83
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,100
Did you ever have any expectations of me?

84
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,890
You want to kill me, don't you?

85
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,250
I'm going back to Jiangbei in a few days.

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,280
If you want to take action,

87
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,680
you'd better do it soon.

88
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,730
Mr. Yamai,

89
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,890
I hope our cooperation will be successful.

90
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,880
It will be.

91
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,660
Three days from now,

92
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,410
I'll hold a banquet at the Peace Hotel.

93
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,440
I sincerely hope you'll attend.

94
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,350
Also,

95
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,260
I'll also prepare the contract.

96
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,010
Okay.

97
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,870
I'll be there on time.

98
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,310
Young Marshal.

99
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:58,200
Are you alright?

100
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,250
Chi Yanzhou.

101
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,740
You can lie to me.

102
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,120
You can use me.

103
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,560
But you shouldn't collude with the Japanese

104
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,710
and become a traitor to your own people.

105
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,910
You've really let me down.

106
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,990
He really dared to trick me.

107
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,190
He's from Jiangbei...

108
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,430
He's not as simple as I thought.

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,480
I really underestimated him.

110
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,310
I really underestimated him.

111
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,400
Governor.

112
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,670
The military funds are tight now,

113
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,390
and the cooperation with Japan has been interrupted.

114
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,130
There have even been deserters within the ranks.

115
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,980
I fear morale is unstable.

116
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,670
I'll...

117
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,830
I'll go call Yamai.

118
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,140
I'll call him.

119
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,780
Governor!

120
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,110
Governor!

121
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,790
Dad!

122
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,060
Dad!

123
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,890
Dad!

124
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,810
You need to rest.

125
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,230
I'll get you a doctor.

126
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,760
Wenlan,

127
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,940
stop lazing away every day.

128
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,440
In the future,

129
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,640
you'll be in charge of this family.

130
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,970
Dad, I won't take charge of the family.

131
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,080
If you ever feel like no one

132
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,190
is around to handle things,

133
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,970
let him do it.

134
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,930
What nonsense are you talking?

135
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,830
Yes, Young Master.

136
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,900
You can't say such things.

137
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,550
I may be known for speaking nonsense,

138
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,840
but right now,

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,530
not a single word I say is in jest.

140
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,790
I won't sink to your level,

141
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,580
colluding with the Japanese.

142
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,890
And I refuse to become a dog of the Japanese.

143
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,680
You little rascal!

144
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,970
You've always thought I was useless,

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,070
that I'm incapable.

146
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,290
Well, maybe

147
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,960
I can't change this corrupt world,

148
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,920
but I won't let this world change me either.

149
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,820
You...

150
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,100
This damned kid is driving me crazy!

151
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,160
Lieutenant Zhang.

152
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,700
I'll deal with Yamai's matter.

153
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,400
This time,

154
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,360
we can't let Chi Yanzhou off easily.

155
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,080
Yes.

156
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,380
Young Marshal.

157
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,340
Slow down.

158
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,400
Mr. Ji.

159
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,690
Mr. Ji!

160
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,990
Mr. Ji.

161
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,150
-What's going on? 
-Slow down.

162
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,120
Here.

163
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,200
Young Marshal. Sit down.

164
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,960
Why is he so drunk?

165
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,990
Chi's usually so controlled with his drinking.

166
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,430
It's because of Jiang Yao again, right?

167
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,110
Chi,

168
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,830
last time I saw you like this

169
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,790
was five years ago.

170
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,620
Mr. Ji,

171
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,510
we shouldn't be talking about this right now.

172
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,290
Is the Young Marshal okay?

173
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,880
You're right. I need to go get something.

174
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,870
Mr. Ji,

175
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,140
do you need my help?

176
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,930
I can prepare the medicine or fetch some water.

177
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,470
Let's see if you can get him

178
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:20,450
to straighten his legs

179
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,240
over your head.

180
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,090
Forget it,

181
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,960
just put him in a nice posture.

182
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,780
It's rare to see Chi so drunk.

183
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,260
This opportunity is too rare.

184
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,140
I'll grab a camera.

185
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,880
Young Marshal, here.
