[Limerence]

00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,690
[Episode 4: "Uncle"]

3
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,979
Do it.

4
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,740
Don't you lay a hand on him.

5
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,780
Miss Jiang, looks like you care a lot about your fiancé.

6
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:43,860
Mr. Du.

7
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,060
Come on, let's have a chat.

8
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,259
Let's talk privately.

9
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,580
Chi Yanzhou.

10
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,020
What do you want?

11
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,660
What do you think I should do?

12
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,270
You'd better behave yourself.

13
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,180
This is Du family's turf.

14
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,060
Uncle!

15
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,660
What?

16
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,500
Wenlan.

17
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,060
Uncle.

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,990
You've made such a grand entrance.

19
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,539
Others might think you're here to snatch my fiancée.

20
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,580
Don't frighten my Yao.

21
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,780
Snatch your fiancée?

22
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,020
My woman is not here.

23
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,140
What am I supposed to snatch?

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,140
Just kidding.

25
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,430
After all these years,

26
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,540
Uncle, you're still as dull as ever.

27
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,660
Yao, don't be afraid.

28
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,329
This is the one

29
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,060
I've often mentioned to you.

30
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,400
The handsome, wealthy,

31
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,940
wise, and powerful...

32
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,740
He is the uncle I told you about,

33
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,530
the King of Hell, totally lacking any romantic charm

34
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,990
and completely clueless about women's feelings.

35
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,500
Chi Yanzhou.

36
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,340
Although he looks older,

37
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,420
he's only three years older than me.

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,500
If the little age gap doesn't bother you,

39
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,260
you can also call him "Uncle" like I do.

40
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,540
Uncle.

41
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,860
This is Jiang Yao,

42
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,180
my fiancée.

43
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,300
She's usually very warm.

44
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,220
She's a little nervous because it's her first engagement.

45
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,580
Is that so?

46
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,740
Then when I have the chance, I definitely have to see for myself

47
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
just how warm Miss Jiang truly is.

48
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,610
Uncle, stop looking at her like that.

49
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,740
She is timid.

50
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,220
Don't scare her.

51
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,260
I'm just looking at the wound on Miss Jiang's lips.

52
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,820
It's quite unique.

53
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,380
Please don't mind it, Young Marshal.

54
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,820
A while ago, I

55
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,300
was bitten

56
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,860
by my dog.

57
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,380
Speaking of which, a few years ago,

58
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,940
I also had a wild cat.

59
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,620
It didn't spare anyone when it bit.

60
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,600
But that's the nature of beasts.

61
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,860
No matter how well you treat them,

62
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,540
they won't be close to you.

63
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,700
Am I right,

64
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,940
Miss Jiang?

65
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,590
How did you go from discussing the wound

66
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,060
to talking about pets?

67
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,730
Uncle,

68
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,060
I have something to ask you.

69
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,290
I heard about your affairs

70
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,810
and how you spent

71
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,180
a fortune in Ye Wei Yang

72
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,540
just to bid on a stunning beauty.

73
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,700
Now everyone in Ao City knows about it.

74
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,529
I'm curious

75
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,210
what kind of woman

76
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,740
could melt your stone heart.

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,100
When will you...

78
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,060
bring her here?

79
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,150
You really want to see her?

80
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,380
What a coincidence.

81
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,100
She's here too.

82
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,980
How about I introduce you two?

83
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,140
You really brought her here?

84
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,260
Where is she? Where is she?

85
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,420
Where is she?

86
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,540
Where is she?

87
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,500
Where is she?

88
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,900
Why haven't I seen

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,700
a woman prettier than my Yao?

90
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,740
I'm just kidding.

91
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,220
Uncle,

92
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,300
when did you

93
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,420
learn to make such a boring joke?

94
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,950
Yanzhou.

95
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,700
Brother-in-law.

96
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,100
It's been a long time.

97
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,740
You've all grown up.

98
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,290
Yanzhou.

99
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:41,010
I feel ashamed

100
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,170
about your father's matter.

101
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,300
I wasn't able to help.

102
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,080
You don't hold it against me, do you?

103
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,010
If you're going to blame someone,

104
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,260
blame that Flying Bird Society.

105
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,659
This is a joyous occasion.

106
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,260
Let's not talk about that.

107
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,380
That's right.

108
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,380
Come on.

109
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,980
Yanzhou.

110
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,340
My brother-in-law?

111
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,940
Brother-in-law?

112
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,540
Look how well-matched they are.

113
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,150
I just hope Wenlan

114
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,180
can settle down when he gets married.

115
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,420
I'll thank the heavens

116
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,010
if he could be half as successful as you.

117
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,420
What's wrong?

118
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,440
You've seemed distracted all evening.

119
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,659
Were you

120
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,820
really scared by my uncle's

121
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,900
display of force just now?

122
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,700
Let me tell you.

123
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,940
He was just born with that fierce look,

124
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,820
but in reality, he's...

125
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,620
He's not any better beneath the surface.

126
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,820
I'm not that timid.

127
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,790
I'm just a little tired.

128
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,310
The dinner is about to start.

129
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,580
I'll go get changed.

130
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,940
Okay.

131
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,940
Are you looking for me?

132
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,900
Young Marshal Chi, have you come to the wrong place?

133
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,580
This is the changing room.

134
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,740
You were once my family's tutor.

135
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,220
A few days ago, you were still the Miss Zhen'er

136
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,020
for whom I paid a lot of money.

137
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,659
And now you've transformed

138
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,700
into the Young Mistress of the Du family.

139
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,920
Jiang Yao,

140
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,100
you've got some moves.

141
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,760
But I think

142
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,780
Miss Zhen'er's identity suits you better.

143
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,460
What do you think?

144
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,900
If you hadn't reminded me,

145
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,060
I would have forgotten.

146
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,420
I shouldn't be addressing you as "Young Marshal" now.

147
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,740
I should address you as

148
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,050
"Uncle,"

149
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,220
just like Wenlan does.

150
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,520
Try calling me that again.

151
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,340
Uncle.

152
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,110
Do you feel so excited

153
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,590
to be marrying my nephew,

154
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,540
wearing the mark I left?

155
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,230
If Wenlan finds out,

156
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,580
I wonder if he would still want to marry you.

157
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,920
My marriage to Wenlan

158
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,390
was arranged long ago.

159
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,580
It won't change because of these things.

160
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,710
You're so confident.

161
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,490
I really want to try

162
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,310
and tell him everything.

163
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,220
Chi Yanzhou.

164
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,790
Are you here today

165
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,340
just to say this?

166
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,200
Cancel the engagement...

167
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,900
now.

168
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,740
Impossible.

169
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,790
If I cancel the engagement now,

170
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,540
Wenlan and the Du family

171
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,850
will become the laughingstock in the whole city.

172
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,200
I know I've signed the agreement.

173
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,540
But could you leave him

174
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,870
out of our matters?

175
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,670
Wenlan is innocent.

176
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,330
Wenlan this,

177
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,840
Wenlan that.

178
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,660
You really care about

179
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,500
my nephew, don't you?

180
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,710
Unfortunately, Jiang Yao,

181
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,030
I can't stand to see you doing well right now.

182
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,190
I'll say it again.

183
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,850
Cancel the engagement.

184
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,660
Yao,

185
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,390
the engagement ceremony is about to start.

186
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,920
My father is urging us.

187
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,410
I should go.

188
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,420
Chi Yanzhou.

189
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,030
What exactly do you want?

190
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,240
Outside is your own nephew.

191
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,710
So what?

192
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,880
Yao?

193
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,020
Yao!

194
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,420
Are you really okay?

195
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,760
I'm coming in.

196
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,940
Wait a minute.

197
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,890
I'll be right out.

198
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,060
You broke our agreement.

199
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,100
You'll face the consequences.

200
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,750
Uncle?

201
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,790
Why are you here?

202
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,900
Just taking a stroll.
