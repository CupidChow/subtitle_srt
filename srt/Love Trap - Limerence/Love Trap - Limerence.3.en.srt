Goodbye.

00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,700
Did I say you could go?

5
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,259
Young Marshal, anything else I can help with?

6
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,070
Come here.

7
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,740
Didn't you say you'd deal with me until the end?

8
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,980
Is this how you do it?

9
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,060
If I'm not satisfied,

10
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,460
you won't get a single pill.

11
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,170
Fine.

12
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,300
I'll deal with you until the end.

13

Chi, the gunshot just now...

14
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,600
Chi Yanzhou, are you crazy?

15
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,420

Jiang Yao.

20
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,430
You're just bland now.

Get lost.

22
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,980
We're here, my lady.

23
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,020
If the Young Marshal sees you here,

24
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,340
he will be very happy.

25
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,740
This time, Yanzhou is here on official duties.

26
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,940
Perhaps

27
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,180
he doesn't want us to follow him.

28
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,810
This is the Chi's Mansion.

29
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,260
That's strange.

30
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,630
Why are there other women here?

31
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,260
The Young Marshal is really something.

32
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,380
He's about to be engaged to you, my lady.

33
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,510
Yet he's letting other women come to his mansion.

34
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,829
Could it be her?

35
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,040
My lady, stop looking at her.

36
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,300
She's not as pretty as you.

37
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,100
Ugly hag.

38
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,250
So...

39
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,019
he's also about to get engaged.

40
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,270
Chi Yanzhou is going to send the medicine to Jiangbei.

41
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,900
The medicine is already at sea,

42
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,260
and we're sending a boat to get it.

43
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,850
If everything goes well,

44
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,900
we should be able to get it within three days.
