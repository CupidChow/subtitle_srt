[Episode 21: I've Already Forgiven You]

3
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,130
At a time like this,

4
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,970
you're still holding on to your stubbornness.

5
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,650
Miss Jiang, you're really dedicated to your work.

6
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,330
Miss Jiang,

7
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,690
stop reading.

8
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,810
Let's go horseback riding.

9
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,080
Let's go!

10
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,539
Miss Jiang,

11
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,850
you give exams every few days.

12
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,460
If you keep this up,

13
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,960
your students will start to think you're a sadist.

14
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,890
Have an apple.

15
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,650
Have an apple before giving another test.

16
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,820
-Actually...
-Actually...

17
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,610
-I'll go first. 
 -You go first.

18
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,690
When did we

19
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,010
become so in sync?

20
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,130
Ladies first.

21
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,290
Alright.

22
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,090
Actually, there's something

23
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,610
I've been holding in my heart for a long time.

24
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,410
But I didn't know how to say it.

25
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,950
What is it?

26
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,850
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,090
Really.

28
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,300
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,560
I know,

30
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,890
no matter how justified my reasons might sound,

31
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,260
♫The wind and snow rage on, with tears falling♫

32
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,260
these words, to you

33
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,520
and to your Chi family,

34
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,110
mean nothing.

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,880
♫Love and hate engulfed, drowning each other in torment♫

36
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,370
But then I thought,

37
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,560
♫It's hard to say who's more sorrowful♫

38
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,250
saying it

39
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,090
is still better than not saying it.

40
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:51,380
♫Is it that the more bitter it is, the deeper it becomes?♫

41
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,650
This whole time, I've wanted to ask you,

42
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:55,020
♫Is it because of too many debts, constantly tearing at us?♫

43
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,090
how have you been these past five years?

44
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,940
♫Or is there an unwillingness to let go?♫

45
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,210
But I couldn't bring myself to ask, and I didn't dare.

46
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:03,930
♫Falling into the whirlpool, never seeking escape♫

47
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,250
Because I knew

48
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,410
you couldn't have been doing well.

♫Love grows in chaotic times, drifting and wandering♫

50
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,050
Just now,

51
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,690
I found out that the person who killed

52
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,690
♫Trapped in broken pasts♫

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,860
your father was Du Jianshan.

♫In a daze, in a once familiar place, I see your face♫

55
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,089
I finally feel a weight lifted off my shoulders.

56
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,670
♫Love buried deep in the abyss, deliberately entombed♫

57
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,450
Does this mean

58
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,930
that the hatred between us

59
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,590
♫I can't understand your unpredictability♫

60
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,540
♫We brushed past each other, frozen gazes hiding panic♫

61
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,690
can lessen, even just a little?

62
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,850
There's something I've been wanting to ask you too.

63
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,110
♫It's my fault for not forgetting♫

♫Helpless, forced to remain silent♫

67

Dad,

96
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,020
do you want to abandon me

97
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,770
just like you abandoned my mom back then?

98
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,770
Release him!

99
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,290
Governor, well...

100
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,100
That's my son.

101
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,130
That's my son. Release him!

102
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,210
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:42,690
Let's go.

104
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,650
Thanks.

105
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,170
Uncle.

106
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,090
Let's go home.

107
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,370
-Young Marshal. 
 -Jiang Yao.

108
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,720
How's Jiang Yao?

109
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,060
She's fine.

110
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,650
Chi Yanzhou,

111
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,690
I won't let you leave

112
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,160
Nanpo Mountain alive.

113
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,730
Protect the Young Marshal!

114
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,940
Young Marshal!

115
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,450
Uncle, don't!

116
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,850
Let's go!

117
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,670
Dad, that way...

118
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,780
She's awake.

119
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,140
Yao,

120
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,870
if you don't wake up,

121
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,980
I will go with you.

122
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,490
If something happens to you,

123
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,630
how can I go on living?

124
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,990
Alright, alright,

125
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,740
the child's fine.

126
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,880
Why are you making such a fuss? You're giving her a headache.

127
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,900
I'm just worried.

128
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,440
How... How did I get back?

129
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,290
Your friends brought you home.

130
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,410
What about Chi Yanzhou and the others?

131
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,770
Yao,

132
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,380
why are you still worrying about others?

133
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,260
What are you doing?

134
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,130
How did you let yourself freeze like that?

135
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,770
My heart aches for you!

136
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,010
I'm fine.

137
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,809
Dad, Mom,

138
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,020
I have something urgent to take care of. I need to go out right away.

139
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,179
You just woke up, and now you're going out again?

140
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,370
Have you lost your mind from the cold?

141
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,010
No way.

142
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,250
You have to rest for at least two days.

143
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,930
You're going to see Wenlan, aren't you?

144
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,130
I don't know what happened,

145
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,570
but Military Governor Du suddenly died yesterday.

146
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,530
It's good for you to check on him.

147
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:57,860
You!

148
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,860
How can you not worry about your daughter?

149
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,400
She just woke up!

150
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,450
The child needs to change her clothes. Let's step out.

151
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,290
Really, you always indulge her.

152
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,650
-Let's go, let's go.
 -Wear more layers!

153
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,850
-Alright. 
 -Don't let anything happen again!

154
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,340
Du Jianshan really died?

155
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,800
I need to go check on Wenlan right away.

156
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,420
Yao.

157
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,610
Dad.

158
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,820
What's wrong?

159
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,730
I may not know what you're doing,

160
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,450
but while you're out,

161
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,990
be careful in everything you do.

162
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,690
Your mother is timid.

163
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,190
She is easily scared.

164
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,030
I don't want to lose you either.

165
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,290
I understand.

166
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,560
Thank you, Dad.

167
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,120
Rickshaw!

168
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,890
How's your health?

169
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,010
I'm fine.

170
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,290
Were there any casualties yesterday?

171
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,940
Don't worry, everyone got out safely.

172
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,480
That's good.

173
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,210
By the way,

174
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,850
stop the plan against Yamai,

175
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,530
and don't take action against Chi Yanzhou anymore.

176
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,170
If we wait any longer, it'll be too late.

177
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,770
Even if Chi Yanzhou was willing to risk his life to save you this time,

178
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,770
he's loyal and sentimental,

179
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,090
but we can't let that stop us

180
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,890
from doing what we need to do.

181
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,210
I suspect

182
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,930
Chi Yanzhou and Yamai's partnership

183
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,800
isn't as simple as it seems.

184
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,490
Until I find out the truth,

185
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,030
don't act rashly.

186
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,840
Are the Du family all cowards?

187
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,350
Come out, Du Wenlan!

188
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,420
Hurry up, come out!

189
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,290
Get out here!

190
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,960
How's your health?

191
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,580
Don't worry, it's fine.

192
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,450
I wasn't asking you.

193
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,530
What's that sour stench?

194
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,930
I wouldn't bother mentioning it.

195
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,770
How's your health?

196
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,720
You see me standing here,

197
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,210
so you know I'm fine.

198
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,680
But you...

199
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,790
I was dazed yesterday,

200
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,060
and I think I saw Du Jianshan shoot at you.

201
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,590
Are you hurt anywhere?

202
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,560
Just a minor wound,

203
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,910
nothing serious.

204
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,740
But Wenlan

205
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,530
might be taking it hard.

206
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,750
Du Jianshan's death may be satisfying,

207
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,580
but Wenlan is innocent after all.

208
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,020
Get your young master out here!

209
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,260
If he doesn't come out, we're going in!

210
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,020
Get him out here!

211
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,810
Yes, come out! Come out!
