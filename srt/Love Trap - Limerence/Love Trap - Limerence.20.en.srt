Young Marshal.

4
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,530
Jiang Yao has escaped.

00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,720
[Come to Nanpo Mountain alone. Otherwise, prepare to collect Jiang Yao's corpse]

6
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,160
To Nanpo Mountain.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,140
Du Jianshan,

8
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,960
I advise you to let me go.

9
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,670
I heard you're strapped for cash.

10
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,620
You've approached my father multiple times,

11
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,140
asking for help with your military funding shortage.

12
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,120
Now you've tied his daughter up like this.

13
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,100
If he finds out,

14
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,510
I'm afraid he's even less likely to agree to it.

15
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,510
Don't worry.

16
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,720
I won't give you a hard time.

17
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,460
As long as Chi Yanzhou comes,

18
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,720
I will let you go.

19
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,070
You want to use me as bait

20
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,690
to lure Chi Yanzhou here?

21
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,930
I'm afraid you're barking up the wrong tree.

22
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,670
Do you know why Chi Yanzhou

23
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,300
insisted on having me break off the engagement with your son?

24
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,980
Why?

25
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,540
Because he hates me.

26
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,750
He can't stand me being even the slightest bit happy.

27
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,150
Five years ago, his family was ruined

28
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,350
because of a woman from the Flying Bird Society.

29
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,290
His father died because of that.

30
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,320
You should have heard about it.

31
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,740
You mean...

32
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,470
you were the woman from the Flying Bird Society?

33
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,540
Yes.

34
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,270
Why else would Chi Yanzhou

35
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,340
reject a wealthy lady from Jiangbei,

36
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,100
and instead mess around with me?

37
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,590
Would he come to save me

38
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,610
despite the deep hatred between us?

39
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,520
He'd rather I die in your hands sooner rather than later.

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,920
Sorry.

41
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,740
He's here.

42
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,120
Chi Yanzhou.

43
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,550
You really didn't let me down.

44
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,500
Stop.

45
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,290
Don't act rashly,

46
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,240
or I'll detonate the bombs!

47
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,020
You shouldn't have come.

48
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,940

keep waiting like this.

83
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,030
No matter what, we have to go up and take a look.

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,780
The Young Marshal said

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,810
no one is allowed to go up without his order.

86
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,140
But

87
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,180
we can't just stand here

88
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,700
and watch him walk to his death, can we?

89
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,710
I trust him.

90
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,840
And he doesn't want

91
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,580
any of us to die here.

92
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,300
You're here to save Chi Yanzhou.

We're here to save Jiang Yao.

94
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,290

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,030
I guess you'd get yourselves blown up

99
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,700
before you even see Jiang Yao.

100
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,640
What should we do?

101
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,990
I have an idea.

102
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,220
I used to come here often when I was young.

103
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,520
I know a path.

104
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,760
But it's not an easy one.

105
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,800
Put the gun down.

106
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,780
Du Jianshan is your father.

107
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,670
Would you really be so kind as to take us up there?

108
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,120
Inside, one is my uncle,

109
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,120
and one is my best friend.

110
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,030
You can follow me or not.

111
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,920
Keep up.

112
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,430
Let's follow him first.

113
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,380
Jiang Yao.

114
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,310
You knew Du Jianshan was looking for you,

115
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,070
yet you still chose to come here.

116
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,920
You two are truly the modern-day

117
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,620
Romeo and Juliet.

118
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,650
What will it take for you to leave her alone?

119
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
You're so deeply in love with her.

120
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,350
After how she treated you before,

121
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,590
yet you're still willing to die for her.

122
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,790
After I kill you,

123
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,880
I'll let her go.

124
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,500
If you kill him,

125
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,270
both Jiangbei and the Japanese will never let you go!

126
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,830
At that point, you'll have no peace either!

127
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,520
You think I'm doing well now?

128
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,740
It's all because this bastard used tricks behind my back

129
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,260
that I've fallen into this situation!

130
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,020
I really regret it.

131
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:01,490
I should have killed him

132
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,570
when I killed his father!

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,650
What did you say?

134
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,430
Look at me.

135
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,580
When people get older, they tend to forget things.

136
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,990
I forgot to tell you, right?

137
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,630
Back then, Chi Yanzhou, your father

138
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,010
didn't die at the hands of the Flying Bird Society.

139
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,400
It was me,

140
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,660
taking advantage of the chaos and killing him.

141
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,970
But he wasn't quite dead yet.

142
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,690
With his dying breath,

143
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,480
your dad told me to run away

144
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,470
and asked me to take good care of you in his stead.

145
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,780
I couldn't stand it anymore,

146
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,680
so I shot him

147
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,250
in the head again.

148
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,980
He was your father-in-law.

149
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,440
He treated you well.

150
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,510
But he blocked

151
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,380
my path to power.

152
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,390
He asked me to take good care of you.

153
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,340
Okay.

154
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,670
Then, today,

155
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,420
I'll let you

156
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,990
reunite with him

157
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,500
and your wife

158
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,380
in the Netherworld.

159
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,190
Let's go.

160
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,919
-Jiang Yao.
-Yanzhou.

161
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,340
Yanzhou, are you alright?

162
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,410
I'm fine.

163
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,630
Chi Yanzhou.

164
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,030
I've prepared something nice for you here.

165
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,300
You two can share your last words of love

166
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,020
during your final moments

167
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,430
since you'll be locked up here.

168
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,810
Run!

169
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,100
This door is impenetrable to knives and bullets,

170
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,950
so you can just spend your last moments together!

171
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,540
Lieutenant Zhang!

172
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,640
Release the cool air!

173
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,860
It's the cool air.

174
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,740
Looks like he wants us to freeze to death here.

175
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,350
We're almost there, just ahead.

176
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,340
Well, the door...

177
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,500
we can't open it

178
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,310
or break it down.

179
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,190
Are we really going to die here?

180
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,120
Don't talk nonsense.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,870
Wu Rong will definitely find a way.

182
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,060
Right.

183
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,310
Our Flying Bird Society will definitely come to rescue me.

184
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,760
I can't die here.

185
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,540
Otherwise, that would be too much of a waste.

186
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,610
It's Du Jianshan.

187
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,600
Hurry, catch me

188
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,690
and threaten my dad to release them.

189
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,620
Hurry up!

190
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,230
Dad, don't shoot!

191
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,160
They have me!

192
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,810
Governor, it's the Young Master.

193
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,350
Release Wenlan!

194
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,970
Let Jiang Yao go first!

195
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,960
And our Young Marshal!

196
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,090
Or we'll kill him! Hurry!

197
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,570
Dad, save me!

198
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,990
I don't want to die yet!

199
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,290
Is it because you haven't killed Yamai yet...

200
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,790
or because

201
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,260
you haven't stopped me from cooperating with the Japanese?

202
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,250
Both.

203
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,880
Even at this point,

204
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,000
you're still holding onto your belief.

205
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,370
Miss Jiang, you're so dedicated.
