[Episode 14 Hello, I'm Jiang Yao]

3
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,690
What's wrong?

4
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,060
Why are you sitting here in a daze?

5
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,509
Did you sit here all night?

6
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,860
You haven't changed your clothes.

7
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,979
Mom.

8
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,710
I'm fine.

9
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,810
You may leave now.

10
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,740
Don't scare me.

11
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,220
What's wrong? Tell me.

12
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,860
Please leave.

13
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,199
Come down for dinner later.

14
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,890
It's been a night.

15
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,470
My Lady hasn't come back yet.

16
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,150
I hope nothing happens.

17
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,200
My Lady.

18
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,950
My Lady, you're finally back.

19
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,630
Here.

20
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,660
Thank you, Miss.

21
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,100
Where have you been?

22
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,670
Why didn't you come back all night?

23
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,990
I was so worried.

24
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,260
Nothing.

25
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,610
I just

26
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
met a friend,

27
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,730
so we talked late.

28
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,040
What friend, My Lady?

29
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,460
You chatted all night?

30
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,290
You have no idea

31
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,070
Young Marshal didn't sleep last night.

32
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,230
He was waiting for you.

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,300
Is this Chi's Mansion?

34
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,420
Yes.

35
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,970
Here is a letter from Miss Jiang.

36
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,790
Please give it to Mr. Chi Yanzhou.

37
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,650
Okay.

38
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,800
It must be the love letter she wrote to Young Marshal.

39
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,380
That woman...

40
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,570
She's gone, yet she still seduces Young Marshal.

41
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,150
You're talking nonsense again.

42
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,210
What did the letter say?

43
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,640
She asked me out.

44
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,890
Is she going to act now?

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,700
She's really that eager, huh?

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,890
Young Marshal, are you going?

47
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,960
If she is so cruel,

48
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,880
we can only follow the plan.

49
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,829
I'm going.

50
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,020
Miss, take a look.

51
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,270
Sir. How much is this?

52
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,040
One yuan.

53
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,170
So expensive?

54
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,290
I didn't come at this price last time.

55
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,060
Young Marshal, here we are.

56
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,340
Jiang Yao invited you to such a place.

57
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,810
I wonder what she's planning.

58
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,120
This is the place where we first met.

59
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,470
Careful.

60
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,330
Thank you.

61
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,280
It seems like you have an injury on your leg.

62
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,080
The path here isn't easy to walk.

63
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,540
You could wait until you've recovered to come here.

64
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,130
Hello, my name is Jiang Yao.

65
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,930
Chi Yanzhou.

66
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,250
Miss Jiang seems very familiar with this place.

67
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,770
Yes,

68
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,960
I come around here often.

69
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,290
This is for you.

70
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,600
A Unity Knot.

71
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,970
It's used to pray for safety.

72
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,850
I hope you stay safe as well.

73
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,150
This is so expensive.

74
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,980
Last time I was here, it wasn't this price.

75
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,210
Can I get a 50% discount?

76
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,900
How could it be expensive?

77
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,030
Since you've been here before,

78
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,290
you should know,

79
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,140
my Unity Knot is meant to be tied

80
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,450
on that tree on the mountain.

81
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,500
It can bless lovers to get married.

82
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,450
It's very effective.

83
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,290
Wishes are priceless, after all.

84
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,290
Fine, we'll buy it.

85
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,320
Thank you.

86
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,650
You're here.

87
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,050
Why did you buy it?

88
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,890
Just for fun.

89
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,770
Inviting me here

90
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,720
is also just for fun?

91
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,120
♫Was our meeting a test of fate?♫

92
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,130
This place is quiet.

93
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,650
There's not much fun to be had.

94
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,770
Let's go further ahead.

95
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,570
Where to?

96
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,940
♫At least I felt your tender affection♫

97
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,680

♫Longing wells up in my heart♫

99
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,950
you did spend the money,

so we can't let it go to waste.

101
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,200
We still have to hang it on the Evergreen Tree.

♫Farewells are often scenes of sorrow♫

Yeah.

159
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,570
When I think about leaving,

160
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,840

I don't.

00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,330
My Lady, please wait here.

168
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,370
I'll go down and ask.

169
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,480
Bro,

170
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,870
what's happening here?

171
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,950
Mr. Du is here, smashing up the place.

172
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,250
Great job smashing this place.

173
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you.

174
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,410
My Lady.

175
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,010
They say it's Mr. Du,

176
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,100
our Young Marshal's nephew,

177
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,610
who's inside punishing some bad guys.

178
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,810
Apparently, the Madam of this Ye Wei Yang

179
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,320
took advantage of the chaos of the times,

180
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,210
hurting many

181
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,670
innocent young girls and children.

182
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,610
-Seems like one of Mr. Du's friends...
-So...

183
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,160
Was nearly victimized here.

184
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,200
He's inside right now, seeking justice for them.

185
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,340
I've long heard that you people

186
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,020
deceive and exploit others here.

187
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,730
If I catch you again,

188
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,490
I'll...

189
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,170
Take her away.

190
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:07,810
Yes.

191
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,690
Go, hand her over to the police.

192
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,810
So, it turns out we're so closely connected to Mr. Du.

193
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,250
Mr. Du.

194
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,650
Miss Zhou?

195
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,130
What a coincidence.

196
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,850
Yes.

197
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,150
What?

198
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,540
Miss Zhou, do you also enjoy watching the commotion?

199
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,590
I just happened to pass by.

200
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,900
Mr. Du, you're injured.

201
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,820
Just a scratch from disciplining

202
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,130
them earlier.

203
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,210
It's nothing serious.

204
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,250
And you?

205
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:46,450
Where are you heading?

206
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,610
I'm leaving.

207
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,530
Du Wenlan!

208
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,300
Go to hell!

209
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,060
Mr. Du, watch out!

210
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,690
So embarrassing.

211
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,880
This is so humiliating.

212
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,810
Miss Zhou!

213
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,080
-Miss Zhou!
-My Lady!

214
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:15,890
Are you alright?
