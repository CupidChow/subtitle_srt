[Episode 23: The Dawn Will Come]

3
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,550
It's been years since Ao City

4
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,350
hosted a temple fair like this.

5
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,770
Your return this time

6
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,110
is quite timely.

7
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
I guess I'm lucky.

8
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,160
If you miss it this time,

9
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,759
who knows how many years

10
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,060
you'd have to wait for another.

11
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,110
Speaking of which,

12
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,460
who knows how many more times

13
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,530
we'll get to see such festivities.

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,240
Look up.

15
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,330
The stars may fall,

16
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,770
but dawn is always on its way.

17
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,480
As long as the light doesn't go out,

18
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,450
we'll live to see the morning.

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,320
And even if the light does fade,

20
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,170
there will always be those who,

21
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,690
flesh and blood, are willing to sacrifice themselves,

22
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,180
just to bring us another day of sunlight.

23
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,050
Are you one of those people?

24
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,050
You must be.

25
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,440
Why are you so sure?

26
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,630
Well, I need to thank you

27
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,970
for locking me in the car.

28
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,760
I found something—

29
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,930
a railway design map.

30
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,230
There was something odd about it.

31
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,090
Odd how?

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,170
It's a

33
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,390
zigzag route design.

34
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,010
A zigzag route design?

35
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,050
What's wrong?

36
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,730
Roads and railways

37
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,650
sometimes use such designs.

38
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,990
There are indeed precedents,

39
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,340
but typically

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,020
as a last resort

41
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,840
to avoid

42
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,250
treacherous terrain.

43
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,260
Before coming here,

44
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,010
I reviewed our maps.

45
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,590
Your design

46
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,970
doesn't fully avoid such areas.

47
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,130
In other words,

48
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,329
you deliberately designed it that way

49
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,570
to slow down

50
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,690
the construction,

51
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,570
or even derail the entire project,

52
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,610
draining Japan's resources.

53
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,300
This is the only reason

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,210
that I can think of.

55
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,370
If what you say is true,

56
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,560
if I didn't want the railway to be completed,

57
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,450
why would I collaborate with Yamai?

58
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,490
You certainly could,

59
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,329
but if you didn't, Yamai would've

60
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,570
collaborated with the likes of Du Jianshan instead.

61
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,610
Even if we kill Du Jianshan,

62
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,530
there will always be countless others like him.

63
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,440
Can we ever eliminate them all?

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,880
Miss Jiang.

65
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,410
You're quite sharp.

66
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,370
Do the people in Jiangbei

67
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,610
know about your plans?

68
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,920
If they find out someday,

69
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,920
wouldn't that mean...

70
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,330
If that day truly comes,

71
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,490
a battle

72
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,600
will be inevitable.

73
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,290
You can't win against Jiangbei.

74
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,570
If everyone were afraid of death,

75
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,200
we'd never see the light of dawn

76
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,890
and never witness festivities like this.

77
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,770
So, you kept this from me on purpose

78
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,890
because you've already

79
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,170
prepared yourself to die.

80
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,490
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,040
Then I'm afraid

82
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,890
your effort will be wasted,

83
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,010
because I, Jiang Yao,

84
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,760
am not someone who fears death either.

85
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,810
No matter what happens,

86
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,160
I will stand by you.

87
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,800

94
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,730
to take him to the temple fair.

95
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:51,540

99

Wenlan hasn't been in a good mood.

100
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,880
We should check on him more often.

101
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,850
You're right. Miss Jiang.

102
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,180

Let's hope

104
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,140
everything goes smoothly.

117
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,890
I can explain.

118
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,280
Explain what?

119
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,360
Leave now.

120
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,540
I'm warning you.

121
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,370
Don't think for a second you can get your claws into my daughter!

122
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,250
I know you warlords—

123
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,050
all brutal and vicious!

124
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,090
Yao is young and timid;

125
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,240
maybe you've forced her into this.

126
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,150
But our Jiang family is not to be trifled with.

127
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,340
We're not afraid of you!

128
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,950
Mom, it's not what you think.

129
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,049
Don't talk.

130
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,870
I agreed about you and Wenlan

131
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,610
reluctantly

132
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,930
because he's kind-hearted.

133
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,810
That doesn't mean I'll tolerate you

134
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,090

135
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,290
Now leave!

137
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,920
Then I'll come back to visit you another time, Madam.

138
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,970
We don't need it.

139
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,520
Stop that.

Whether you're doing this willingly or under duress,

Think this through, will you?

149

What's wrong with you?

150
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,070
Didn't like the nephew

151
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,950
but fell for the uncle instead?

152
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,180
What kind of taste is that?

153
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,320

154
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,840

What?

157
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,930
Don't tell me it's a goodbye kiss.

158
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,610

It's said he accidentally stepped on a landmine.

168

Who sent it?

172
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,050
It only says the surname Du.

173
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,130
Du?

174
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,450

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,440
shall we proceed with signing the contract?

192
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,400
The contract will indeed be signed.

193
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,440
But before that,

194
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,090
there's something

195
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,960
I need to

196
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,250
confirm with you.

197
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,960
Please go ahead.

198
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,810
I received a letter.

199
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,050
It claims

200
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,370
that Miss Jiang, who visited my room a few days ago,

201
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,290
is a member of the Flying Bird Society.

202
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,560
And you

203
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,730
are one of their allies.

204
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,730
If I'm not mistaken,

205
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,460
this letter must have been sent

206
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,610
by Military Governor Du.

207
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:41,770
You're aware

208
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,360
he was bitter about

209
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,600
my collaboration with you.

210
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,220
He even sent assassins after me a few days ago.

211
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,610
It's clear he wanted to drag me down with him

212
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,370
before he died

213
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,940
and sabotage our plans.

214
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,670
I've dealt with

215
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,610
Du Jianshan before

216
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,720
and understand his character well.

217
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,770
But I know

218
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,650
Young Marshal Chi's character even better.

219
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,200
That's why I don't believe

220
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,890
his claims at all.

221
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,730
You're wise.

222
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,050
Even though I trust you,

223
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,930
I must provide the Japanese side

224
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,530
with an explanation.

225
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,970
So,

226
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,330
So, I need you, Young Marshal Chi,

227
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,040
to prove that you are not

228
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,450
affiliated with

229
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,240
the Flying Bird Society.

230
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,200
And how do you expect me to prove that?

231
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,970
Young Marshal, please come with me.
