[Episode 9 You're the most special one]

3
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,830
What a beautiful ring.

4
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,030
Could it be the love token

5
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,580
the vixen lost a few days ago?

6
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,820
What have you got?

7
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,340
Young Marshal.

8
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,389
Give it to me.

9
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,860
Maybe it belongs to Miss Jiang.

10
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,329
You searched for only a short while,

11
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,460
and you gave up.

12
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,660
Since I lost it,

13
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,940
I don't want it anymore.

14
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,780
Jiang Yao.

15
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,420
What on earth are you thinking?

16
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,070
Stop!

17
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,500
Am I a tiger?

18
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,760
You ran away when you saw me.

19
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,980
You said you didn't want to see me.

20
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,460
Is there something

21
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,060
you wanted ask me?

22
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,030
Have you found

23
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,250
the love token?

24
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,140
No.

25
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,740
What's the matter?

26
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,820
I'll ask someone to find it for you.

27
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,100
No need.

28
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,980
Why?

29
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,529
Since I lost it,

30
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,780
then it's only right that I get it back for you.

31
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,210
Aren't you usually very busy?

32
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,740
I don't waste your time

33
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,060
because of this kind of matter.

34
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,470
Besides,

35
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,450
I don't want to get it back.

36
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,940
You used to risk your life searching for it.

37
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,409
Now,

38
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,000
you say you don't want it.

39
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,940
Do you think it's convincing?

40
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,900
Or is it that

41
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,790
you don't want me to find it?

42
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,840
No.

43
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,340
Fine.

44
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,650
Since you don't need me to look for it,

45
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,120
I won't.

46
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,580
Miss Jiang,

47
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,020
what are the interesting places in Ao City?

48
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,880
I've been here for a while.

49
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,470
I want to explore Ao City

50
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,650
while the weather is nice.

51
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,860
Apart from the interesting places,

52
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,780
Ao City is also very famous for its delicious
delicacies.

53
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,900
How about this?

54
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,700
I'll annotate

55
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,540
all the delicious food and fun things

56
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:48,700
on the map,

57
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,300
so that you can explore them easily.

58
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,260
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

59
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,140
My Lady,

60
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,990
My Lady, the Young Marshal is back.

61
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,460
He brought many gifts.

62
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,300
The Young Marshal treats My Lady very well.

63
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,260
He always prepared gifts.

64
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,100
Unlike someone

65
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,670
who chased after our Young Marshal for years,

66
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,820
still no one cares about her.

67
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,820
Xiu, stop it.

68
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,620

69
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,180
Here are your gifts.

70
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,580
They're for everyone.

71
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,900
Xiu, give them to everyone.

72
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,940
Why is it for everyone?

73
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,600
Will she get one too?

74
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,420
We didn't prepare anything for Miss Jiang.

75
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,980
I knew it.

[Su's Sweet]

77
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,960
It's nothing.

78
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,720
Why did you prepare a gift specially for her?

79
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,300
It's from Su's Sweet.

80
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,960
[Su's Sweet]

81
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,500
My Lady, I've asked around.

82
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,510
It's really hard to get that sweet.

83
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,740
They have to queue up for a long time.

84
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,180
Enough, Xiu.

85
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,740
Let's buy some when we go out next time.

86
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,840
-So weird.
-Shame on you.

87
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,950
Why did Chi suddenly change his mind?

88
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,700
With this map from Miss Jiang,

[Have fun, Jiang Yao]

90
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,580
I'm sure we won't miss a fun place.

91
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,740
My Lady,

92
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,220
I really don't understand.

93
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,340
Jiang Yao is obviously a vixen.

94
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,900
How could you be friends with her?

95
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,790
In the future,

96
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,790
you are the one who's going to marry the
Young Marshal.

97
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,470
Father intended for

98
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,600
Yanzhou and me to get married,

99
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,500
but

100
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,630
as you can see,

101
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,500
isn't it obvious what's on Yanzhou's mind?

102
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,280
Then...

103
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,990
it's because the Young Marshal

104
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,740
is temporarily blinded by the vixen.

105
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,300
My Lady, you have to pull yourself together.

106
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,260
Xiu, that's enough.

107
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,940
It's getting late. Let's go.

108
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,460
My Lady,

109
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,140
those girls outside.

110
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:49,940
They...

111
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,220
Smelly old man.

112
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,200
How dare you lock me up for so long?

113
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,230
This is strange.

114
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,420
Why did the old man

115
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,390
ask me about Yao every day?

116
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,160
Oh no.

117
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,180
Is he still suspicious of Yao?

118
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,910
I have to find her quickly.

119
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,300
Follow him.

120
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,180
Yes, sir.

121
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,260
My Lady,

122
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,460
I don't think this is the right way back.

123
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,159
I think we're walking further and further
away.

124
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,240
Are we lost?

125
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,620
I'm not really sure about this route.

126
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,890
I should have asked the Young Marshal to
accompany us.

127
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,660
What is this place?

128
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,930
Let's go, Xiu.

129
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,660
This is strange.

130
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,500
She's not at home,

131
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,140
nor at the hospital.

132
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,140
Did Yao just disappear?

133
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,860
Get back! Get back!

134
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,780
If you come any closer,

135
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,100
I'll not let you get away with it.

136
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,900
Miss,

137
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,660
what are you going to do to me?

138
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,730
It's your bad day

139
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,340
to run into me.

140
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,560
Brat, who are you?

141
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,190
I'm who I am.

142
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,100
I'm your Grandpa Du.

143
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,690
You want to die?

144
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,590
In this world,

145
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,090
-you don't fight the enemy for your country.
-My Lady.

146
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,500
Amazing!

147
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,200
Instead, you bully girls?

148
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,100
You don't deserve to be men.

149
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:54,820
You...

150
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,780
Wait and see.

151
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,660
Don't run.

152
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,620
Stop!

153
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,180
Thank you, Mr. Du, for saving my life.

154
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,030
No worries.

155
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,460
It's nothing.

156
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,120
The outside world is in chaos now.

157
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,940
You should go back home early.

158
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,780
What?

159
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,680
Are you going to fall in love with me?

160
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,220
Let me tell you.

161
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,900
I'm not interested in

162
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,940
the clichéd story of

163
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,270
marrying you because I saved you.

164
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,430
We got lost.
