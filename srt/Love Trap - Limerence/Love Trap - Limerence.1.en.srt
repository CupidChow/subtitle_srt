00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,810
Sorry to keep everybody waiting.

4
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,520
The auction starts now.

5
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,670
Okay.

6
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,390
I bid 500.

7
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,390
I bid 650.

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,390
Sold.

21
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,790
Miss Man,

22
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,950
the quality of your goods

23
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,770
is for those

24
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,420
with limited experience.

25
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,220
If I don't spot anyone satisfactory

26
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,810
by the time I finish this drink,

27
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,210
perhaps it's time for

28
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,620
new management at this auction house.

29
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,860
Chief Yan,

30
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,490
you are so anxious.

31
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,660
The moment has arrived

32
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,290
for today's grand finale.

33
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,220
Zhen.

34
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,380
Everyone, don't miss out.

35
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,570
Chief Yan, does this meet your satisfaction?

36
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,200
Good.

37
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,500
I'll bid 2,000.

38
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,100
Chief Yan bids 2,000.

39
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,890
You're so generous.

40
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,300
Miss Zhen'er

41
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,780
will be yours tonight.

42
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,740
I'll be quick.

43
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,779
Be careful.

44
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,329
We've investigated

45
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,250
that Yan Xuan is a lustful man,

46
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,380
a man of indulgent desires.

47
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,210
He will fall into our trap this time.

48
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,620
I'll follow him into the room

49
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,140
and kill him silently.

50
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,240
The organization will have someone outside to meet you at any time.

51
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,460
You've been living abroad for many years.

52
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,300
This mission can only be assigned to you.

53
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,340
Be careful.

54
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,060
Remember,

55
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,010
the ultimate goal is to get the medicine from him.

56
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,580
The soldiers stationed at the front line

57
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,460
are counting on this medicine to save their lives.

58
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,700
So, Jiang Yao,

59
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,820
this time,

60
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,100
we must succeed.

61
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,490
We must not fail.

62
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,140
Our comrades' sacrifices

63
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,380
will not be in vain.

64
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,500
20,000.

65
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,580
Are you trying to screw with me?

66
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,940
I want to see

67
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,740
who's behind these tricks.

68
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,170
This man is not on the list.

69
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,220
Execute plan B.

70
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,570
Follow Yan Xuan closely.

71
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,780
How dare you take my lady?

72
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,220
How dare he beat up Chief Yan?

73
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,330
Who is this guy?

74
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,300
Why are you yelling?

75
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,340
Let' go!

76
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,540
Chi Yanzhou.

77
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,930
Father!

78
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,740
What are you looking at?

79
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,250
Miss Zhen'er looks nervous.

80
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:13,860
Zhen.

81
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,730
Didn't he recognize me?

82
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,380
Give it your all tonight,

83
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,930
and serve the Young Marshal well.

84
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,010
Don't let him down.

85
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,660
We're going to have a good time tonight.

86
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,490
Zhen,

87
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,540
where should we start?

88
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,940
I heard you girls from the nightclub

89
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,620
need to let the clients inspect you first.

90
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,980
Shall we begin the inspection first?

91
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,090
Wait.

92
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,260
Zhen.

93
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,140
It's my first time.

94
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,460
I'm a little nervous.

95
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,820
Besides,

96
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,060
there are so many people sitting there.

97
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,289
Young Marshal, relax.

98
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,340
Don't let us ruin your mood.

99
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,419
Yes, go on.

100
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,900
Come on, let's drink.

101
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,049
What if I don't mind being watched?

102
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,730
I will do

103
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,400
as you command.

104
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,580
But you spent a lot of money on me.

105
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,650
Don't you want to wait until tonight

106
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,810
when it's just the two of us,

107
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,900
so you could experience it better?

108
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,060
I don't really like being watched.

109
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,660
I'll let you go this time.

110
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,650
I didn't expect that Yanzhou

111
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,410
now suddenly became

112
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,940
the Young Marshal of Jiangbei.

113
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,300
I heard that in the next few years,

114
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,780
Governor Zhou will appoint you to govern
Jiangbei.

115
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,170
By the way,

116
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,290
I heard that the woman who

117
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,900
lied to Young Marshal and got the Governor
killed

118
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,380
has never been found.

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,900
She brought so much trouble to the Chi family,

120
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,050
and caused the death of the Governor.

121
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,660
She led to the downfall of the Chi army.

122
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,650
Making her pay for what she did isn't enough.

123
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,300
I'd rather tear her to pieces.

124
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,300
Right.

125
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,530
Zhen, your hands are so cold.

126
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,940
What are you afraid of?

127
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,050
I...

128
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,500
I've never heard anything like it.

129
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,930
I got scared

130
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,650
when I heard you about all these killings.

131
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,980
Don't be afraid.

132
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,370
Alright, let's not talk about this.

133
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,420
Yanzhou spent a fortune tonight.

134
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,170
You should enjoy it.

135
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,340
Let's drink.

136
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,620
-Come on.
-Come on.

137
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,900
I'm feeling hot.

138
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,900
Take off my clothes

139
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,900
with your mouth.

140
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,580
Man said

141
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,620
Zhen has great oral skills.

142
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,520
Do you want to show us?

143
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,010
What?

144
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,260
You want to look innocent?

145
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,980
I'd like to see what kind of beauty you are.

146
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,410
How dare you disobey the Young Marshal!

147
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,140
Behave.

148
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,020
Don't be impulsive.

149
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,290
I'm just too nervous.

150
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,000
So you're nervous.

151
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,090
I understand.

152
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,220
Take it off.

153
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,220
Go on.

154
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,100
Enough.

155
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,980
Excuse me for a while.

156
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,690
Isn't this Zhen?

157
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,170
Why are you here?

158
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,530
If you don't want to accompany Young Marshal,

159
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,900
you can be with me.

160
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,730
I'm sorry, Young Marshal.

161
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,370
Get lost!

162
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,530
Young Marshal, why did you come out?

163
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,140
Where are you going?

164
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,970
I just want to use the bathroom.

165
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,380
Why did you come out here?

166
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,700
Because I finally caught you.

167
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,100
If I don't keep a closer eye on you,

168
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,860
what if you try to escape again?

169
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,730
Young Marshal can't be away from

170
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,770
Zhen for a moment.

171
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,900
Yes.

172
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,530
This isn't the first time

173
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,140
you've captivated me.

174
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,890
So, you already knew it was me.

175
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,340
Stop pretending.

176
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,860
Five years ago, you tried so hard to get
close to me,

177
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,100
and gave me such a great gift.

178
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,930
How can I forget it?

179
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,930
Jiang Yao.

180
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,130
Long time no see.

181
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,890
Our game

182
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,900
has only just begun.
