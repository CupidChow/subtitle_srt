[Episode 10 Don't reject me]

3
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,150
I haven't asked you after all this time.

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,460
You got lost here.

5
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,180
You're not from Ao City, are you?

6
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,720
We've never traveled far.

7
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,060
We just arrived in Ao City not long ago.

8
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,940
We wanted to explore around,

9
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,840
but I didn't expect to run into bad people.

10
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,039
The external world is in chaos now.

11
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,150
You don't know the city very well.

12
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,890
Next time if you go out,

13
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,340
you should have people accompany you.

14
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,300
That's right.

15
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,180
I said we should find people accompanying us.

16
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,900
It has to be our Young Master.

17
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,060
But she doesn't want to.

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,480
Your crush?

19
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,000
I... I don't know

20
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,460
if he counts.

21
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,300
Tell me about it.

22
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,920
Maybe

23
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,900
I can help clear up your confusion.

24
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,579
My father chose a fiancé for me.

25
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,750
But his heart already belongs to someone
else.

26
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,860
I don't know

27
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,400
if I should listen to my father

28
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,980
and stay by his side,

29
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,610
or I should go against my father's will,

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,680
bringing him and the girl together?

31
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,300
Mr. Du,

32
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,920
what would you do

33
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,210
if you were in my position?

34
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,130
That's it?

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,430
I'm quite familiar with the dilemma.

36
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,610
Some time ago,

37
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,000
my old man

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,870
also chose a girl for me.

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,160
And then?

40
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,920
To deal with that old man,

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,190
we held a fake engagement.

42
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,430
Marriage is such an important matter.

43
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,650
How could it be fake?

44
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,250
They don't care about my preferences at all.

45
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,020
How could they treat marriage

46
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,340
as if it's a child's play?

47
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,740
You have really bold and novel

48
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,940
actions and ideas.

49
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,850
So,

50
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,290
what I'm saying is,

51
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,390
first, you need to be clear

52
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,110
if you like him.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,490
If you do,

54
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,130
you should fight for it.

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,079
If you don't like him,

56
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,180
just let it go.

57
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,430
What matters is

58
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,350
whether I like him or not.

59
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,350
Do I want to marry him?

60
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,880
Of course you do.

61
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,390
He is an excellent man.

62
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,050
How could you not like him?

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,040
You're right.

64
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,570
Who wouldn't like

65
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,579
such an excellent guy?

66
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,450
That's not necessarily true.

67
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,680
If love

68
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,260
means excellence,

69
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,450
then I'll have

70
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,640
no chance of getting out of the house.

71
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,020
Why not?

72
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,360
Because all the girls will go after me.

73
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,540
You are really humorous.

74
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,180
You are obviously narcissistic.

75
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,190
My Lady,

76
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,180
we'll be home soon.

77
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,670
You live nearby?

78
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,990
What a coincidence.

79
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,180
My uncle lives nearby too.

80
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,620
Since you're here,

81
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:41,030
do you want to say hello to your uncle?

82
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,010
No need.

83
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,590
If my uncle knows

84
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,670
I'm still wandering around at this hour,

85
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,970
he'll tell my dad to take me home.

86
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,750
Alright.

87
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,360
I'll leave you two here then.

88
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,990
Thank you for your suggestions.

89
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,960
And thank you for bringing us back.

90
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,640
Bye-bye.

91
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,480
I'm leaving.

92
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,550
Goodbye.

93
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,630
The feudal etiquette is not important.

94
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,260
What matters is

95
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,910
your heart.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,870
My Lady,

97
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,180
it's getting late.

98
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,070
Why are you still thinking about

99
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,950
Mr. Du's random thoughts?

100
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,430
Stop thinking about it.

101
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,390
Let's take a shower,

102
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,900
and go to bed, okay?

103
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
Xiu,

104
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,270
where are we going tomorrow?

105
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,270
Tomorrow?

106
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,770
We almost ran into an accident today.

107
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,610

[Have fun, Jiang Yao]

109
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,280
Yao.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,220
Why do I have

111
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,670
Yao's thing with me?

112
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,730
Could it be...

113
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,220
Miss Zhou

114
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,300
Why did Miss Zhou have

115
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,660
Yaoyao's thing?

116
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,230
[Have fun, Jiang Yao]

117
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,020
Yao is with her.

118
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,260
Miss Zhou and Yao are together.

119

[Have fun, Jiang Yao]

120
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,950
Who is with Yao?

121
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,710
Yao and...

122
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,920
Father.

123
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,160
You said

124
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,240
she was with Yao?

125
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,560
Who is it?

126
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,020
What Yao?

127
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,270
Father.

128
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,780
You're getting old. Listen...

129
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,520
Cut the crap.

130
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,960
Lieutenant Zhang,

131
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,020
follow this lead and keep investigating.

132
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:40,920
Yes, sir.

133
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,590
Father.

134
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,770
You even followed me.

135
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,140
Why do you want to

136
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,460
find Yao so bad?

137
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,710
She only broke off your son's engagement
once.

138
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,630
Is it really necessary to be so petty?

139
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,340
If you keep doing this,

140
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,920
I'll get upset.

141
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,710
You are constantly getting upset.

142
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,020
Son,

143
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,680
but you did a good job this time.

144
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,950
You don't need to be

145
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,410
grounded anymore.

146
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,330
Father!

147
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,810
Smell old man.

148
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,150
That girl is at Chi's Mansion?

149
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,190
Yes, sir.

150
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,960
I don't think

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,320
they knew each other that day.

152
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,270
Governor,

153
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,350
could your brother-in-law be

154
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,560
the one behind this?

155
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,060
I'm worried

156
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,930
that he had already known the truth about

157
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,780
his father, Chi Lingfeng's, death five years ago.

158
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,510
That's why he deliberately went against you?

159
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,730
That's impossible.

160
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,710
Everyone knew that Chi Lingfeng died

161
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,530
because of the Flying Bird Society and the
Japanese.

162
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,300
No matter how smart he is,

163
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,960
he won't be able to associate it with me.

164
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,300
Is it possible...

165
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,850
Is it possible that Jiangbei is also planning

166
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,080
to cooperate with the Japanese?

167
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,010
After all, it's a big fat piece of meat.

168
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,190
If this is really

169
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,260
related to my brother-in-law,

170
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,180
I'll devour him on the spot.

171
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,370
Devour him!

172
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,630
Kill him!

173
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,040
Let's go.

174
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,000
Where would Chi Yanzhou hide the letter?

175
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,130
Will he carry it with him?

176
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,000
Under this circumstances,

177
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,880
it's really difficult to get close to him.

178
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,140
Jiang Yao,

179
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,410
what are you waiting for?

180
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,530
Come on in.

181
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,170
By the way,

182
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,220
I haven't had time to thank you.

183
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,590
What is it?

184
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,600
It's really hard to get Su's Sweet.

185
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,670
I happened to pass by that day.

186
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,160
There was no one in the queue.

187
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,400
It's just out of convenience.

188
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,090
Please don't buy it again.

189
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,030
Miss Zhou won't be pleased if she finds out.

190
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,930
She won't.

191
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,490
Isn't she

192
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,530
your fiancée?

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,480
We've never been engaged.

194
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,270
My godfather,

195
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,440
her father

196
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,540
wanted to us to get married.

197
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,400
But I never consented to it.

198
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,880
Enough.

199
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,170
In winter,

200
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,910
it's better not to water too much.

201
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,290
You are quite persistent.

202
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,260
You've always loved this flower.

203
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,750
You never changed your preferences,

204
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,230
even to this day.

205
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,440
Some things,

206
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,980
once you fall in love with them,

207
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,460
are unforgettable.

208
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,400
How can it be changed so easily?

209
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,000
What about the ring,

210
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,580
the love token?

211
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,610
You were being so persistent.

212
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,220
Is it because your love with him

213
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,380
was unforgettable?

214
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,560
Why aren't you answering me?

215
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,720
It's all in the past.

216
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,240
There's no point in talking about it now.

217
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,220
Don't

218
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,360
turn me down.

219
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,520
♫Falling leaves everywhere means the clock going counterclockwise♫

220
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,820
♫A pure white flower slipped into the neckline♫

221
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,630
♫To let it go, to own it, or to laugh it off♫

222
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,050
♫I never understood the answer in your eyes♫

223
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,910
Chi Yanzhou,

224
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,300
what's the matter?

225
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,280
♫You left softly and I followed hard♫

226
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,380
Forget about what happened at the snowfield.

227
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:01,720
♫Stepping on your shadow, imagining your body temperature♫

228
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,090
♫It's not that I can't see the chance♫

229
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,260
♫It's your tears♫

230
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,970
♫Blame it on my obsession, not knowing how to quit♫

231
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,960
♫I'm thinking of you in all kinds of ways♫

232
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,120
♫Drop on your shoulder and follow♫

233
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,450
♫It's time to freeze all my mistakes♫

234
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,170
Go get changed.

235
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,470
It's all wet.

236
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,170
Will he hide the letter in his clothes?

237
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,740
[To Yamai Taichi]

238
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,050
It's Du Jianshan.

239
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,120
[From Du Jianshan]

240
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,360
Not him.

241
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,090
Are you disappointed to find out

242
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,690
that I didn't collude with the Japanese?

243
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,800
I...

244
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,070
What?

245
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,500
You're trying to tell me

246
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,340
you've been trying so hard to approach me

247
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,140
just for this letter.

248
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,740
You pretended to care about me

249
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,650
with Yumian's soup.

250
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,320
And this ring.

251
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,120
Why is it here?

252
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,790
From the beginning, you

253
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,300
were desperately looking for it in the snow.

254
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,150
Is it just a show for me?
