Miss Zhou,

5
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,479
I didn't think you were coming.

6
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,520
Sorry.

7
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,940
My dad fell sick yesterday.

8
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,430
How's your injury?

9
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,380
Are you feeling better?

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,789
Aunt Lu's medicine really worked.

The pain stopped the next day

12
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,340
after I applied it.

00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,460
That's good.

14
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
This restaurant

00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,860
looks really elegant and serene.

16
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,220
But once you step outside this door,

the streets are filled with

homeless and starving people.

19
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,810
It feels like two completely different worlds.

20
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,710
It's so ironic.

21
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,340
Why are you looking at me like that?

22
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,880
Nothing.

23

We worked with the Japanese because...

192
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,900
When she agreed to the Flying Bird Society's
request to kill me,

193
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,420
she had already condemned me and passed
sentence.

194
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,650
It is pointless talking about it.

195
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,510
Chi Yanzhou.

196
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,080
Is there anything else, Miss Jiang?

197
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,410
I almost forgot,

198
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,420
I have something to return to you.

199
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,350
This

200
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,780
was yours in the first place.

201
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,800
I don't want it anymore.

202
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,170
Here's your ring back.

203
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,870
Chi, help me!

204
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,290
I don't want to die yet.

205
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's split up.

206
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,610
They got away again.

207
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,960
They didn't come after us.

208
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:58,450
♫The distance between us, with indifferent tones♫

209
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,750
♫Turns out we've already reached the conclusion♫

210
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:11,210
♫Since we met, separation was already destined♫

211
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,490
♫Hate is the mark of love♫

212
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,160
♫I repeatedly drown in it, how can I completely withdraw?♫

213
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,980
♫Listening to the rain, drop by drop, thinking of you♫

214
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,000
♫Missing piles up, drowning your voice♫

215
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,960
♫Too many memories, slipping through my fingers♫

216
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,590
♫Can't hold onto you♫

217
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,050
♫Listening to the rain, pitter-pattering like teardrops♫

218
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,570
♫People surge, but love never calms♫

219
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:53,550
♫Regret losing you, also losing myself♫
