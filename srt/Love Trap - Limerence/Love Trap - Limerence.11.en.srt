[Episode 11: Don't ever lose it again]

3
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,850
And this ring.

4
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,500
Why is it here?

5
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,210
From the beginning...

6
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,770
when you were desperately searching for it in the snow...

7
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,450
was that all just an act you put on for me?

8
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:55,860
Jiang Yao.

9
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,660
Using the same old trick again.

10
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,670
Does it make you feel accomplished?

11
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,440
You won't believe me,

12
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,010
no matter what I say now, right?

13
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,580
I want to believe you.

14
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,610
But tell me,

15
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,690
how can I trust

16
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,320
a con artist who lied to me?

17
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,020
I know it's useless no matter how I explain it.

18
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,730
But this time,

19
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,040
I never thought of hurting you again.

20
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,100
Fine.

21
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,950
Let me ask you.

22
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,850
If today you found out

23
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,829
that I truly colluded with the Japanese...

24
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,990
would you let me go?

25
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,210
Get lost.

26
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,220
Chi, bad news!

27
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,470
Well,

28
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,930
Du Jianshan came here for her

29
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,340
and surrounded the mansion.

30
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,620
Chi Yanzhou!

31
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,329
Come out and see me!

32
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,410
Take her away.

33
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,110
What about you?

34
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,280
It's none of your business.

35
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,360
I know you Jiangbei men are all mighty fighters.

36
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,990
But right now, you're outnumbered,

37
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,640
and this is Du Jianshan's territory.

38
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,140
Aren't you just throwing stones at a hornet's nest?

39
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,580
There will be another way.

40
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,500
Let's go.

41
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,800
Mr. Ji,

42
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,310
I'd like you to do me a favor.

43
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,640
Are you sure you want to do this?

44
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,940
Okay.

45
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,590
I'll go downstairs first.

46
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,220
What do you want?

47
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,490
Why hasn't he come down to see me yet?

48
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,480
Governor, I went upstairs and checked.

49
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,830
Chi is busy right now,

50
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,909
and it's inconvenient for him to meet you.

51
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,020
Busy?

52
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,770
I'd like to see how busy he really is.

53
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,740
Desperate times

54
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,420
call for desperate measures.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,970
Young Marshal, please

56
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,340
cooperate with me.

57
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,760
Jiang Yao.

58
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,230
You really will do anything

59
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,620
to achieve your goals.

60
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,070
Since that's the case,

61
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,890
I must cooperate with you well.

62
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,050
Governor,

63
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,260
Jiang Yao is your future daughter-in-law.

64
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,450
How could she be here?

65
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,950
-You must have found the wrong place.
-Get lost!

66
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,340
Since he's so busy,

67
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,930
I'll see for myself what big matters he's handling

68
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,010
-Governor!
-so he doesn't have time to see me!

69
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,060
G-Governor!

70
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,560
Brother-in-law, why are you here?

71
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,350
Uncle Du.

72
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,530
Put on your clothes, both of you.

73
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,550
And come downstairs.

74
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,650
Your acting is a little too convincing.

75
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,910
I forgot to tell you.

76
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,720
There is a secret passage in the mansion.

77
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,890
It can let you out.

78
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,770
It's enough to deal with Du Jianshan.

79
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,760
That's what Chi meant earlier.

80
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,140
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

81
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,890
Jiang Yao.

82
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,320
You claimed that you broke off the engagement

83
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,100
because you loved Wenlan too much.

84
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,340
But secretly, you're messing around

85
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,409
with Wenlan's uncle.

86
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,300
You guys...

87
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,690
really don't take me seriously, do you?

88
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,940
Brother-in-law.

89
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,630
I forced her...

90
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,940
to break off the engagement.

91
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,370
It has nothing to do with her.

92
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,680
It has nothing to do with her again?

93
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,890
That silly Wenlan helped her.

94
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,270
You're helping her too?

95
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,530
Alright, then.

96
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,990
Brother-in-law, what do you mean?

97
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,360
You lead troops too.

98
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,750
What matters most in the military

99
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,210
are loyalty and rules.

100
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,700
You've broken the loyalty and the rules.

101
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,400
In my unit...

102
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,310
Be punished with three shots!

103
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,420
But today,

104
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,920
I'll reduce it to one shot.

105
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,570
But it must be:

106
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,330
either you...

107
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,290
shoot her,

108
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,090
or she

109
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,330
shoots you.

110
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,490
Otherwise,

111
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,340
don't blame me

112
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,890
for being rude!

113
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,059
Brother-in-law, your eye for women

114
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,640
isn't that great.

115
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,250
You defend her at every turn,

116
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,230
but she wants to kill you.

117
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,580
Are you sure

118
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,539
she really loves you?

119
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,480
Jiang Yao?

120
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,100
Jiang Yao!

121
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,560
Ji Nan!

122
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,990
I-I'll get the medicine.

123
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,740
Alright.

124
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,580
For the sake of your sister,

125
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,330
I'll let it slide today.

126
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,010
Remember,

127
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,780
don't ever call me

128
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,730
"brother-in-law" again.

129
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,920
Wenlan

130
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,570
has no uncle like you anymore.

131
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,060
Let's go.

132
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,590
Take care, Governor.

133
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,380
Governor, do you really believe

134
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,890
those two have that kind of relationship?

135
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,260
From the looks in their eyes just now,

136
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,710
it didn't seem like they were faking it.

137
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,400
So, that shot earlier,

138
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,750
you were just testing them?

139
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,040
By the way,

140
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,470
should we hide this from the Young Master?

141
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,270
He's been looking for Jiang Yao lately.

142
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,850
Don't tell that silly boy.

143
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,210
It would only break his heart.

144
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,930
Yes, sir.

145
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,820
Let's go.

146
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,580
It's done.

147
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,040
Don't worry, Chi.

148
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:44,950
It's not serious.

149
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,810
But that was really close.

150
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,130
If the bullet had been a little closer

151
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,210
and struck the aorta,

152
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,270
even a god couldn't have saved her.

153
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,310
Get out.

154
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Du Jianshan won't suspect us anymore.

155
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,780
If there's nothing else,

156
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,780
I'll leave now.

157
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,540
Your thoughts

158
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,660
are still as inscrutable as ever.

159
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,630
After all this time, I still can't figure out

160
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,850
why you did that just now.

161
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,060
You could have died.

162
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,930
That's still better than you going to die.

163
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,270
Are you afraid that something might happen to me?

164
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,090
Of course.

165
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,880
I owe you this.

166
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,070
So, you're just making up to me.

167
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
What about the ring?

168
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,940
Was it really all part of a well-thought-out plan...

169
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,790
or have you actually

170
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,580
kept it with you all these years?

171
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,180
Think carefully before you answer.

172
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,700
I want the truth.

173
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,210
In fact, for the past five years,

174
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,250
I've always...

175
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,520
always kept it with me

176
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,440
and never taken it off.

177
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,560
I wanted to find it.

178
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,690
I really wanted to find it.

179
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,670
But it's not that easy to get back

180
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,260
what you've lost.

181
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,910
♫Was our meeting a test of fate?♫

182
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,680
♫At least I felt your tender affection♫

183
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,720
♫Longing wells up in my heart♫

184
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,120
♫Farewells are often scenes of sorrow♫

185
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,680
♫Yet I'm grateful we once shared a past♫

186
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,630
I don't care whether you're acting

187
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,480
♫Even if it was just for a fleeting moment♫

188
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,300
or how much

189
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,810
♫I often yearn for those fragments of memories♫

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,290
truth or lies

191
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,510
are in your words.

192
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,680
From now on,

193
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:03,670
♫These unforgettable scenes form the most beautiful arc of my life♫

194
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,080
you must always wear this...

195
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,200
and never lose it again.

196
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,800
♫My world was once a barren wasteland♫

197
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,080
Jiang Yao.

198
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,080
♫Until the moment you appeared♫

199
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,700
I'm willing to take another gamble.

200
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,060
♫From then on, everything became radiant and new♫
