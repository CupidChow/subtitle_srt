=The Journey of Chongzi=
(Adapted from "The Journey of Chongzi" by Shu Ke)

27
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:38,974
=Episode 10=

28
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:43,214
I didn't expect
there happened so many things

29
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,174
after we separated in Qinghua Palace.

30
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:50,693
If what Sima Miaoyuan said is true,

31
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,093
at least Wan Jie

32
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:54,214
didn't want to hurt Chong Zi.

33
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:55,614
Besides,

34
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:57,534
no matter how cruel Wan Jie is,

35
00:01:57,653 --> 00:01:59,294
he won't hurt Chong Zi

36
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,093
for the sake of
the old friendship with you.

37
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:02,614
Chong is different.

38
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:04,934
By the way,

39
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:06,934
you've travelled
to many places for years,

40
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:08,974
so do you have any idea
that we haven't thought of

41
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:10,894
to break through the shields
on the Land of Tribulations?

42
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,573
Even the Earthshock Spell couldn't work.

43
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:15,534
It seems

44
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:17,694
normal magical skills can't work.

45
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:22,213
However, the Land of Tribulations
is next to the Monster World,

46
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,334
so we can use the Monster World's power.

47
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:26,293
Tell me about that.

48
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:29,653
There used to be a kind of vine flute

49
00:02:29,814 --> 00:02:31,694
that could be used to
summon the monster Qinyuan.

50
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:33,614
Although they are small,

51
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,694
they appear by thousands.

52
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:38,414
Wherever they go,
animals and plants will die.

53
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:40,334
Do you mean we can use Qinyuan's power

54
00:02:40,573 --> 00:02:41,894
to break through the shields?

55
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:44,093
They only obey

56
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:45,694
the sound of the vine flute.

57
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,093
However,

58
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:50,933
the vines used to make the flute
grow in Buzhou Mountain,

59
00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:53,013
and I'm afraid it's hard to get them.

60
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:55,213
I'll go to get them.

61
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:03,254
(Go to Qingchang Mountain to join us.
Wan Jie is there.)

62
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:06,414
Is it a message from Mr. Min?

63
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,774
Wan Jie has appeared.

64
00:03:07,894 --> 00:03:09,013
I have to go to him.

65
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:10,573
Go now.

66
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:12,573
I'll help you to get the vines

67
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:14,614
in case they will be used.

68
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:21,733
Thank you, Miss Zhuo.

69
00:03:39,573 --> 00:03:40,453
I've never seen Sage Chonghua

70
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,373
salute to others,

71
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:44,853
and he actually did that
to you for Chong Zi.

72
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:48,213
He really dotes on her.

73
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:07,414
Master,

74
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:09,293
are you sad?

75
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,293
I've never owned him,

76
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:14,013
so how could I be sad?

77
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,213
I'm afraid the one who will be sad

78
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:20,534
is that kid.

79
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,053
Ting Xue,

80
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,414
let's set off

81
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:29,933
for Buzhou Mountain.

82
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:33,974
(Perfect Cuisine)

83
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:34,933
Sirs, madam,

84
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:36,454
the strong alcohol you drank before

85
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:37,493
was spicy,

86
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:38,893
and I think you must be thirsty

87
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:40,454
after the feast,

88
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:42,493
so how about trying
the Osmanthus Wine we newly created?

89
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:43,974
It's sweet and intoxicating.

90
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:45,294
Let's have a pot of it.

91
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:46,493
Okay.

92
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:47,574
Here is the money.

93
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:49,534
Thank you, sir.

94
00:04:49,653 --> 00:04:51,613
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Let's drink.

95
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:55,933
Boss.

96
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,173
Miss Chong Zi,

97
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:03,093
you've drummed up
much business in just one day,

98
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:05,014
and you're like a living advertisement.

99
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:07,173
I really want you

100
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:08,653
to stay here for years,

101
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:10,414
not to mention three days.

102
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:11,653
No.

103
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:13,773
My master is waiting for me
in the mountain.

104
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:17,134
(If I hadn't promised Mr. Wan)

105
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:18,613
(that I would wait for him
for three days,)

106
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,173
(I wouldn't have stayed here.)

107
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,734
Is he dead?

108
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:24,773
Don't talk nonsense.

109
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:26,294
Leave. How could we run the restaurant

110
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:27,854
(Xichun Restaurant)
when you're lying at our gate?

111
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,414
You're...

112
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:31,613
How are you?

113
00:05:31,653 --> 00:05:32,414
What's wrong?

114
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:33,373
- Boss, look.
- Are you okay?

115
00:05:33,454 --> 00:05:35,454
How could we run the restaurant
when he's lying at our gate?

116
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:40,134
Is he poisoned?

117
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,333
He needs to be checked by a physician.

118
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,134
It's...

119
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:52,493
Don't touch me.

120
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:55,294
I'm poisoned by the Golden
Silkworm Poison from the Demon World.

121
00:05:56,414 --> 00:05:57,653
It's incurable.

122
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:00,294
Just give me some water.

123
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:02,294
I'll leave after resting.

124
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:07,254
Wait.

125
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,613
I knew a medicine immortal from Nanhua Sect,

126
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:11,213
and she's taught me some prescriptions.

127
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:11,893
Boss,

128
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,814
help me to get
the Vaccaria Segetalis Seeds of 6 grams

129
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:15,974
and 7 seeds of Plantago Asiatica L.

130
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:17,134
Powder them

131
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:18,534
and stew them with the toad oil.

132
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:20,974
I know
the Plantago Asiatica L is diuretic,

133
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,454
but the toad oil...

134
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:23,613
It's normal for you to not know that.

135
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:24,694
If you don't have that,

136
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:26,053
help me to catch two toads.

137
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:26,734
Toads?

138
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:27,574
Okay.

139
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:28,974
Let's go.

140
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:30,974
How are you now?

141
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:32,454
Can you move?

142
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:34,493
I'll help you get in the room.

143
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:45,933
How do you feel now?

144
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:47,694
Your chest doesn't hurt, right?

145
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,053
And you even feel hungry, don't you?

146
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:57,814
Are you an immortal lady?

147
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,694
How do you know that?

148
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:04,333
I'm Hai Sheng, a Taoist cultivator.

149
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,173
Although my spiritual power
isn't strong,

150
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:07,093
and I haven't joined

151
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:08,734
any sect,

152
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:10,574
I can tell

153
00:07:10,854 --> 00:07:12,574
you have spiritual power.

154
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:14,574
Since you saved me,

155
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,093
I should thank you for that

156
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:18,373
Sit down.

157
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:22,694
In fact,

158
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,414
no one here knows my true identity.

159
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:25,534
I am Chong Zi from Nanhua Sect,

160
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,653
and it's my duty to
help people in distress.

161
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:32,014
Thank you, Chong Zi.

162
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:33,534
Chong Zi?

163
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,053
Call me Miss Chong Zi.

164
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:37,493
Right.

165
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:39,854
Thank you, Miss Chong Zi.

166
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,173
You're a generous girl,

167
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:42,734
so please forgive me.

168
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:48,773
Miss Chong Zi.

169
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:56,213
You're detoxified,

170
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:58,213
so what do you plan to do?

171
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:00,893
I'm not talented,

172
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:03,014
so I can't join
an immortal sect like you.

173
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,134
But I want to be like you,

174
00:08:05,454 --> 00:08:07,694
punishing the evil and protecting
the weak around the world.

175
00:08:07,974 --> 00:08:09,534
Even if I can't be an immortal,

176
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:11,613
I can be a chivalrous man,
defending justice and helping people.

177
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:13,613
It isn't easy to be a chivalrous man.

178
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:16,694
You saved my life,

179
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:17,814
so I must build my career

180
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:19,134
to pay you back.

181
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:21,694
In that case, I can hang your portrait

182
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:23,093
in the main hall of my house.

183
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:24,534
You don't need to do that.

184
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:27,134
My master is Luo Yinfan,
a sage from Nanhua Sect.

185
00:08:27,254 --> 00:08:29,294
If you found a sect one day,

186
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,694
you can hang his portrait.

187
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,534
Worshiping him
is the same as worshiping me.

188
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:34,173
The sage from Nanhua Sect,

189
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:35,493
Luo Yinfan.

190
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:38,733
Okay, I remembered.

191
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:45,733
I promise to remember

192
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:47,334
the sage's and your help in mind.

193
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,293
I'm going to leave.

194
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:51,373
Hope to see you again.

195
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:52,973
See you.

196
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:57,293
Miss Chong Zi,
you can stop sending me off now.

197
00:08:58,014 --> 00:08:59,214
Goodbye.

198
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:00,814
Take care of yourself.

199
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:10,053
It has only been two days.

200
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:11,533
When can I return to

201
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:12,454
my master?

202
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:13,613
I heard that every immortal sect

203
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:15,094
rushes to Qingchang Mountain,

204
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,973
and even Sage Chonghua goes there.

205
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:20,173
I'm afraid it's not
easy to deal with Wan Jie.

206
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:21,613
He is very cunning.

207
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,373
He has hurt the disciples
of our immortal sect for many times

208
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:24,814
and broken through formations to escape.

209
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:26,694
Sirs, the steamed
stuffed buns are ready.

210
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,613
Here is the money.

211
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:29,853
Goodbye.

212
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:31,694
(Mr. Wan hasn't recovered
from his old disease,)

213
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:33,454
(so if he is trapped and caught,)

214
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:35,814
(doesn't it mean I have to
keep waiting for him here?)

215
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:37,654
(Why don't I go to
Qingchang Mountain as well?)

216
00:09:37,814 --> 00:09:39,134
(In that case, I can help
Master to send letters)

217
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:40,574
(and meet Uncle Wan Jie.)

218
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:42,254
(It won't break my vow.)

219
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:43,413
Where are you going?

220
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:44,933
Didn't we agree that
you would stay for three days?

221
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:46,694
I have something to deal with. I...

222
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:54,014
Boss,

223
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,894
I want a pot of the Osmanthus Wine.

224
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:58,053
Sorry, sir. It's sold out.

225
00:09:58,214 --> 00:09:59,853
How about the Nverhong Wine?

226
00:10:00,454 --> 00:10:02,134
Boss, give him the pot of
the Osmanthus Wine I asked you

227
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:03,134
to keep.

228
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:05,053
Thank you.

229
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,053
- Pay back the money.
- Pay back the money.

230
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:17,254
Stop.

231
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:18,733
What are you doing?

232
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:21,173
Who are you?

233
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:22,173
- Yes.
- She's pretty.

234
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,173
Mind your own business.

235
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:26,293
Let me tell you

236
00:10:26,373 --> 00:10:28,814
that this beggar owes us money.

237
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:29,733
What?

238
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:30,894
Do you want to pay for him?

239
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:32,853
Do you?

240
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:35,894
I'll pay

241
00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:37,413
for him.

242
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:38,814
Who are you?

243
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:40,493
Where do you come from?

244
00:10:41,814 --> 00:10:43,254
Leave now. Do you hear me?

245
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,413
Otherwise, we'll hit you.

246
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:46,613
Leave.

247
00:10:54,173 --> 00:10:54,774
It's mine.

248
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:55,853
Stop fighting. It's mine.

249
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:57,014
- I'll take it.
- It's mine.

250
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:57,853
Go back.

251
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:01,254
It's you.

252
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:02,814
I've paid the money for my wine.

253
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:04,173
You'd better use magical skills

254
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:05,774
less here.

255
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:42,493
Why do you always follow me?

256
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:44,533
I can take you to see your master.

257
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:45,853
I don't know you,

258
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,173
so how could I believe you?

259
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:50,933
Regard me as a kind man.

260
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:54,173
Although we've never met before,

261
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,973
I'm sure we'll
meet frequently in the future.

262
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:03,094
You helped me before,

263
00:12:03,454 --> 00:12:04,613
and I happen

264
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:06,933
to be a grateful man.

265
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,053
Do you know how

266
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:10,814
to go to Qingchang Mountain?

267
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:16,214
I can take you there.

268
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:18,973
Thank you.

269
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:33,373
What evil skill is it?

270
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:35,733
You are from the Demon World.

271
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,373
I can't go with you.

272
00:12:38,814 --> 00:12:40,533
Even if I'm from
the Demon World, so what?

273
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:43,334
If I wanted to hurt you,

274
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,413
I would have kidnapped you

275
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:47,574
instead of wasting time here.

276
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,293
But I heard people
from the Demon World are...

277
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:50,933
Barbarous and ruthless?

278
00:12:51,214 --> 00:12:52,613
They always do evil things?

279
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:55,814
The Demon World has Demon Kings

280
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:57,533
while the Immortal World has sages.

281
00:12:57,853 --> 00:12:59,334
Since there exist demons and immortals,

282
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:01,574
one party must be good
while the other must be evil.

283
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:03,574
But who can classify people

284
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,134
as good and evil?

285
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:07,053
And how to classify that?

286
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:09,894
I just want to help you,

287
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:11,973
but you have doubt on me.

288
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:13,373
It means I'm the good one

289
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:15,134
while you're the evil one.

290
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,814
It's said

291
00:13:18,254 --> 00:13:21,053
the Demon World is full of bad people

292
00:13:21,454 --> 00:13:23,053
who kill the innocent,

293
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:28,053
but as a kind man,

294
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:30,493
why do I have to be disgusted by you

295
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:32,814
just because I'm a demon?

296
00:13:33,853 --> 00:13:35,173
You're right.

297
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:36,574
You're just like me.

298
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:38,293
I've never thought about hurting people,

299
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:40,454
but the Immortal World
is on guard against me

300
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,373
just because
I was born with evil breath.

301
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:44,774
However, Wan Jie the Demon King

302
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:46,814
treats me well.

303
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:52,254
No.

304
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:54,134
Your ring's power is too strong.

305
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:55,613
What if I'm sucked into it again

306
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,533
if I go with you?

307
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:01,733
How about

308
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:03,533
you swear by your leader's name

309
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:05,134
that you'll never
use this stuff to hurt me?

310
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:06,894
Since you're from the Demon World,

311
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,574
you can't deceive your leader,

312
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:09,613
can you?

313
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:12,613
Okay.

314
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:15,094
I swear by the Demon God's name

315
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:16,933
that I will never hurt you.

316
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:32,094
Qingchang Mountain is ahead.

317
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:35,814
I can see Master soon.

318
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:06,774
Who did this?

319
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:08,894
Why were so many people killed?

320
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:14,014
Watch out.

321
00:15:53,973 --> 00:15:55,293
Are you okay?

322
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:56,413
Yes.

323
00:15:57,094 --> 00:15:58,493
Aren't you from the Demon World?

324
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:00,493
Why are you inferior to me?

325
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:03,053
I'm just a nobody,

326
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:04,613
so how could I match them?

327
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:05,733
Go and check

328
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:07,574
if any of our peers is alive.

329
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:11,214
It's Miaoyuan.

330
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:12,814
Leave.

331
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:15,254
(He sneaked away so fast.)

332
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:27,334
Senior Mu, I'm here.

333
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:28,733
Chong Zi?

334
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:32,173
Senior Mu.

335
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:33,214
Chong Zi,

336
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:34,493
why are you here?

337
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,134
Are you injured?

338
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:37,254
No.

339
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:39,334
Where is Wan Jie?

340
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:42,254
He didn't hurt you, did he?

341
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,413
Do you know how much Supervisor Sage

342
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:47,014
has worried about you during these days?

343
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:49,014
Other peers are the same as him.

344
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:50,774
Qin Ke even gave up studying

345
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:52,454
because of you.

346
00:16:55,454 --> 00:16:56,894
Everyone has contributed.

347
00:16:57,654 --> 00:16:58,654
I am Chong Zi,

348
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:00,814
so how could I get hurt easily?

349
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,094
By the way, where is my master?

350
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:04,733
Isn't he here?

351
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:11,494
Why is there

352
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:13,293
full of corpses of disciples
from Nanhua Sect?

353
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:16,614
What happened exactly?

354
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:24,253
Master,

355
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:26,214
they were killed by the demons,

356
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:27,773
just like the peers we saw just now.

357
00:17:30,454 --> 00:17:31,653
Demons?

358
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:39,814
You couldn't help killing them, right?

359
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:43,253
It's you. You've lurked
in Nanhua Sect for many years

360
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:44,614
and coveted the Tianmo Token.

361
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:47,614
You gathered the demons to hurt
the disciples from Nanhua Sect.

362
00:17:47,773 --> 00:17:49,494
It wasn't me.

363
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,094
Sir, Chong Zi wouldn't kill our peers.

364
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,374
Many people died tragically here,

365
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,094
it couldn't be done by Chong Zi alone.

366
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:07,893
But she's close to the demons,

367
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:09,293
and Wan Jie treats her well,

368
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:10,933
so even if it wasn't her,

369
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:12,053
she couldn't run away from that.

370
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,053
Miaoyuan is right.

371
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:20,933
Did you gang up with him secretly

372
00:18:21,053 --> 00:18:22,694
and help him to kill your peers

373
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,734
before breaking through
the formation to escape?

374
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:25,933
- No.
- Tell me!

375
00:18:26,334 --> 00:18:28,013
Wan Jie isn't that kind of person.

376
00:18:28,094 --> 00:18:30,173
My god. You are even disputing.

377
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:32,893
I'll help Nanhua Sect
to clear the traitor out.

378
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:34,133
Please think about it twice, sir.

379
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:35,413
Sir!

380
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:43,694
Immortal Killing Seal.

381
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:53,133
(Although I hate Chong Zi,)

382
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:54,653
(she's my peer.)

383
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:56,974
(It's very cruel for her to suffer it.)

384
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:02,053
Councilor Sage, Chong Zi doesn't
have a high cultivation,

385
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:03,293
so she couldn't bear that.

386
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:05,533
I'm willing to bear
the punishment for her.

387
00:19:07,293 --> 00:19:08,094
Cast the formation.

388
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,173
Do you really want to kill her?

389
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:34,653
She ganged up with the demons
and killed her peers.

390
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,574
Either crime she committed
is enough for her to die.

391
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:39,974
Do Nanhua Sect's rules mean nothing

392
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:42,574
in your eyes?

393
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:47,094
They are set by people.

394
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:48,893
When people die,

395
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:51,094
they are useless.

396
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:52,133
You...

397
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:13,974
We hurt you by mistake.
Please punish us, sir.

398
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:16,253
You killed so many immortals,

399
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:18,173
so it's unavoidable
for you to be irrational.

400
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:19,574
Never mind.

401
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,814
But you acted well just now.

402
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,094
If you hadn't hurt me,

403
00:20:25,653 --> 00:20:27,494
she wouldn't have trusted me that much.

404
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:05,334
Master,

405
00:21:05,854 --> 00:21:07,533
many people and my peers

406
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:09,173
died there.

407
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,334
You must save them.

408
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:13,574
I know.

409
00:21:14,094 --> 00:21:16,413
I almost died.

410
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:19,814
I don't want to die.
I only want to see you.

411
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,293
I know it has nothing to do with you.

412
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:24,694
I've always been obeying you

413
00:21:24,814 --> 00:21:26,773
and never hurt anyone.

414
00:21:30,214 --> 00:21:31,334
Senior Mu.

415
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:36,773
My master ordered me to visit Chong Zi.

416
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:38,413
He asked her to meet him

417
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:39,974
after she recovers.

418
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:45,574
How are you now? Do you feel better?

419
00:21:47,814 --> 00:21:50,214
I get better very fast
since my master is here.

420
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:53,653
You need to take time to get recovered.

421
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:56,494
Sometimes it's not good
for you to recover so soon.

422
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:00,814
I suddenly think

423
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:03,653
I need to rest for more days.

424
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,173
Since that,

425
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:10,173
I won't disturb you from resting.

426
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:13,494
I'm leaving.

427
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:22,293
Thank you, Senior Mu.

428
00:22:23,494 --> 00:22:24,933
You're a troublemaker.

429
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:26,454
Wherever you go,

430
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:28,214
you will cause trouble.

431
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:30,574
Master,

432
00:22:30,814 --> 00:22:32,413
could my inborn evil breath

433
00:22:32,614 --> 00:22:34,454
bring me bad luck?

434
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:35,933
Why am I

435
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:37,694
always in trouble?

436
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:50,388
(Wish Guests Come Here Endlessly)

437
00:23:21,454 --> 00:23:23,214
Tell me the truth.

438
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,053
Weren't you kidnapped by Wan Jie?

439
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:28,334
How did you manage to escape?

440
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,533
He...

441
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:32,293
He took me out.

442
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:34,533
Wan Jie indeed treated you specially.

443
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,293
Did you collude with him

444
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:37,734
and bring him here?

445
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:40,214
No, he didn't come here with me.

446
00:23:40,574 --> 00:23:41,933
Judging from your cultivation,

447
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,173
I don't think you could
arrive at Qingchang Mountain

448
00:23:44,253 --> 00:23:46,734
without him.

449
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:50,814
I indeed didn't come here alone.

450
00:23:52,494 --> 00:23:53,694
I met a demon

451
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:55,293
on the way here

452
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:57,653
and he disappeared
after bringing me here.

453
00:23:57,814 --> 00:23:58,133
I...

454
00:23:58,214 --> 00:23:59,133
Demon.

455
00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:01,053
Another demon?

456
00:24:02,293 --> 00:24:04,454
I'm sure you colluded with the demons.

457
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:06,053
But he's a good person.

458
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:08,094
We just came across,

459
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:09,933
and he helped me.

460
00:24:09,974 --> 00:24:12,814
- You...
- You said my disciple colluded with demons.

461
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:15,574
And I think you'd better
say it's I that do so, sir.

462
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,133
It's just your groundless accusation.

463
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:20,734
I think you're holding her accountable.

464
00:24:21,374 --> 00:24:23,854
I'm afraid she can't bear that,

465
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:27,013
so let's wait until she returns
to Nanhua Sect and recovers.

466
00:24:27,374 --> 00:24:29,013
Yinfan, you...

467
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:30,533
You...

468
00:24:34,694 --> 00:24:36,253
Fine.

469
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:40,454
I'll let you protect her
for the time being.

470
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:42,293
After she recovers,

471
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:44,933
she has to go to
the Immortal Prison with me.

472
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:48,734
Let's go back to Zizhu Peak.

473
00:24:53,614 --> 00:24:55,734
Someone threatened you with Miss Gong,

474
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:57,933
so you could only be obedient, right?

475
00:24:58,173 --> 00:25:00,293
I'll be right here waiting for you,
not going anywhere.

476
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:01,893
I'll be back in three days at most.

477
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,173
(Oh, no. I am too happy)

478
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:05,653
and I forgot about Uncle Wan.)

479
00:25:09,614 --> 00:25:10,933
(If I leave,)

480
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,413
(he and Miss Gong will be in danger.)

481
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:18,454
Chong,

482
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:21,013
let's go back to Zizhu Peak first.

483
00:25:21,413 --> 00:25:22,253
(No.)

484
00:25:22,614 --> 00:25:24,653
(I can't abandon my benefactor.)

485
00:25:28,253 --> 00:25:29,413
Chong?

486
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:33,653
Sorry, Master.

487
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:37,214
Please give me more days.

488
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:41,334
I made an agreement with Wan Jie,

489
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,214
so I can't leave without informing him.

490
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,133
What?

491
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,974
You made an agreement with Wan Jie?

492
00:25:48,374 --> 00:25:49,614
What is it?

493
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:50,974
Do you want to

494
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:54,974
betray your master
and join the Demon World?

495
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:59,533
Chong, don't act willfully.

496
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:02,013
You were kidnapped by Wan Jie before
and hung between life and death.

497
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:03,773
It was not easy for you to escape,

498
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:05,173
but you actually want to
go back to him now?

499
00:26:05,293 --> 00:26:07,253
But Uncle Wan saved me.

500
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:08,893
Master, haven't you said

501
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:10,773
we must keep our word?

502
00:26:10,893 --> 00:26:13,413
I promised to
wait for him for three days,

503
00:26:13,494 --> 00:26:15,133
so please give me one more day.

504
00:26:15,214 --> 00:26:16,094
Only one.

505
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:19,173
Uncle Wan? You're already so close.

506
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:22,454
Wan Jie has the Ni Lun's Sword,

507
00:26:22,574 --> 00:26:24,614
so no one can threaten him.

508
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,734
I think

509
00:26:26,893 --> 00:26:28,854
you're bewitched by him

510
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:30,974
and couldn't tell right from wrong.

511
00:26:33,454 --> 00:26:34,893
You only consider his difficulty

512
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,413
without thinking that
I've gone everywhere

513
00:26:36,454 --> 00:26:37,053
in order to find you

514
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:39,413
during these days.

515
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:41,214
I've been grateful to you

516
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:43,133
at every second,

517
00:26:43,293 --> 00:26:44,854
but Wan Jie protected me at all costs

518
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:46,614
so that I am unharmed now.

519
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,053
He isn't as bad

520
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:48,933
as rumored.

521
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:51,293
How ridiculous!
Wan Jie is the Demon King.

522
00:26:51,413 --> 00:26:52,734
You only spent several days with him

523
00:26:52,773 --> 00:26:53,933
and don't know much about him,

524
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:55,933
so why do you have to
insist on keeping your word?

525
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:06,814
Yinfan,

526
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,533
you try to protect her

527
00:27:08,574 --> 00:27:10,454
by all means,

528
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:12,893
but she's disobeying you now.

529
00:27:13,094 --> 00:27:14,094
What?

530
00:27:14,214 --> 00:27:15,374
Will she

531
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:17,933
go to the so-called

532
00:27:18,173 --> 00:27:20,013
Uncle Wan?

533
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:21,173
Go back with me.

534
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:42,013
Master,

535
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:44,293
I didn't mean that.

536
00:27:53,494 --> 00:27:55,893
Disciples, escort Chong Zi
to Nanhua Sect.

537
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:57,454
No one is allowed to beg mercy for her.

538
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:58,974
- Yes.
- Yes.

539
00:28:07,013 --> 00:28:08,334
Master.

540
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:11,933
Let me go.

541
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,334
Chong.

542
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:46,854
If you want to kill me,

543
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:50,173
I swear I won't hate you.

544
00:28:52,094 --> 00:28:54,133
But even if you kill me,

545
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:56,374
I can't go back like this now.

546
00:28:58,013 --> 00:28:59,614
Since she's unwilling to go with you,

547
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:01,933
let her go with me.

548
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:31,094
Uncle,

549
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:32,133
I feel assured

550
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:33,053
when seeing you safe.

551
00:29:33,094 --> 00:29:34,413
Go now. Leave me alone.

552
00:29:36,253 --> 00:29:37,334
I've heard

553
00:29:37,374 --> 00:29:38,893
Chong Zi's words.

554
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:40,854
She begged you hard,

555
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:42,374
but you forced her.

556
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:44,133
If your immortal sect can't accept her,

557
00:29:44,494 --> 00:29:45,814
I'll take her away.

558
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:47,214
She's my disciple,

559
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:49,094
so she could only go with me.

560
00:29:51,214 --> 00:29:53,013
What if I insist on
taking her away today?

561
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:54,734
Then both of you have to stay here.

562
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:19,614
Disciples, cast the formation.

563
00:30:34,053 --> 00:30:35,133
Spirit Seal?

564
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:14,054
(Donglai Inn)

565
00:31:14,054 --> 00:31:16,574
Chong Zi the traitor
helped Wan Jie to escape.

566
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:19,773
Everyone, search for their whereabouts
with might and main.

567
00:31:20,494 --> 00:31:21,533
- Yes.
- Yes.

568
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:37,053
It seems casting the Spirit Seal
cost much of your spiritual power.

569
00:31:42,253 --> 00:31:43,893
You are so stupid.

570
00:31:44,734 --> 00:31:46,614
How could you disobey your master

571
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:49,013
to keep your word?

572
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:53,253
Unfortunately,

573
00:31:53,653 --> 00:31:55,814
I wonder what Miss Gong will think

574
00:31:55,893 --> 00:31:57,814
when she sees this scene.

575
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,253
Are you keeping Keran?

576
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:05,334
I've been ordering people to protect her

577
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:07,533
and won't make her feel wronged.

578
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:09,253
I'm not like you

579
00:32:09,614 --> 00:32:10,933
who abandoned her

580
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,013
in the Mortal World alone.

581
00:32:13,253 --> 00:32:15,053
We've made an appointment.

582
00:32:15,574 --> 00:32:17,173
When I finish my task,

583
00:32:17,374 --> 00:32:18,893
you will let us leave.

584
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:21,094
As the Demon King,

585
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:22,734
are you going to go back on your word?

586
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:25,133
Calm down.

587
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:28,013
You haven't finished your task yet.

588
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:29,454
Besides,

589
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,533
it's not time to let her go.

590
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:33,374
Even if I do so,

591
00:32:33,614 --> 00:32:35,614
will the immortals forgive her?

592
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:37,854
They will catch her

593
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:39,494
to allure you to appear,

594
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:43,773
so she's better to be kept by me.

595
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,214
The reason why I saved her by all means

596
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:56,653
isn't to let you kill her.

597
00:32:57,974 --> 00:32:59,013
No one

598
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:01,574
is allowed to kill her.

599
00:33:24,574 --> 00:33:26,013
Am I back again?

600
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:29,094
It's over.

601
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:31,374
I did upset Master.

602
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,893
I am smart,

603
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:36,974
but why was I out of mind this time?

604
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:38,974
Master,

605
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,933
I didn't want to betray you.

606
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:42,814
Please believe me.

607
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,614
After making a disturbance
in Nanhua Sect,

608
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:47,173
you're actually doing
the same thing here.

609
00:33:47,933 --> 00:33:49,173
I'm true to my word

610
00:33:49,253 --> 00:33:51,053
and won't escape.

611
00:33:58,653 --> 00:33:59,974
Did you save Miss Gong out?

612
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,173
How is she?

613
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:02,653
I didn't see her.

614
00:34:03,454 --> 00:34:05,133
They just wanted to allure me to appear,

615
00:34:05,854 --> 00:34:06,974
but they failed

616
00:34:07,773 --> 00:34:09,214
and involved you in.

617
00:34:09,974 --> 00:34:11,494
If you want to go back now,

618
00:34:12,013 --> 00:34:13,533
I can send you away right now.

619
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:16,934
No.

620
00:34:17,094 --> 00:34:18,414
I'm too shameful to go back.

621
00:34:19,453 --> 00:34:21,334
Do you also know that?

622
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:24,453
I think girls from Nanhua Sect

623
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:25,733
are as unruly

624
00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:27,533
as you.

625
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:29,174
- You disobeyed your master in public,
- I...

626
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:30,814
begged for the Demon King

627
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:32,973
and ran away with him.

628
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:35,814
Each thing you did

629
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:37,334
was sinful.

630
00:34:38,374 --> 00:34:39,894
I'm afraid you're the only one

631
00:34:40,013 --> 00:34:42,253
in the Immortal World
who dares to do so.

632
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:43,934
I know that.

633
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:45,334
I've made the decision.

634
00:34:48,693 --> 00:34:50,374
I decided to stay here.

635
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:54,934
This is a place for the demons.

636
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:57,293
So what?

637
00:34:57,414 --> 00:34:58,894
You were also an immortal before.

638
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:01,574
Since you can stay here, why can't I?

639
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,334
You're different from me.

640
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,013
You still have a chance.

641
00:35:07,094 --> 00:35:08,013
If you are bored,

642
00:35:08,134 --> 00:35:09,134
I can chat with you

643
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:10,973
and take you to eat delicious food

644
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:13,334
to return your favor.

645
00:35:14,453 --> 00:35:15,053
By the way,

646
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:17,414
I may dominate the six worlds

647
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:18,693
by my evil breath

648
00:35:19,013 --> 00:35:21,374
and be the lord of the Demon World.

649
00:35:21,773 --> 00:35:23,574
I promise I won't kill innocent people.

650
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:25,253
I will punish the evil
and praise the good

651
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,574
with my master.

652
00:35:26,773 --> 00:35:28,253
I'll only kill people who do bad things.

653
00:35:28,574 --> 00:35:30,934
By then, the six worlds will be peaceful.

654
00:35:32,973 --> 00:35:34,414
If you really become a demon,

655
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,013
could you get along

656
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:38,013
with your master peacefully?

657
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:44,493
The world's rules

658
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:47,574
are not as easy as you think.

659
00:35:51,213 --> 00:35:52,414
(He's right.)

660
00:35:53,174 --> 00:35:54,693
(My feelings to my master)

661
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,773
(are not that easy, either.)

662
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:06,013
Yinfan,

663
00:36:06,094 --> 00:36:07,174
why are you back alone?

664
00:36:07,213 --> 00:36:08,614
- Chong Zi...
- Get out of my way.

665
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:12,174
Ke.

666
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:13,174
What happened?

667
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:15,053
Master, it's my fault.

668
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:17,453
I failed in protecting Chong Zi
and got injured.

669
00:36:18,574 --> 00:36:19,654
Please help her.

670
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:21,013
She had a quarrel with Supervisor Sage

671
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:22,414
because of Wan Jie.

672
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:23,733
After offending the sages,

673
00:36:23,854 --> 00:36:25,174
she followed Wan Jie to leave.

674
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:27,414
I'm worried that she will never go back.

675
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:30,814
I know

676
00:36:30,894 --> 00:36:32,293
you two joined Nanhua Sect together,

677
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,094
so you have a close relationship.

678
00:36:34,814 --> 00:36:36,654
But Chong Zi...

679
00:36:52,174 --> 00:36:53,253
Mr. Luo.

680
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,134
You don't need to beg for her.

681
00:36:59,013 --> 00:37:00,934
Since you are Chong Zi's master,

682
00:37:01,374 --> 00:37:03,334
I think you must know her personality.

683
00:37:03,814 --> 00:37:05,654
She couldn't disobey you on purpose,

684
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:08,334
nor could she collude with the demons.

685
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:10,654
I hope you could forgive her

686
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:12,693
and not hold a grudge.

687
00:37:15,374 --> 00:37:17,894
I think it's normal
for you and your disciple

688
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:19,733
to have a quarrel.

689
00:37:19,733 --> 00:37:21,334
Hope you could forgive her.

690
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:22,533
Disciple?

691
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:24,894
She's not my disciple.

692
00:37:30,693 --> 00:37:32,053
I'm leaving.

693
00:38:12,654 --> 00:38:13,733
You're here.

694
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:17,293
Uncle, you play the Guqin very well.

695
00:38:19,374 --> 00:38:22,013
In the past, I would play the Guqin,

696
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,773
and Keran would practice dancing.

697
00:38:24,574 --> 00:38:26,414
Time would go very fast.

698
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:29,334
Perhaps I practiced a lot at that time
and have been good at it from then on.

699
00:39:24,493 --> 00:39:25,453
Unfortunately,

700
00:39:26,814 --> 00:39:27,934
when I'm still playing the Guqin,

701
00:39:29,973 --> 00:39:30,973
she's not by my side any longer.

702
00:39:31,293 --> 00:39:33,134
Uncle, in fact,

703
00:39:33,253 --> 00:39:34,773
it doesn't matter if you admit

704
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:36,693
you are Chu Bufu or not.

705
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:38,453
You used to be Mr. Immortal,

706
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:39,654
and now,

707
00:39:39,773 --> 00:39:41,253
you're my Uncle Wan.

708
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:45,693
Anyway, I can't go back
to Nanhua Sect now,

709
00:39:46,293 --> 00:39:48,053
so I'd rather stay here
to accompany you,

710
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:49,213
just...

711
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:50,854
just like your family.

712
00:39:52,094 --> 00:39:52,814
By the way,

713
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:54,614
these herbs are for you.

714
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:56,654
They can release your pain
when you are attacked by your disease.

715
00:40:01,493 --> 00:40:02,574
Who asked you to do that?

716
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,334
Piss off!

717
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:05,374
It's not late for you to leave now.

718
00:40:06,134 --> 00:40:07,094
Don't become me.

719
00:40:08,293 --> 00:40:09,733
I don't have a chance to regret anymore.
