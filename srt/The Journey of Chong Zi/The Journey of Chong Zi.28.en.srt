=Episode 28=

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,519
What a lofty sage in Nanhua.

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,799
People all say Sage Chonghua
protects the whole world.

30
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,479
What about me?

31
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,600
What did I do wrong?

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,080
Aren't I worthy of being protected

33
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,960
and loved?

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,319
I have lived two lives,

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,080
and each time I have suffered,

36
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,000
been betrayed and killed
by the one I trusted most.

37
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:23,000
Even my birth

38
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,240
was full of intrigue and deception.

39
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:29,039
Why do I have to live?

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,520
And why do I have to endure all this?

41
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,800
Luo Yinfan,

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,440
I'd rather never

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,920
have had your love.

44
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,039
From now on,

45
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,479
I will trust no one

46
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,399
but myself.

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,119
I'll make you all pay!

48
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,479
Master.

49
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,319
Master, save me.

50
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,280
Master, save me.

51
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
Save me.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,399
Master, save me.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,199
Save me.

54
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,319
(Why did I not come over
these three years?)

55
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,520
(I didn’t know that she was set up.)

56
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,240
Answer me,

57
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,400
is the rumor that Chong Zi
became a demon true?

58
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,400
How could that be?

59
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,159
Then where is she now?

60
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,080
I just received news that

61
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,400
a demon burned down
a temple in Yangzhou.

62
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,920
I suspect that Chong Zi did that.

63
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,439
Okay, we can't wait.

64
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:38,640
Let's go to Yangzhou immediately.

65
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,560
What?

66
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,159
You're not coming with me?

67
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Young Master Zhuo,

68
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,080
sometimes I really envy you.

69
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,479
Are you not afraid that once you go,

70
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,240
Qinghua Palace
will be suspected by others?

71
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,999
Your father and Miss Min...

72
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,240
I don't care what others think.

73
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,999
I only care about my heart.

74
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:10,680
Before, I couldn't stop her
from going to the Ice Prison.

75
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,640
This time,
I don't want to regret it anymore.

76
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,759
Yes, you're always so spontaneous

77
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,719
and not bound by your position.

78
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,479
Unlike me,

79
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,479
who is in Nanhua,

80
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,240
and can't go anywhere.

81
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:25,879
That's enough!

82
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,560
Don't think I can't see that

83
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,120
you're calling me impulsive and reckless

84
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,439
in a different way.

85
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,719
Young Master,

86
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,439
I'll count on you
for the long journey to Yangzhou.

87
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,560
Don't worry.

88
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,800
I'll definitely persuade her
to change her mind.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,680
(Chonghua Palace)

90
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:08,640
Luo Yinfan,

91
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,479
don’t you want to see me?

92
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
I'm back.

93
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,800
Don't you dare to see me?

94
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Are you hiding?

95
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,000
(Recipes)

96
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,199
(I won't marry anyone.)

97
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
(I want to be with you all the time.)

98
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,680
You are

99
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,439
a troublemaker.

100
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,120
You can only cause trouble
wherever you go.

101
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,199
If you leave me,

102
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,920
I really don't know

103
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,640
who will take care of you.

104
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,999
I'm the only one who can control you.

105
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,840
You’re dull as a wooden man.

106
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,199
I'm the only one who can stand you.

107
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,319
What should we do?

108
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,560
It seems that we two weirdos

109
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,400
can only live together

110
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,520
on this Zizhu Peak.

111
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,759
Great!

112
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,640
This is what you call living together?

113
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,080
It's all over now!

114
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,639
Chong's back.

Luo Yinfan.

118
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,440
Today I will burn the patriarchs

119
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,519
of your Nanhua

120
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,520
(Patriarch's Hall)
and let the immortal sect

121
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,240
be destroyed!

122
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:35,920
Stop it, Chong Zi!

123
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,520
(Liuhe Hall)

124
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,320
Sorry,

125
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,440
we made you this way.

126
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,680
It’s none of your business.

127
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,519
You are the best disciple for Councilor.

128
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,279
You are the righteous Qin Ke.

129
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:51,760
How could you be wrong?

130
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,279
Whatever you say,

131
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,039
it's my inability to protect you.

132
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,440
I can't argue with that.

133
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,360
I've had enough of your hypocrisy.

134
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,519
You say you're sorry.

135
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,440
But when I was locked in the Ice Prison,

136
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,479
enduring the suffering,

137
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,839
where were you?

138
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,320
Did you come to see me?

139
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,880
Do you think I didn't want to go?

140
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,000
- I...
- Of course,

141
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,519
you had your reasons.

142
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
I can't blame you for that.

143
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,760
You've always been good to me.

144
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560
You're just a little weak.

145
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:20,959
You can go.

146
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,760
I don't want to fight with you.

147
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,000
Chong Zi.

148
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,839
You can hate me or resent me,

149
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,639
but don’t act rashly.

150
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,959
You're right.

151
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,399
I was too weak.

152
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,159
From now on,

153
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,320
no matter what they think,

154
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,159
I'll do my best to protect you.

155
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,639
Protect me?

156
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,360
I am a demon,

157
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,079
a demon as you call me.

158
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,800
Is this how you guard Nanhua?

159
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,639
You know I won't hurt you.

160
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,399
But I am a traitor to Nanhua.

161
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,719
I will kill everyone in Nanhua!

162
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,240
Chong,

163
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,200
don't be blinded by the evil breath.

164
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,000
I’m not here to hear you say that.

165
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,599
I did all this. How about it?

166
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,760
Are you going to kill me again?

167
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,760
I know you resent me.

168
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,039
But the things between us

169
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,639
don’t need to involve
other people in Nanhua.

170
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,159
If there was no Nanhua,

171
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,920
how could we have
a grudge against each other?

172
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,360
Come back with me to Zizhu Peak.

173
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,880
I won't go back with you.

174
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,000
Zizhu Peak has been burned down by me.

175
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,719
Ni Lun's Sword that you are afraid of

176
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:19,719
is also in my hands.

177
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,959
Either you kill me,

178
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
or we die together.

179
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,519
Chong,

180
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,959
don't be naive.

181
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,920
Ni Lun's Sword

182
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,959
can't release the real magic
in your hands.

183
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,880
That's good.

184
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,360
I'll use your blood

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,159
to sharpen the blade.

186
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,240
Demon!

187
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,959
You're just in time.

188
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,200
I don't have to go looking for you
one by one.

189
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,120
Mu Yu, you're just in time.

190
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,159
Catch this demon for me!

191
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,399
Sorry, Young Master, I'm late.

192
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,599
What are you talking about?

193
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,560
Mu Yu, what did you call her?

194
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,920
You...

195
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:16,959
You are not Mu Yu.

196
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,320
Who are you?

197
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,719
I am

198
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,000
the Thousand-Faced Demon Tian Zhixie.

199
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,039
Thousand-Faced Demon Tian Zhixie?

200
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,760
You are a demon?

201
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:29,560
Yes.

202
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,440
I’ve been lurking in Nanhua
for hundreds of years,

203
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:34,279
thanks to your love.

204
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,519
You...

205
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,760
You evil creature!

206
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,120
You...

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,719
Councilor.

208
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,399
Evil creature!

209
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,440
Who let you do that?

210
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,719
Soon the six worlds will know that

211
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,519
you burned Zizhu Peak.

212
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,680
The immortal sect will not let you go.

213
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,639
In addition to your identity,

214
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,519
except for returning
to the Demon King Hall,

215
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,240
in the six worlds,

216
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,360
where can you go?

217
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,719
You’ll be in fear day after day,

218
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,560
avoiding the pursuit
of the immortal sect.

219
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,839
So what?

220
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,200
The worst...

221
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,079
The worst thing is to die with them.

222
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,839
Young Master,

223
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,479
if you have the heart to die,

224
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,039
you should put your life

225
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,039
to better use.

226
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:41,200
I think you also know that

227
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,800
your evil breath has increased greatly
since you became a demon,

228
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,279
revenge is just around the corner.

229
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,320
But you can't fight alone

230
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,360
against Nanhua's many people.

231
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:53,240
But it will be different
if you return to the Demon World.

232
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,120
You have the noble blood
of the Demon King

233
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,959
and the power of the Demon World.

234
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,479
Even if you are going to die,

235
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,240
you should take the person
who hurt you with you,

236
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,000
instead of being like this.

237
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,719
Right?

238
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,599
Chong Zi.

239
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,719
Chong Zi.

240
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:28,800
You are really in Yangzhou.

241
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,200
I've been waiting for you here
for a long time.

242
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,760
If you don't show up,

243
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:34,639
I'm going to beat Qin Ke.

244
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:37,959
Come on, let's go back.

245
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,880
Zhuo Hao.

246
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,440
Forget it.

247
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,240
What?

248
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,599
What are you saying, young lady?

249
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,200
I don't know what you mean.

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,360
She means that

251
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,680
immortals and demons are different,

252
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,320
so there is no need to force her.

253
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,880
Mu Yu?

254
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:07,920
No.

255
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,399
You are a demon.

256
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,959
Let me reintroduce myself.

257
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
I am Mu Yu,

258
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,079
and I am also

259
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,399
Tian Zhixie of the Demon World.

260
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:18,760
I see.

261
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,200
The demons really took great pains

262
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,039
raising such a big mole in Nanhua.

263
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,880
No wonder Chong Zi became a demon.

264
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:29,680
You are flattering me.

265
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,560
Young Master's return

266
00:16:31,719 --> 00:16:33,440
was caused by Nanhua.

267
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,039
I didn’t make any effort into it.

268
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,000
Enough.

269
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,479
You can leave.

270
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,200
Yes.

271
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,479
You know I'm a demon now,

272
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,039
why wait for me?

273
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:53,440
My waiting for you

274
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,519
has nothing to do with you
being a demon or an immortal.

275
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,159
As long as you are Chong Zi,

276
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,760
my waiting is worth it.

277
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,839
Okay.

278
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,440
Then I’m telling you,

279
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,200
the Chong Zi you like is dead.

280
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,159
Even if you wait
until the end of the world,

281
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,239
she won't come back.

282
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,399
I don't believe it.

283
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,480
Isn't she here now?

284
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:24,720
Chong Zi,

285
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:28,239
I know Luo Yinfan broke your heart,

286
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,200
but you still have me.

287
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,680

No matter where,

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,759
I will give my life

291

to protect you. I...

292
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,320
Well, then listen to me.

293
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,200
I don't need it.

294
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,519
And I don’t like you.

(waiting for you to come back one day.)

327
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:54,239
I heard that Chong Zi and Yan Zhenzhu

328
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,560
were very close over the years.

329
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,080
Zhenzhu was a demon,

330
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,999
I only found it out after the incident.

331
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
As a disciple of the immortal sect,

332
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,680
I was so negligent.

333
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:02,960
I am guilty.

334
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,200
But,

335
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,039
I am deeply in love with Zhenzhu.

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:07,960
I think Zhenzhu

337
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,720
was also forced to do so.

338
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,039
I don’t ask you here

00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,800
I just want you to do something for me.

341
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,159
Do you want me

342
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,039
to find Chong Zi?

343
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:27,440
Although Chong Zi is now a demon,

344
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,600
her past is not over.

345
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,680
So she burned Nanhua.

346
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,080
But now the main thing is that

347
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,920
she can no longer listen to my words.

348
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,159
But for the sake of Zhenzhu,

349
00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:42,920
maybe she can listen to

350
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,800
what you say.

351
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,999
So I want to ask you

352
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,519
to help me go for her.

353
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,080
I know what you mean.

354
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:53,720
In fact,

355
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,159
I also want to go to see Chong Zi.

356
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Before Zhenzhu died,

357
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,239
I couldn't see her for the last time.

358
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,440
I also want to ask Chong Zi

359
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,159
if Zhenzhuo had any message for me.

360
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,159
Give this to her for me,

361
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,840
and tell her that

362
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,519
everything on Zizhu Peak

363
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,639
is waiting for her return.

364
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:25,639
But,

365
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,279
where should I go to find her?

366
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:28,680
I think

367
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,239
she could only go back to
the Demon King Hall now.

368
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,720
You must keep it a secret

369
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,759
that I’ve met with you.

370
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:37,920
Don't worry, Sage Chonghua.

371
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:38,999
I see.

372
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:58,159
Chengfeng?

373
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,399
Councilor.

374
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,039
What are you doing here?

375
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,960
I... I... I...

376
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,639
Starlight?

377
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Did Sage Chonghua ask for you?

378
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,759
What did he ask you to do?

379
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,999
He...

380
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:17,720
Did he ask you to find that demon?

381
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:19,399
No, no...

382
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:21,960
No...

383
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:34,080
Chengfeng,

384
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,399
I always thought

385
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,399
you were smart.

386
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,560
Maybe

387
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:41,560
you’ve already influenced her,

388
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,800
and she no longer worked for the demons.

389
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,639
If she hadn't only thought about Chong Zi,

390
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,440
and cared about the friendship
between her and Chong Zi,

391
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,200
how could she have died

392
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,759
so miserably?

393
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,600
You

394
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,159
do one thing for me.

395
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:24,999
Go ahead.

396
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,440
Won't you come with me?

397
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,080
If you go back alone,

398
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,920
the Demon King will be more satisfied.

399
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,720
I can see whatever I want to see.

400
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:39,800
I don't want to see anything.

401
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,440
So I can't see anything.

402
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
Now that you're back,

403
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,119
can't you still let go
of your dignity to see them?

404
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:49,359
You knew all about it?

405
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:52,999
You've burned the place

406
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,200
and beaten the disciples,

407
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,960
you should be happy now.

408
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,480
You took a step back and came back.

409
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,080
I'll take a step back too.

410
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,600
Please come back.

411
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,279
This step,

412
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,759
Young Master, please take it.

413
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,440
From today onwards,

414
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:39,320
Young Master is Demon Zi.

415
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,920
All of you

416
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,560
must help her unlock the Tianmo Token.

417
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,800
Seeing her is like seeing me.

418
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,480
If Young Master doesn't like someone,

419
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:53,639
just kill him.

420
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,920
Do you hear me?

421
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,999
-Yes, my king.
-Yes, my king.

422
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,239
Don't play this trick in front of me.

423
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,039
I've seen this a lot in Nanhua.

424
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,759
It seems that

425
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,639
I've upset you first.

426
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,759
Find a quiet place for me.

427
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,519
I want to stay alone,

428
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,480
far away from you.

429
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,560
I do know a place

430
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,639
that's perfect for you.

431
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,840
This is Shuiyue City.

432
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:45,320
You have a special identity.

433
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,519
I don't think you want to be

434
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,600
with those demons
in the Demon King Hall.

435
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,840
Shuiyue City
is the closest to the Mortal World,

436
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:55,720
and no one will disturb you here.

437
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:59,080
You can meditate quietly.

438
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,720
You can go. I want to be alone.

439
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,519
Okay.

440
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,119
Stay alone.

441
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,480
You have the demon sword with you anyway.

442
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,879
I believe that

443
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:22,720
you will soon figure it out,

444
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,960
and soon you will know

445
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:26,920
what you should do next.

446
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:49,759
Chong Zi,

447
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,119
don't make the same mistake I made.

448
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,560
Uncle.

449
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Chongzi,

450
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:05,920
thank you.

451
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,239
Young Master,

452
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:09,320
the demon sword has been
waiting for you for a long time.

453
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,560
Didn't you meet your sweetheart?

454
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,560
What? She doesn't want you anymore

455
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,800
so you came back to get drunk?

456
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,119
Good point.

457
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,200
That's what a serious immortal lady

458
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,519
should say.

459
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,480
You've seen it.

460
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,159
I'm a mess now.

461
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,560
You should have left Qinghua

462
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,279
as soon as possible.

463
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,800
I won't leave.

464
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,840
Whether you admit it or not,

465
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,440
I'm still your fiancee.

466
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,440
As the Young Master
of Qinghua Palace,

467
00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:29,960
you are destined
to fight against the demons

468
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,359
and turn against Chong Zi.

469
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,080
This is your duty

470
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:34,359
and your destiny.

471
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,639
Destiny?

472
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,279
Who said so?

473
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,999
You want me to fight against

474
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,560
the demons indiscriminately?

475
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,720
Even if I'm reduced to an invalid,

476
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,720
I won't do what you want.

477
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:53,440
Are you still stubborn at this point?

478
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,159
That woman

479
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,119
doesn't care about you at all.

480
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:58,639
Is it worth it
to degrade yourself for her?

481
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,039
What about you?

482
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,279
Is it worth it to pursue a man

483
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,320
who doesn't love you?

484
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,039
It's worth it.

485
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,519
Look, you and I are pretty much the same.

486
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:20,279
Don't confuse me

487
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,399
with your stupid unrequited love.

488
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,759
Zhuo Hao,

489
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,279
how can you be the same as Chong Zi?

490
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,200
Zhuo Hao,

491
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,039
do you remember that?

492
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,680
When I was little,
I wasn't good with words.

493
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,920
And I was always bullied.

494
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,639
It was you who saved me.

495
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,119
You also told me that

496
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,920
as long as I try my best,

497
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:03,600
there is nothing I can't change.

498
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:07,759
But now that

499
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,519
I've tried so hard to come to you,

500
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,200
yet you've become like this.

501
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,519
It's Chong Zi.

502
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:25,480
It's all because of that demon

503
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,159
that you've fallen to this state.

504
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
Forget it.

505
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,840
It doesn't make sense.

506
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,519
I don't want to explain.

507
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:36,239
Zhuo Hao!

508
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:52,440
(Chong Zi,)

509
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:55,480
(you made him like this.)

510
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,159
(It's all your fault.)

511
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,720
The Demon World is

512
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,080
no worse than the Immortal World.

513
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:52,960
Master!

514
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,519
Master, save me!

515
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,759
Master, why did you do this to me?

516
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,440
You deserve this.

517
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,359
I don't want to see you anymore.

518
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,159
Master! Master!

519
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:09,840
Master!

520
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,320
This nightmare flower of Shuiyue City
is really powerful,

521
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,159
no less than Yan Zhenzhu
and her nightmare technique.

522
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:21,440
Why are you here?

523
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,800
You are not welcome in Shuiyue City.

524
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,440
It's just an illusion.

525
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,999
If you don't fear it,

526
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:28,440
you won't be harmed by it.

527
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,359
Now you've become a demon,

528
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,960
I advise you to let go

529
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,279
of those unwarranted thoughts.

530
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,279
Unwarranted thoughts?

531
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,159
Shuixian,

532
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,440
why did you do so much for Sage Xueling?

533
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,080
I'm here to tell you that

534
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,600
an old friend wants to see you.

535
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,600
An old friend?

536
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:55,600
You want to see me?

537
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Chong Zi.

538
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,080
I've brought her to you.

539
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,279
I’m leaving now.

540
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,720
Unexpectedly,

541
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,440
there's such a nice place

542
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,879
in the Demon World.

543
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,040
I wonder if Zhenzhu

544
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,280
also used to live by the water.

545
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,359
She always told me

546
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,319
she wanted to live by the water.

547
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,119
Do you hate Zhenzhu?

548
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,680
After all,

549
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,319
she lied to you.

550
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,440
I do.

551
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,960
How can I not hate her?

552
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,079
But she died
without even giving me a chance

553
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,720
to question her.

554
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,480
I was cheated by her so badly.

555
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:50,839
Thinking back,

556
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,639
the first time we met,

557
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,240
the things she told me

558
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,520
about the past

559
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,920
were all carefully designed by her.

560
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,839
Even when we slept together,

561
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,079
I would have strange dreams.

562
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,240
I was stupid

563
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,799
and deserved to be cheated by her.

564
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,960
But sometimes I miss her so much.

565
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,040
In Nanhua,

566
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:19,799
besides Master,

567
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,920
only Zhenzhu brought me happiness.

568
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,799
So I don’t want to hate her.

569
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,839
Because in any case,
she can not come back.

570
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:31,200
What about you?

571
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,799
Zhenzhu cheated you too.

572
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,280
Don't you hate her?

573
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,319
No.

574
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,159
Being from different worlds

575
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,760
is not my fault or hers.

576
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,119
But I just want to know

577
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,280
if Zhenzhu had a message for me.

578
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:52,879
Before she died,

579
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,399
she asked me to say sorry to you.

580
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:04,240
Why is she still so stupid?

581
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,119
I’m here to

582
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,760
give you one thing.

583
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,680
Starlight?

584
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,879
Did he ask you to come to me?

585
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,599
He was afraid you
wouldn't want to see him,

586
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,920
so he asked me to come to you.

587
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,720
Just to deliver Starlight?

588
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:41,720
Sage Chonghua said that

589
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,079
when you see Starlight,

590
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,839
you will know what he wants to say.

591
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:54,319
I'll take it.

592
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,200
You can leave now.

593
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,839
Just give it to Chong Zi.

594
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,960
This is Golden Needle

595
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,159
that can dissipate

596
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:37,960
all the power in one's body?

597
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:44,559
You...

598
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:45,599
I'm sorry.

599
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,720
Chong Zi.

600
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,119
Did he ask you to do this?

601
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:50,159
Don’t struggle.

602
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,639
The Golden Needle

603
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,200
is already embedded in your body.

604
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:54,639
The harder you push,

605
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,440
the quicker the evil breath
will dissipate.

606
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,720
Did he ask you to do this?

607
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,240
Answer me!

608
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,599
The sages asked me to do that.

609
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:06,200
Luo Yinfan?

610
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,520
Or them?

611
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,040
They...

612
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,159
They decided together.

613
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,960
No wonder

614
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,799
he was so kind

615
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,200
to give me Starlight.

616
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,839
He just couldn't

617
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,440
wait for me to die.

618
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:33,879
I didn't want to do this.

619
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,879
But you were born with evil breath,

620
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,399
and now you have become a demon,

621
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,920
so you will be a disaster for the world.

622
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,559
Besides,

623
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
if it weren't for you,

624
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:48,680
Zhenzhu wouldn't have died.

625
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,359
If I were a disaster for the world,

626
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:54,760
how could I be in such a state?

627
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,799
You've become a demon,

628
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,240
I won't believe you anymore.

629
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,879
My sword

630
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:05,000
will scatter all your souls,

631
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,200
and you will never feel any pain.

632
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,480
I'm sorry.

633
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,480
Never feel any pain?

634
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,599
In that case,

635
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:17,520
should I thank you?

636
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Senior Mu?

637
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,079
Still calling me Senior Mu?

638
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,079
No.

639
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,520
You’re not Senior Mu.

640
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,960
You are Tian Zhixie.

641
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,599
You're here to see Chong Zi,

642
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,920
aren't you afraid that
Sage Chonghua will blame you?

643
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,760
Nanhua is really overconfident,

644
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:44,920
sending a nobody
to offend our Demon World.

645
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,720
As long as it is someone I recognize

646
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,040
and we

647
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,079
like each other,

648
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,079
I will entangle with him to the end.

649
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,399
Even if we have different identities,

650
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:54,559
different positions,

651
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,359
I will persist

652
00:39:57,799 --> 00:40:00,040
and cherish every moment.

653
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,040
Don't kill him!

654
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:18,359
Thank you.

655
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
I'm sorry.

656
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,159
Zhenzhu.

657
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,319
I...

658
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,720
I'm coming.

659
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,200
Chengfeng.

660
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,639
Zhenzhu.

661
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,639
Why did you kill him?

662
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:53,000
You know why.

663
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,240
You've seen

664
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,639
the Golden Needle.

665
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,960
Nanhua won’t show you mercy again.

666
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:15,119
One more word of advice.

667
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,359
Don't trust anyone
in the Immortal World anymore.

668
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,760
This man is a pawn,

669
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,240
but if he hurts you,

670
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,399
I won’t let him leave here alive.

671
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:30,079
It is easily said than done.

672
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,799
But it's up to me to decide

673
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,480
what to do with him.

674
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,760
I told you not to kill him.

675
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,200
Why didn't you listen to my orders?

676
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,720
It happened suddenly.

677
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
I won't do it again.

678
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,399
But he's still dead.

679
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,920
He was sent here to die by Nanhua.

680
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,319
The one who really killed him

681
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:53,000
was Luo Yinfan, not me.

682
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,440
No.

683
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,440
Although he had the intention
to kill me,

684
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,440
he would never

685
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,040
let an innocent person die.

686
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,599
You still believe him?

687
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,399
In Luo Yinfan's mind, you are a demon.

688
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,200
He wants to kill you.

689
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,319
He kept you around

690
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,920
because of your special status,

691
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,680
not because he really loves you.

692
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,960
Give it back to me.

693
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,520
If you continue to be unrepentant,

694
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,280
I'll destroy it.

695
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,520
How dare you!

696
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,639
If you want to achieve greatness,

697
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:28,599
you must be as far away
from the past as possible.

698
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,319
Don't destroy it.

699
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,440
Give it back to me.

700
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,200
Don't destroy it.

701
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,680
Give it back to me.

702
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:45,879
Don't destroy it.
