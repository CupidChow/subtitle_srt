00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,381
(Is Zhuo Hao)

29
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:42,182
(serious about it?)

30
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:44,782
Getting married with him?

31
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:47,182
What would happen if Master found out?

32
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:50,502
Is he really going to marry me to Qinghua?

33
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:51,502
No.

34
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:52,981
I can't tell him.

35
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:55,462
I just want to be with Master forever.

36
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:01,182
Chong Zi will love this gift.

37
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:04,941
No, I have to hurry up.

38
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:07,661
That elm-headed Qin Ke

39
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,581
and the impenetrable Luo Yinfan

40
00:02:09,742 --> 00:02:12,462
are by her side all day long.

41
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:15,102
If they took advantage of it,

42
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:17,021
I'd be heartbroken.

43
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:18,661
I have to go.

44
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:22,982
Where are you going?

45
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:24,182
Grab your daughter-in-law.

46
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:25,141
Stop.

47
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:28,342
Which immortal lady
do you want to tease again?

48
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:30,462
There are already many immortal ladies

49
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:31,501
who have come to Qinghua.

50
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:33,062
How long are you going to mess around?

51
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:35,262
Father, I'm serious this time.

52
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:37,262
I swear I really want to marry

53
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,822
Sage Chonghua's disciple.

54
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:44,182
If it were her,

55
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:46,301
it would be absolutely impossible.

56
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:48,381
Why?

57
00:02:48,622 --> 00:02:50,702
Didn't you quite like her before?

58
00:02:53,021 --> 00:02:55,301
She is clever, quick-witted and charming.

59
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,141
But I heard that Luo Yinfan
kept her by his side,

60
00:02:58,421 --> 00:02:59,702
although he doted on her
in every possible way,

61
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:02,421
he never taught her any spells,
which is very suspicious.

62
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:04,421
Moreover, it was rumored that

63
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:06,262
Chong Zi could retreat unscathed

64
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:07,742
after encountering Wan Jie twice.

65
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:09,141
There must be

66
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:11,702
something wrong.

67
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,581
Father, you have taught me
since I was a child that

68
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:17,702
seeing is believing.

69
00:03:18,102 --> 00:03:18,941
Why have you been swayed

70
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:20,902
by rumors yourself?

71
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:23,301
Seeing is believing.

72
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:25,661
But there is no smoke without fire.

73
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:28,102
I've heard everything you said,

74
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,501
and I know it all.

75
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:31,781
But I still like her.

76
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,141
I only like her.

77
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:33,941
Enough.

78
00:03:34,342 --> 00:03:34,902
I...

79
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:37,102
This is your spur of the moment
and doesn't count.

80
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:38,742
You need to be cautious
about this matter,

81
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:40,742
and never act willfully.

82
00:03:42,062 --> 00:03:43,102
- Father!
- You...

83
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:44,421
I fell in love with her

84
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:45,941
from the first time I met her.

85
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:50,062
I know that before, I was naughty.

86
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:51,141
But

87
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,262
after meeting her,

88
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:54,902
there is no one else in my heart

89
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,661
except her.

90
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:59,902
Father, I understand your concern.

91
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:03,141
I also know that marriage
should not be trifled with.

92
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:04,702
I know better than anyone

93
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,702
what Chong Zi is like.

94
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,342
Get up.

95
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,102
If you don't agree, I won't get up.

96
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:17,902
You!

97
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:20,342
Father, I have never begged you

98
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,942
for anything since I was a child.

99
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:24,182
Father, please promise me.

100
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:27,701
Father, please.

101
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:34,942
Forget it.

102
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:36,541
I will

103
00:04:37,182 --> 00:04:38,622
seek a marriage alliance for you.

104
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:40,701
Really? Great!

105
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,541
- I'm going to marry her!
- You...

106
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:15,421
Master didn't come to see me again.

107
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:20,141
Is it because I caused
too much trouble for him

108
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:22,981
and he thinks I'm disobedient?

109
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,821
What exactly does Master think of me?

110
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:38,462
(Chonghua Palace)

111
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:11,942
No matter how much
she usually talks back to me,

112
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,541
now it seems that

113
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:18,782
she is just the little girl

114
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:21,421
when she went up the mountain.

115
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:35,581
Master.

116
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:37,301
Get married.

117
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:40,662
Get married to Master.

118
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:45,261
Chong.

119
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,062
What are you talking about?

120
00:06:49,462 --> 00:06:50,861
I don't want to get married.

121
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:53,502
I'd like to be with Master forever.

122
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:01,942
Your master has been making you kneel.

123
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:04,182
Why do you still want to be with him?

124
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:06,821
I am willing to.

125
00:07:07,622 --> 00:07:10,222
No one can replace Master.

126
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:12,662
Look at you.

127
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:15,861
I promised you that
I will always be with you.

128
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:18,742
What else do you want?

129
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:23,261
(Luo Yinfan.)

130
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:25,981
(When did you become so fussy?)

131
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:34,502
Greetings to Mr. Luo.

132
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:35,981
What's up?

133
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:38,261
The Councilor said that
a distinguished guest is visiting,

134
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:39,662
and asked you to go and meet him.

135
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:41,101
Did he say who's coming?

136
00:07:43,902 --> 00:07:45,622
It's Zhuo Yao, the lord of Qinghua Palace.

137
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:47,902
It is said that

138
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:49,622
he's here to ask you for something.

139
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,141
I thought it was just a joke.

140
00:07:57,662 --> 00:07:58,782
I didn't expect my son

141
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:01,382
to be so infatuated with
Sage Chonghua's disciple.

142
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:03,861
In desperation, as a father,

143
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:06,662
I had no choice but to boldly
propose marriage

144
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:08,301
and make an appointment with Chong Zi.

145
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,981
(Chong Zi is born with evil breath.)

146
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:11,581
(It would be a good thing for
Nanhua and Yinfan)

147
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,662
(if she took this opportunity to leave.)

148
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,622
Nanhua and Qinghua have always
been on friendly terms.

149
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,342
I wanted to bring my niece Suqiu

150
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,301
and Young Master Zhuo together.

151
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:29,821
Unexpectedly, Young Master Zhuo
likes Chong Zi.

152
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:31,502
That would be great.

153
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:33,782
The two kids

154
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:36,421
are about the same age and temperament.

155
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:40,182
They are a perfect match.

156
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:41,382
That's good.

157
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:42,861
Let's wait until Mr. Luo arrives

158
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,981
to discuss this matter.

159
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,901
Could it be that Chong Zi
already has an agreed marriage?

160
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:52,421
Not yet.

161
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:54,502
That being the case,
and they like each other,

162
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,221
wouldn't it be the best?

163
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,541
Could it be that Nanhua
looks down on Qinghua

164
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:06,822
and thinks we are not worthy?

165
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:10,541
I don't agree.

166
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:16,661
Mr. Luo.

167
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:18,742
Why?

168
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:21,742
Chong Zi is still young,

169
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:23,062
not yet suitable for marriage.

170
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:24,861
In the Mortal World, women at this age

171
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:26,901
can get married and have children.

172
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:30,062
She still needs to devote herself to practice
and cultivate the immortal bones.

173
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:32,101
She can still practice
after getting married.

174
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:34,622
She is my disciple
and has to be by my side.

175
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:37,742
Mr. Luo, you protect your disciple

176
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:39,781
so closely.

177
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:42,101
Is it really like rumors that

178
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:43,502
there is some ulterior secret

179
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:46,901
hidden in Chong Zi?

180
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:49,702
Of course not.

181
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:51,702
What Mr. Luo means is that

182
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,262
Chong Zi is still young

183
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,622
and doesn't know many etiquettes.

184
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:55,702
He's afraid that

185
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:57,461
she will cause trouble to Qinghua
after getting married.

186
00:09:57,861 --> 00:09:59,262
Lord Zhuo made unfounded speculation

187
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,341
about Nanhua's disciples for no reason.

188
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,781
Your behavior

189
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,781
is as low as a countryman.

190
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,702
You!

191
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:14,502
Good.

192
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,582
It seems that Qinghua
is self-sentimental

193
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,502
about the marriage.

194
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:20,861
Goodbye.

195
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:25,942
Lord Zhuo. Lord Zhuo.

196
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:28,062
Lord Zhuo.

197
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:29,262
You...

198
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:36,981
You went so far.

199
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:39,861
Now that you know he will propose,

200
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,582
you should be prepared.

201
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:43,901
But after all,

202
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:45,822
this is Chong Zi's main affair.

203
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:48,062
As her master, you turned them down

204
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:50,502
without even asking her.

205
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:53,022
Chong Zi is still young and has no relatives.

206
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:54,822
Of course I should call the shots for her.

207
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:56,221
I mean

208
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:58,022
you should at least let her know about it.

209
00:10:58,182 --> 00:10:59,942
What if she wants to go?

210
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:03,262
Young Master Zhuo is a promising
young man of the immortal sect,

211
00:11:03,742 --> 00:11:05,262
and is fine-looking.

212
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:06,781
If he took the initiative
to propose marriage,

213
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:09,182
no one would say no.

214
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:11,142
I heard from Zhenzhu that

215
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,382
he and Chong Zi get along well.

216
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:15,262
If she really wants to,

217
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:17,382
we can't stop this.

218
00:11:21,822 --> 00:11:22,661
Yinfan.

219
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:05,101
She cherishes the gift

220
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:07,421
I prepared for her so much.

221
00:12:29,461 --> 00:12:31,142
The Shadow Mirror of Qinghua Palace.

222
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,421
Quite rare.

223
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:36,582
It should be sent by Zhuo Hao.

224
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:38,661
(Zhuo Hao is really romantic)

225
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:41,062
(and good at pleasing girls.)

226
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:45,182
Master.

227
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:51,861
It makes sense.

228
00:12:52,421 --> 00:12:55,062
It may be a little lonely

229
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,382
to stay with me on Zizhu Peak all day.

230
00:12:57,622 --> 00:12:58,582
No, Master.

231
00:12:58,661 --> 00:12:59,942
I am not familiar with Zhuo Hao.

232
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:02,582
I just received this mirror.

233
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:04,341
You've grown up.

234
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:06,182
It's good to have your own ideas.

235
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:08,461
I won't interfere with
who you make friends with.

236
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:10,502
Just if you have any ideas,

237
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:12,661
you can tell me yourself.

238
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:14,582
Look.

239
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:16,661
Haven't you always wanted to hang out?

240
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:19,301
If you two do find each other congenial,

241
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,582
I will promise you.

242
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:23,661
You can leave Zizhu Peak

243
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:25,461
to see the outside world.

244
00:13:29,022 --> 00:13:30,382
Think about it carefully

245
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:32,262
and tell me your decision.

246
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:41,062
Master, I am not getting married.

247
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:42,582
I am not willing to.

248
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:45,301
He and I are just friends.

249
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:48,182
No, not even friends.

250
00:13:48,622 --> 00:13:51,221
How could I fall in love with him?

251
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,702
Even if I fall in love with Lion,

252
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:56,221
I won't fall in love with him.

253
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:05,622
You bad mirror.

254
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:07,421
I'm going to smash you.

255
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:14,461
It's all your fault.

256
00:14:21,142 --> 00:14:22,502
Master.

257
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,781
Don't leave me, okay?

258
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,182
If you leave,

259
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:28,781
you will never find
such an obedient disciple as me.

260
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:30,942
I can make you happy,

261
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:33,341
walk Lion for you

262
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,262
and prepare herbal cuisine.

263
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:39,262
Master, even if you
don't think about me,

264
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:42,781
you should think about yourself.

265
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,301
Master.

266
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:01,461
Okay, don't cry.

267
00:15:01,582 --> 00:15:04,062
What are you talking about?

268
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,221
In fact, Qinghua came to
propose marriage today.

269
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:10,942
But I have declined for you.

270
00:15:14,262 --> 00:15:15,502
As for that mirror,

271
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,502
just throw it away.

272
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:18,502
Master.

273
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:22,062
How can you tease me with such a thing?

274
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:25,142
You don't even know how sad I am.

275
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:27,341
You still cry like a child

276
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:30,742
for no reason.

277
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,421
If you are like this,

278
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:35,582
how will you get married in the future?

279
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:36,541
Right?

280
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,022
I don't want to get married.

281
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,341
I will always be with Master.

282
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:55,341
You are a troublemaker,

283
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,461
and you can only cause trouble
wherever you go.

284
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:00,822
If I leave you,

285
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:03,461
I don't know who can
cope with the aftermath for you.

286
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:05,981
Only I can discipline you.

287
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:08,822
You are a blockhead.

288
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:11,142
Only I can stand you.

289
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,341
What to do?

290
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:15,421
It seems that we two weirdos

291
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,341
can only depend on each other

292
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:18,702
on Zizhu Peak.

293
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:21,901
Depend on each other?

294
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:23,421
Really?

295
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:28,101
What a shame.

296
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:29,661
Qinghua is

297
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:31,022
thoroughly discredited.

298
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:34,461
What a shame.

299
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:37,502
Sage Chonghua really refused
without leaving any room?

300
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:40,062
From now on, forget about the marriage
between you and Chong Zi,

301
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:41,582
and you are not allowed
to mention it again.

302
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:42,461
No way.

303
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,142
I'm going to ask Luo Yinfan.

304
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:45,981
Why did he make the decision
for Chong Zi?

305
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:47,022
Stop.

306
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,221
- You don't feel ashamed enough?
- I...

307
00:16:52,861 --> 00:16:53,781
Listen.

308
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:55,382
You are not allowed to
go to Nanhua anymore,

309
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:56,461
let alone see Chong Zi.

310
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,502
- Why?
- You!

311
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,221
I'm going.

312
00:16:58,262 --> 00:17:00,022
I have to ask Chong Zi face to face.

313
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:00,861
How dare you!

314
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:02,262
I have to go!

315
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:04,022
- Dad, it hurts.
- Go.

316
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:04,942
Shut yourself up
and reflect on yourself.

317
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:06,861
Dad, it hurts.

318
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,822
Master, hurry up.

319
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:11,142
What are you up to?

320
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:12,502
Come on and take a seat.

321
00:17:12,701 --> 00:17:13,622
Master, sit down.

322
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,142
Are you in trouble again?

323
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,742
No!

324
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,861
I don't just get into trouble every day.

325
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,941
Master, if you don't like it,

326
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:23,382
you can't scold me,

327
00:17:23,662 --> 00:17:24,941
and you can't show it.

328
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:32,981
After the fish

329
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:35,022
was cooked by me before,

330
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,581
you have been depressed every day,

331
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:38,461
and always in a daze by the water.

332
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:40,502
So I secretly went to the Mortal World
to catch...

333
00:17:41,622 --> 00:17:43,341
To buy a fish.

334
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,461
It's not an immortal fish though,

335
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:47,502
but a normal fish,

336
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,341
just like me.

337
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:51,101
Even so,

338
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:52,662
it will stay with you

339
00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:53,742
for the rest of the time,

340
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:55,422
until you don't need it,

341
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,181
until it dies.

342
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:04,181
Master, don't leave it behind.

343
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:06,662
You should cherish it
like how you cherished the fish I killed.

344
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,262
By the way, Master,

345
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:09,221
I swear that

346
00:18:09,382 --> 00:18:10,821
I will protect it well

347
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:12,382
and prevent it from being hurt.

348
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:15,221
Who else would hurt it but you?

349
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,861
Then give it a name.

350
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:22,902
It would be called Zi.

351
00:18:23,142 --> 00:18:24,941
You can't eat yourself.

352
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,341
But fish is different from me.

353
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:30,142
I don't want it to be called Zi.

354
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:32,902
I like Zi to keep me company.

355
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:39,861
Which Zi are you talking about?

356
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:08,262
Master, look.

357
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:20,622
The relationship between Chong Zi
and Luo Yinfan

358
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:22,782
progressed very quickly,

359
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,821
even smoother

360
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:27,022
than we planned.

361
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:29,861
The two of them are destined.

362
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,742
Of course it's smooth.

363
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:33,581
How does she treat Wan Jie?

364
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:36,742
It seems that she has realized

365
00:19:37,101 --> 00:19:39,142
that Wan Jie is Chu Bufu.

366
00:19:40,061 --> 00:19:42,262
The person who led her
into the immortal sect

367
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:44,022
has now become a demon.

368
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:45,542
It must be hard

369
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:48,382
for her to let go.

370
00:19:53,302 --> 00:19:55,422
It's best not to let go.

371
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:58,061
Now is the time.

372
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:00,581
It's time to take actions.

373
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:36,941
Tianmo Token.

374
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:38,701
Isn't it sealed?

375
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:40,461
How can it move by itself?

376
00:20:52,022 --> 00:20:53,262
Something's up!

377
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:54,861
Something's up!

378
00:20:57,662 --> 00:20:58,622
Something's up!

379
00:20:58,782 --> 00:20:59,861
Something's up!

380
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:01,302
Tianmo Token...

381
00:21:01,581 --> 00:21:03,221
Something happened to Tianmo Token!

382
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:07,622
Something happened to Tianmo Token!

383
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:08,822
(Patriarch's Hall)

384
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:37,422
Senior.

385
00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:38,662
What happened?

386
00:21:38,742 --> 00:21:41,022
Someone broke into
the Patriarch's Hall last night.

387
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:51,502
(Liuhe Hall)

388
00:21:59,222 --> 00:22:00,502
(Liuhe Hall)

389
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:06,422
Someone broke into
the Patriarch's Hall last night,

390
00:22:06,782 --> 00:22:08,622
trying to cast the blood curse

391
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:10,941
to awaken the Tianmo Token.

392
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:12,502
Tianmo Token?

393
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:21,142
This is not true.

394
00:22:21,662 --> 00:22:23,101
Just a nightmare.

395
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:26,622
The matter of Tianmo Token
is of great importance.

396
00:22:26,902 --> 00:22:28,701
I'm afraid we have a spy
from the Demon World.

397
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:30,101
We have to investigate thoroughly.

398
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:31,662
- Yes.
- Yes.

399
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:14,022
Does any of you know the origin

400
00:23:14,382 --> 00:23:16,382
of the Tianmo Token?

401
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:22,782
I heard of some.

402
00:23:23,622 --> 00:23:24,581
Say it.

403
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:28,422
Decades ago, Demon King
Ni Lun was ambitious.

404
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:30,981
He not only led the demons
to tyrannize the Mortal World,

405
00:23:31,302 --> 00:23:33,061
but also boldly invaded
the Immortal World.

406
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:36,061
Dozens of sects including Tianshan Sect
and Shushan Sect

407
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,302
were hit hard.

408
00:23:37,502 --> 00:23:39,022
Ni Lun even attacked Nanhua,

409
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,782
attempting to enter the Tongtian Portal
and destroy the Six-world Monument.

410
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:43,341
Fortunately, Celestial King of Nanhua

411
00:23:43,461 --> 00:23:45,502
beheaded him

412
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:46,742
with the method of extinction
in Jitian Techniques.

413
00:23:46,861 --> 00:23:49,821
Celestial King of Nanhua was also
injured and passed away.

414
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:53,461
Ni Lun

415
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:55,902
used this Tianmo Token

416
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,821
to summon the demons.

417
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:02,902
The reason why the Demon World
is different today

418
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:07,022
is precisely because
it has been sealed by Ni Lun.

419
00:24:07,382 --> 00:24:09,662
Since then, no Demon King

420
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,142
can use this to summon the demons.

421
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:15,622
I think the most important reason

422
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:17,382
is not because
the Tianmo Token was sealed,

423
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,461
but because

424
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,542
the disciples in the immortal sects
never forget their important responsibilities,

425
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:22,181
keep in mind the teachings
of the Celestial King,

426
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:24,461
and work together
to protect the common people.

427
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:26,861
Therefore, the demons
are no longer rampant,

428
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:28,981
and the world is at peace.

429
00:24:29,022 --> 00:24:29,902
- Right.
- Exactly.

430
00:24:30,022 --> 00:24:32,782
Tianmo Token is cast forbidden technique
by Ni Lun,

431
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:36,581
and only the blood curse cast by
close relatives can unravel it.

432
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,581
Now there is blood on it.

433
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:40,742
Obviously,

434
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:43,662
someone sneaked into
the Patriarch's Hall last night

435
00:24:43,902 --> 00:24:45,542
in an attempt to use the blood curse

436
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,622
to awaken Tianmo Token.

437
00:24:53,422 --> 00:24:55,221
But this person didn't succeed.

438
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:56,821
That being the case,

439
00:24:57,221 --> 00:24:58,581
it is useless to delve into it.

440
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:01,742
Ni Lun had no blood relatives.

441
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:03,742
It's natural for him to fail.

442
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:07,422
It's just that this person
tried to awaken Tianmo Token

443
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:09,142
with evil intentions.

444
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:10,821
If this person is left in Nanhua,

445
00:25:10,902 --> 00:25:12,542
something will happen in the future.

446
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:15,302
As a disciple of Nanhua,

447
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:17,061
this person has evil thoughts.

448
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:20,302
Nanhua will never keep this kind of scum.

449
00:25:21,341 --> 00:25:23,221
If he volunteers to be executed,

450
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:26,542
Sage Tianji and I
will make an exception.

451
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:27,941
Otherwise,

452
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:30,821
we will punish him severely
according to our rules.

453
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:40,341
What?

454
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,981
No one dares to admit?

455
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:44,902
That being the case,

456
00:25:45,382 --> 00:25:47,502
Sage Tianji, please predict

457
00:25:47,941 --> 00:25:49,581
and find out the truth.

458
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,782
No.

459
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:31,581
It's just a dream. It's not real.

460
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:33,821
Why are you still quibbling?
It's obviously you.

461
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:35,542
Could it be possible to fake it?

462
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:36,262
I...

463
00:26:36,382 --> 00:26:37,981
It's not your turn to speak.

464
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:40,902
Mu Yu, as the chief disciple,

465
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:43,181
is this how you teach
your disciples to behave?

466
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:44,742
If you can't teach them well,

467
00:26:45,142 --> 00:26:46,581
I'll take care of it for you.

468
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,061
Miaoyuan contradicted

469
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:51,782
for the sake of Nanhua.

470
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:54,701
The Book of Secrets has reproduced
yesterday's scene.

471
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:57,101
It was Chong Zi who cast the blood curse

472
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,701
in an attempt to awaken Tianmo Token.

473
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:00,662
How long are you going to protect her?

474
00:27:00,941 --> 00:27:01,941
It wasn't me.

475
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,302
I was groggy last night,

476
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,022
as if I had dreamed about this scene.

477
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:07,622
But that was just a dream.

478
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:09,341
I didn't go anywhere last night,

479
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:10,542
just stayed in my room.

480
00:27:10,821 --> 00:27:11,782
And I have nightmares

481
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:13,142
whenever I see Tianmo Token.

482
00:27:13,262 --> 00:27:14,221
I'm even hiding from it,

483
00:27:14,262 --> 00:27:15,542
how could I go look for it?

484
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:16,902
According to what you said,

485
00:27:17,142 --> 00:27:19,502
Sage Tianji got you wrong?

486
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:20,981
It was really not me.

487
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:23,461
It flew towards me by itself.

488
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:25,181
And I never learned

489
00:27:25,262 --> 00:27:26,821
the blood curse.

490
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:30,422
Someone, catch the traitor Chong Zi.

491
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:32,382
Who dares to move?

492
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:39,542
I know my disciple's temperament best.

493
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:40,941
Although she's brave,

494
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:42,581
she doesn't dare to do this,

495
00:27:42,902 --> 00:27:44,302
and she has no reason to do so.

496
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:46,821
How can we be convinced

497
00:27:47,022 --> 00:27:48,542
based on her statement alone?

498
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:54,461
It's really strange.

499
00:27:55,061 --> 00:27:56,622
If Chong Zi deliberately concealed it,

500
00:27:56,782 --> 00:27:57,861
why would she say
such a credible statement

501
00:27:57,981 --> 00:27:59,502
like a nightmare?

502
00:28:00,061 --> 00:28:00,941
I remember that

503
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,622
Demon King Ni Lun had subordinates

504
00:28:02,701 --> 00:28:04,581
who are good at the nightmare technique,

505
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:06,382
and they can manipulate people's minds.

506
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:09,581
Chong Zi may have been hit
by the nightmare technique.

507
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:10,542
Nonsense.

508
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:12,461
Nanhua is heavily guarded,

509
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:14,341
and there are mythical creatures
guarding the mountain.

510
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:17,542
How can the spies
of the Demon World get in?

511
00:28:19,022 --> 00:28:21,422
Since Sage Tianji can reproduce
what happened yesterday,

512
00:28:21,662 --> 00:28:22,581
he will also be able to determine

513
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,422
whether Chong Zi was haunted
by the nightmare technique.

514
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:30,422
I am willing to let Sage Tianji check.

515
00:28:30,662 --> 00:28:31,502
Councilor.

516
00:28:33,941 --> 00:28:34,981
That being the case,

517
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,981
we can first put Chong Zi
in the Immortal Prison

518
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:38,981
to separate her from the Tianmo Token.

519
00:28:39,662 --> 00:28:40,581
We will talk about other things

520
00:28:40,782 --> 00:28:42,461
in detail later.

521
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:45,142
What do you think?

522
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:49,101
My master would agree.

523
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:50,622
As long as I can prove my innocence,

524
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:52,382
I am willing to cooperate with anything.

525
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:55,662
It's just that if the truth comes out,

526
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:57,981
Councilor Sage, please be impartial,

527
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:00,142
and don't use evil breath
to blame me casually.

528
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:01,101
You!

529
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:10,382
Are you really willing to

530
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:12,262
go to Immortal Prison?

531
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:14,101
Suffering is nothing

532
00:29:14,382 --> 00:29:15,662
compared to innocence.

533
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,221
Besides, I believe that Master

534
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:18,742
will uphold justice for me.

535
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:21,382
You are worthy of being my disciple.

536
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:50,302
As the disciple of Sage Chonghua,

537
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,382
you never practice martial arts with us.

538
00:29:53,022 --> 00:29:54,061
It just so happens that

539
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:55,902
our masters are not here today.

540
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:57,581
Show me

541
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,662
what supreme spells
Sage Chonghua taught you.

542
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:01,382
I don't want to fight with you.

543
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:02,581
But I do.

544
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,782
Aren't you with evil breath?

545
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:06,181
Don't hold yourself.

546
00:30:06,382 --> 00:30:08,101
Just show us.

547
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:11,262
Or if you call me senior

548
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:13,061
and say that you are not worthy
to be Sage Chonghua's disciple,

549
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:14,221
I will let you go.

550
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:15,382
It's a pity that

551
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:17,221
I am the only disciple of my master.

552
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:18,422
Luo Yinfan's disciple

553
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:19,821
will never be competitive,

554
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:21,302
let alone hurt others.

555
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:24,502
How do you deserve to be Nanhua's senior?

556
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:29,981
Really?

557
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:47,101
How dare you bully her,

558
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,341
and abuse the lynching of your disciple?

559
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:50,742
Young Master Zhuo, you got us wrong.

560
00:30:51,262 --> 00:30:53,022
We are just punishing her for Nanhua.

561
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,022
Punish?

562
00:30:54,181 --> 00:30:55,861
What qualifications do you have
to punish Chong Zi?

563
00:30:56,302 --> 00:30:58,181
You may not know.

564
00:30:58,461 --> 00:31:00,782
Chong Zi attempted
to steal the Tianmo Token.

565
00:31:01,262 --> 00:31:03,022
Councilor Sage ordered us
to send her to the Immortal Prison

566
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:04,502
without delay.

567
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:06,622
Ignore them.

568
00:31:06,861 --> 00:31:08,861
Chong Zi, I will take you away.

569
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:18,821
I can't go with you.

570
00:31:19,142 --> 00:31:21,101
Otherwise, it would be difficult for me
to prove my innocence.

571
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:23,022
I promised to wait for Master.

572
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,742
He will pick me up in a few days.

573
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:26,581
I believe in him.

574
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:28,061
If I go with you,

575
00:31:28,341 --> 00:31:29,782
where can he find me?

576
00:31:29,902 --> 00:31:31,742
Why are you talking about
your master all the time?

577
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:33,861
You care so much about him,
but what about him?

578
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:36,422
He leaves you at the mercy of others.

579
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:38,981
In the end, it's you who suffers.

580
00:31:39,422 --> 00:31:40,382
Young Master Zhuo, you'd better

581
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:42,061
not meddle in our affairs.

582
00:31:42,142 --> 00:31:42,902
Please make way

583
00:31:43,022 --> 00:31:44,742
and facilitate my work.

584
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,142
If you insist on stopping us,

585
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:48,422
don't blame us for offending you.

586
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,341
Let's go. Ignore them.

587
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:11,262
She's mine.

588
00:32:20,461 --> 00:32:21,142
Chong Zi!

589
00:32:25,622 --> 00:32:26,542
It's all your fault.

590
00:32:26,782 --> 00:32:28,181
If you hadn't been
meddling in our business,

591
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:30,181
Chong Zi wouldn't have been taken away
by Wan Jie at all.

592
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:32,061
I have to report to Sage Chonghua now.

593
00:32:42,341 --> 00:32:44,302
Are you still suspecting that
it is a nightmare technique?

594
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,701
But Senior said that

595
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:49,461
Nanhua was heavily guarded.

596
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,581
How could the disciples
of the immortal sect

597
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:52,422
know the spells of the demons?

598
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:55,061
What if there is an escaped criminal?

599
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:57,341
What happened

600
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:59,142
before Chong Zi
entered the Patriarch's Hall?

601
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:00,782
Did you find any clues

602
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:02,262
in the Book of Secrets?

603
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:05,101
If it granted whatever is requested,

604
00:33:05,221 --> 00:33:06,742
it wouldn't be called Book of Secrets.

605
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:08,821
It will take some time

606
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:10,542
to know the leads you want.

607
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,941
But I always feel that this matter

608
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:16,061
is aimed at your disciple.

609
00:33:19,902 --> 00:33:21,022
Mr. Luo.

610
00:33:23,861 --> 00:33:24,941
Just now came the urgent report that

611
00:33:25,181 --> 00:33:26,022
Sima Miaoyuan and the others

612
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:28,061
were attacked on the way
to send Chong Zi away.

613
00:33:28,142 --> 00:33:28,941
Chong Zi

614
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:30,701
was robbed by Wan Jie.

615
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,341
(What is this place?)

616
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:09,701
(Because before being a demon,)

617
00:35:10,181 --> 00:35:11,421
(Wan Jie was Chu Bufu,)

618
00:35:11,502 --> 00:35:13,742
(the famous chief disciple
of Changsheng Palace)

619
00:35:14,742 --> 00:35:16,621
(as well as your Mr. Immortal.)

620
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:19,742
Who are you?

621
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:26,901
I met you once in Panhai Town.

622
00:35:27,262 --> 00:35:30,022
You were an immortal back then.

623
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,502
Piss off.

624
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:33,181
Do you still remember

625
00:35:33,221 --> 00:35:34,102
the beggar you rescued

626
00:35:34,181 --> 00:35:35,901
in Panhai Town?

627
00:35:36,782 --> 00:35:37,981
They all bullied me,

628
00:35:38,062 --> 00:35:39,421
stoned me,

629
00:35:39,742 --> 00:35:41,381
and even tried to pluck my eyes.

630
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:50,862
I have been looking for you
all these years,

631
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:53,461
and I just want to say thank you
to you personally.

632
00:35:54,461 --> 00:35:55,862
Although your appearance has changed,

633
00:35:56,022 --> 00:35:57,181
I know that

634
00:35:57,342 --> 00:35:59,181
you are Chu Bufu,

635
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:00,782
the chief disciple of Changsheng Palace.

636
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:09,421
There is no Chu Bufu here,

637
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:12,141
only the Demon King Wan Jie.

638
00:36:12,342 --> 00:36:14,302
It doesn't matter if you don't admit it.

639
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:18,342
I'm not afraid of you.

640
00:36:19,582 --> 00:36:21,381
My magical skills are very powerful now,

641
00:36:21,782 --> 00:36:22,421
and I am no longer

642
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:24,342
that beggar
who allowed others to bully me.

643
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:32,022
Born with evil breath.

644
00:36:32,782 --> 00:36:34,621
No wonder Luo Yinfan wants you.

645
00:36:35,022 --> 00:36:36,661
Since you don't admit that
you are Mr. Immortal,

646
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:38,621
there is no need for me
to get close to you.

647
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:40,582
You are the Demon King.

648
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,661
I am just a humble disciple

649
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,102
of Nanhua.

650
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:45,381
What good would it do you to kidnap me?

651
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:51,221
So noisy.

652
00:36:53,302 --> 00:36:55,141
If you could be quiet,

653
00:36:56,342 --> 00:36:58,221
I might save your life.

654
00:37:00,582 --> 00:37:01,941
Tell me

655
00:37:03,022 --> 00:37:04,221
why.

656
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:21,461
According to what you said,

657
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,381
you want Chong Zi to fend for herself?

658
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,221
She intentionally
approached Tianmo Token,

659
00:37:25,421 --> 00:37:27,062
which was obviously
out of sheer scheming.

660
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:28,901
If you hadn't blindly protected her,

661
00:37:29,221 --> 00:37:31,102
she would have been kicked out
of Nanhua long ago.

662
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:33,062
Now it is her fate

663
00:37:33,262 --> 00:37:34,621
to be robbed by Wan Jie,

664
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:36,181
and she cannot blame anyone else.

665
00:37:36,661 --> 00:37:38,102
Others will be of no use.

666
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:39,381
I will be looking for her myself.

667
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:40,701
Yinfan.

668
00:37:44,901 --> 00:37:46,062
Yinfan.

669
00:37:47,262 --> 00:37:48,661
She is like this now,

670
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:51,542
and you still insist on finding her
and saving her with all your strength.

671
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:53,701
Not to mention how ruthless

672
00:37:53,782 --> 00:37:55,221
Wan Jie is

673
00:37:55,302 --> 00:37:57,381
and how hard to find the hiding place,

674
00:37:58,102 --> 00:37:59,661
just because you risk your life

675
00:37:59,742 --> 00:38:01,022
in order to find Chong Zi

676
00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:04,221
is already breaking the rules.

677
00:38:04,502 --> 00:38:05,421
Rules?

678
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:07,102
Councilor,

679
00:38:07,342 --> 00:38:09,302
if I can't even protect my own disciple,

680
00:38:09,502 --> 00:38:11,782
how can I protect the Immortal World
and the common people?

681
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:26,221
Someone.

682
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:31,782
Yes, sir.

683
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:33,302
Send an order

684
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:34,661
to let all the disciples

685
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:36,782
find Chong Zi's whereabouts.

686
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,502
Once there is news about her,

687
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:39,862
report to me as soon as possible.

688
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:41,302
Yes.

689
00:38:42,181 --> 00:38:43,022
Wait.

690
00:38:52,141 --> 00:38:52,901
Remember.

691
00:38:53,502 --> 00:38:54,822
Report to me

692
00:38:55,582 --> 00:38:57,102
as soon as you find
Chong Zi's whereabouts.

693
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:00,062
Don't let anyone else know, understand?

694
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:11,822
Chong Zi

695
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:15,221
is just the nemesis in Yinfan's life.

696
00:39:19,862 --> 00:39:21,022
Hand over Chong Zi.

697
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:22,862
Otherwise don't blame me for being rude.

698
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:29,221
Why are you here?

699
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:31,542
I didn't expect you

700
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:32,981
to look for your disciple.

701
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:34,342
I should ask you this.

702
00:39:34,461 --> 00:39:35,461
Ask me?

703
00:39:35,742 --> 00:39:37,181
If you hadn't sent Chong Zi
to the Immortal Prison,

704
00:39:37,421 --> 00:39:38,822
she wouldn't have encountered this.

705
00:39:39,022 --> 00:39:40,141
There is no need for outsiders

706
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:41,621
to intervene in my disciple's affairs.

707
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:43,502
You lost your disciple.

708
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,822
Yet you come to Demon King Hall.

709
00:39:46,941 --> 00:39:48,542
Isn't it ridiculous?

710
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:52,582
Hand over Wan Jie.

711
00:39:52,981 --> 00:39:54,181
Otherwise,

712
00:39:54,582 --> 00:39:56,062
I will slaughter
your Demon Palace today.

713
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,022
Wan Jie is not here.

714
00:39:59,782 --> 00:40:01,661
It's useless for you to make trouble here.

715
00:40:01,862 --> 00:40:03,302
It is impossible for you not to know.

716
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,381
Wan Jie is arrogant

717
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:06,981
as the Demon King,

718
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:08,941
and disdains to be with us.

719
00:40:09,302 --> 00:40:10,701
The Land of Tribulations

720
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,461
is a place that is
neither in the Immortal World

721
00:40:12,742 --> 00:40:14,461
nor in the Demon World.

722
00:40:25,221 --> 00:40:27,342
Is my tip too obvious?

723
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:34,901
Mr. Zhuo, is there something else?

724
00:40:35,421 --> 00:40:36,302
If you're late,

725
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:38,502
Luo Yinfan will take the lead.

726
00:40:38,661 --> 00:40:41,102
Today I will spare your lives.

727
00:40:41,262 --> 00:40:43,862
I will teach you a lesson next time.
