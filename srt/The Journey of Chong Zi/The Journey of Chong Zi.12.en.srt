28
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,240
(Chonghua Palace)

29
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,001
Senior Mu, are you here to see Mr. Luo?

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,880
I heard that Mr. Luo had not come down
from the mountain for a few days.

31
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,800
Master asked me to take a look.

32
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,281
It is good that he has not
come down from the mountain.

33
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:21,600
These days

34
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:24,281
he's not in the mood.

35
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,281
Because of Chong Zi?

36
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,841
You heard about it too?

37
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:32,481
Yu Xuzi saw her with Wan Jie,

38
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:34,121
and said that she launched an attack.

39
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:35,600
Yu Xuzi is such a villain.

40
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,361
His words can't be trusted.

41
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:39,240
There must be some misunderstanding.

42
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:42,361
Chong Zi wouldn't do it for no reason.

43
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,281
- Do you know her so well?
- I...

44
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:48,201
What are you doing here?

45
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:51,841
Mr. Luo.

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,361
My disciple

47
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:57,001
doesn't need to be judged by others.

48
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,600
I like peace.

49
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,680
Please leave the mountain
if you have nothing to do.

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Mr. Luo, please stay.

51
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,400
Since you are Chong Zi's master,

52
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:08,361
no matter what others say,

53
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:09,761
you will stand by her side,

54
00:04:09,921 --> 00:04:11,361
and believe her unconditionally, right?

55
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,841
Whether I believe in her or not,

56
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:14,440
it's none of your business.

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,361
A few days ago,

58
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:23,481
he said he didn't have this disciple.

59
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,761
It seems he still has her in his heart.

60
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:37,801
(I was so good to you,)

61
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:39,681
(but you left me)

62
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:41,681
(to keep your promise with someone else.)

63
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,120
(You just think I always spoil you)

64
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,600
(so you do whatever you want.)

65
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,961

suffer a little outside.)

Xichun Restaurant.)

71
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:50,681
Try it.

72
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,840
Why does it taste different
from my imagination?

73
00:05:57,961 --> 00:05:59,320
Master, stop eating it.

74
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,801
But I've done so.

75
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:02,641

76
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,040

to you and your disciple.

I'm just sending
the vine flute as agreed.

Did you encounter any danger

on Buzhou Mountain?

I have presented the flute.

As for what you should do next,

139
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:29,480
you should know it

00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,440

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,401

then you're really

145
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:41,041
pushing her into the abyss of disaster.

146
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:45,961
It's not too late,

147

Are you going to

Councilor prevents all sects
from sharing information,

150
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,961
and even ordered your disciples
to deceive me.

151
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,800
I can only make my own decision.

152
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,320
Councilor has good intentions.

153
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,641
He's afraid that you can't
make decisions being involved in it.

154
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
Yes.

155
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,401
Since she used the Spirit Seal

156
00:12:22,601 --> 00:12:24,041
to help Wan Jie escape,

157
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,601
it proved that

158
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:27,961
she was not under
the threat of Wan Jie at all.

159
00:12:27,961 --> 00:12:30,480
She has long been
associated with the demons.

160
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
If she is really related to the demons,

161
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,641
then according to you,

162
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:37,401
should I bring her back

163
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,480
and execute her on the spot,

164
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,480
so that you can completely
dispel the doubts?

165
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:42,201
Well...

166
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,440
We didn't mean that.

167
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,240
Since you are her master,

168
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,800
it is natural for you to deal with her.

169
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:56,641
Yinfan, we are just worried about you.

170
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:59,240
But have you figured out

171
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,161
how to break through
the boundary of the Land of Tribulations?

172
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,680
I have my own plan.

173
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:44,680
Do you remember the game

174
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,601
you used to play with me
when I was a child?

175
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Yes, I do.

176
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:50,281
When you were a child,

177
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:51,841
you always let me play that with you.

178
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,360
I'm going to hide.

179

Maybe we've done
too many wrong things.

I'm tired.

Chong Zi,

233
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,200
I have something to tell you.

234
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,641
I'm afraid if I don't say it,

235
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:31,000
it will be too late.

236
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:33,521
Over these years,

237
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:35,521
I've been lost in my mind.

238
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,600
Looking back,

239
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:40,480
it's like a lifetime ago.

240
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,761
I still remember

241
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:47,200
when my master ordered me to take
3,000 disciples of Changsheng Palace

242
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:48,960
to Kunlun

243
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:51,641
to escort the demon sword to Nanhua.

244
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,480
Unexpectedly, while passing
through Chenzhou,

245
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,561
something bad happened
in the middle of the night.

246
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,561
Master and my brothers

247
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,720
were also killed by the demon sword.

248
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,880
They went too much.

249
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,880
They took advantage
of your desire to save others

250
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,441
and made you become a demon.

251
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:26,041
Since the demon sword has its real host,

252
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,120
who is he?

253
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:34,480
When we first met,

254
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,840
I noticed the evil breath in you.

255
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,120
But at that time,

256
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:43,921
you were so pitifully bullied,
and your body was covered in wounds.

257
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:46,681
I wanted you to stop being bullied.

258
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:50,120
So I cast a small spell

259
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,281
on you.

260
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,200
So that your evil breath

261
00:20:54,441 --> 00:20:56,321
would not be seen.

262
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,240
And Tian Zhixie couldn't find you.

263
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:02,801
But by mistake,

264
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:04,840
you ran into me.

265
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,960
It's all my fault.

266
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:10,401
Not only did my evil breath

267
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,401
hurt myself,

268
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,761
but also hurt you in the dark.

269
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,561
You didn't hurt me.

270
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:19,281
I helped you that day,

271
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and I never regretted it.

272
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:24,761
If the Ni Lun's Sword is not purified,

273
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:26,921
there will be no end of trouble.

274
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:30,761
I know what I should do,

275
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,521
but I still did the wrong thing.

276
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,641
After all,

277
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,720
it's because I haven't cultivated enough.

278
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,720
Later,

279
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,480
the news of the death
of 3,000 disciples spread,

280
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,120
several murders
occurred one after another,

281
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,921
and countless people
were killed by the demon sword.

282
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,360
The Immortal World blamed

283
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,441
all the sins on me alone.

284
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,441
Finally,

285
00:22:03,681 --> 00:22:06,600
I also lost my mind
because of the demon sword

286
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,880
and have been acting
recklessly ever since.

287
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:11,880
Chong Zi,

288
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,240
don't make the same mistake I did.

289
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:16,720
Uncle,

290
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,161
why are you suddenly telling me this?

291
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:21,321
At that time, the Ni Lun's Sword

292
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
forced me to make a vow.

293
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,321
Once I tell you about
the sword sacrifice,

294
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:30,161
I will die.

295
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,641
Uncle.

296
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,041
Chong Zi.

297
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:34,801
After I die,

298
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,041
take it back to atone for your sin.

299
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,120
Stay well with your master.

300
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:42,561
You must be very careful.

301
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,761
Don't listen to its bewitchment

302
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:47,161
until it is purified.

303
00:22:47,281 --> 00:22:48,761
Uncle, it's okay.

304
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:50,200
Let's hand over this harmful sword

305
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,401
to them together.

306
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,161
There's still a way back.

307
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:54,281
Master.

308
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:57,281
Master, he will help us.

309
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:00,281
In this world,

310
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,200
all the people
are fighting for this sword.

311
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,761
But they don't know that

312
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:08,600
the demon scent in the sword

313
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,521
has long been boarded in my body.

314
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,480
It is just

315
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,360
a piece of rotten iron.

316
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:20,360
But I am the host of this demon sword.

317
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:21,880
Let me do it for you.

318
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,041
You won't like this kind of life.

319
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,921
Chong Zi,

320
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,240
promise me,

321
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:29,880
don't become a demon.

322
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,240
I didn't save you

323
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:35,000
to see you repeat my mistakes.

324
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:36,641
Uncle,

325
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,041
I promise you, don't go.

326
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,080
Don't leave me alone.

327
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,921
Uncle.

328
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,521
Uncle.

329
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:46,281
Chongzi.

330
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,921
Chongzi,

331
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,921
you'll have to go

332
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,641
on your own.

333
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,641
Don't become a demon.

334
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,801
Remember,

335
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,521
if you live,

336
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:02,840
I live.

337
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,200
As for me,

338
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:07,600
I chose the wrong path,

339
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:11,161
that's the truth.

340
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,641
From now on,

341
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:17,080
there will be no Chu Bufu,

342
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:20,281
and no Wan Jie.

343
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:31,281
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

344
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:33,561
Wake up.

345
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:35,521
Uncle.

346
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:38,921
Uncle.

347
00:25:00,761 --> 00:25:02,321
Uncle.

348
00:25:13,921 --> 00:25:14,921
Chong.

349
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,441
Master.

350
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,161
Master,

351
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:33,880
why did Uncle suffer this?

352
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,641
He was kinder than anyone else, and...

353
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:37,641
Chong,

354
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:40,720
I know.

355
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:44,080
It's not your fault.

356
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:48,801
Since he took the wrong step,

357
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,561
many things have been doomed.

358
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:53,720
This is his choice.

359
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,921
It has nothing to do with you.

360
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:05,281
(This is)

361
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,161
(his primordial spirit.)

362
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:33,720
Uncle.

363
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:35,600
Chong,

364
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,921
don't be sad.

365
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:40,641
Your uncle didn't leave you completely.

366
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,801
The last trace of his primordial spirit

367
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,240
is still in this sword.

368
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,120
Master,

369
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:51,281
are you really not lying to me?

370
00:26:51,641 --> 00:26:52,801
I will find a way

371
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,761
to separate the primordial spirit
from the demon sword.

372
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,801
As long as the primordial spirit
is still alive,

373
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,561
maybe

374
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,801
he still has a chance to be reborn.

375
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,840
Chong Zi returns to Nanhua
with the Ni Lun's Sword.

376
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:22,960
So everyone in Nanhua

377
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,041
will not blame her for
trying to awaken the Tianmo Token.

378
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Naturally,

379
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,521
there is no need
to send her to the Immortal Prison.

380
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:34,801
Finally, this day has come!

381
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:36,761
Senior,

382
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:40,161
Ni Lun's Sword has returned to Nanhua,

383
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:43,600
we have finally completed your last wish.

384
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:45,360
Master,

385
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:48,120
after all, Yinfan and I
didn't let you down.

386
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:49,561
Although it is long overdue,

387
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:51,880
we have finally found
Ni Lun's Sword back.

388
00:29:52,161 --> 00:29:53,521
It is not in vain that

389
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:55,801
we have protected
the Wufang Pearl for all these years.

390
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,401
Chu Bufu was asked to get the sword,

391
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:01,200
unexpectedly,

392
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,360
it turned out like this.

393
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,681
Yinfan,

394
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,080
we won the battle against Wan Jie.

395
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,801
And we got back the demon sword.

396
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,921
You deserve a lot of credit!

397
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:18,681
But,

398
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,641
your disciple

399
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,281
is really disturbing.

400
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,480
Not only did she

401
00:30:25,681 --> 00:30:27,321
try to awaken the Tianmo Token,

402
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:29,880
but she also got tangled up with Wan Jie.

403
00:30:30,321 --> 00:30:32,641
Luckily, Wan Jie is dead,

404
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,600
and she got back the Ni Lun's Sword.

405
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,641
So we

406
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,281
let her go.

407
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
But,

408
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:42,240
I have to remind you.

409
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,840
She was born with evil breath,

410
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,960
and has been coveted by the demons.

411
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,281
The demons won't just stop.

412
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,240
I'm afraid...

413
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:51,240
Sir,

414
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:54,041
leave me alone.

415
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:30,720
He's like this again.

416
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,321
He just won't admit that
Chong Zi made a mistake.

417
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:35,880
After all these things,

418
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,041
I feel that Chong Zi is more obedient.

419
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,041
As soon as she came back,

420
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,000
she stayed in confinement on Zizhu Peak.

421
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:42,600
You shouldn't have said those things

422
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,161
to upset Yinfan.

423
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,161
Hope he can understand.

424
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:13,960
Every time we met,

425
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,720
we never had a chance to talk.

426
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,360
After you became a demon,

427
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:24,880
I had imagined when I saw you again,

428
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:28,200
how you would answer.

429
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:30,801
But when I saw you,

430
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,000
it was always as if you didn't know me.

431
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:39,960
Maybe

432
00:32:41,281 --> 00:32:43,480
I never understood you,

433
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,761
and didn't want to admit your suffering.

434
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,761
For this,

435
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:54,761
I'm not as good as Chong.

436
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,681
I apologize to you.

437
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,041
People only think of the gods

438
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:14,681
when they are desperate.

439
00:33:15,521 --> 00:33:17,480
If we are not missed by people,

440
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:20,321
it is a happy occasion for people.

441
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,000
That's true.

442
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:29,801
So,

443
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,120
we just need to do our job well.

444
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:34,561
Just like you have cultivated
the Wufang Pearl,

445
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:37,161
and I'll go get the demon sword.

446
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,840
After this separation,

447
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,840
there will be several years
in the Mortal World.

448
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,080
I heard something about
you and her from Chong.

449
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,720
Thank you for taking care of her.

450
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:56,080
In order not to let others
die for the sword,

451
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,641
you imprisoned
your last primordial spirit

452
00:33:58,641 --> 00:33:59,921
in the sword,

453
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,041
and endured the curse forever.

454
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,401
When the demon sword
is completely purified,

455
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,600
you will disappear.

456
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,840
Except for me and Chong,

457
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:16,121
no one knows what you have done.

458
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:20,680
(Take good care of Chong in the future.)

459
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,121
(She)

460
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,440
(doesn't treat you just as her master.)

461
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,121
Master.

462
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:07,960
You're back.

463
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,601
Let me bring you some cakes.

464
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
Why don't I

465
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:43,561
make Jade Wheel Cakes for you?

466
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,720
Master?

467
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,081
Why is Master here?

468
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,160
Such bad cakes

469
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,400
will only annoy Master.

470
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:37,680
Where did you get this fruit?

471
00:36:38,081 --> 00:36:39,361
Master, you've forgotten that

472
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,881
this was given by Sage Tianji last time.

473
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,561
I don't want to eat it.

474
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,400
Then I won't bother you.

475
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,400
I'm leaving.

476
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,321
(Why am I angry?)

477
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,801
Jade Wheel Cakes?

478
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,680
Where's the improvement?

479
00:37:44,121 --> 00:37:45,160
It tastes horrible.

480
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,121
(It's rare that she is so filial.)

481
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,361
Zi,

482
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:15,321
the more I care about Master,

483
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,400
the more I can't do anything right.

484
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,440
When I was in the Land of Tribulations,

485
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:21,881
I always looked forward to
coming back to see Master.

486
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:23,841
But now I'm back,

487
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,480
and Master is so cold to me.

488
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:29,920
Life here

489
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,081
is even more difficult than
that in the Land of Tribulations.
