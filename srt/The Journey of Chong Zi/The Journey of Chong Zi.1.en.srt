(sunlight and moonlight flooded the earth.）

3
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:12,009
(The creatures multiplied)

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,249
(and formed the six worlds.)

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,049
(Among them, God World
cast the Six-world Monument,)

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,329
(which not only maintained the peace
of the whole world,)

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,169
(but also represented the rules and truths.)

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,409
(Until the destruction of the God World
30,000 years ago,)

9
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,809
(the Immortal World, headed
by Nanhua Sword Clan,)

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,890
(continued to guard the Six-world Monument
for the world.)

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,530
(And the Demon World, which had always
been eroded by the turbid air,)

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,570
(was bent on subverting the six worlds,)

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,050
(resetting the rules,)

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,769
(and trying to make the world
a world of demons.)

(Demon King Ni Lun)

45

(Immortal Yunqiu, Nanhua)
(summoned all the demons)

(Ni Lun, Demon King)

47
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,730
(to attack Nanhua
from the Tongtian Portal,)

48
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,850
(intending to destroy
the Six-World Monument.)

49
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:40,010
(The Nanhua Sword Clan,
headed by Immortal Yunqiu,)

50
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:41,609
(resisted with all their strength)

51
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:44,570
(and paid a heavy price.)

52

Shui Ji.

No!

55
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,650
Shui Ji.

56
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,770
No!

57
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,290
No!

58
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,409
(In the end,)

59
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:29,370
(with the help of Ni Lun's wife Shui Ji,)

60
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:34,370
(Immortal Yunqiu killed Ni Lun
with the ultimate method,)

61
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,770
(Yu Du, Sage Tianji)
(-and died together with him. - Shui Ji.)

62
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:52,969
Master.

63
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:53,930
(After that,)

64
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,329
(his discipline Luo Yinfan, Sage Chonghua,)

65
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,770
(inherited the mantle of Immortal Yunqiu)

66
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:00,290
(and became the new head)

67
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:01,689
(of the Immortal World.)

68
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,130
Master.

69
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,930
(However, although Ni Lun's body died,)

70
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,210
(his last trace of magic power)

71
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:30,770
(was injected into Ni Lun's sword.)

72
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,250
(The Immortal World sealed the sword)

73
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,729
(at the bottom of Kunlun Mountain.)

74
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:38,370
(The Tianmo Token,)

75
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,210
(which can use demonic blood
to summon all demons,)

76
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,129
(was sealed in the Nanhua Patriarch's Hall)

77
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,889
(to prevent future troubles.)

78
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,170
(14 years later)

79
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,210
(Panhai Town)

80
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:57,650
Stop!

81
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,009
Stop!

82
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,729
Don't run!

83
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:38,650
How dare you steal
the steamed stuffed bun?

84
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,449
No.

85
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,210
A guest gave it to me.

86
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:42,690
You are just a scourge.

87
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,289
- You stole it.
- Help!

88
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,049
We have to

89
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,250
teach you a lesson.

90
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,449
Even immortals can't save you, beggar.

91
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:55,449
Does anyone

92
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:57,329
really

93
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,250
believe in immortals?

94
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,449
To tell the truth,

95
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,449
aren't you and me

96
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,329
right by their side?

97
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,009
People only think about immortals

98
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,410
when they are desperate.

99
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,690
If no one thinks about us,

100
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,129
that's good news.

101
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,849
It makes sense.

102
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,410
So

103
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,569
we just need to do our part.

104
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,289
You have refined Wufang Pearls.

105
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:34,810
And I will go on to get the demon sword.

106
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:38,410
After our farewell this time,

107
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,690
there will be several reincarnations
in the mortal world.

108
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,049
(Help me.)

109
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,970
(All the joys and pains of the moment)

110
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,250
(are nothing but passing clouds.)

111
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,810
(Some people enjoy wealth and honor,)

112
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,690
(while others live like nobody.)

113
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,569
Help.

114
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:33,729
Help. Help.

115
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,009
Help me.

116
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:37,810
Help.

117
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,770
(Even immortals can't save you.)

118
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,169
(Beggar.)

119
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,810
I don't believe in immortals at all.

120
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:47,930
There are no immortals in this world.

121
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,569
Even if

122
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:54,970
there are,

123
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,250
they are deaf, blind,

124
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,930
bloodless and fleshless.

125
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:00,930
Immortals should also accept their fate.

126
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,889
It is not necessarily a good thing

127
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,490
to be blindly compassionate.

128
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:06,169
Am I right, Luo?

129
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:08,930
Luo.

130
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,970
- Help me.
- Luo.

131
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:12,410
Help me.

132
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,690
Help me.

133
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:40,970
Wait.

134
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,249
Are you here to save me?

135
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,530
Sorry.

136
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:51,809
Never mind.

137
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:07,850
Benefactor.

138
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,170
Are you an immortal?

139
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:10,410
If so,

140
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,929
can you grant me a wish?

141
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:12,929
I...

142
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:16,929
Take a rest.

143
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:44,610
Didn't I die?

144
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,809
No way.

145
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,369
Was that

146
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,009
a dream?

147
00:10:00,489 --> 00:10:01,689
I'm really fine.

148
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,650
It was not a dream.

149
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,249
There are indeed immortals.

150
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:17,530
Give it to me.

151
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:18,650
Mine looks better.

152
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,249
Come over.

153
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,650
(The place I went to last time)

154
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,249
(was unattended)

155
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:28,730
(and you could eat anything.)

156
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:29,929
(And they can't catch me.)

157
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,050
(I'll take you there next time.)

158
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:36,809
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

159
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:37,689
Give it back to me.

160
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:38,689
Come and get it.

161
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,410
Give it back to me.

162
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,329
Chongzi, good for you.

163
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:44,569
You learned to steal.

164
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,530
I didn't steal it.

165
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,929
It's from an immortal.

166
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,090
Immortal?

167
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:53,689
Give it back to me.

168
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,290
I haven't settled with you

169
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,369
for poking my eyes last time.

170
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:01,770
Beat her.

171
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,569
Come on.

172
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,410
Harder.

173
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:38,489
A monster?

174
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,610
- Monster!
- Monster!

175
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:40,650
- Monster!
- Kill her!

176
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:41,970
- Kill her!
- Monster!

177
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,249
- Monster!
- Kill her!

178
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:44,850
(What happened just now?)

179
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:52,050
(Monster!)

180
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,290
(Harder.)

181
00:11:57,449 --> 00:11:58,369
(Monster!)

182
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:01,249
(Keep going.)

183
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,689
He's indeed an immortal.

184
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,170
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

185
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:22,329
- Let's go.
- Hurry up.

186
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:28,850
Step aside.

187
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:02,889
Not him.

188
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:04,569
Who are you talking about?

189
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:06,850
I mean...

190
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:08,489
Are you also an immortal?

191
00:13:11,369 --> 00:13:12,290
Thank you for saving me.

192
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,610
Good-looking brother.

193
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,090
Did you have an evil thought just now?

194
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,530
You can be angry when you are bullied,

195
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,449
but never think of
harming someone's life.

196
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:22,610
Do you know?

197
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,449
Why do they

198
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:29,369
call you Chongzi?
[*Literally a little bug]

199
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:33,249
My surname is Chong.
I'm not called Chongzi.

200
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,170
They make fun of me by my name.

201
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:36,569
Chongzi.

202
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,809
This way,

203
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,530
no one will dare to bully you anymore.

204
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,449
There are really immortals.

205
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:58,009
Are you an immortal?

206
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:58,770
Well.

207
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,569
Can I also be an immortal?

208
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:01,850
Before becoming an immortal,

209
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,369
one must first learn to cultivate
immortal bones.

210
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:06,210
Immortal bones?

211
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,170
How to cultivate immortal bones?

212
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:10,210
May I?

213
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,850
As long as the heart is kind,

214
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:14,329
everyone can cultivate immortal bones.

215
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,290
If so,

216
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:19,770
could you tell me

217
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:20,730
how to

218
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:22,090
cultivate immortal bones?

219
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,290
The closest place to here is

220
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,850
Nanhua Mountain.

221
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,889
Recently, Nanhua Sect
is accepting disciples.

222
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,730
All kids can take a try.

223
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,730
But

224
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,050
whether you can succeed
in apprenticeship

225
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,170
depends on you.

226
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,569
I'm willing to try
whenever I get the chance.

227
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,650
No matter how difficult it is,
I'm not afraid.

228
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,249
I suddenly feel that

229
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:55,249
the fearlessness in your eyes

230
00:14:56,249 --> 00:14:57,530
looks like a friend of mine.

231
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,850
Is he also an immortal?

232
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,530
Yes.

233
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,129
But his thinking

234
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:04,730
is different from

235
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:05,770
other immortals in the Immortal World.

236
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,489
What a pity.

237
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,369
I hope you can find

238
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,929
a good master.

239
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,730
(Panhai Town)
(Dou, look.)

240
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,610
(Panhai Town)
(What's this?)

241
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,329
(Dessert of Xichun Restaurant!)

242
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,889
(Chongzi, good for you.)

243
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,009
Show me mercy.

244
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,530
Show me mercy.

245
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,809
Thank you.

246
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,210
I promised Mr. Immortal

247
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,410
to be kind.

248
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:06,369
In this way,
I can cultivate immortal bones

249
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,489
- and become an immortal.
- How could you believe that?

250
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,449
Did you meet a liar?

251
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:11,610
To be honest,

252
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,129
I met two immortals.

253
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:17,610
One is soft-spoken

254
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,809
and treats me very well.

255
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,249
The other...

256
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:24,970
Sorry.

257
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:26,809
Never mind.

258
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:36,489
I really want to see him again.

259
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,850
So what?

260
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,210
Who would recognize

261
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,770
a dirty little girl like you?

262
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,090
Dou, how dare you laugh at me?

263
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,170
Look at you.
You have mud all over your face.

264
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,929
How can I get food

265
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,489
without this muddy face?

266
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,090
Let me make you more.

267
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,889
I...

268
00:16:58,929 --> 00:16:59,929
What are you doing?

269
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:12,930
Dou.

270
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,089
Dou.

271
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,129
It's you again!

272
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:21,570
You can never escape again.

273
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:22,410
Beat her.

274
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:23,450
Come on.

275
00:17:24,729 --> 00:17:25,930
Beat this monster.

276
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,450
Beat this monster.

277
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,170
- Harder.
- Beat this monster.

278
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,290
Beat this monster.

279
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,249
Beat her.

280
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,969
- Monster!
- Monster!

281
00:17:58,089 --> 00:17:59,009
Monster!

282
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:11,609
Run!

283
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:12,450
Hurry up!

284
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:13,489
Go.

285
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,369
Run!

286
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:16,570
It's Mr. Immortal who's protecting me.

287
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,810
He said that no one would bully me again.

288
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:20,330
He didn't lie to me.

289
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:51,849
Beat her.

290
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:56,170
As long as the heart is kind,

291
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,129
everyone can cultivate immortal bones.

292
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,570
So weird.

293
00:19:04,729 --> 00:19:06,690
What Mr. Immortal left in my hand

294
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:08,969
seems to have disappeared.

295
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:18,489
Chongzi, why aren't you sleeping?

296
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:25,050
Dou, I've made up my mind.

297
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,889
I'm going to Nanhua to cultivate.

298
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,850
(Chonghua Palace)

299
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,090
(Chonghua Palace)

300
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,209
Chonghua Palace
doesn't welcome outsiders.

301
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,129
Sage, the immortals of all sects
have gathered in Nanhua.

302
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,690
Chu Bufu defected.

303
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,209
Chu Bufu, the former disciple
of Changsheng Palace,

304
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,736
(Min Yunzhong, Nanhua Councilor Sage)
has now stolen his sword and defected,

305
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,970
(Min Yunzhong, Nanhua Councilor Sage)
falling into diabolism.

306
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:30,770
He killed the lord of Changsheng Palace

307
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,810
and three thousand disciples
of the Immortal World.

308
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:34,209
His crime was unforgivable

309
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:37,810
and he would be expelled
from the Immortal World forever.

310
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,570
Everyone.

311
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:41,369
Immediately set off

312
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:42,690
(Lord Ming, Changsheng Palace)
to capture Chu Bufu,

313
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,449
(Yu Xuzi, Lord of Kunlun Sect)
the traitor of the Immortal World.

314
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:44,450
(Lord Lan,Tianshan Sect)
the traitor of the Immortal World.

315
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,330
(Zhuo Yao, Lord of Qinghua Sect)
Whether he's alive or dead,

316
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,369
bring the demon sword back.

317
00:20:50,369 --> 00:20:51,290
Yes.

318
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:53,969
Sir.

319
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,410
(Madam Kunlun; Mr. Kunlun)

320
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,889
Yinfan.

321
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,129
He is no longer Chu Bufu of
the Immortal World.

322
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:09,450
I know

323
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,369
you are close.

324
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,889
Don't act impetuously.

325
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:16,810
I will investigate this matter thoroughly.

326
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:19,650
Everyone.

327
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:22,369
If he did it,

328
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,009
I will never let him go easily

329
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:26,609
when we meet again.

330
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:46,129
(Everyone, take a look.)

331
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:47,729
(It's a real skill.)

332
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,690
(You can either reward me)

333
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,570
(or come to watch the fun.)

334
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,489
(I don't know if I can meet Mr. Immortal)

335
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,410
(when I go to Nanhua this time.)

336
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:03,369
(Would he recognize me?)

337
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:06,849
Chongzi.

338
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,050
Dou.

339
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:10,849
I said you don't need to come.

340
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,609
Chongzi, this is Dingsheng cake.

341
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,609
If you have it,

342
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,209
you will win victory.

343
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:15,969
I...

344
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,129
You must have spent all your money.

345
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,690
How could you survive

346
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:21,410
after buying this?

347
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,930
I've found a way to make a living.

348
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,770
I can live up on my own.

349
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:25,609
But you...

350
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:27,930
It is already very difficult for ordinary
people to go to the Immortal World to study,

351
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:29,729
let alone people of our background.

352
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,609
Don't be looked down upon by others.

353
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:32,530
Here.

354
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,690
Let's eat it together.

355
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:44,089
I'll win victory.

356
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:45,690
And you have to be safe.

357
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,729
Take good care of yourselves.

358
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:53,690
Don't forget me.

359
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,530
I see. It would never happen.

360
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,570
Excuse me.

361
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:00,290
Just stop here.

362
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:01,770
A little further.

363
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:19,129
She's left?

364
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:24,690
But that girl

365
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,290
is thin and weak.

366
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,530
Maybe she couldn't make it to Nanhua.

367
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:33,650
Should I help her?

368
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,129
No need.

369
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:37,450
She can definitely

370
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:39,489
make it.

371
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:18,770
Yinfan.

372
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:20,089
The Qi of Beidou

373
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:22,410
descends on the Six-world Monument
only once in a thousand years.

374
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:24,690
Perhaps only you

375
00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:25,849
in the entire Immortal World

376
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:27,930
can take it by force

377
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:30,369
and condense this Wufang Pearl.

378
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:31,849
With this pearl,

379
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:33,729
the matter of purifying the demon sword

380
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:35,930
is very sure.

381
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,690
Chu Bufu from Changsheng Palace

382
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:49,530
has brought three thousand disciples
from the Immortal World

383
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,650
to Kunlun.

384
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:53,650
Escorting the demon sword
is no easy task.

385
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:55,609
Chu Bufu

386
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:57,690
may go through hardships and dangers

387
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,729
along the way.

388
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:10,729
What happened to you?

389
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,770
Is this the bell of Nanhua Mountain?

390
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,050
Sir.

391
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:13,729
Is that Nanhua Mountain
where the immortals live?

392
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,050
Looks so nice.

393
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,770
What immortals? What mountain?

394
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:21,009
Piss off, I have no money.

395
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:21,810
I...

396
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,849
Am I the only one who can see it?

397
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:36,129
I am coming!

398
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:42,810
Don't worry.

399
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,369
He can definitely make it.

400
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:45,770
All thanks to your lucky words.

401
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:50,410
Can beggars also come to cultivate?

402
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,810
In the past, only the children
of noble families

403
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:54,290
could go up the mountain for mentorship.

404
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:56,050
But the battle between
immortals and demons

405
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,690
caused heavy losses
to the Immortal World,

406
00:26:58,089 --> 00:26:59,450
so they lowered the threshold.

407
00:26:59,849 --> 00:27:00,609
Now even

408
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,530
beggars could take a try.

409
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:03,969
So overconfident.

410
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:05,129
Exactly.

411
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,010
(Nanhua)

412
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,530
Ke, this is a letter
written by your father.

413
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:39,690
Remember to

414
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:42,530
give it to Sage Tianji.

415
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,450
(To Sage Tianji)
Understand?

416
00:27:44,489 --> 00:27:46,209
Her father knows Sage Tianji.

417
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:48,129
It seems that immortals

418
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,009
also like rich people.

419
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:57,530
Got it, Mother.
Please go back.

420
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,009
No worries.

421
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:01,969
I will keep you company for a while.

422
00:28:13,729 --> 00:28:16,969
Even a beggar comes to cultivate now?

423
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:20,489
So what? At least I depend on myself.

424
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:21,930
Unlike some people

425
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,770
who look glamorous on the outside,

426
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,889
but are not as good as me on the inside.

427
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:27,650
Forget it, Mother.

428
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,209
It's a waste of breath.

429
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,729
Prince.

430
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:41,209
Prince.

431
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,369
- Greetings to Your Highness.
- Greetings to Your Highness.

432
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:50,170
- Greetings to Your Highness.
- Greetings to Your Highness.

433
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,009
I was ordered by my father to
come to Nanhua for mentorship.

434
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,249
Fortunately, the prince will
accompany me along the way.

435
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,729
Thank you, Your Highness,
for your appreciation.

436
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,530
It's the honor of the Qin family.

437
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:03,690
A richer one came.

438
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:05,650
The greater the official position,
the higher the status.

439
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:06,690
How dare you

440
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:08,170
speak here!

441
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,690
This is Nanhua Mountain.

442
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,290
Do the immortals here have to

443
00:29:11,489 --> 00:29:12,290
ask for your approval before speaking?

444
00:29:12,369 --> 00:29:13,009
You!

445
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,290
Nonsense!

446
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,330
I...

447
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,290
Why is it gone?

448
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,609
The mountain is gone.

449
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,369
See? The immortals got angry.

450
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,129
Who's acting rude?

451
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:38,609
Not me.

452
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:51,089
(It's started. Go.)

453
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,209
(- I am afraid.
- All right.)

454
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,489
(Don't be afraid.)

455
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,489
(- Be brave as an adult.
- I don't dare to go.)

456
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,969
(Just go. It's fine.)

457
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,129
(Go.)

458
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:03,410
What a big talk.

459
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:06,930
Mother, I am going.

460
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,089
Take care.

461
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:51,810
Ugly girl.

462
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:53,849
If you can't make it, just give up.

463
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,530
Some people rely on their parents

464
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,930
to become Nanhua disciples,

465
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,050
don't they feel ashamed?

466
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,249
What are you talking about?

467
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,489
Didn't you take the letter?

468
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:01,609
I can become a Nanhua disciple

469
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:03,290
even without that letter.

470
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,450
Follow up if you dare.

471
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:07,330
Prince.

472
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,050
Prince, wait for me.

473
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,770
Go.

474
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,249
- Step aside. Me first.
- You!

475
00:31:11,849 --> 00:31:12,609
Step aside.

476
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:14,849
Be careful!

477
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,810
You are dressing so fancy for the exam.

478
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,609
Don't you dare be rude.

479
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:32,570
- They are falling down.
- They are falling down.

480
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,009
- This...
- This...

481
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,450
Disappeared.

482
00:31:36,969 --> 00:31:38,290
Take care.

483
00:31:58,369 --> 00:31:59,930
These children are still young.

484
00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:01,810
Will this level

485
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,209
be way too difficult?

486
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:05,050
We don't need those

487
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:07,050
who are mortally afraid of death.

488
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,930
Why is the water so icy?

489
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:37,330
So green and inexperienced.

490
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:38,570
How could the water
in the Immortal World

491
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,489
be the same
as that in the Mortal World?

492
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,450
Prince, there is no bridge.

493
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,889
How could we cross the river?

494
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,089
If he had his way, he would
have crossed long ago.

495
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:50,690
Isn't he stuck here like us?

496
00:32:51,489 --> 00:32:52,530
So noisy.

497
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:54,729
Are all country women like you?

498
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,570
You!

499
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,889
What's that?

500
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,650
The transformation of these stones
is irregular.

501
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,969
Maybe if we take one wrong step,

502
00:33:26,209 --> 00:33:27,089
there is no turning back.

503
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,009
What if it sinks

504
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,209
after we step on it?

505
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,089
Exactly.

506
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:31,450
Don't go if you're afraid.

507
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,489
Now that the stones
have already appeared,

508
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:34,849
how can we not try?

509
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,369
This girl

510
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,450
has good qualifications,

511
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:40,770
but a bad temper.

512
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:44,690
I wonder whose apprentice
she will become.

513
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,650
(I hope that my daughter, Ninth Princess
Sima Miaoyuan, can be Sage Tianji's disciple)

514
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,089
The Ninth Princess also wants
to be a disciple of Nanhua.

515
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,410
Really?

516
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,170
These two kids are both good.

517
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,810
In the past, there were very few
female disciples who could pass the test.

518
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,489
I didn't expect

519
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,770
a particularly daring one
to appear this year.

520
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:19,290
In comparison,

521
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:22,130
this girl is even better.

522
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,409
As for this man...

523
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,929
He knows some kung fu,

524
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,249
not bad.

525
00:34:28,689 --> 00:34:31,890
A good disciple is rarer
than a rare treasure.

526
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,929
You girl, step aside.

527
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,009
Me first.

528
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,169
Thank you.

529
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,130
Never mind.

530
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:03,130
Is Yinfan not coming yet?

531
00:35:04,209 --> 00:35:05,570
Maybe he will come.

532
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,489
He really doesn't want any apprentices?

533
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,009
Yinfan has his own ideas.

534
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:11,249
Leave him alone.

535
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,890
Wouldn't it be better if one less person
competes with us for apprentices?

536
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,649
That's true.

537
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:18,370
But someone

538
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:20,929
has to take over the mantle.

539
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:22,969
Watch out!

540
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,570
Your hands are dirty.

541
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,729
Stay away from me.

542
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:30,850
You think I'm dirty?

543
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:31,729
Believe it or not, I can save you up

544
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,209
and push you down.

545
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,009
I...

546
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:50,330
Are you okay?

547
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,169
Yes.

548
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:53,449
I didn't expect these slabs
to move so quickly.

549
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:55,689
We have to first find the law

550
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:57,409
of the transformation of these slabs.

551
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:04,929
Prince, save me.

552
00:36:05,209 --> 00:36:06,209
Prince.

553
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,729
She thinks my hands are dirty.

554
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,009
You save her.

555
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:23,370
Give me your hand.

556
00:36:34,449 --> 00:36:35,209
Are you okay?

557
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,290
I'm fine. Thank you, Prince.

558
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,610
You should thank her.

559
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:49,330
Nanhua Mountain.

560
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:50,489
- Great!
- Great!

561
00:36:50,489 --> 00:36:52,169
- We're finally up.
- We're going to be immortals.

562
00:36:52,249 --> 00:36:53,770
- Great!
- Great!

563
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,290
Great!

564
00:37:01,409 --> 00:37:03,050
The tree in the Immortal World
is like that.

565
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,330
Prince, why don't you hurry up?

566
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,330
Sages should like whoever comes first.

567
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:10,130
Are you sure?

568
00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:13,009
I guess they like the best ones.

569
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,209
You don't understand.

570
00:37:45,649 --> 00:37:46,570
Wait.

571
00:37:56,689 --> 00:37:57,810
- This...
- This...

572
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,169
What a huge tiger.

573
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:01,090
Is it a mountain guard?

574
00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:09,130
What are you doing?

575
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,969
I will stop it. You should go.

576
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:12,330
You are obviously afraid.

577
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:13,409
Why flaunting your superiority?

578
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:14,169
I...

579
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:15,689
Don't worry.

580
00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:17,290
I won't let you die.

581
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:19,810
Although you are annoying.

582
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:21,929
Just wait and see.

583
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,330
I will.

584
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,370
But for now, we'd better figure out

585
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,969
how to avoid the tiger.

586
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,610
- Run!
- Run!

587
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,530
Run!

588
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,770
Get away!

589
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,249
Prince.

590
00:39:16,249 --> 00:39:17,449
Prince, are you okay?
