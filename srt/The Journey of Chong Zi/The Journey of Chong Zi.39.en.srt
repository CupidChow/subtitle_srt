=The Journey of Chongzi=
(Adapted from "The Journey of Chongzi" by Shu Ke)

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,000
=Episode 39=

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,960
(I have to control my evil breath.)

29
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,799
(Perhaps everything will get better)

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,600
(after Master comes back.)

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,439
(Chong Zi,)

32
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,320
(you don't deserve all of these.)

33
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,800
You found the place
where Demon Zi is hiding?

34
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,200
How about Zhuo Hao?

35
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:12,599
Did you see him?

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,920
No.

37
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:15,840
If I see Lord Zhuo,

38
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,519
I'll persuade him to go back to Qinghua.

39
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,599
He's been controlled by Demon Zi,

40
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,599
so it's useless no matter
who goes to persuade him.

41
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,280
Lord Zhuo may sober up

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,080
and return to Qinghua

43
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,239
and you

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,519
only when Demon Zi is killed.

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,119
She was born with evil breath.

46
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,840
If we kill her,

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,360
we wipe a hidden danger
out of immortal sects.

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,080
But since she became a demon,

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,879
she got more powerful,

50
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,080
so I'm afraid I can't match her.

51
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,399
Even if you don't
have enough magical power,

52
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,959
you're the grandniece of
Councilor Sage from Nanhua.

53
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,840
I'm sure they have a method.

54
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:50,039
Now,

55
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,879
Sage Chonghua is fighting
Wang Yue in the East Sea,

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,519
and Demon Zi is alone,

57
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,119
so this is the best chance

58
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,000
to save Lord Zhuo.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,280
There is

60
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,319
indeed a method,

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,800
but what if...

62
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,160
Don't worry, Miss Min.

63
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,640
If there is any accident,

64
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,280
I'll take the responsibility myself

65
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,920
and won't drag you down.

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,479
There is a treasure in
Tianque Pavilion of Nanhua,

67
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,119
named Soul-binding Thread.

68
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,119
It's said to deal
with the demons specially.

69
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,440
The patriarch refined
seven Sour-binding Threads,

70
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,800
and five of them have been used.

71
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:24,959
They are very precious.

72
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,879
This treasure

73
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,679
is the best magic weapon

74
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,399
to deal with Demon Zi.

75
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,599
I'll do it

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,399
for Zhuo Hao

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,119
and the Qinghua Sect.

78
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,640
(Chong Zi has committed many
evil things after becoming a demon,)

79
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,519
(controlled disciples
from immortals sects,)

80
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,959
(and disturbed the order
of the Immortal and Demon World.)

81
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,959
(I must use the Soul-binding Thread)

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,560
(to take her back to Nanhua)

83
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,959
(to be punished.)

84
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,759
Luo Yinfan,

85
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,319
long time no see.

86
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,679
Luo Yinfan,

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,320
finally.

88
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,919
Save the disciples from Qinghua.

89
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,320
You know

90
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,720
it's easy

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,399
to save them.

92
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,040
Stop dreaming.

93
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,239
I won't let you see her again.

94
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:31,919
Do you think you can avoid that forever?

95
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,440
Don't forget

96
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,480
you're Sage Chonghua,

97
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,320
and she's Demon Zi.

98
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,600
Luo Yinfan,

99
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,720
tell them where Demon Zi is now.

100
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,560
How shameless Demon Zi is.

101
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,119
She actually married
Sage Chonghua secretly.

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,239
Such kind of demon

103
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
must be killed.

104
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,079
As long as you put the
Soul-binding Thread into her body,

105
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,720
I'll enter and help you.

106
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,320
Leave the rest

107
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,560
to me.

108
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,239
Miss Min,

109
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,919
why are you here?

110
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,600
I come for Zhuo Hao.

111
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,880
Where is he?

112
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,359
I don't know.

113
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
How could you not know that?

114
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,560
He's under your control.

115
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,359
You've been living very well

116
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:15,199
and married to Sage Chonghua.

117
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,519
You've owned everything you want,

118
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,040
so why can't you let Hao go?

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
It's he that doesn't let himself go.

120
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,639
Go and look for him elsewhere.

121
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,480
Chong Zi,

122
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:27,760
please.

123
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,919
Give Hao back to me, okay?

124
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,119
Soul-binding Thread.

125
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,079
Why?

126
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
I've known Hao since childhood.

127
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,880
He's very unrestrained.

128
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
If it weren't for you,

129
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,000
he wouldn't have become like this.

130
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,760
Because of you,

131
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,000
he can't return to the Qinghua Sect now.

132
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,280
Only when you're dead

133
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,359
will he go back to the immortal sect.

134
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,480
It's you.

135
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,359
You incited Min Suqiu to do this.

136
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,799
You're wrong.

137
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,639
It's because of your master,

138
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,320
Supervisor Sage.

139
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,639
In order to find you,

140
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,359
Wang Yue has kidnapped
disciples from Qinghua Palace

141
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,000
and threatened Sage Chonghua
to tell where you are.

142
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,119
Sage Chonghua loves
people in the whole world,

143
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,760
so he knows

144
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,840
the best choice is to kill you.

145
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,880
Shut up!

146
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,320
Wang Yue can't threaten him,

147
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,799
nor can you cheat me.

148
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,239
How interesting.

149
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,199
You're the respected Sage Chonghua,

150
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,959
but you can actually
watch an innocent person

151
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,679
die for your love
without doing anything.

152
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,359
Because of this,

153
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:56,880
I can let him go.

154
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,519
What did you do to Chong Zi?

155
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,519
You'll see after going back.

156
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,239
I didn't know...

157
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,519
I didn't know the Soul-binding
Thread was like this.

158
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,320
I just wanted Hao to sober up.

159
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:54,199
Chong Zi.

160
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:55,959
Chong Zi.

161
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,720
Chong Zi.

162
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,920
Why did you become like this?

163
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,879
What happened?

164
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,639
Save me.

165
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,639
I'll save you.

166
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,480
I promise.

167
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:26,920
Save her.

168
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,840
I know you can.

169
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,240
Yes,

170
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:33,840
but even if I save her,

171
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,720
she won't be grateful to me,

172
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,319
so why should I do that?

173
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,519
But I can promise you

174
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,600
only when you beg me.

175
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,399
My king,

176
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:49,480
please.

177
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:51,480
Please save Chong Zi.

178
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:54,879
Okay.

179
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,560
♪After turning around,
who can bear to forget♪

180
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,600
Ting Xue.

181
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,920
(Soul-binding Thread.)

182
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,680
What did you do to Chong Zi?

183
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,920
It's Min Suqiu. That stupid woman.

184
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,199
I just mentioned it casually,

185
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,920
but she stole it from the Nanhua Sect.

186
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,360
It's late.

187
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,800
You came here too late.

188
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
Chong is dead.

189
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,439
She was destroyed.

190
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,840
Kill me.

191
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,879
It doesn't matter even if you kill me,

192
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,840
because she'll never come back to life.

193
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,519
Luo Yinfan,

194
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,959
why do you only care about her?

195
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,160
Why do you always ignore me?

196
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,480
It's better to let you hate me

197
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,800
than ignore me.

198
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,439
It's you

199
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,800
that caused everything today!

200
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:21,879
Ting Xue,

201
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,639
I won't kill you.

202
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,879
I'll put you into the Immortal Prison

203
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,319
until you make up for your sins.

204
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,800
Your soul

205
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,879
has been broken.

206
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,600
I saw that thing in Tianque Pavilion.

207
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,360
I didn't expect the ordinary
Soul-binding Thread

208
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,559
to be such an evil magic weapon.

209
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:20,920
Aren't

210
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,280
immortal sects lenient?

211
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,999
Why did they use that kind of thing?

212
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:29,040
Will my corpse be incomplete

213
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,720
after I die?

214
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,759
You're no different from
a dead person now.

215
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,519
Even if

216
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,519
I repair your soul,

217
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,360
your body can't bear

218
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:41,600
the huge impact.

219
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,040
Not long after,

220
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,959
your body will be disintegrated

221
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,480
along with your soul.

222
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
So it means

223
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,879
I'm killed again

224
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,319
by the immortal sect.

225
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,160
It was Luo Yinfan who killed you.

226
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,999
No.

227
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,680
It's not him.

228
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:07,999
The one who wants to kill me

229
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,999
is Min Suqiu.

230
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:12,999
If you don't believe me,

231
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,439
you can ask him in person.

232
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,879
No need.

233
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,399
He can't protect me

234
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,360
no matter who wants to kill me.

235
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,480
I'd rather

236
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,559
depend on myself than him.

237
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,439
I must live.

238
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,959
If so,

239
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,079
you must pay the price.

240
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,319
I can pay whatever price

241
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,999
at all costs.

242
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,999
Okay.

243
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,319
If you want to live,

244
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,920
you only have one way.

245
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,840
That is to sacrifice yourself
for the demon sword

246
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,639
and cultivate yourself
to be the Celestial Demon.

247
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
By then,

248
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,280
you'll break free from your body

249
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,480
and become powerful as never before.

250
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,240
You can take whatever revenge

251
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,639
as you like.

252
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,040
(Luo Yinfan,)

253
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,680
(I predicted a long time ago)

254
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,800
(that our peaceful life
wouldn't last long,)

255
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,120
(but I didn't expect)

256
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,079
(it finished so soon.)

257
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,199
After experiencing so much,

258
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,360
I still have to accept this.

259
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,520
♪After meeting you♪

260
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,120
♪I'm most afraid that everything is
an illusion, alone in joys and sorrows♪

261
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,600
♪I'm willing to die for you♪

262
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,040
(If I can,)

263
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,079
(I also want to live
in seclusion with you,)

264
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,759
(but because of my identity,)

265
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,280
(immortal sects will never accept me.)

266
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,920
(I don't want to see you be forced)

267
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,160
(and in a dilemma,)

268
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,720
(nor do I want to let them hurt me)

269
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,559
(and insult me.)

270
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,840
(We're different,)

271
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,480
(so we're destined to be apart.)

272
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,280
Chongzi,

273
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:52,360
depend on yourself

274
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,040
in the future.

275
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,319
Remember

276
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,079
I'm alive

277
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:01,319
as long as you're alive.

278
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:07,280
Chong Zi,

279
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,639
listen to me.

280
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,959
Don't be a martyr for the sword.

281
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,639
I promise you.

282
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,840
(I fought)

283
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:16,240
(and compromised,)

284
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,319
(but now,)

285
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,040
(I have to accept my destiny.)

286
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:22,999
(Sorry.)

287
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,280
How strong the demon scent is.

288
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,959
- What happened?
- What is going on?

289
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,240
The demon scent is so strong.

290
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:51,919
It seems

291
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,400
you're the real host of the demon sword.

292
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,480
Chong Zi.

293
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:08,640
Demon Zi sacrificed
herself for the sword

294
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,600
and cultivated herself
to be the Celestial Demon.

295
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,600
- Celestial Demon was born
- Celestial Demon was born

296
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,439
- to dominate the six worlds.
- to dominate the six worlds.

297
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,439
- Celestial Demon was born
- Celestial Demon was born

298
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,360
- to dominate the six worlds.

299
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,439
- Celestial Demon was born
- Celestial Demon was born

300
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,319
- to dominate the six worlds.
- to dominate the six worlds.

301
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Last time I sensed
such strong demon scent

302
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,199
was when Ni Lun was born.

303
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,159
Grandpa, help me.

304
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,720
Suqiu,

305
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,600
what's wrong?

306
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,640
Ting Xue asked me to deal with
Demon Zi with the Soul-binding Thread.

307
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:53,480
I...

308
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
I didn't know that
treasure was very powerful.

309
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,520
I did that because I wanted
Zhuo Hao to return to Qinghua.

310
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,400
Will he hate me?

311
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,000
Suqiu, you're so silly.

312
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,000
Why are you still

313
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,199
thinking about Zhuo Hao now?

314
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,400
I think Chong Zi must sacrifice
herself for the demon sword

315
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,319
and cultivate herself
to be the Celestial Demon

316
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,799
because of this thing.

317
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,919
Since it has become like this,
it's useless to argue about the reason.

318
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,520
Suqiu,

319
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,679
get up.

320
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,279
Suqiu,

321
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,520
even if you hadn't done that,

322
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,840
she would be the Celestial Demon

323
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,400
as she was Ni Lun's daughter
and born with evil breath.

324
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,760
Stop excusing her, sir.

325
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,360
They attacked Chong Zi
with the Soul-binding Thread.

326
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,279
When I went back to her,

327
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:44,199
she had gone,
and the house was destroyed.

328
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:45,600
Her blood

329
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,039
was everywhere.

330
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,360
I've put

331
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,480
Ting Xue into the Immortal Prison.

332
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:53,919
As for Min Suqiu,

333
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:56,480
I'll never let her go.

334
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,679
How could you blame Suqiu?

335
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,039
She tried to kill the demon
for the immortal sect.

336
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,439
Is it wrong?

337
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,120
The Soul-binding Thread

338
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,840
could have definitely killed her,

339
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,919
but it's a pity that
her evil breath was so powerful

340
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,959
that she survived.

341
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,679
Her demoniac nature had been cleansed,

342
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,360
and she had been living
peacefully in the Mortal World.

343
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,000
Why do you insist on killing her?

344
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,760
The Mortal World is full of demon scent now,

345
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,039
and every immortal feels dangerous.

346
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,120
However,

347
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,720
you connive the junior

348
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,480
and avoid admitting her mistake.

349
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,279
As Councilor Sage,

350
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,720
you don't fulfill your duty well.

351
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,120
What?

352
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,679
How dare you blame me now?

353
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,559
I said

354
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:38,559
you should kill Demon Zi
as soon as possible,

355
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,199
but you didn't listen to me at that time.

356
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,640
Otherwise,

357
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,400
it wouldn't have become like this now.

358
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,400
Listen up.

359
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
You're not allowed to hurt Suqiu.

360
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,600
Grandpa.

361
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,559
Sir.

362
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:57,880
Are you okay, sir?

363
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,919
Good.

364
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,199
You actually dared to attack me

365
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,400
for a demon.

366
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,520
Yinfan,

367
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,840
does the Nanhua Sect matter to you?

368
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,079
Do the six worlds matter to you?

369
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,279
You're not qualified
to mention the Nanhua Sect

370
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,199
or the six worlds!

371
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,840
When I fought Wang Yue
in the Qinghua Sect,

372
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:26,400
what were you doing?

373
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,799
Yinfan,

374
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,279
even if Councilor Sage
and Suqiu are wrong,

375
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,120
you can't...

376
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,199
What?

377
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,760
I won't kill you

378
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
for the sake that you're my senior.

379
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:43,400
I want to tell you

380
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,079
that I married Chong Zi,

381
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,240
and she's my wife.

382
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,559
If she dies,

383
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,439
I won't be alive, either.

384
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,640
Think about it yourself.

385
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,120
If you need me to deal with Wang Yue,

386
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,120
don't hurt Chong Zi

387
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,720
at all.

388
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:24,919
Sir.

389
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,319
Did I do wrong?

390
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,600
I ruined the six worlds.

391
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,880
It's you

392
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:04,319
who put the Soul-binding
Thread into Chong Zi's body.

393
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,480
Yes,

394
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,360
but I was deluded by Ting Xue.

395
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,279
Hao,

396
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,959
I just wanted you to
return to the Qinghua Sect.

397
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,720
I didn't want to kill her.

398
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,840
Don't call my name.

399
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,799
It makes me disgusted.

400
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,480
She had quitted the Demon World

401
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,000
and just wanted to
be an ordinary person.

402
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
It's you.

403
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:33,000
You ruined everything.

404
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,279
If Chong Zi

405
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,520
really dominates the six worlds,

406
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,799
immortal sects will be destroyed.

407
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,400
So what?

408
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,000
She deserves that.

409
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,079
As long as she can die,

410
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,240
I'm willing to do whatever I can,

411
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,000
let alone be the sinner
of immortal sects.

412
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,199
I only feel it a pity

413
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,120
that the Soul-binding Thread
couldn't kill her

414
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,760
and ruin her.

415
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,480
Stop.

416
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:21,959
Kill me

417
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,679
and everyone in Qinghua Palace

418
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,520
before killing Suqiu.

419
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,840
Anyway,

420
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,159
you don't want to recognize
me as your father anymore.

421
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,720
I didn't mean that.

422
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:36,279
I...

423
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:38,319
I was blinded by the demon scent.

424
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,039
- Father.
- Don't call me that.

425
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,039
Since you're so stubborn,

426
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,039
I won't regard you as my son anymore.

427
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:51,880
Leave.

428
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:53,880
Leave!

429
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,959

However, it seems I'm wrong.

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,079
You don't just want to drink, do you?

510
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,520
I don't like chatting.

511
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Remember

512
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,600
that you've sacrificed
yourself for the sword,

513
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,600
and you should know your duty.

514
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,319
Only a few days passed,

515
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:08,640
and you won't

516
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,360
forgive him out of mercy, will you?

517
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,079
Now I know

518
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:14,360
your stubbornness.

519
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,959
No matter how many times

520
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,760
Luo Yinfan kills you,

521
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,400
or how the immortal sect

522
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
hurts you

523
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:22,760
and humiliates you,

524
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,360
you will

525
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:26,000
show understanding for him

526
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:27,079
and forgive him

527
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,279
over and over again.

528
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,199
I didn't discover

529
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,400
you were so generous.

530
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,199
It's useless if you want to stir me up.

531
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,159
I'm not

532
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:38,799
as fragile as before.

533
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,919
Please enjoy your meal.

534
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,720
Please.

535
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:46,760
Please.

536
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:48,799
Sir,

537
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:50,919
I heard

538
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,279
Panhai Town

539
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,799
is protected by immortals.

540
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,840
If I destroy this town now,

541
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,039
will anyone come to save you?

542
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,439
You're still softhearted.

543
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,120
It's not their fault

544
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,439
to trust the immortal sect,

545
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:34,159
but the immortal sect's.

546
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,439
They boost their contributions

547
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,240
to make people believe

548
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,679
they can protect everything.

549
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,400
Essentially,

550
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,159
it's people's prejudice

551
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,880
that makes the immortals
different from the demons.

552
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,079
Since immortal sects can't

553
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,400
keep absolute justice,

554
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,559
how could they be qualified

555
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,039
to judge everything?

556
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,480
So what do you think?

557
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,799
I want to destroy immortal sects

558
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,240
and achieve equality between everything.

559
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,720
No classes should exist.

560
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,600
As for dominating
the six worlds as you said,

561
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,559
it's never been my goal.

562
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,760
Why are you laughing?

563
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,039
Nothing.

564
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:21,840
I just think

565
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:24,039
you're thoughtful,

566
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,480
which is admirable.

567
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,840
Then let's destroy the Immortal World

568
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,279
as you like.

569
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:33,760
Why are you so obedient?

570
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:35,159
You're the Celestial Demon,

571
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,360
and the whole Demon World
should obey you,

572
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,679
so I should do as you say.

573
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,760
But I have one demand.

574
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,959
Even if immortal sects
don't exist any longer,

575
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,919
the demons aren't allowed
to hurt innocent people.

576
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,120
Without the Immortal World,

577
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,840
the sober breath

578
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,039
won't belong to
immortal sects any longer,

579
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,400
and the demons

580
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,880
will stop killing mortals

581
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,160
to keep a balance between
soberness and dirtiness.

582
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,200
As a result,

583
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,920
they won't invade the Mortal World.

584
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,880
Can you do that?

585
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
That's good.

586
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,519
I don't fail to live up to
your use of me.

587
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,079
I'm not using you.

588
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:34,600
I'm

589
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,120
cultivating you.

590
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,519
Tell me

591
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,440
how my father failed.

592
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:49,960
Your father

593
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,600
was killed by the Celestial King Yunqiu.

594
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,479
I want to know the real reason.

595
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,400
Why did he fail?

596
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,519
He was killed by Shuiji.

597
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,999
The Immortal World

598
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,960
found Ni Lun's weakness

599
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,840
and threatened him with Shuiji,

600
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,640
forcing him to leave Nanhua.

601
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,759
However,

602
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,559
your mother had already joined Nanhua,

603
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,039
so

604
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:20,160
Ni Lun was killed by her.

605
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:23,039
It was fragility that
defeated my father.

606
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:25,840
That was his weakness in relationships

607
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,840
and had nothing to do with my mother.

608
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,279
It's fine if you think it this way.

609
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,239
However,

610
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,239
you can't follow
the same old disastrous road.

611
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,600
Why did you promise to help her?

612
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,960

Don't be rude, sir.

We're different,

658

so don't pretend.

659
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:08,479
I didn't know about
the Soul-binding Thread before.

660
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,799
Ting Xue has been
put into the Immortal Prison,

663
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,319
all your sufferings
with my spiritual power.

664
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:18,319
No need.

665
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:21,440
I'm just a shell of the demon sword,

666
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,319
so I don't need your spiritual power.

667
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:26,400
Don't say you'll make up for me.

668
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:27,640
You just

669
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:29,759
want to ease your guilt.

670
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,279
I come here to tell you

671
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,039
that I'll destroy

672
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,799
the immortal sects

673
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,640
after three days

674
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,479
by the power of the Celestial Demon.

675
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,519
You can hate me alone.

676
00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:43,640
Why do you target all immortal sects?

677
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,840
Why not?

678
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,200
They've never treated me well.

679
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,400
If they hadn't made
things difficult for us,

680
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,759
how could we

681
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,799
be in such a situation?

682
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,920
I've given them chances,

683
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,719
but they drove me to the wall
again and again.

684
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,880
Now

685
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,559
I have to fight them.

686
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,680
If I beg you with my life,

687
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,559
can you forgive them?

688
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,200
I can't

689
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,039
unless Nanhua Mountain collapses,

690
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,880
and Sihai Sea goes dry.

691
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:15,680
Even if we will become enemies?

692
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:17,279
Yes.

693
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,600
Let's put an end to it

694
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:25,759
after we separate today.

695
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,479
When I see you next time,

696
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,079
we'll be on the battlefield.

697
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,799
Don't worry.

698
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,920
I won't show you any mercy.

699
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,239
I think you should also...

700
00:43:38,999 --> 00:43:39,680
Okay.
