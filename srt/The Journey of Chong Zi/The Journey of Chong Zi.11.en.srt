Little girl,

38
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:34,996
why are you here alone?

39
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:38,436
You've got the wrong person.

40
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:40,115
I'm not easy to bully.

41
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:41,156
Just you.

42
00:02:41,515 --> 00:02:42,875
Can you beat me?

43
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:46,276
You're just Chong Zi.

44
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:49,115
Just because you're
Luo Yinfan's disciple,

45
00:02:49,156 --> 00:02:50,076
you're talking nonsense.

46
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:52,115
But now your master
doesn't want you anymore.

47
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:54,755
Without him,

48
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:57,475
how much power do you think you have?

49
00:02:57,556 --> 00:02:58,755
Cut the crap with her.

50
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:00,196
Let's catch her.

51
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:02,395
Find out about Nanhua from her

52
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:04,356
and go back and tell Lord Yin Xinmo

53
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:05,556
to get a reward.

54
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,196
(Luo Yinfan made us homeless.)

55
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:27,556
(Now his disciple is in our hands,)

56
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:29,955
(it's time to teach him a lesson.)

57
00:03:30,515 --> 00:03:31,276
(Yes.)

58
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,996
(Lord Yin Xinmo's heart poison)

59
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:34,515
(is really powerful.)

60
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:36,716
(That's enough for this girl to suffer.)

61
00:03:37,156 --> 00:03:40,836
(But, she's pretty.)

62
00:03:41,156 --> 00:03:42,836

Don't let me go.

68
00:04:03,636 --> 00:04:04,716
I'll go back with you.

69
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:06,636
Go back to the Immortal Prison with you.

70
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:08,955

71
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,156

What are you doing?

79
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:01,915
What have you drugged me with?

80
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:04,515
Unexpectedly,
you've fallen in love with your master.

81
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:06,915
Nonsense!

82
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:08,836
That's the evil magic you used

83
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:10,596
to make me hallucinate.

84
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,635
We gave you the Heart Poison.

85
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:13,596

86
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:15,075

If you don't love your master,

88
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,276
why would you have such a vision?

89
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:19,436
Yes.

90
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:21,355
I've seen a lot today.

91
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:23,635

00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:24,515

93
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:26,316
what kind of expression
Luo Yinfan will have

94
00:05:26,436 --> 00:05:28,675
when he finds out about this.

95
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:31,195
Don't tell my master.

96
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:32,836
Please.

97
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,515
Please don't tell my master.

98
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:36,355
You were so arrogant just now,
weren't you?

99
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:39,476
Please, don't tell my master.

100
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:47,436
Demon King, forgive us.
Demon King, forgive us.

101
00:05:47,436 --> 00:05:48,596
Demon King, forgive us.
Demon King, forgive us.

102
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:49,276
Demon King.

103
00:05:49,276 --> 00:05:49,996
Demon King.

104
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:55,235
(Sorry, Chongzi.)

105
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:57,235
(I'm late.)

106
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:06,876
Chong Zi!

107
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,876
Has Master already

108
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,235
known my mind?

109
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:13,635
Is he going to drive me out
of the sect?

110
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:15,156
They're all dead.

111
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:18,235
Your master won't know anything,

112
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:20,276
let alone expel you.

113
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,716
Not only will they not expel you,

114
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:27,156
but they are finding you.

115
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:29,235
Really?

116
00:06:29,915 --> 00:06:30,955
I was looking for you,

117
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:32,515
and when I passed by the city,

118
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:35,156
I found some secret agents of
the immortal sect were looking for you.

119
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:38,795
But...

120
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:40,115
How can you take seriously

121
00:06:40,195 --> 00:06:41,515
what people say when they're angry?

122
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:44,036
The angrier a person is,

123
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:46,556
the more he cares, right?

124
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:49,996
So

125
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:52,036
it's not that Master doesn't want me.

126
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:56,156
Chong Zi!

127
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:57,355
Chong Zi!

128
00:06:58,195 --> 00:06:59,756
You've just been poisoned
with Heart Poison.

129
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:01,436
You can't be too happy or too sad,

130
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:03,795
and don't get too excited, okay?

131
00:07:22,195 --> 00:07:23,235
Have a sleep.

132
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:25,276
I'm here.

133
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:27,876
No one will dare to bully you.

134
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:32,115
Councilor,

135
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:33,915
I've sent many people to look for her,

136
00:07:34,316 --> 00:07:36,036
but there's still no sign of Chong Zi.

137
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:39,515
That sinful disciple
colluded with the demons,

138
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:41,436
maybe now

139
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:43,756
she is having fun in the Demon World.

140
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:46,036
Chong Zi is my disciple.

141
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:57,996
Since she's my disciple,

142
00:07:58,476 --> 00:07:59,436
whether she's right or wrong,

143
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:00,795
I have to catch her myself

144
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:02,036
before I make a decision.

145
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:05,355
When you do get her back,

146
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:06,756
please

147
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:09,195
don't forget what she did,

148
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:11,596
and don't be sentimental.

149
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:15,195
I know

150
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:16,675
what to do.

151
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:18,556
Those who collude with the demons

152
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:20,795
should be executed.

153
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:10,955
Sorry,

154
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:12,676
I shouldn't have driven you away.

155
00:09:13,315 --> 00:09:15,195
Uncle, if you drive me away again,

156
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:16,875
I won't come back.

157
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:21,836
Actually, I like here.

158
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,356
When spring comes,

159
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:24,596
remove the weeds,

160
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,195
plant some flowers and trees,

161
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,116
it must be a different scenery here.

162
00:09:32,476 --> 00:09:33,515
Slow down.

163
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:35,236
You've just recovered.

164
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:51,195
Everyone else is afraid of snakes,

165
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,515
but look at you,

166
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:54,276
the snake is afraid of you.

167
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:00,596
What's so scary about it?

168
00:10:00,796 --> 00:10:02,395
At most it will bite us.

169
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:03,875
But we can catch it,

170
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:05,036
make it into medicine wine,

171
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:06,236
and cook it into snake soup.

172
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:09,236
Think in this way,
it should be afraid of us.

173
00:10:11,435 --> 00:10:12,755
It's a demon's creature.

174
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,515
You'd better be careful.

175
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:18,955
We will meet often in the future.

176
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:20,236
I won't cook you into snake soup.

177
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:22,596
And you won't bite me by stealth, okay?

178
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,315
I take that as a yes.

179
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:27,116
Well,

180
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:27,995
you, me

181
00:10:28,276 --> 00:10:29,116
and Uncle,

182
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,635
the three of us are now a family.

183
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:52,716
Uncle,

184
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:55,395
do you miss her?

185
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,515
She's like the wind blowing,

186
00:10:58,555 --> 00:10:59,955
the clouds floating overhead,

187
00:11:00,635 --> 00:11:02,156
and the flowers I've seen.

188
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:04,515
It seems like everything is her.

189
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:06,755
But in fact,

190
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,916
I know it's not.

191
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:11,276
Let's go.

192
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:12,315
Where to go?

193
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:14,635
Since you're missing someone,

194
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:16,315
you should try your best to meet her.

195
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:18,195
Let's go and get Miss Gong back.

196
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:20,435
She won't like being
in a place like this.

197
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:23,836
Then let's remove the weeds,

198
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:26,435
cut down the dead trees
and plant many cherry trees.

199
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,995
Build it just like the Changsheng Palace.

200
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,195
What the Changsheng Palace has,

201
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,555
the Land of Tribulations must also have,

202
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:35,395
and it must be
more beautiful and more magnificent.

203
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:37,276
This barren land

204
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:40,395
can not be changed overnight.

205
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:21,596
(Zizhu Peak, Nanhua Mountain)

206
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,881
Are you worried about her too?

207
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:28,555
The Land of Tribulations is so big,

208
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:31,116
when can you change it?

209
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:33,796
I have plenty of time anyway.

210
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:35,515
Uncle, go back quickly.

211
00:15:29,836 --> 00:15:30,596
Uncle,

212
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,116
go get her back. I'll go with you.

213
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:34,555
Wait.

214
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:36,596
There's something missing.

215
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:37,995
What?

216
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:40,116
The mountains
and rivers are so beautiful,

217
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,995
the people should be more beautiful.

218
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:43,716
Let's go.

219
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:00,276
Master,

220
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:02,156
is this the Buzhou Mountain?

221
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:04,916
Buzhou Mountain is the mountain
that leads to the gods.

222
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:07,395
No one knows how high it really is,

223
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,916
and no one has ever
really reached the top.

224
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:13,476
Then you're still going, Master?

225
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:16,836
I promised Yinfan.

226
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:36,875
Ma'am,

227
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,716
my master wants to go
up the mountain to collect medicine.

228
00:16:38,995 --> 00:16:40,796
I saw that you just came
down from the mountain.

229
00:16:41,036 --> 00:16:41,875
I want to know

230
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:45,116
if there's any fog, wind

231
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:46,676
or beasts on this mountain.

232
00:16:47,515 --> 00:16:48,555
The beasts on the Buzhou Mountain

233
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:49,995
are very spiritual,

234
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:51,356
and won't hurt people easily.

235
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:52,676
But you guys,

236
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:54,796
the Buzhou Mountain is so big,

237
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:56,276
what medicine are you looking for?

238
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,156
We want to find the seedlings
of the Red Vine.

239
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,236
The seedlings of the Red Vine?

240
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:02,716
That's difficult.

241
00:17:03,716 --> 00:17:04,796
So

242
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:06,635
you know where the seedlings

243
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:08,435
grow on the mountain?

244
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:11,435
You must be sincere in your search

245
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:13,516
for medicine on Buzhou Mountain.

246
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:16,315
Even if you are sincere,
you may not be able to find it.

247
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:17,555
Not to mention,

248
00:17:18,195 --> 00:17:19,075
miss,

249
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:21,236
you have other intentions.

250
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,516
This color suits you.

251
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:56,836
You are not only handsome and elegant,

252
00:17:57,795 --> 00:17:59,996
but also have good taste.

253
00:18:00,195 --> 00:18:02,476
You picked the treasure
of our store at once.

254
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:05,116
Let me take your measurements.

255
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:06,396
I don't need it.

256
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:07,795
Just let her choose.

257
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:11,795
Since you're here,
why don't you make a new dress?

258
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:13,756
Look at your clothes,

259
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:15,876
they don't look good on you.

260
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:18,396
Uncle,

261
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,636
we are here to make you new clothes.

262
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,756
When I first saw you,

263
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:25,596
you were dressed in white, so pretty.

264
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:29,356
White is the original color of purity.

265
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:32,596
I do not deserve to wear it.

266
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:42,675
This dress looks good.

267
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:45,915
Uncle, when you get married
with Miss Gong,

268
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:47,636
will you wear this too?

Miss Gong,

00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:16,476
my name is Chong Zi.

303
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:18,555
I am the disciple
of Sage Chonghua, Mr. Luo Yinfan,

304
00:21:18,716 --> 00:21:19,836
and Uncle's

305
00:21:22,035 --> 00:21:22,836
friend.

306
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:25,035
I see that Uncle has a lot to tell you.

307
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:26,795
I won't bother you.

308
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:39,195
You still like this kind of place.

309
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:40,876
I heard that for me,

310
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:43,476
you need to do something
for the Demon King Wang Yue.

311
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:47,116
Actually, it's not necessary.

312
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:49,555
You and I

313
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:51,035
just look at each other

314
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:52,915
from afar like this. That's good.

315
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:55,795
I am not in the immortal sect.

316
00:21:55,955 --> 00:21:57,195
I won't hurt you,

317
00:21:58,596 --> 00:22:00,075
and you won't hurt me.

318
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:03,236
Knowing that you are alive

319
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:05,236
is enough for me.

320
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:06,435
It's not enough!

321
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,636
We both know that

322
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:11,716
it's not enough.

323
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,315
So what?

324
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:17,356
We can't go back.

325
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:18,675
Wan Jie.

326
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:22,516
We really can't go back to the past.

327
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,236
But we don't need to go back.

328
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:28,476
If you want,

329
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:30,636
we can start over.

330
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,716
Far away from the Immortal World

331
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,636
and the Demon World.

332
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:38,435
Just me and you,

333
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,435
stay away from disputes.

334
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:42,596
We won't care
about the immortals or the demons.

335
00:22:44,356 --> 00:22:45,275
Would you like to?

336
00:22:57,716 --> 00:22:58,516
(Great.)

337
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:00,155
(They'll get back together this time.)

338
00:23:00,236 --> 00:23:01,155
(I'll go pick some flowers)

339
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:02,795
(for Uncle and Miss Gong.)

340
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:18,596
After tonight,

341
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,435
you'll be 15 years old.

342
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:22,716
Then can I marry you?

343
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:25,876
You are still young,

344
00:23:26,356 --> 00:23:27,476
is it too early

345
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,636
to say these words?

346
00:23:30,795 --> 00:23:32,476
I'm not a kid.

347
00:23:33,915 --> 00:23:36,396
I've told my father

348
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:39,915
I only want to marry you.

349
00:24:01,035 --> 00:24:02,476
Miss Gong, you're here.

350
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:05,476
Didn't you say you two
had nothing to do with each other?

351
00:24:09,356 --> 00:24:11,675
Last time I saw how vicious you were,

352
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:14,955
I knew you were collaborating
with the demons to betray the immortals.

353
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:16,675
Now it seems that

354
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:18,315
I am right.

355
00:24:18,596 --> 00:24:20,356
Making arbitrary conclusions
without evidence,

356
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:22,996
is really the usual style of you, Yu Xuzi.

357
00:24:24,915 --> 00:24:25,675
Miss Gong,

358
00:24:25,795 --> 00:24:28,555
you're really good at arguing.

359
00:24:29,155 --> 00:24:31,636
You two are together
and that is the best evidence.

360
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:33,155
Today,

361
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:35,435
I'm going to let you, the traitor,

362
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:38,915
and Wan Jie die together.

363
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:41,116
Lord, she's a member
of Changsheng Palace.

364
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:43,476
It may not be right to kill her.

365
00:24:43,675 --> 00:24:45,716
Anyone connected to Wan Jie must die.

366
00:24:46,555 --> 00:24:48,035
To be merciful to our enemies

367
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:50,516
is to be cruel to our own people.

368
00:24:51,716 --> 00:24:52,996
Don't you want to avenge

369
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,275
the 3,000 disciples?

370
00:24:55,435 --> 00:24:57,636
Even if the immortal lady dies today,

371
00:24:58,356 --> 00:25:00,636
it's all your fault.

372
00:25:24,116 --> 00:25:25,195
Keran!

373
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:35,195
Keran.

374
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:37,275
Keran, are you okay?

375
00:25:37,356 --> 00:25:37,996
I'm fine.

376
00:25:42,396 --> 00:25:43,075
Uncle!

377
00:25:43,315 --> 00:25:44,155
Don't come over.

378
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:48,516
The little demon is here too.

379
00:25:49,195 --> 00:25:51,075
None of you can escape.

380
00:25:51,836 --> 00:25:52,675
Cast formation!

381
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:11,756
Let's go!

382
00:26:25,195 --> 00:26:26,476
Where is this place?

383
00:26:29,915 --> 00:26:30,955
The Land of Tribulations.

384
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:35,555
Is this the uninhabited
Land of Tribulations?

385
00:26:36,435 --> 00:26:38,555
Unexpectedly, the Demon World
has such a beautiful view.

386
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:40,116
To make you like it,

387
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:41,275
Uncle made a lot of effort.

388
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:43,195
Of course, I also provided some ideas.

389
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:43,876
Right,

390
00:26:43,996 --> 00:26:44,955
there is another good place,

391
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:46,356
you will like it.

392
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:50,075
Let's go.

393
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,195
The scenery is not in the eyes,

394
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:34,716
but in the hearts.

395
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:42,996
Keran,

396
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:45,915
whatever you want,

397
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:47,836
just tell me.

398
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:50,996
If you don't like this place,

399
00:27:51,756 --> 00:27:53,476
and mind that this
is the land of the demons,

400
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:55,756
we can go somewhere else.

401
00:27:57,035 --> 00:27:58,675
If you mind my identity,

402
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:00,236
I can destroy my Demon Pill,

403
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:01,596
and become an ordinary person.

404
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:04,876
As long as it's something
you don't want me to do,

405
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:07,356
I won't do it anymore.

406
00:28:16,516 --> 00:28:17,795
What's wrong, Keran?

407
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:23,356
Nothing.

408
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:16,396
What?

409
00:29:16,675 --> 00:29:17,636
Chong Zi used the Spirit Seal

410
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,756
to save Wan Jie and Gong Keran?

411
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:21,435
Lord of Kunlun Sect wrote a letter,

412
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:23,155
and asked me to send it back quickly.

413
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:42,315
All of you listen up!

414
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:44,116
What happened to Chong Zi,

415
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,195
don't talk about it to anyone,

416
00:29:46,396 --> 00:29:48,516
especially the Supervisor Sage.

417
00:29:51,315 --> 00:29:52,356
- Yes.
- Yes.

418
00:29:55,716 --> 00:29:57,716
Councilor, what are you doing?

419
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,596
(Chong Zi rescued Wan Jie and Gong Keran.)
(Inform Lord of Nanhua and Sage Chonghua.)

420
00:30:03,155 --> 00:30:04,035
Councilor,

421
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:05,756
private blocking news

422
00:30:05,876 --> 00:30:07,236
is a big taboo, do you know that?

423
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:09,716
Chong Zi's return to Nanhua

424
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:11,435
would be a big disaster.

425
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:12,915
She has repeatedly broken the rules,

426
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:14,356
and also bewitched Yinfan

427
00:30:14,476 --> 00:30:15,155
to protect her

428
00:30:15,195 --> 00:30:16,716
regardless of right or wrong.

429
00:30:16,876 --> 00:30:17,955
Rather than this,

430
00:30:18,155 --> 00:30:19,795
it's better to let her die on her own.

431
00:30:20,075 --> 00:30:21,315
But you

432
00:30:21,435 --> 00:30:22,636
can't keep it from him all the time.

433
00:30:22,756 --> 00:30:23,876
If Yinfan finds out,

434
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:25,116
he won't let it go at that.

435
00:30:25,195 --> 00:30:26,476
That's why

436
00:30:26,555 --> 00:30:27,795
I won't let Yinfan know

437
00:30:27,955 --> 00:30:29,555
anything about Chong Zi.

438
00:30:29,756 --> 00:30:30,275
It's better

439
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:32,236
if they never see each other again.

440
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:34,836
I can't let Chong Zi

441
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:36,716
influence Yinfan.

442
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:43,596
But Yinfan will not be controlled by you.

443
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:10,876
Master.

444
00:31:11,396 --> 00:31:12,555
Master.

445
00:31:13,236 --> 00:31:14,476
Put it here.

446
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,555
I win!

447
00:32:26,396 --> 00:32:27,516
Master!

448
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,596
(You must be sincere in your search)

449
00:32:44,716 --> 00:32:46,675
(for medicine on Buzhou Mountain.)

450
00:32:47,035 --> 00:32:49,396
(Even if you are sincere,
you may not be able to find it.)

451
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:50,876
(Not to mention,)

452
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:52,155
(miss,)

453
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,396
(you have other intentions.)

454
00:33:59,396 --> 00:34:00,996
Master! Master!

455
00:34:01,236 --> 00:34:01,795
Master.

456
00:34:01,836 --> 00:34:02,996
Master, are you okay, Master?

457
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:04,236
Ting Xue.

458
00:34:04,435 --> 00:34:05,435
Look!

459
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:07,075
Look, I found it!

460
00:34:13,396 --> 00:34:14,396
(Just for Chong Zi,)

461
00:34:14,715 --> 00:34:15,515
(is it worth it?)

462
00:34:39,676 --> 00:34:40,876
It's been many days,

463
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:42,676
Miss Gong has not gone to see Uncle,

464
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,596
and Uncle has not gone to see Miss Gong.

465
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,755
They two are
hundreds of years old together,

466
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:48,836
why can't they have a good talk?

467
00:34:51,075 --> 00:34:52,196
Do you understand?

468
00:34:53,075 --> 00:34:54,275
I'm sure you don't.

469
00:34:56,515 --> 00:34:59,396
I used to talk everything with my master.

470
00:35:00,356 --> 00:35:01,196
But now he is alone

471
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:02,836
on Zizhu Peak,

472
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:04,995
who will talk with him?

473
00:35:09,755 --> 00:35:10,795
Throw it away for me.

474
00:35:12,116 --> 00:35:12,876
Keran,

475
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:14,715
she doesn't need this.

476
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:46,356
Miss Gong.

477
00:35:53,956 --> 00:35:54,676
You...

478
00:35:55,035 --> 00:35:56,795
How did you get hurt so badly?

479
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:03,876
I was hit by Yu Xuzi's attack,

480
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:07,116
I don't have much time left.

481
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:09,995
It's not going to happen.

482
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:11,436
There're all kinds of medicine here.

483
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:12,436
I'll go find Uncle.

484
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:13,315
He must have a solution.

485
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:14,315
No.

486
00:36:21,956 --> 00:36:23,475
You can't tell him.

487
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,755
Yu Xuzi's attack
penetrated deep into the bone.

488
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,156
Even with his power, he can't resist it.

489
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:33,475
Not to mention me.

490
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:35,995
I know better than anyone.

491
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:39,116
My life

492
00:36:40,235 --> 00:36:42,035
will stop here.

493
00:36:42,555 --> 00:36:43,636
So

494
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,956
it's not that you don't accept Uncle,

495
00:36:46,636 --> 00:36:48,275
- but...
- If that's the case,

496
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:51,356
I shouldn't give him hope,

497
00:36:52,436 --> 00:36:53,956
and let him down again.

498
00:36:56,356 --> 00:36:58,275
Just let him hate me forever.

499
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:00,235
How can he hate you?

500
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:06,035
This is...

501
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,555
This is the wedding dress
he prepared for you.

502
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:12,396
A wedding dress?

503
00:37:12,515 --> 00:37:13,995
He doesn't care
about immortals and demons,

504
00:37:14,196 --> 00:37:15,956
or the world,

505
00:37:16,315 --> 00:37:18,035
or even death,

506
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,315
but only you.

507
00:37:20,956 --> 00:37:23,636
Miss Gong, you obviously love Uncle.

508
00:37:24,196 --> 00:37:25,436
Do you really want to

509
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:27,715
keep your feelings hidden forever?

510
00:37:38,636 --> 00:37:41,035
Uncle must want to see you

511
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:43,035
wearing this wedding dress.

512
00:37:45,995 --> 00:37:47,275
But I can't...

513
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:48,916
I used to be just like you.

514
00:37:49,596 --> 00:37:51,035
When faced with an important person,

515
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,596
I always felt that I shouldn't do anything.

516
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:58,035
But when I left Master,

517
00:37:58,596 --> 00:38:00,315
I realized that there was so much

518
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:02,196
I didn't get to say to him.

519
00:38:05,636 --> 00:38:07,555
You love your master?

520
00:38:10,196 --> 00:38:11,956
I don't care if they say that I'm bold,

521
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:14,075
or I'm daydreaming.

522
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,235
Uncle Wan said

523
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:20,515
I was poisoned
by the Demon World's Heart Poison.

524
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:22,636
I also don't know

525
00:38:22,715 --> 00:38:24,315
what kind of feelings I have for Master.

526
00:38:25,075 --> 00:38:26,596
But when I was poisoned,

527
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:29,035
all I could think about
was my master's face,

528
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:32,356
and the person
I cared about most was him.

529
00:38:33,515 --> 00:38:34,795
Does Supervisor Sage

530
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:36,196
know that?

531
00:38:38,836 --> 00:38:40,035
No, he doesn't.

532
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:42,636
What I regret most now

533
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:45,636
is the things I didn't dare to do
and couldn't do.

534
00:38:46,475 --> 00:38:48,396
If I had the chance again,

535
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:50,515
I would tell him my feelings

536
00:38:50,755 --> 00:38:52,515
without reservation.

537
00:38:55,956 --> 00:38:56,956
Miss Gong,

538
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,396
it's sadder to do nothing

539
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:02,475
than to miss out.

540
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:05,116
But I don't have much time left.

541
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:09,275
I'll only add to his worries.

542
00:39:10,956 --> 00:39:12,636
I promise you I won't tell him.

543
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:14,156
But

544
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:17,636
I don't want you and Uncle
to have any regrets.
