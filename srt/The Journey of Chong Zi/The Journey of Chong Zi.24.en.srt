=Episode 24=

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,639
Autumn is coming, the sky is clear,

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,959
and the moon is bright.

30
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,959
You are so happy today,

31
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,599
would something good happen?

32
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,279
Go tell them

33
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,360
to keep their eyes open.

34
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,840
There will be a great show in Nanhua.

35
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,200
Master.

36
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,840
Wake up, Master.

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,640
Don't scare me.

38
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,719
Master.

39
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,439
Master.

40
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,519
Wake up, Master.

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,560
Wake up.

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,560
I have used all the best immortal herbs

43
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,359
in Nanhua.

44
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,560
Lord Zhuo was furious
upon hearing this,

45
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,400
and is on his way here now.

46
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:43,239
How should we deal with him?

47
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,799
Miss Zhuo is the only sister of Lord Zhuo.

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,040
Something happened to her in Nanhua,

49
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:52,120
and Zhuo Yao
would definitely not let it go.

50
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,239
Maybe

51
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,200
this is what the demons did.

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,159
They deliberately
alienated the relationship

53
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,959
between Nanhua and Qinghua.

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,239
But the demons

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,400
cannot enter Nanhua.

56
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,840
Could it be that

57
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,680
the remnants of the past
haven't been cleared up,

58
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,040
and there are still spies
from the Demon World

59
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,400
in Nanhua?

60
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,159
Yunji.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,359
I haven't seen you for just a day.

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,280
Are you mad at me?

63
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,759
Get up

64
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,919
and go home with me.

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,600
Get up.

66
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,280
There are many people waiting
for you to save.

67
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
Get up to save them.

68
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,519
Get up.

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Get up.

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
You kept saying you want to save people.

71
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,720
But who can save you
when something happened to you?

72
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,560
You waited for Luo Yinfan for so long,

73
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,560
but what did you get?

74
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,039
You were just a fool.

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,359
A fool.

76
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,600
Lord Zhuo.

77
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,079
I beg you to uphold justice
for my master.

78
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,000
I know who killed her.

79
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,479
The murderer

80
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,560
is right in Nanhua.

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,639
Who is the murderer?

82
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,880
Supervisor Sage's disciple,

83
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,120
Chong Zi.

84
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,160
Chong Zi?

85
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,160
Answer me.

86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,639
Where is she?

87
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,320
Don't talk nonsense.

88
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,799
Is there any real evidence?

89
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,479
On the night of Master's death,

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,479
I heard Chong Zi calling her name
with my own ears.

91
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
Master never came back

92
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,759
after that.

93
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,239
Who could it be

94
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,120
if not her?

95
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,639
Let me ask you again.

96
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,320
Where is she?

97
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,840
Lord Zhuo, there is no real evidence

98
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,239
to prove that it is Chong Zi.

99
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,440
It's still guesswork.

100
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,680
Don't jump to conclusions.

101
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,639
The witness is right here.

102
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,799
It's definitely her!

103
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,280
Alright.

104
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,479
Lord Zhuo.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,120
Calm down.

106
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,079
I'll bring her here

107
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,120
to give you justice.

108
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,680
Councilor.

109
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,440
It's noon.

110
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,840
Weird. How could I sleep for so long?

111
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,320
What are you doing?

112
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,880
Why did you kill Miss Zhuo?

113
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,479
Miss Zhuo is dead?

114
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,000
Ting Xue saw you

115
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,000
go to Zizhu Peak last night.

116
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,919
I have never left Yuchen Peak.

117
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,759
And I have no grudges against Miss Zhuo,

118
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,320
how could I kill her?

119
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Stop quibbling.

120
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,680
Where did the stain
on the shoes come from?

121
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,160
I have no idea.

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,479
I want to see my master.

123
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,079
You!

124
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,880
Councilor.

125
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,799
It's better to put Chong Zi
in the Immortal Prison first.

126
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,639
After all,
she is Supervisor Sage's disciple.

127
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,079
It depends on Supervisor Sage
whether to interrogate her.

128
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,320
Take her away.

129
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

130
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,759
Let go of my disciple.

131
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,919
Let her go?

132
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,799
Do you know what she did?

133
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,039
Anyway, she is my disciple.

134
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,919
Without my permission,

135
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,759
why did you lock her up?

136
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,680
Why?

137
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:32,239
It's because she's seen
on Zizhu Peak at night.

138
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,640
Councilor, calm down.

139
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,200
Now is not the time for infighting.

140
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,320
I'll say that again.

141
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,159
Let go of my disciple.

142
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,159
See?

143
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,640
We are not as good as his disciple

144
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,320
in his eyes.

145
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,000
Yinfan is eager to protect his disciple.

146
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,960
Don't provoke him.

147
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,039
Stop it.

148
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,320
All right.

149
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,479
Since you don't think
she is the murderer,

150
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,719
help her find the murderer.

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,799
And then

152
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,479
she will be innocent.

153
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,359
You better keep your promise.

154
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,960
Master.

155
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,239
I know something

156
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,440
that I have to tell you.

157
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,359
Say it.

158
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,200
According to my usual observations,

159
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:32,120
the master-student relationship between
Chong Zi and Sage Chonghua

160
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,560
seems to be way too close.

161
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,080
Watch your words

162
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,399
at this moment.

163
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,399
It's a serious matter.

164
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,399
I dare not exaggerate anything.

165
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:46,440
The reason why I dared to tell you

166
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,320
is that I am afraid that...

167
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,479
I'm afraid that there will be
another Yin Shuixian in Nanhua.

168
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,080
It has been a while since Chong Zi
came to Nanhua.

169
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,039
But she has always
been protected by Sage Chonghua,

170
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:04,080
arrogant and willful, full of evil spirits.

171
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,919
I'm afraid she came prepared.

172
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,239
It is possible for her

173
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,359
to seduce Sage Chonghua
with the same face,

174
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,159
and to attack Miss Zhuo
when she wasn't prepared.

175
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,359
And

176
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,039
her background is dubious.

177
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,200
Young Master Zhuo, I have been
looking for you for a long time.

178
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,440
Here you are.

179
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,440
Take a try of...

180
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,479
Where are you going?

181
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,440
(Nanhua)

182
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,719
(It's a letter from Nanhua.)

183
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,399
(Could it be that
the marriage is settled?)

184
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,720
(Miss Zhuo passed away, the whole immortal sect
is mournful, come to Nanhua soon)

185
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,520
What?

186
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,000
Something happened to Miss Zhuo?

187
00:10:58,239 --> 00:10:59,839
I'm here to see my aunt off.

188
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,399
You've followed me all the way.

189
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,960
Now we are in Nanhua.

190
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,279
Can you leave me alone?

191
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,719
I don't want others
to misunderstand our relationship.

192
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,000
Young Master, I...

193
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,479
Are you Miss Min Suqiu?

194
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,039
I often hear people
in the immortal sect say that

195
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,560
Miss Min has
an extraordinary temperament.

196
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,399
It's really as expected.

197
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,039
You are worthy of being
Councilor Min's grandniece.

198
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm flattered.

199
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,159
May I ask you who you are?

200
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,680
I am Ting Xue,

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,799
the disciple of Miss Zhuo.

202
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,120
It's you.

203
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,320
Do you know

204
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:46,239
why Young Master Zhuo
is indifferent to you?

205
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,560
All because of Chong Zi.

206
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,880
Chong Zi?

207
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,919
You may not know.

208
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,839
Young Master Zhuo is talented

209
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,000
and handsome.

210
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,479
He will definitely be able to
inherit the Qinghua Sect one day.

211
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,560
Many women try their best to
get close to him.

212
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,760
And Chong Zi is even more unscrupulous.

213
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,960
She first seduced Sage Chonghua,

214
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,239
and then Qin Ke.

215
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,880
Presumably Young Master Zhuo

216
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,359
is too kind to be confused by her.

217
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,960
I've heard a lot
about her a long time ago,

218
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,799
but I didn't expect her
to be so unbearable.

219
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,320
She even seduced

220
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,159
Sage Chonghua?

221
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,799
Sage Chonghua naturally
dotes on her as his disciple.

222
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,000
But Chong Zi doesn't think so.

223
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,719
Before, she was sick in bed,

224
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,000
and I treated her with Master.

225
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,399
Chong Zi was jealous of the relationship
between my master and Sage Chonghua,

226
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,239
and even killed my master

227
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,880
in revenge.

228
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,120
She did kill Miss Zhuo?

229
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,320
She is so vicious.

230
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
Chong Zi killed my master,

231
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,080
and she should pay with her life.

232
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,880
Once she dies,

233
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,279
Young Master Zhuo may wake up,

234
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,000
mend his ways,

235
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,479
and see how good you are.

236
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,479
Aunt.

237
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,120
My aunt died in vain.

238
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,239
Why did you come here

239
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,440
instead of investigating the real culprit?

240
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,000
Chong Zi got arrested and imprisoned.

241
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,680
What did you do?

242
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,039
Two of the most important women

243
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,719
in my life

244
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,880
lost their lives because of you.

245
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,399
I'd like to cherish them,

246
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,880
but it's too late.

247
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:30,960
Ask yourself

248
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,479
how you treated them.

249
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,279
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

250
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,120
Please leave us alone.

251
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,919
Let me keep her company for the last ride.

252
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,719
(Everything is my fault.)

253
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,520
(I won't let you die inexplicably.)

254
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,239
(It's just that)

255
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,799
(I don't believe
this is what Chong Zi did.)

256
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,560
Unexpectedly, Miss Zhuo's death

257
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,159
was really caused by Chong Zi.

258
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,080
She is so vicious.

259
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,799
And I heard that

260
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,080
not only the Young Master,

261
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,320
but even Sage Chonghua

262
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,760
was completely deceived by her.

263
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:41,599
No matter what Chong Zi did,

264
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:42,719
they would protect her.

265
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,359
I really feel sorry for Miss Zhuo.

266
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,200
No matter how powerful
Luo Yinfan's spells are,

267
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,080
he can't bully Qinghua

268
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,279
over and over again.

269
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,440
I won't let him succeed.

270
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,560
Chong Zi has to die.

271
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,000
Otherwise,

272
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,000
it's hard to relieve the pain
of losing my sister.

273
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,080
Father.

274
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,479
The truth is still being investigated.

275
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:03,919
Chong Zi has not yet pleaded guilty.

276
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,000
How can you conclude that Chong Zi
is a murderer

277
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,960
based on just a few words from someone?

278
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,640
If you just want to displease Luo Yinfan,

279
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,960
there are many ways.

280
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,000
Why do you have to hurt his disciple?

281
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,159
You are still speaking for Luo Yinfan.

282
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,080
Did you forget what he did to you?

283
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,039
Haven't you learned
enough lessons before?

284
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,680
I'm not speaking for Luo Yinfan.

285
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,399
I remember everything he did.

286
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,760
But Chong Zi was wronged.

287
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,440
You!

288
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,479
I think

289
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,120
you just want Chong Zi to die

290
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,799
to calm your grievances,

291
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,760
and it has nothing to do
with whether she is guilty or not.

292
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,880
It's for Chong Zi again.

293
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,239
Your aunt is dead.

294
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,479
But you are still obsessed.

295
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,719
- I...
- Zhuo Hao.

296
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:42,680
Lord Zhuo is so angry

297
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,799
- because he wants to get justice for your aunt.
- Shut up.

298
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,479
I...

299
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,560
Outsiders should not gossip

300
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,839
about my family affairs.

301
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,000
You should shut up.

302
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,399
Piss off.

303
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,760
Piss off!

304
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,399
(Why should I be worried?)

305
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:10,999
(What does Luo Yinfan's disciple
have to do with me?)

306
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:13,519
(She just looks somewhat similar)

307
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,159
(to Chong Zi.)

308
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:16,879
(How will saving her)

309
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,840
(benefit me?)

310
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,960
(I am just asking for trouble.)

311
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,399
(This is...)

312
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:35,999
(Should I go up?)

313
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,240
(Someone cast illusions
in the territory of Nanhua.)

314
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,759
(Could it be that Luo Yinfan)

315
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:52,960
(has something to show me?)

316
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,639
Isn't this the Immortal Prison?

317
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,960
Could it be that...

318
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,639
Chong Zi.

319
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,600
Chong Zi.

320
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,320
She's locked up here.

321
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,680
Evil breath.

322
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,440
Inborn evil breath.

323
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,639
I see.

324
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:23,840
Same appearance.

325
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,919
Same name.

326
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,600
Chong Zi.

327
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,680
Is it really you?

328
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,600
Now that you got her back,

329
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,879
you should treat her well.

330
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
Why lock her up here?

331
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,680
Luo Yinfan is such a jerk.

332
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,399
If I found him, I would...

333
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,240
Young Master Zhuo.

334
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,840
Here you are.

335
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
Young Master Zhuo.

336
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,639
Shall we talk in private?

337
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,600
Covering up evil breath
with a pendant carrying aura.

338
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,840
Only you

339
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,759
can manage this.

340
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,279
You covered her appearance

341
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:07,399
to remove suspicion.

342
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:08,600
So

343
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:10,440
the reason why
you don't want to tell everyone

344
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,200
is because...

345
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,119
I wouldn't have told anyone

346
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,680
if something serious had happened

347
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,399
that endangered her life.

348
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,519
Well.

349
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,799
If it's really evil breath,

350
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:21,919
could my aunt's death be caused

351
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,200
by Chong Zi?

352
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,119
No.

353
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:27,799
I checked the wound on Miss Zhuo's body,

354
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,440
and it wasn't caused by the magic weapon
of Chong Zi.

355
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:33,840
I knew that

356
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,240
she'd never kill my aunt.

357
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:38,039
Councilor is eager to explain
to your father,

358
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,440
so he will try his best to convict Chong Zi.

359
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,879
In their eyes,

360
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,519
whether Chong Zi is innocent or not
is not important,

361
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:45,960
what matters

362
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,360
is the relationship
between Nanhua and Qinghua.

363
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,759
Yes.

364
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,159
We should think of a way soon.

365
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,680
Something's wrong with Miss Zhuo's death.

366
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,279
It would be best
if we could find out the truth.

367
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,879
But if it really
gets to the point of no return,

368
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,560
no matter what,

369
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,759
we have to save Chong Zi's life first.

370
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,279
Due to my status,

371
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:10,999
I need your favor.

372
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,879
My favor?

373
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,879
Is this something you would say?

374
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:20,279
Seriously?

375
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,639
You really are different from before.

376
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,440
But are you doing everything

377
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,440
because you regret

378
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,680
killing her?

379
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,639
I don't need any reason to protect her.

380
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:42,639
If I hadn't had to,

381
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,519
I wouldn't have come to you.

382
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,519
It's okay.

383
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:51,159
After all, Chong Zi is my young lady.

384
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,759
Don't call her young lady.

385
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:53,999
I'd love to.

386
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,999
It has nothing to do with you.

387
00:21:58,879 --> 00:21:59,680
Don't worry.

388
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,919
I will not let her die unjustly again.

389
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:03,039
Besides,

390
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,720
I have to uphold justice for my aunt.

391
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,600
As long as we find a way
to get the best of both parties,

392
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:08,119
I am willing to give it my all,

393
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,159
no matter what it costs.

394
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,519
Wuhua Shield

395
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,840
makes all spells invisible.

396
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:49,519
I've only seen this spell

397
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,840
in books.

398
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,960
This is the trace left by the demons
when they released their unique skill.

399
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,720
My aunt's death has something to do
with the demons.

400
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,039
The demons came from this direction.

401
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,320
Yuchen Peak.

402
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,960
During this period of time, she was
the only one living on Yuchen Peak.

403
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,039
Right.

404
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,039
How could the demons
have anything to do with her?

405
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,799
We'll see.

406
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,919
What kind of spell is this?

407
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,600
This spell
doesn't contain murderous intent,

408
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:25,799
only psychedelic effects.

409
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,720
Could it be...

410
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:30,840
Sha Yihuan.

411
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:31,680
The one of the demons

412
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,519
who is good at
bewitching people with dreams?

413
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:35,639
Chong used to say that
she had nightmares.

414
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,320
I'm going to see her.

415
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,560
I'm also going.

416
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,279
I'm going to see my disciple.

417
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Don't follow me.

418
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,879
Take care.

419
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,399
Master.

420
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,279
You don't blame me

421
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,039
for taking so long to see you, do you?

422
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,039
Didn't you tell me not to

423
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,720
go to Zizhu Peak again?

424
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,600
How can I blame you

425
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,680
if you don't want to see me?

426
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,799
It's me

427
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,519
who dragged you down.

428
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:30,240
Stop pretending.

429
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:34,039
The interrogation
will be held in a few days.

430
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,680
Are you worried?

431
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,159
It's no more than one life.

432
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:40,639
What is there to worry about?

433
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,600
I didn't do it.

434
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,519
As long as Master believes in me,

435
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,799
I have nothing to fear.

436
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,799
I've found some clues.

437
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:51,080
But there are some questions

438
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,560
I have to ask you.

439
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,519
Did you have a dream

440
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,480
the night Miss Zhuo was killed?

441
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,720
How did you know?

442
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,119
Yes.

443
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,840
I did.

444
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,320
There was always a voice in my dream

445
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,200
asking me to kill Miss Zhuo.

446
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,799
In this case,

447
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:13,119
Master would belong to me alone.

448
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,399
I had been rejecting in my dream.

449
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,879
Then I woke up in a shock.

450
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,480
I didn't expect

451
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,919
Miss Zhuo to die the next day.

452
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,159
I dared not tell others.

453
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:25,279
I'm afraid that after I say it,

454
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,519
they will think that I am the murderer.

455
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,200
I...

456
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,799
Demons invaded Nanhua
to bewitch you to kill,

457
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:32,840
but they did it themselves

458
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,999
after failing to do so.

459
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,039
Don't worry, I will find that person

460
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,799
and take you back to Zizhu Peak.

461
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,480
Really?

462
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,680
Would you

463
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,919
abandon me?

464
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,519
Never ever.

465
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Master.

466
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,759
I won't get you into trouble anymore,

467
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,879
and I'm not mad at you anymore.

468
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,119
I want to go back
to Zizhu Peak with you,

469
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,720
to concentrate on
practicing spells with you,

470
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,119
saving the world,

471
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,560
and eradicating the demons.

472
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,999
When we are free,

473
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,600
we can drink and eat fish at the tavern.

474
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,639
And Lion...

475
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,560
I miss it.

476
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,119
Stop crying.

477
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,480
We can go back soon.

478
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:32,279
Get a good night's sleep first.

479
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,759
Then go to Liuhe Hall with peace of mind.

480
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,840
I will arrange everything.

481
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,440
In the dream,

482
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,240
I really wished for a moment that

483
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:51,680
Master belonged to me alone.

484
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,999
But I know that

485
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,600
Master is not my own.

486
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,519
I don't expect Master

487
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,119
to belong to me alone.

488
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,799
But I hope to

489
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,119
have a little place for me

490
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,320
in your heart.

491
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:16,600
♪Dyed with love and missing♪

492
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:23,960
♪But the bright moon
is still hanging high♪

493
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:29,480
Young Master Zhuo,
please help Chong Zi once.

494
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
You keep calling me by my name.

495
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,440
Now you call me

496
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:38,560
Young Master Zhuo.

497
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:40,519
Young Master Zhuo.

498
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,039
Please help Chong Zi.

499
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,840
Why should I help her?

500
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,039
She is Nanhua's disciple,

501
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,519
what does she have to do with me?

502
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,680
Miss Zhuo was Chong Zi's savior.

503
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,680
Chong Zi had no reason to kill her.

504
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,600
Since you believe in Chong Zi,

505
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,240
why bother to come to me?

506
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,159
Wouldn't it be better to go to

507
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,320
your master and Councilor Sage?

508
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:02,360
Councilor Sage has always favored you.

509
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,560
If you ask for his favor,

510
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,919
Chong Zi may have a chance to survive.

511
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,960
Councilor has always
been hostile to Chong Zi.

512
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,799
He won't let go easily

513
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:15,879
even if my master
wants to investigate carefully.

514
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,200
Are you so sure?

515
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,159
How do you know if you don't try it?

516
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:22,399
I'm just afraid that

517
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,600
if I offend Councilor...

518
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,360
Zhuo Hao.

519
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,600
The only one
who can save Chong Zi is you.

520
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:30,759
What if I don't help?

521
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,159
What's your plan?

522
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,960
I will kneel at the gate of Liuhe Hall

523
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,399
until Councilor is willing to
reinvestigate the truth.

524
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,639
What's so funny?

525
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,720
This is really like

526
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,759
what you would do.

527
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,840
Some people want to kill Chong Zi,

528
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,600
while others want to save her.

529
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,600
But you are the first one

530
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
to be so self-righteous.

531
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,119
Put away your wine.

532
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,399
Even if you don't come to me,

533
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,600
I will help her.

534
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,119
Zhuo Hao.

535
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
Whether you laugh at me

536
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,519
or look down on me,

537
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,399
Chong Zi is definitely innocent.

538
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:10,560
Nanhua has wronged one person.

539
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,960
It shouldn't happen again.

540
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,279
Unjust cases are common
in the immortal sect.

541
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:17,840
You'll get used to it.

542
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:25,279
Father, don't kill Chong Zi.

543
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,440
I already know who killed my aunt.

544
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,320
You came back in a hurry

545
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,919
just to tell me this?

546
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,440
It's true, Father. Trust me.

547
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:34,720
Both Sage Chonghua and I think that

548
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,560
Sha Yihuan invaded Nanhua.

549
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,159
Chong Zi was framed.

550
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,960
This matter has to be investigated.

551
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,080
If we let it go,

552
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,399
more disciples

553
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,360
will suffer misfortune.

554
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,840
You and Sage Chonghua?

555
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,279
This doesn't matter.

556
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,080
What matters is that

557
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,080
what I said is true.

558
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,720
It was you who hated Luo Yinfan earlier.

559
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:54,799
And it is you
who is standing by his side now.

560
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,080
I am not standing by his side.

561
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,399
I'm doing this for Chong Zi.

562
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,080
For the sake of you and Yunji,
I am ready to completely

563
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,119
break off friendship with Nanhua.

564
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,039
Yet you come here and
say these nonsense to me?

565
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,080
It's not nonsense, it's the truth.

566
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,960
Shut up.

567
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,519
Don't leak a word

568
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,240
of what you just said to me.

569
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,360
Why not?

570
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,919
The most important thing now is
to find out the truth of the death,

571
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,480
and not let the real murderer
go unpunished.

572
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,999
So it wasn't that

573
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,960
Chong Zi colluded with Sha Yihuan?

574
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:24,720
Of course I know.

575
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,680
Because she is...

576
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,399
Because I just believe in her.

577
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,720
She will never betray the immortal sect.

578
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:31,600
You!

579
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,200
To tell you frankly,

580
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,720
regardless of whether Chong Zi
colluded with Sha Yihuan or not,

581
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:44,799
she must die

582
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,999
for Qinghua's honor.

583
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,399
I have to

584
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,200
vent my anger.

585
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,159
Father.

586
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,639
Don't even think about going out

587
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,080
until Chong Zi is executed.

588
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:04,560
Father.

589
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,399
Lord Zhuo.

590
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,119
Mu Yu, serve tea.

591
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,240
No need for that.

592
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:26,200
I came here just to ask

593
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,440
why Chong Zi hasn't yet been executed

594
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:30,799
for so many days
after the accident of my sister.

595
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,119
Qinghua needs an explanation.

596
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,480
I really want to

597
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:37,759
deal with that evildoer
as soon as possible.

598
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,279
But Yinfan didn't allow me to

599
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:42,119
and wanted to look for evidence.

600
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,119
What?

601
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,919
Luo Yinfan didn't tell you?

602
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,799
No.

603
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,560
He and my son found evidence

604
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,320
that the demons invaded Nanhua.

605
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,159
What?

606
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,519
He didn't tell you about such a big deal.

607
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,879
What do you think he's trying to hide?

608
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,680
In my opinion,

609
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:05,360
Chong Zi colluded with the demons
to murder my sister.

610
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:07,279
It was also a conspiracy of the demons

611
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,680
that she came back from the dead
and returned to Nanhua.

612
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,600
And Sage Chonghua
turned a blind eye to all this,

613
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,639
and let everything go on

614
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,480
for his own preference.

615
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,480
Councilor.

616
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,200
Supervisor Sage wants to eradicate
the demons wholeheartedly,

617
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,600
how could he let their conspiracy
go unnoticed?

618
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:23,600
You'd better

619
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:25,600
ask him about it in person.

620
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,879
It won't work.

621
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,639
He's been obsessed.

622
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,720
Only when Chong Zi was gone

623
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,999
would he wake up.

624
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,039
So the only way now

625
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,639
is to kill Chong Zi immediately.

626
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,560
Execution without trial

627
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,399
doesn't conform to the rules
of the immortal sect.

628
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,080
Councilor, please think about it twice.

629
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,200
Which is more important,
the rules of the immortal sect

630
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,680
or the safety of the common people?

631
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:56,960
Councilor.

632
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,200
Lord Zhuo is right.

633
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,399
If all of this is a conspiracy
by the demons,

634
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:11,919
wouldn't Nanhua

635
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,599
become the laughing stock of
all the immortal sects?

636
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,720
I will now send Chong Zi

637
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
to the Six-world Monument for execution.

638
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,680
(Chong Zi is in danger.)

639
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,960
(Come to the Six-world Monument.)

640
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,720
(Forget about the Heart Poison.)

641
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,319
(Chong.)

642
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,520
(I'll take you back to Zizhu peak.)

643
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,000
(Chong Zi is in danger.
Come to the Six-world Monument.)

644
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:14,800
Why are you here?

645
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,800
Your father and Councilor have

646
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:17,879
brought Chong Zi
to the Six-world Monument.

647
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,399
Let's go save her.

648
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,200
She can only rely on us now.

649
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,440
Let's go.

650
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,200
I'm going with you.

651
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,240
You?

652
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,680
Aren't you afraid of offending Councilor?

653
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,720
I have to go.

654
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,399
Chong Zi is my best friend in Nanhua.

655
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,720
I have to save her from the trouble.

656
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:34,200
Let's go together.

657
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,760
Your wickedness makes Nanhua

658
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,240
ashamed to face the immortal sects.

659
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,240
It was you

660
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,440
who murdered Miss Zhuo.

661
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:45,639
You should have died long ago.

662
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,079
I didn't kill her.

663
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,440
You can't kill me.

664
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:49,480
I want to see my master.

665
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:50,639
Shut up.

666
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,280
Today I will send you to the Underworld,

667
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:55,879
so that you will not be reborn.

668
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,639
Chong Zi.

669
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,200
Chong Zi.

670
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,879
Why are you here?

671
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,319
If Chong Zi was really
sent to the Underworld,

672
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,680
she would be dissipated,

673
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,919
and there would be
no room for turning back.

674
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,040
If Councilor and Lord Zhuo
insist on punishing her,

675
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,159
I am willing to take
the next punishment for her.

676
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,280
I have evidence to prove that

677
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,599
it was the demons who killed my aunt,

678
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,599
not Chong Zi.

679
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,280
You!

680
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,240
If Chong Zi was dealt with like this,

681
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,879
Sage Chonghua would not let it go.

682
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,319
Zhenzhu.

683
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,319
Where is my master?

684
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,440
How dare you make trouble

685
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,960
in front of the Six-world Monument?

686
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,159
- Chong Zi.
- Chong Zi.

687
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,280
- Chong Zi!
- Chong Zi!.

688
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:58,760
Chong Zi.

689
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,919
(Master.)

690
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,079
(Chong.)

691
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,520
(Chong.)

692
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:12,919
No interrogation.

693
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,919
No confession.

694
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,839
We also found evidence that

695
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:16,240
it wasn't Chong Zi who did it.

696
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:17,800
But Councilor turned a blind eye on it,

697
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,839
and hit Chong Zi down
from the Six-world Monument.

698
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,000
Are you trying to cover up the truth
with her death?

699
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,599
You traitor.

700
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,960
Are you also bewitched by Chong Zi?

701
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:27,800
How dare you say that?

702
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:50,399
Who hurt my disciple like this?

703
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,440
It was me.

704
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,240
Why did you execute the sentence today?

705
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,599
Yinfan.

706
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,480
Listen.

707
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,240
Today, Chong Zi has to die.

708
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:08,839
Young Master Zhuo has already
delivered the message for me.

709
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,079
But you didn't care.

710
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,639
All you want is

711
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,000
for my disciple to die.

712
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:15,919
Right.

713
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,760
We found traces of
the invasion of Sha Yihuan

714
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
outside the main hall
of Chonghua Palace

715
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,119
and in Chong Zi's room.

716
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,720
Please go there to take a look.

717
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:27,319
It is not certain whether
it was an invasion or collusion.

718
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,919
When is it your turn to point out

719
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:32,119
the matter between me and my disciple?

720
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,159
You protect this devil so much.

721
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,879
Do you want my sister to die in vain?

722
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:37,119
Listen.

723
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:40,520
Chong Zi has to pay with her life.

724
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,639
Master.

725
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,919
Take a try.

726
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:44,800
You!

727
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,079
No!

728
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,159
Father.

729
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
Since you want Chong Zi to
pay with her life,

730
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,599
I will carry out the punishment

731
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,040
on behalf of Qinghua Palace.

732
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,919
Zhuo Hao.

733
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,919
Are you crazy?

734
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,919
What are you doing?

735
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,079
Young Master Zhuo.

736
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,159
Sea Flame.

737
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:39,599
Qinghua's unique skill.

738
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:53,319
You said

739
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:56,520
you've always wanted
to watch Sea Flame again.

740
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
I made it.

741
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,599
Did you see?

742
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,280
Zhuo Hao.

743
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,520
Do you know what you did?

744
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,800
At this point,

745
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,960
the grievances between Qinghua
and Chong Zi are all over.

746
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:14,680
Please leave the rest

747
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,800
to her master.

748
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:18,919
Young Master Zhuo.

749
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,119
Are you confused?

750
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,800
She is your aunt.

751
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,720
Councilor.

752
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,119
Qinghua has already punished Chong Zi.

753
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,040
That should be the end of the matter.

754
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,040
I've checked the Book of Secrets.

755
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
Miss Zhuo's death

756
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,839
was caused by the evil spirit

757
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,480
that was restrained by the moon.

758
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,119
Qi restrains the energy,

759
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,319
imprisoning the primordial spirit.

760
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,520
It proves that this matter
was exactly done by the demons.

761
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,559
Since Yinfan said that it was caused
by Sha Yihuan,

762
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720
it all made sense.

763
00:40:52,879 --> 00:40:53,960
(If you are able to)

764
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,720
(carry out
the execution yourself by then,)

765
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,559
you can make a little modification

766
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
and save her life

767
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,480
while preserving Qinghua's majesty.

768
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,639
I said I could save you.

769
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,240
Master.

770
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:17,599
Chong.

771
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,520
Hold on.

772
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,720
I'll take you home right away.

773
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:23,599
Yinfan.

774
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,919
Do you really want to protect this devil?

775
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:31,960
So far,

776
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,960
Chong Zi has nothing to do
with Miss Zhuo's death.

777
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,720
My disciple abides by every rule

778
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,919
of the immortal sect,

779
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,559
and suffers wrongs
that should not be endured.

780
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,720
Instead, you were the ones

781
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:46,440
who lynched her

782
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,079
while I was practicing.

783
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,440
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

784
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,839
I've made it clear.

785
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,800
I need you to give me an explanation.

786
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,639
All right.

787
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,639
Now that Hao has imposed the punishment

788
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,919
on Qinghua's behalf,

789
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,480
I won't bother with this matter anymore.

790
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,040
The rest

791
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,639
are Nanhua's internal affairs.

792
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,319
Deal with them yourselves.

793
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,280
Okay.

794
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:22,440
Luo Yinfan!

795
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,000
I will give you an explanation.

796
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,639
Tomorrow, Chong Zi will be judged

797
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:30,680
in Liuhe Hall.
