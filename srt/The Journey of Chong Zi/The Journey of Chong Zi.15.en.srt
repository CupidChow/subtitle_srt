Master,

73
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,400
is there anyone you want to protect?

74
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,359
You love the common people

75
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,759
and have never considered about yourself.

76
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,440
I think since you want
to protect the world,

77
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,479
I'll protect you.

78
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,440
Why do I hear your voice

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,919

81
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,039
Zizhu Peak also becomes very quiet.

82
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,440
I haven't accompanied you

83
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,079
to the Mortal World
you like for a long time,

84
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,199
nor have I

85
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,919
eaten the desserts cooked by you.

86
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,639
The books on the desk

87
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,239
are put so orderly

88
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,720
that I can't get used to it.

89
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,359
Even if you don't want to say to me,

90
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,680
Lion and Zi

91
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,239
are also waiting for you to go back.

92
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,120
By then,

93
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,720
carve a sculpture of you

94
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,000
and put it next to mine

95
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,120
so that they can be
with each other forever

96
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,919

98
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,880
It's all my fault.

99
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,000
I failed to protect you

100
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,519
and had to watch you
being killed by the sword

101
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,400

102
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,480
I don't deserve to be your master.

103
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,519
I don't.

106
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:54,040
Father,

107
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,240
are you kidding me?

108
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:09,360
No.

109
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,920
That's impossible.

110
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,439
Luo Yinfan dotes on her the most,

111
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,720
so how could he kill her?

112
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,920
It's because he dotes on her

113
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,600
that he placed righteousness above that.

114
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,559
I think you should know that.

115
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,920
I just didn't expect
him to be that ruthless.

116

Father, let me go.

119
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,280
I need to go to Nanhua Sect.

120
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,639
I'm going to find out what happened.

121
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,040
Even if you find out the truth, so what?

122
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,280
She has died

123
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,920
and couldn't come back to life
even if you go there.

124
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,800
That's impossible.

125
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,319
No, I don't believe that.

126
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,960
Chong Zi liked him so much

127
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,879
and mentioned him every day.

128
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,160
What did she do wrong?

129
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,480
What did she do wrong?

130
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,119
Did she do something unforgivable
and must be executed?

131
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,160
Luo Yinfan,

132
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,119
how could you do that to Chong Zi?

133
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,800
How could you kill her
without permission?

134
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,400
I have to tell you
that it mattered a lot.

135
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,199
We'd rather kill her mistakenly
than free her mistakenly.

136
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,360
If I were him,

137
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,800
I would also do that.

138
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Father, let me go.

139
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,319
I'm going to kill Luo Yinfan.

140
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,199
I'll kill him to take
revenge for Chong Zi.

141
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,679
Can you succeed?

142
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,079
Judging from your magical power now,

143
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,639
I think it's lucky enough for us

144
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,519
if you can survive after one move.

145
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,999
So what?

146
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:56,119
Even if I can't kill him now,

147
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,999
I'll cultivate myself for ten
or twenty years,

148
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,400
and even one hundred years more.

149
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:00,800
One day,

150
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,559
I'll kill Luo Yinfan in person.

151
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
I want him to pay
with his life for Chong Zi.

152
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,160
Ke.

153
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Master.

154
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,879
Did you go to Zizhu Peak again?

155
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,199
You know Sage Chonghua
set a shield there.

156
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:56,759
- Why did you...
- I know.

157
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,319
I just want to
see her for the last time,

158
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,280
but I didn't expect

159
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
someone wasn't only heartless

160
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,559
but also stopped me from lamenting.

161
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,400
I know you're upset,

162
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,400
but it has become like this.

163
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,639
Sage Chonghua has his own difficulty.

164
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,920
Does his difficulty

165
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,720
matter more than a person's life?

166
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
I know

167
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,519
you think Sage Chonghua
doesn't deserve Chong Zi's sincerity

168
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,439
and she shouldn't have died,

169
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,679
but if Sage Chonghua
hadn't killed her on that day,

170
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,240
I'm afraid the whole Immortal World

171
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,240
would have suffered great losses,

172
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:33,960
not to mention Nanhua Sect.

173
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,720
By then, it would be a catastrophe,

174
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:37,600
and lots of people would die.

175
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,960
So did Chong Zi deserve to die?

176
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,199
Then do people around the world
deserve to die?

177
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,040
To Yinfan,

178
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,840
protecting people in the six worlds
is his responsibility,

179
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,559
as well as his shackle.

180
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:04,360
No matter the one he faces is Chong Zi

181
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:05,800
or people in the six worlds,

182
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,800
he has to be cautious enough

183
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,639
in case of causing unimaginable trouble.

184
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,360
You can't imagine

185
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,639
his bitterness,

186
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,800
and he sacrifices himself

187
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,679
more than any one of us.

188
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:20,400
When I put myself in his place,

189
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,960
I just think

190
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,879
no one is qualified to scold him.

191
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,199
I don't understand that.

192
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:31,439
I'm only angry at my inability.

193
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:33,559
I couldn't do anything

194
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,600
except watching Sage Chonghua

195
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,400
kill Chong Zi.

196
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,360
Ke,

197
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,360
one can be just if he has no desires.

198
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,160
Since we can't change the fact,

199
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,400
we could only strengthen ourselves.

200
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I think you can't focus on practicing

201
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,679
during this period,

202
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,999
so why don't you

203
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,559
take this chance to
organize your thoughts

204
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,920
and try to improve

205
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,679
your state of mind?

206
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,759
My king,

207
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:29,679
I've finished the task.

208
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:32,119
Although I couldn't
get back the Holy Sword,

209
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,559
they didn't succeed in purifying it.

210
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,720
The sword is gone,

211
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,360
and so is Chong Zi.

212
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,960
It's out of my expectation.

213
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:44,840
Well,

214
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,840
should I go back to get the sword back?

215
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,240
No need.

216
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,519
She's indeed dead.

217
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,840
Luo Yinfan is as heartless

218
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,920
as rumored.

219
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,439
Since she's dead,

220
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,160
how could you

221
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:06,639
continue lying?

222
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,240
My king,

223
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,360
what should we do now?

224
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,040
Keep waiting.

225
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,360
Ni Lun became a demon
after experiencing three lives.

226
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,199
I've been waiting for a long time,

227
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,280
so I don't mind keeping waiting.

228
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,960
One day,

229
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,999
I'll take my people

230
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,480
to leave this deserted place

231
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,600
and go to where we should go.

232
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,999
(Why does Supervisor Sage
go to the Six-world Monument?)

233
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,920
(Liuhe Hall)

234
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,960
Mu Yu.

235
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,120
I'm going to see Yinfan on Zizhu Peak.

236
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,880
Do you want to go with me?

237
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,079
I've received no news of him

238
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:09,520
during these days,

239
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,000
so I'm a little worried about him.

240
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,960
You don't need to be worried, sir.

241
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,640
I saw Supervisor Sage

242
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,319
went to the Six-world Monument.

243
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,399
I think he didn't want us to disturb him

244
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,559
and wanted to stay alone.

245
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,279
Let's give him more time.

246
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,120
He went to the Six-world Monument?

247
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,679
Probably he didn't want us to find him,

248
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,199
and the Six-world Monument

249
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,399
is indeed a good place for cultivation.

250
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,919
You're right.

251
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,199
Fine,

252
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,319
I won't go there to ask for a snub.

253
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,760
I read from a book of the Immortal World

254
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,120
that the Six-world Monument
was created by destiny.

255
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,439
All creatures in the six worlds could
offer a sacrifice to it to make a vow

256
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,120
and ask it to pay a little back to them.

257
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,399
I want nothing

258
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:45,360
but just hope Chong Zi could be reborn.

259
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,399
If my hope could be fulfilled,

260
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,480
I'm willing to concentrate
on cultivating myself

261
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,240
and reviving the Immortal World

262
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,600
in the rest of my life.

263
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,960
I didn't expect

264
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:56,760
Hao to be so entreprenant.

265
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,120
Yes,

266
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,120
but he's also at the edge of craziness.

267
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,799
Speaking of this,

268
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:07,640
it's caused by Yinfan.

269
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,880
In fact,

270
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,279
I think Yinfan is the saddest one

271
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,360
at this moment.

272
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,520
I've never seen him

273
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,039
cares about someone before.

274
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,679
To him,

275
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,919
Chong Zi was more than a disciple.

276
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,039
Yunji,

277
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,679
why don't you go to accompany him?

278
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,480
Everyone is destined,

279
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,199
and I shouldn't take advantage
of his distress.

280
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,960
Besides,

281
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,720
I can never be compared

282
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,240
to a dead person.

283
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,000
It'll do no good

284
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,600
to both him and me.

285
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:51,640
I can't understand your relationship.

286
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:55,480
Never mind.

287
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,640
It's your business,
so make the decision yourself.

288
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
I have to wait for him
to get over it himself.

289
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,159
Even if it'll cost ten years

290
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,760
or hundreds of years,

291
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,679
I'll wait for him.

292
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,559
Master,

293
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,679
isn't that Sage Chonghua, Luo Yinfan?

294
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,840
(Wine)
Waiter, a pot of wine.

295
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,199
Okay, wait a minute.

296
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:56,079
I'm Hai Sheng, and I'm grateful
to your rescue of my life.

297
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,520
I've never forgotten that.

298
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,559
You recognized me wrongly.

299
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,000
Sir, please listen to me.

300
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,079
You indeed didn't
save my life in person.

301
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,640
It's Miss Chong Zi,

302
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,199
your disciple, who did.

303
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,799
This is an abandoned baby
saved by you, right?

304
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,079
Our abbey also take

305
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,279
these poor kids in

306
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,799
to build relationships
as many as possible.

307
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,000
I remember Miss Chong Zi saved me

308
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:24,760
when I was poisoned.

309
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,960
Moreover,

310
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,439
she encouraged me to found a sect

311
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,559
and help people in distress.

312
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:29,720
And she said

313
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,279
if I insisted on thanking her,

314
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,360
I could hang her master
Sage Chonghua's portrait

315
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,840
in the main hall of my house.

316
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,360
(Chong,)

317
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,039
(how many things have you done for me?)

318
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,399
How is Miss Chong Zi?

319
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,600
Please tell her

320
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,120
that I've never forgotten her words

321
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:50,520
and done everything accordingly.

322
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:52,399
I'll also try my best

323
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,760
to help people around me.

324
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,480
If she knew that,

325
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,199
she would be very happy.

326
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,640
I'm sorry.

327
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,039
I've delayed your time for so long.

328
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,840
I think you must have something to do

329
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,520
in the Mortal World,

330
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,960
so I'll stop disturbing you.

331
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,480
If you need anything,

332
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,120
I'll help you once you call me.

333
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,039
By the way,

334
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,520
do you know Wen's Mansion in Yangzhou?

335
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,439
Do you also know Mr. Wen, sir?

336
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:15,760
He's a

337
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,199
famous generous man here.

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,279
Whenever we need help,

339
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,279
we'll go to him.

340
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,039
Yangzhou is up ahead.

341
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,919
When you arrive there,

342
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,039
you just need to ask whoever you meet,

343
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:27,039
and I'm sure someone kind
will lead you to Wen's Mansion.

344
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,079
Thank you.

It's 9:30 PM now.
Close windows and doors

347
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,319
in case of thieves and robbers.

348
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,159
Sir, it's late now.

349
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,240
Take the baby to go home now.

350
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,600
Monsters and demons are everywhere

351
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,919
and they eat people,

352
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,640
so you'd better be careful.

353
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,279
Isn't the city always peaceful?

354
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,880
Sir,

355
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,199
how many years
haven't you come to Yangzhou?

356
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,319
It was peaceful in the past,

357
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,679
but it's not now.

358
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,880
Monsters and demons always come here,

359
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,000
causing people to be panicky.

360
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,720
Although Mr. Hai Sheng
is highly skilled,

361
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,360
he can't always
stay in Yangzhou, can he?

362
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,319
To tell you the truth,

363
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,600
even I plan to take my family

364
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,000
to hide in a safe place.

365
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:43,079
Young man, listen to me.

366
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,360
Leave now.

367
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,600
You don't need to move out.

368
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,880
Yangzhou will be peaceful

369
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,559

that he attaches great

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,240
buried that traitor's corpse

441
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,360
in the darkest place of Nanhua

442

445
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,799
that Yinfan finally grows up

Look.

448
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
He begins to behave like a sage.

449
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,240
We don't know

Mister,

455
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,079
the sage is merciful,

456
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,600
so he won't care about
what incenses you use to worship him.

457
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,880
You needn't have bought
expensive incenses.

458
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,960
Yes.

459
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,279
Monsters and demons
are doing evil things,

460
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,360
but only Yangzhou
is protected by the sage.

461
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,000
Our ancestors drew his portrait
and built a temple for him

462

according to the legend.

463
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,679
Therefore, we must worship him
with the best incenses.

464
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,839
I'll also worship him
with a stick of good incense.

467
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,080
Are the herbs we sent helpful?

468
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:26,919
If they're helpful,

469
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,800
I can go to the mountain
outside our city

470
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,000
to pick more.

471
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,199
It's not safe outside Yangzhou,

472
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,800
so we'd better be careful.

473
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,159
Mr. Wen is respected

474
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,280
and treats us well.

475
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,520
Besides, he's blessed by the sage,

476
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,080
so I'm sure he'll be safe.

477
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

478
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,839
Sage, please bless my father

479
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,520
and all people in Wen's Mansion.

480

483
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,199

and bring benefit to the world.

484

485
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,439
please bless Mr. Wen

486

and Miss Wen.

00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,359
Uncle Wen,

488
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,919
why do I feel the sage in the portrait

489
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,679
is close,

490
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:27,639
as if I had seen him in my childhood?

491
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,599
You played a joke on me again, Miss Wen.

492
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,639
The sage of Nanhua Sect won't go to
the Mortal World without any reason.

493
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:36,399
I'm sure I have seen him before.

494
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,000
Isn't it rumored

495
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,599
that someone used to see the sage?

496
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,800
What if the one I saw is him?

497
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:43,679
In that case,

498
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,240
I may also see him

499
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,040
in the future.

500
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,960
It's...

501
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,839
Do you really think

502
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
the sage is protecting you?

503
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,599
Who's this crazy man?

504
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,960
- Put it down now.
- How could you talk nonsense here?

505
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,119
You disrespect the sage

506
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,839
and will be punished.

507
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:15,119
Today is the annual day

508
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,000
to worship the sage.

509
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,639
If you anger him,

510
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,000
you'll drag us down to be punished.

511
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,960
- Yes.
- He's right.

512
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,119
Everywhere outside Yangzhou
is full of monsters and demons,

513
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,439
and only here is safe.

514
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,040
Since you said the sage didn't protect us,

515
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,480
tell us why monsters and demons
don't dare to go to our city.

516
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,399
- Yes.
- Tell us why.

517
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Everyone,

518
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,159
calm down.

519
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,960
Be patient.

520
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,439
I'm not a bad man

521
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,000
but a good one.

522
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,320
I really am.

523
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,359
You can't do that even if you're good.

524
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:48,240
Everyone, listen to me.

525
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,119
It's improper for us to fight

526
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:52,439
in front of the sage
on such a good day.

527
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,560
Besides, although he's ignorant,

528
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,399
he doesn't have bad intentions.

529
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,119
You'd better leave now.

530
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,560
We don't welcome anyone
that disrespects the sage.

531
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,639
- Get out.
- Leave.

532
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,439
- We don't welcome you. Leave now.
- Hurry up.

533
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,480
- Get out.
- We don't welcome you.

534
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,240
- Get out.
- Get out.

535
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,160
(Sage's Temple)

536
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,599
I have to thank you again.

537
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:34,000
I don't understand.

538
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,639
We just met for the first time,

539
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,439
so why did you say "again"?

540
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:39,720
Don't mind that, miss.

541
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,480
Perhaps because

542
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,000
you look very similar to my friend,

543
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,240
and I recognized you wrongly.

544
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,240
Sir,

545
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:47,760
I think you're not local

546
00:37:47,919 --> 00:37:49,480
and just returned from outside,

547
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,000
so you should know

548
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,720
how hard-won the peace of Yangzhou is.

549
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,760
We're blessed by
the sage of Nanhua Sect,

550
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,280
so we can live such a peaceful life.

551
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:00,000
You shouldn't have disrepected him.

552
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,760
Do you really think

553
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,560
the sage of Nanhua Sect is good?

554
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,800
Of course.

555
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:06,119
The first day of next month

556
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,639
is a quinquennial day for
Nanhua Mountain to recruit disciples.

557
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,879
All young people
with ambitions will go there.

558
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:13,960
Why don't you have a try?

559
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:15,760
You must be joking.

560
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,720
Normal people are impossible
to arrive there as they like.

561
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,639
But I'm sure

562
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,320
you can make it.

563
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:26,839
All right, stop talking nonsense.

564
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:28,080
I'm going to close the store,

565
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:30,320
and you'd better find a place
to settle down as soon as possible.

566
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,679
I'm a good man,

567
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,599
and I won't deceive you.

568
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,680
(Wen's Mansion)

569
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,159
Father, you're coughing again.

570
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,760
My disease is getting
more and more serious.

571
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,480
I'm afraid I'll die soon.

572
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,639
Father, don't say that.

573
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,159
I worshiped the sages of Nanhua Sect

574
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:11,599
in the temple today.

575
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,000
With their bless,

576
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,879
I'm sure you'll get better soon.

577
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,919
Okay.

578
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:41,439
I have no regrets.

579
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:44,720
Unfortunately, your mother died early.

580
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,320
If she could see

581
00:39:46,399 --> 00:39:48,760
your independence now,

582
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,960
she must be very happy.

583
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,800
Father, focus on recovering.

584
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,720
Leave everything to me.

585
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:58,879
I promise to
guard our home well for you.

586
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,960
Zi,

587
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,960
you're capable

588
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,960
and smart.

589
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,800
Although you're not our biological kid,

590
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:14,040
in my opinion,

591
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,800
you're my own child.

592
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:19,720
I was just an abandoned orphan,

593
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,599
but you and Mother raised me up

594
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:22,879
and treated me with sincerity.

595
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,919
I've kept them in mind

596
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,520
and will never forget that.

597
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,199
I wonder

598
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,839
if the sages of Nanhua Sect
could hear my wishes.

599
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,320
However,

600
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,199
the sage who saved me when I was young

601
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,080
indeed looked similar
to the one in the portrait today.

602
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,000
Where do they live?

603
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:12,800
Do they really live in a fairyland

604
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,919
as people describe?

605
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,000
