=The Journey of Chongzi=
(Adapted from "The Journey of Chongzi" by Shu Ke)

27
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:38,932
=Episode 2=

28
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:43,795
Prince, are you okay?

29
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:01,435
What a strong evil breath.

30
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,036
I've only seen this kind of evil breath

31
00:02:05,236 --> 00:02:06,676
on one person.

32
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:09,195
Go find out her origin.

33
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:14,196
Why does she have evil breath with her?

34
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,555
She is from Weiyang County, Cangzhou,

35
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:46,756
and her surname is Chong.

36
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:47,396
Her parents died

37
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,155
when she was very young.

38
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:51,396
She has been begging
along the street since then.

39
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:53,956
This time, she traveled thousands of miles
to run for the election.

40
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:56,476
No problem with her background.

41
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:58,396
Even so,

42
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:00,915
we can't take risks.

43
00:03:02,956 --> 00:03:04,275
She has potential.

44
00:03:04,676 --> 00:03:06,036
What a pity.

45
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:09,435
Not at all.

46
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:10,756
Nanhua

47
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:12,515
never lacks good disciples.

48
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:28,795
Looks like we passed.

49
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:44,355
Immortals.

50
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:48,795
Sage Tianji is right at Liuhe Hall.

51
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,236
No worries.

52
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,355
Listen to me.

53
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:54,155
I am Mu Yu,

54
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:56,756
the current first disciple of Nanhua.

55
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:58,236
- Senior Mu.
- Senior Mu.

56
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:00,316
Senior Mu looks so young.

57
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:03,316
Each of you may become

58
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:05,155
a new disciple of the Nanhua Sect,

59
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:07,555
and my junior

60
00:04:07,635 --> 00:04:08,836
fellow apprentice.

61
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:11,795
I will take you to Liuhe Hall

62
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:14,596
to visit Sage Tianji and Councilor Sage.

63
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,995
Keep quiet.

64
00:04:17,316 --> 00:04:19,196
Only when the two sages
give a clear indication

65
00:04:19,316 --> 00:04:20,596
can you step forward and answer.

66
00:04:21,155 --> 00:04:21,916
Understand?

67
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,675
- Yes.
- Yes.

68
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:26,196
Senior Mu,
after we enter Nanhua,

69
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,435
do we have to kowtow everywhere?

70
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,356
What an ignorant
and shallow country woman.

71
00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:35,395
The rules of the Immortal World
are different from those of the Mortal World.

72
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:37,796
You can learn slowly later.

73
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:39,955
As long as you show sincerity,

74
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:42,876
sages will naturally feel your genuineness.

75
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:44,675
Thank you, Senior Mu.

76
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:46,516
Please lead the way.

77
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:49,155
Senior Mu.

78
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:50,715
Would you accept apprentices?

79
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:53,036
After Sage Tianji

80
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,955
and Councilor Sage finish
accepting apprentices,

81
00:04:55,076 --> 00:04:56,715
I will choose one of you

82
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,275
as my apprentice.

83
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,115
It'll be an honor to be an apprentice

84
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,476
of the first disciple.

85
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:08,251
(Liuhe Hall)

86
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:09,691
We all know

87
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:11,091
your performance just now.

88
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,131
Great.

89
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:15,931
Come here.

90
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,450
Qin Ke of Chenzhou,

91
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,091
greetings to Sage Tianji
and Councilor Sage.

92
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,091
Do you have something to show me?

93
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,170
No.

94
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:28,651
Good boy.

95
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,371
Would you like to be my disciple?

96
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,411
Yes.

97
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:38,371
I am now the Sage Tianji of
Nanhua Sword Clan.

98
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,131
I'm in charge of Yuchen Peak of Nanhua.

99
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:42,851
Since you have become my disciple,

100
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:44,450
you are the 365th generation disciple

101
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,010
of Nanhua.

102
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:47,091
From now on,

103
00:05:47,131 --> 00:05:49,371
you must abide by the rules,
respect your masters and seniors,

104
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:50,971
act openly and aboveboard,

105
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,371
and take Nanhua as the top priority.

106
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,411
If you do something that insults
the Immortal World in the future,

107
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,131
I will not let you go.

108
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,450
Understand?

109
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,931
I will keep your teachings in mind.

110
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,851
Good, stand up.

111
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,330
Thank you, Master.

112
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,330
Congratulations, Prince.

113
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:17,251
There is no prince in Nanhua.

114
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:22,091
My bad. Please don't blame me.

115
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,931
Are you the Ninth Princess?

116
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:25,371
Yes.

117
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,730
Before my departure,
my father told me that

118
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,851
the Immortal World
is not like the Mortal World,

119
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,890
and that I could never be arrogant

120
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,290
in front of Sage Tianji and Councilor Sage.

121
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,610
I am sorry for being rude just now.

122
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:41,490
The practice in
the Immortal World is hard.

123
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:43,691
Have you made up your mind?

124
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,931
Yes, I have.

125
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:52,290
Now that you are the supremacy
of the Mortal World,

126
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,931
I can not but

127
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:56,251
follow the providence.

128
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,531
That being the case,

129
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,610
who do you want to be a disciple of?

130
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:03,531
It's up to you, sir.

131
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,411
Councilor Sage, what do you think?

132
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:13,251
I need a female disciple.

133
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,851
Just be my disciple.

134
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,131
Greetings to Master.

135
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:21,931
Stand up.

136
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:23,371
Thank you, Master.

137
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:25,730
Master, if my father knew that

138
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,091
I became your disciple,

139
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,971
he would definitely entertain
all parties to celebrate.

140
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,210
Sima Miaoyuan.

141
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,490
The Nanhua Sect has guarded
the Tongtian Portal for generations.

142
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:37,450
All of Nanhua's disciples
take protecting all beings

143
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,371
and killing demons as their duty.

144
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,450
Bear this in mind.

145
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:45,170
If you dare to violate the rules
in the future,

146
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,651
you will be punished severely.

147
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,330
Yes, sir.

148
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,770
Although you have
different qualifications,

149
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,411
you can make up
for lack of natural talent

150
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,851
by hard work.

151
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,851
（As long as you practice diligently
in the future,）

152
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:00,971
（you will definitely not
be worse than others.）

153
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,010
Go and wait outside the hall.

154
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:05,971
（The other senior disciples of Nanhua）

155
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,371
（will also accept disciples.）

156
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:09,571
（You can be their disciples.）

157
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:15,691
- Yes, Sage Tianji.
- Yes, Sage Tianji.

158
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,770
Hold on.

159
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,330
That girl.

160
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:31,251
You should stay.

161
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:38,011
Nanhua cannot accept you
as an apprentice.

162
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:39,891
Mu Yu.

163
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,891
Send her down the mountain quickly.

164
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:43,691
(Hasn't she been acting pretty well?)

165
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,090
(Why sending her away?)

166
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:46,730
Did she offend anyone?

167
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:48,931
Why?

168
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,410
Didn't the sage say that

169
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,771
diligent work could
make up for something?

170
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,730
Although I don't know anyone powerful,

171
00:08:54,811 --> 00:08:56,251
I made it up the mountain by myself,

172
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,610
and I also helped others.

173
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:58,931
(Why not accept me?)

174
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:00,730
If you cultivate,

175
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,730
you will be a disaster in the future.

176
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,970
What?

177
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:08,050
A disaster?

178
00:09:08,211 --> 00:09:09,331
I never thought of harming anyone.

179
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,650
How could I do so?

180
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,090
Enough.

181
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,850
Nanhua can't keep you here.

182
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,170
Leave now.

183
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,811
Why?

184
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:18,530
I did nothing wrong.

185
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,850
Didn't you say that I can
go up the mountain for mentorship?

186
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,891
It's not fair.

187
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:27,451
I'm obviously doing better than them all.

188
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,850
(Not only did you refuse to accept me,
but you even scolded me.)

189
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:30,410
You are all jerk sages.

190
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,331
Blind sages.

191
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,610
How dare you!

192
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:39,011
There are no immortals in this world.

193
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:40,610
Even if there are,

194
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:42,891
they are deaf, blind,

195
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:44,970
bloodless and fleshless.

196
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,811
It's her.

197
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:50,011
No wonder she is so familiar.

198
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:51,410
Sir, calm down.

199
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,650
- Actually, she...
- Stop.

200
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,931
Don't interrupt your elders.

201
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,451
Mu Yu.

202
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,970
What are you waiting for?
Take her down the mountain.

203
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,771
I didn't expect Nanhua's sages

204
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,730
to despise me too.

205
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,571
Since the Immortal World can't keep me,

206
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,451
there will be another place
where I can stay.

207
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,530
I don't believe that

208
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,490
there is no room for me in this world.

209
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,451
What did you say?

210
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,211
This girl is deeply obsessed.

211
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:17,571
It's better to stop her idea of cultivating
as soon as possible.

212
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,530
I said that you are a blind sage!

213
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:22,050
Councilor.

214
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,530
I want you.

215
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,571
Yinfan.

216
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,131
What are you...

217
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:06,371
Councilor, she's loose-lipped.

218
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,811
She really shouldn't have offended you.

219
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,170
But please forgive her disrespect

220
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,771
for the sake of her being

221
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,931
my future disciple.

222
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:18,730
Future disciple?

223
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:21,331
Make it clear.

224
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,811
Who will be your disciple?

225
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,170
It's her.

226
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,371
Silly girl.

227
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,131
Sage Chonghua has said that.

228
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:34,530
Why don't you agree?

229
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,371
Would you like to be my disciple?

230
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:44,970
Mr. Benefactor.

231
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,490
Call me Master.

232
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,691
Master.

233
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:49,691
Yinfan.

234
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,290
She is brave, forthright and ingenious.

235
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:56,571
I love that.

236
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,571
(Although she has evil breath with her,)

237
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:00,090
on the way up the mountain,

238
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,371
I never saw her have
any harmful intentions.

239
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,410
Unfounded speculation about others

240
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,331
only proves one's own malice.

241
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:09,090
The Immortal World has always adhered
to the principle of not doing any evil deeds.

242
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,571
Right?

243
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:11,970
Councilor.

244
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,891
Recently, the Demon World has become
more and more rampant.

245
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,451
If something happens
to this girl running around,

246
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,410
it will be our fault instead.

247
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,011
But I think

248
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,850
we can trust Yinfan.

249
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,290
As long as he is here,

250
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,371
it is okay

251
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,931
for this girl to stay in Nanhua.

252
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,331
Okay.

253
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,891
Then let her be my disciple.

254
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,891
I will teach her by myself.

255
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:39,170
Sage Chonghua has said to

256
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,290
take me as his disciple.

257
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,371
How could you change that?

258
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,891
Besides, I only recognize him
as my master,

259
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,571
even if others kneel down and beg me,

260
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:48,011
I am not willing.

261
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:49,170
You!

262
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:51,730
Look.

263
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,891
She is completely unruly.

264
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:55,811
As Nanhua's Councilor Sage,

265
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:58,050
I was taken so slightly by her.

266
00:12:58,131 --> 00:12:59,251
It seems that

267
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,931
she will also be
undisciplined in the future.

268
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,011
Never mind.

269
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,410
It fits me.

270
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,691
From now on,

271
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:09,811
she is my only apprentice.

272
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,090
Yinfan.

273
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,490
Councilor, councilor.

274
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:15,011
You have taken Sima Miaoyuan as disciple.

275
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:18,490
It would be more appropriate for Yinfan
to accept her as his disciple.

276
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:23,691
Then it depends on Sage Tianji.

277
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:27,771
Why don't you formally acknowledge me
as your master?

278
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,970
What's your name?

279
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:34,650
My parents died when I was young,

280
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:36,610
and they haven't had time
to give me a name.

281
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,170
I only know that my surname is Chong.

282
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,891
Everyone calls me Chongzi.

283
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,490
Chongzi.

284
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,771
Chong Zi.

285
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,891
The wind blows the peonies,
and the rain lingers.

286
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:50,211
What an elegant name.

287
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,290
Chonghua Palace, Zizhu Peak.

288
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,771
We are destined.

289
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,571
From now on, you will be named

290
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:58,211
Chong Zi.

291
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:00,650
What do you think?

292
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,891
Chongzi.

293
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,290
Chong Zi.

294
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:05,050
They sound like the same thing.

295
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,490
But after you change it,

296
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:07,931
it seems to be different immediately.

297
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,931
You are so great, Master.
Thank you.

298
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:11,490
My name will be Chong Zi
from now on.

299
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,290
My name is Luo Yinfan.

300
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:14,530
Or you can call me Chonghua.

301
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:17,410
After you become my disciple,
you must abide by the rules,

302
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:19,090
take the common people in the world
as your concern,

303
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:21,090
and refrain from doing
anything against it.

304
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:23,090
I will listen to you.

305
00:14:23,251 --> 00:14:25,050
If I do something that upsets you,

306
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,650
feel free to hit me.

307
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:28,011
Get up.

308
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,650
Follow me back to Zizhu Peak.

309
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:57,691
(Chonghua Palace)

310
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,970
This is where I live.

311
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,050
(Chonghua Palace)
I usually work in the hall.

312
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,811
Why not

313
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,610
let me go?

314
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,571
I...

315
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,211
It's your room for now.

316
00:15:24,811 --> 00:15:26,211
Is this my room?

317
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,251
Great.

318
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:28,571
I love it.

319
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,410
So nice.

320
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,530
Now you look like an immortal lady.

321
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,931
Why don't you take a look?

322
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,050
Why are you still standing here?

323
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,090
Are you waiting for me to lead you there?

324
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:26,850
It's way too plain.

325
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:29,211
Good enough.

326
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,771
Let me know if there is anything missing.

327
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:46,170
No, everything's fine.

328
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:47,331
I have never lived in

329
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:48,850
such a nice house.

330
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,011
It's just...

331
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:52,811
I'm a little hungry.

332
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:54,171
(Breathing Method)

333
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,571
Immortal disciples do not need to eat.

334
00:16:57,771 --> 00:16:59,090
It records

335
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,131
the Nanhua Sect's breathing method.

336
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,131
Go to study it first.

337
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,331
If I don't eat,

338
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:06,610
what should I do if I'm hungry?

339
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:08,730
I have nothing to eat
in the Mortal World,

340
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:10,010
and the situation remains the same

341
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,530
after I come to the Immortal World?

342
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:14,650
Do what the book says
and you won't be hungry.

343
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:28,931
I can't read.

344
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:37,290
I am such a blind sage

345
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,010
who accepted such a stupid disciple.

346
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,770
Now can you read?

347
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,931
You have to study hard and never be lazy.

348
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:03,410
Yes, Master.

349
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,770
She looks quite different.

350
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,491
I didn't recognize her at first.

351
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,410
Sage Tianji came so soon

352
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,731
because of worrying about my disciple?

353
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,331
Who dares to control your disciple?

354
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,410
But I do want to talk to you

355
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:42,931
about Chong Zi.

356
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:18,530
She's with me. Don't worry.

357
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,530
(Great, I don't have to go hungry.)

358
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:08,290
So icy.

359
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,130
I know you won't send her
down the mountain.

360
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,811
But she is born with evil breath.

361
00:20:15,971 --> 00:20:17,770
Be careful.

362
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,211
Didn't you urge me to accept disciples?

363
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,290
But who would have thought that

364
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:24,250
you would accept such a disciple?

365
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,571
I hope you are not sent by the councilor
to be a lobbyist.

366
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:30,170
We are not as rigid as you think.

367
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,770
If it weren't for the evil breath,

368
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,370
I also think Chong Zi is very good.

369
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:35,931
(Chonghua Palace)
I am most afraid of serious disciples.

370
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,410
But Chong Zi is different.

371
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,811
She dares to speak the truth,
is fearless,

372
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:42,211
and we are very much on the same page.

373
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:45,691
Although the last person who was born
with evil breath was Ni Lun,

374
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,530
he already died.

375
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,331
Chong Zi is innocent.

376
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:51,410
It depends on how you teach her.

377
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:53,130
She's born with evil breath.

378
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,611
It stands to reason that
she is going to be a demon.

379
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,130
If she is really stubborn,

380
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,491
you don't have to waste your time.

381
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,050
(Sorry.)

382
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:01,890
(If I don't eat you, I will starve to death.)

383
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,211
I don't know where to cook.

384
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:35,731
Why are the stoves
in the Immortal World so small?

385
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:37,410
It can't even hold a fish.

386
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,890
(Where is the seasoning?)

387
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,611
(Nice spice.)

388
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,170
Don't worry.

389
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,250
I won't teach her spells.

390
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,691
At most I will teach her
some self-defense techniques.

391
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:41,130
Although she wouldn't intentionally
hurt anyone with her evil breath,

392
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,331
if she learned some spells,

393
00:22:43,491 --> 00:22:45,211
it would instead stimulate her evil breath

394
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,571
and hurt innocent people,

395
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,530
so that the gain would outweigh the loss.

396
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,571
Let her be the most ordinary immortal.

397
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:53,811
It would be nice

398
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:55,931
to have an extra disciple

399
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,530
who cleans and serves.

400
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,971
But if one doesn't know spells,

401
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:02,130
he will suffer in the end in Nanhua.

402
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:03,611
Forget it.

403
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:07,091
Just try to protect her.

404
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,370
It depends on her.

405
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:16,651
(Chonghua Palace)

406
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,331
What's the smell?

407
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,530
Master, Sage Tianji.

408
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:26,451
You have come just in time.

409
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,851
Come and try my grilled fish.

410
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:29,491
This is what I do best.

411
00:23:30,691 --> 00:23:32,130
Given the size of this fish...

412
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:33,571
Could it be the one

413
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:35,691
you have raised for four hundred years?

414
00:23:37,971 --> 00:23:39,811
Four hundred years?

415
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,050
No wonder the fish meat is so tough.

416
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:44,611
This...

417
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:45,971
Look...

418
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,890
Could this be the ancient book

419
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,331
you have collected for so many years?

420
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,211
Yinfan.

421
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,091
I think your pharmacy

422
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:56,571
is ruined.

423
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,611
Chong Zi.

424
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:01,650
Master, it's my fault.

425
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:03,370
I'm so hungry.

426
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:05,851
Didn't I show you the Breathing Method?

427
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:07,451
I am a fool.

428
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:09,331
I've learned the Breathing Method
for a long time,

429
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,491
but I failed.

430
00:24:10,691 --> 00:24:11,851
I am afraid that if this continues,

431
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:13,091
I will starve to death at Zizhu Peak

432
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,370
before I learn it.

433
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,331
(From this point of view,
it wasn't all Chong Zi's fault.)

434
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:20,010
(It's just a pity that this fish)

435
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,971
(had been with you
for four hundred years.)

436
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:26,211
Master, please forgive me this time.

437
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,611
Since the fish is gone,

438
00:24:27,691 --> 00:24:29,250
I will talk with you to
relieve your boredom in the future,

439
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:30,811
and you will never be alone.

440
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,451
Seriously?

441
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:40,530
If you were asked to give up
all the delicacies in the world

442
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:42,050
and your desire for gluttony,

443
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,931
would you also be willing
to stay in Zizhu Peak?

444
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,890
Of course.

445
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:48,331
I will now tell you

446
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:49,691
the first rule of Zizhu Peak.

447
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,491
As my disciple, you can't kill,

448
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,410
nor can you have the intention
of harming others.

449
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,091
I will abide by the rules,

450
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,851
never kill, and never have the intention
of harming others.

451
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:01,931
Let go.

452
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:05,931
Stand up.

453
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,611
Now I will teach you the essentials
of the breathing method.

454
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:18,571
Concentrate and meditate.

455
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:22,050
Adjust the internal breath
according to the formula I taught.

456
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:30,451
Breathe nothingness
into the pubic region.

457
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:34,650
Green and clear water.

458
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:44,010
Don't get distracted while practicing.

459
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:46,211
I didn't.

460
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,731
What are you holding in your hand?

461
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,091
I...

462
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:54,931
Practicing is boring, right?

463
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,530
Not at all.

464
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,731
Although the practice is boring,

465
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,491
you are good-looking.

466
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,130
Forget it.

467
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,971
You are just a kid.

468
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,211
It will be difficult for you

469
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,650
to adapt to this poor life
all of a sudden.

470
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,410
Not at all.

471
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:15,410
I am very happy

472
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,890
to take care of you.

473
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,491
I'm just afraid that you can't adapt.

474
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,931
What do you mean?

475
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,491
I'm new here and unaware of the rules.

476
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:26,130
I'm afraid that one day I will annoy you

477
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,691
and you'll drive me down the mountain.

478
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:28,770
Don't worry.

479
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:30,010
It won't happen.

480
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,331
Really?

481
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,091
Then promise me.

482
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,091
No matter what I do,

483
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,530
you can't be angry.

484
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,851
OK, I promise you.

485
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,050
Go ahead.

486
00:26:53,451 --> 00:26:54,971
Master, take a try.

487
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:01,931
Chong, you...

488
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,451
Master, tea, please.

489
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,250
Chong!

490
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:24,851
I won.

491
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:34,851
Master.

492
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,530
Master, looks good?

493
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,170
I asked you to practice breathing method
in your room,

494
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:42,250
and you sneaked to the pharmacy
to play with grass and fish.

495
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:44,091
I asked you to sit here to
read the book and imitate,

496
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,811
and you just drew this.

497
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:49,851
(Don't be angry)

498
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,091
- I knew that...
- Okay.

499
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,250
If you keep making trouble,

500
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,971
I will take these words back.

501
00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:06,650
Okay, would you give me something new?

502
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,170
What do you want?

503
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:10,091
Such as,

504
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,331
never mind, well done, and amazing.

505
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,010
I'd like to give you another four words.

506
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,890
Chong Zi is great.

507
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:22,091
Lost in the indulgence.

508
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:24,571
Am I proud?

509
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,491
How is the handwriting

510
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:27,691
I asked you to practice?

511
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:31,650
Master.

512
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:32,651
Master, look.

513
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:33,891
(Luo Yinfan)
I wrote your name.

514
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:36,931
What else?

515
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,611
Well...

516
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:44,491
Come back.

517
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:45,370
Come here.

518
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:46,851
Wait, Master.

519
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:50,010
Master, let me go.

520
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,491
Sit down.

521
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:58,211
It's no use being coquettish.

522
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,410
Practicing calligraphy
is a kind of cultivation.

523
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,170
Work hard.

524
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,050
I will check.

525
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:06,650
Master.

526
00:29:10,211 --> 00:29:11,290
Remember.

527
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,290
Work hard.

528
00:29:13,571 --> 00:29:15,170
I will check.

529
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:22,611
(Word Power Made Easy)

530
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:31,331
(Fish Bird Turtle)

531
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:44,920
(Luo Yinfan)

532
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:05,291
(Turtle)

533
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:18,011
(Turtle)

534
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:37,531
(Three years later)

535
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:41,971
(Turtle)

536
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:55,650
Master.

537
00:30:57,571 --> 00:30:58,370
I listened to your words

538
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,650
and worked hard to practice calligraphy.

539
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:08,211
(The Demon is aggressively invading,
hope Nanhua will help. Kunlun Sect)

540
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,211
Chong.

541
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,250
This is the letter from Mr. Kunlun.

542
00:31:30,331 --> 00:31:33,091
Master, it's my fault.

543
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,091
Enough.

544
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:05,530
That's all for today's competition.

545
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,770
Senior Miaoyuan, your swordsmanship
has improved again.

546
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,130
It was my negligence just now.

547
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,571
I will win you next time.

548
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,650
Miaoyuan, don't rush for quick success.

549
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,091
Although your swordsmanship
has improved,

550
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,290
there are still many problems

551
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:25,851
in the competition just now.

552
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,170
After the Councilor finds out,
he will definitely accuse you.

553
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,331
As a senior,

554
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,331
you have to be strict with yourself.

555
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:32,530
Senior Mu.

556
00:32:32,691 --> 00:32:33,971
Senior Miaoyuan has to supervise
the style of the disciples

557
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:35,290
for the Councilor,

558
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,731
and also handles the affairs

559
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:38,331
among sects for him,

560
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:39,931
so she will inevitably
be distracted by these.

561
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,611
I don't have these burdens,

562
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:43,691
so I shouldn't be bad at swordsmanship.

563
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:45,050
It makes sense.

564
00:32:45,331 --> 00:32:46,851
Three years have passed in a flash.

565
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,491
You've become mature.

566
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:50,571
Whether it's practising swordplay,

567
00:32:51,091 --> 00:32:53,491
or handling affairs for the sect,

568
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,091
you can work independently.

569
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,731
It's all thanks to Senior Mu.

570
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,851
Those of us juniors who came to Nanhua

571
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:00,650
have achieved some success
in swordsmanship now,

572
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,211
and at least we can control the sword.

573
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,211
It's just that

574
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:05,650
I wonder how the wild girl

575
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:07,650
who worshiped under Sage Chonghua

576
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,491
is cultivating now.

577
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,410
We haven't seen her

578
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,130
since we became disciples.

579
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:16,211
Chong Zi will be taught by Sage Chonghua.

580
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:18,331
Her spells are naturally
no worse than yours.

581
00:33:18,971 --> 00:33:21,050
The spells of Sage Chonghua
are naturally unmatched.

582
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,851
But his disciple's is not necessarily
like that.

583
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,571
Learning spells requires
talent and hard work.

584
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:26,650
In my opinion,

585
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:28,530
who is more powerful remains uncertain.

586
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:29,770
Really?

587
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,290
Since you said so,

588
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,530
let Sage Chonghua bring his disciple

589
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,811
to compete with you next time.

590
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:37,530
Okay, I will definitely be the first
to compete with her.

591
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:39,851
Miaoyuan.

592
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:42,451
It's not bad to be competitive,

593
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:46,091
but it's not a good thing
to be way too aggressive.

594
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,091
You have to go to the Patriarch's Hall
to worship tonight.

595
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,731
Go get prepared.

596
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,530
- Yes.
- Yes.

597
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,890
Go.

598
00:34:04,451 --> 00:34:05,650
I will compete with you next time.

599
00:34:36,251 --> 00:34:37,451
Master.

600
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,370
Master.

601
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,610
Where are you going?

602
00:34:47,971 --> 00:34:48,810
Come back.

603
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:53,410
Master, what are you reading?

604
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,091
(Ancient Spell)
Why can't I understand

605
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:56,410
(Ancient Spell)
any of the words above?

606
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:58,731
This is an ancient book
handed down from ancient times,

607
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,051
which records many rare spells.

608
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,731
I know that Master is doing

609
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:04,090
a very important thing.

610
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,051
Could such a great master

611
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:08,090
promise me

612
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:09,330
a less demanding request?

613
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,610
You're not allowed to
go down the mountain.

614
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,650
Master.

615
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,330
Master, you are the best.

616
00:35:15,451 --> 00:35:16,090
Just promise me

617
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:17,890
such a small request, okay?

618
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:19,971
Isn't it good to be on Zizhu Peak?

619
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,691
It is.

620
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:24,330
It's just that I kind of miss

621
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:26,251
my childhood playmates.

622
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,650
Master, do you still remember

623
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:30,451
the Xichun Restaurant in Panhai Town

624
00:35:30,531 --> 00:35:31,971
I told you about?

625
00:35:32,051 --> 00:35:33,771
The dessert there is delicious.

626
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,211
The aroma of their freshly baked dessert

627
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:37,850
can waft two streets.

628
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,090
It's a pity that

629
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,130
I didn't have a chance

630
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,810
to eat fresh ones at that time.

631
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,211
Master.

632
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,051
Look, I have been

633
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,850
on Zizhu Peak for so long.

634
00:35:52,971 --> 00:35:54,410
Let alone the Mortal World,

635
00:35:54,531 --> 00:35:56,850
I haven't even visited Nanhua properly.

636
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,650
I have been on Zizhu Peak all the time,

637
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,291
and I don't know any other seniors.

638
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,251
And the Prince

639
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:06,130
who came to Nanhua with me.

640
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,650
I don't know how he is now.

641
00:36:13,491 --> 00:36:16,731
Master, just give me two hours.

642
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:19,251
- I promise that I won't...
- Enough.

643
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,410
You've said that to me

644
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,731
countless times.

645
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,051
The answer is still the same.

646
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,211
No.

647
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,330
Even if other people
raise kittens and puppies,

648
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,051
they will take them out for a walk.

649
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:36,610
I'm not practicing,

650
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,650
I'm simply in confinement
on Zizhu Peak.

651
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,850
I shouldn't be discovered by Master

652
00:36:52,971 --> 00:36:54,771
if I go out secretly for a while.

653
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,610
- Sir.
- Sir.

654
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:36,850
Miaoyuan.

655
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,291
It so happened that your father wrote

656
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,650
to ask about your recent situation.

657
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,251
I didn't expect that you could really

658
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,370
endure the pain of cultivation.

659
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,650
All these years, you've cultivated
every day, rain or shine.

660
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,011
I will definitely praise you

661
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:48,570
to your father.

662
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,251
Since all the juniors can make it,

663
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,810
as a senior, I should work harder.

664
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,570
You are really hardworking and smart.

665
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:56,691
It's really a blessing for Qin Ke

666
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,051
to have you by his side all these years.

667
00:37:58,531 --> 00:37:59,771
I will definitely ask Mu Yu

668
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,610
to teach you the next level
of swordsmanship.

669
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:04,451
You and Qin Ke can continue to
compete and learn from each other.

670
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,971
Thank you, sir.

671
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:11,251
What a disciple

672
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,890
ignorant of the rules.

673
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,251
I...

674
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,011
This is Chong Zi,
disciple of Chonghua Palace.

675
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,451
Greetings to Sage Tianji.

676
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,410
Did your master send you down
the mountain?

677
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,330
Exactly.

678
00:38:22,451 --> 00:38:23,810
This is my first time going downhill.

679
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:26,090
Master told me not to
forget the etiquette.

680
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,090
So I came to meet you first.

681
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:29,330
Good kid.

682
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,011
So what are your plans
for going down the mountain this time?

683
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:34,330
Master told me to

684
00:38:34,451 --> 00:38:35,890
be familiar with all places in Nanhua,

685
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:38,491
and to share my cultivation experience
with my seniors.

686
00:38:40,011 --> 00:38:40,771
Miaoyuan.

687
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,771
This is the first time
Chong Zi goes down the mountain.

688
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:45,410
And you came to Nanhua together.

689
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:47,370
Why don't you take Chong Zi
to look around,

690
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:49,011
and catch up on old times?

691
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:51,051
Don't worry, sir.

692
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,330
You are Sima Miaoyuan,

693
00:38:58,491 --> 00:38:59,451
that princess?

694
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,650
How dare you call Senior Miaoyuan
by her name?

695
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,570
Never mind.

696
00:39:04,291 --> 00:39:06,370
There is no need
to call me princess here.

697
00:39:06,931 --> 00:39:08,570
But you can't show no respect
to your seniors.

698
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:10,931
Are you Chong Zi?

699
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,531
Yes.

700
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,291
She is the Chong Zi

701
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:14,971
who has never come down
from Zizhu Peak.

702
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,211
(Patriarch's Hall)
So ignorant.

703
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,051
What qualifications does she have
to be Sage Chonghua's disciple?

704
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,650
You have been in Nanhua Sect
for so long.

705
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:22,370
Have you ever been
to the Patriarch's Hall?

706
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,570
Not yet.

707
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,771
In front of you is the Patriarch's Hall,

708
00:39:27,051 --> 00:39:29,051
the place where the ancestors
of Nanhua were enshrined.

709
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:30,810
Every year on the day
of the establishment of the sect,

710
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:32,051
all Nanhua disciples

711
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,051
will come here to worship the ancestors.

712
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,931
You never came here once.

713
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,890
Does Sage Chonghua

714
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,850
really take you as his disciple?

715
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,650
You'd better learn the rules of Nanhua

716
00:39:42,691 --> 00:39:43,731
before you come to me.

717
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:46,691
Don't waste our time.

718
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:50,531
Then I won't bother you.

719
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,051
I don't need it anyway.

720
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:56,971
(Patriarch's Hall)

721
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:46,130
There is nothing interesting
about Nanhua Mountain.

722
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,731
So cool.

723
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:22,771
Am I bothering you?

724
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,531
Don't worry, I won't let you die.

725
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,130
Don't look at me,
we don't know each other.

726
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:35,170
My name is...

727
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:36,330
Ugly girl.

728
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,570
You are ugly.

729
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,090
It's you!
