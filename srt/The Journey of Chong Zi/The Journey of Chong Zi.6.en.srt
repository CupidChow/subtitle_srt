=The Journey of Chongzi=
(Adapted from "The Journey of Chongzi" by Shu Ke)

27
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,021
=Episode 6=

28
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,381
I don't believe

29
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,261
I can't make you obey.

30
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,821
It's very beautiful.

31
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,941
I've never seen
Nanhua Mountain in this way.

32
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,821
I can also fly by sword now,

33
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:30,941
so no one will look down on me.

34
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:37,140
Since Master gave me Starlight,

35
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:39,140
I should also give him
something in return.

36
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:41,461
I've brought

37
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,381
all kinds of ancient books
of magical skills from my sect

38
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,340
to you.

39
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,980
They are all here.

40
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:47,741
Put them aside.

41
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,301
I wonder

42
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,860
if there is any record of
the legendary Mirror Heart Skill.

43
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,060
You've never read a record of that,

44
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,420
so how could my sect have it?

45
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,381
I think

46
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,060
you don't need to
teach her magical skills,

47
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,461
nor do you need to bother yourself

48
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,821
to practice the Mirror Heart Skill.

49
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,301
Chong said she wanted to practice it,

50
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,980
so I hope she can be satisfied.

51
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,340
I can't protect her all the time,

52
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:11,101
so if I don't teach her anything,

53
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:13,620
I'm afraid she'll be in danger
when she faces the demons.

54
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,220
But have you ever thought of
the consequence

55
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:17,461
if magical skills arouse her evil breath?

56
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:21,021
That's why I should practice
the Mirror Heart Skill.

57
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,900
Even if she is tainted with evil breath

58
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,381
when practicing magical skills,

59
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:25,861
I can control her.

60
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,941
The Mirror Heart Skill is only a legend,

61
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,981
and nobody in the Immortal World
succeeded in practicing it.

62
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:33,421
Even Master

63
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,500
failed to practice it to purify Ni Lun

64
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:36,500
and had to die with him

65
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:38,500
by sword skills.

66
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,821
Yinfan,

67
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,740
you must prepare for that.

68
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,981
It's because Master failed
to practice the Mirror Heart Skill

69
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,101
that I should succeed in practicing it.

70
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:47,900
No,

71
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,101
I must do that.

72
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:52,541
Just cut to the chase.

73
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,740
You're doing it for your disciple.

74
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,900
You dote on Chong Zi so much

75
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,180
that she will cause trouble

76
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,340
sooner or later.

77
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:58,780
I'm not afraid.

78
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:00,500
No matter what trouble she causes,

79
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,220
I'll protect her.

80
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:27,060
Add this.

81
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,300
Mix it.

82
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:03,460
Master, I cooked the Jade Wheel Cakes

83
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,861
according to the cakes of
Xichun Restaurant.

84
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:07,821
Try it.

85
00:06:08,381 --> 00:06:09,340
Why don't you eat it

86
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,900
first?

87
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:16,861
How's your process
of training Starlight?

88
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:19,020
I've learned to fly by it.

89
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:20,780
I didn't expect

90
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:22,220
Zizhu Peak to be so big.

91
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:23,460
Looking down from upside,

92
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,261
I think the dense bamboo forest

93
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,661
is very stunning.

94
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,381
Don't be proud.
Spend more time on training it.

95
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:34,861
How is it?

96
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,381
Is it bad?

97
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:38,620
It's fine.

98
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:39,981
Your sincerity matters more.

99
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,701
Why does it taste different
from my imagination?

100
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:50,220
Master, stop eating it.

101
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,620
But I've done so.

102
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,821
Give me that.

103
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,581
Master.

104
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,261
Master, give me that.

105
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:08,220
Master.

106
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,661
Give me that.

107
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:13,941
Give me that.

108
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,900
No.

109
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:46,454
(Chonghua Palace)

110
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,701
You said you would accompany me to read,

111
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:17,340
but you're sleeping soundly now.

112
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,100
Master,

113
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:18,500
don't force yourself if you don't like it.

114
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:21,060
I'll cook

115
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,701
the Overwhelming Cakes for you

116
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:24,500
when I'm free.

117
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,060
It sounds

118
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:32,701
more terrifying

119
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,581
than the Jade Wheel Cakes.

120
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:49,461
(Help us. Allure Wan Jie to save Gong Keran.)
(She is in Kunlun Sect now.)

121
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,100
I didn't expect

122
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,300
Yu Xuzi to do such a thing.

123
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,060
Miss Gong

124
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,540
used to be the young master
of Changsheng Palace,

125
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,740
so it was unreasonable to send her

126
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,420
to Kunlun Sect.

127
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,300
Moreover,

128
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:13,980
considering her relationship
with Wan Jie...

129
00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:16,581
I'm sure Kunlun Sect

130
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,100
can't defeat Wan Jie

131
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:19,620
once he appears.

132
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:22,540
Yinfan,

133
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,060
in the six worlds,

134
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,261
only you are able to defeat Wan Jie

135
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,620
and he has Ni Lun's Sword,

136
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,461
so you must get it back to purify
as soon as possible.

137
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,261
Otherwise, the trouble will be endless.

138
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:36,781
Even if it weren't for the demon sword,

139
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:40,021
I would go to Wan Jie

140
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,381
and ask him

141
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,341
why he becomes like this.

142
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:48,141
I'll set off for Kunlun Sect tomorrow.

143
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,300
Yinfan,

144
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,941
I'll send a group of disciples
to go with you.

145
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:54,620
I know

146
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,500
you like being alone,

147
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,701
but this matter is different,

148
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,821
so you'd better take disciples with you

149
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:02,500
in case you will meet dangers.

150
00:11:03,341 --> 00:11:04,261
Be careful.

151
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,781
If anything happens,

152
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,141
we will go to help you right away.

153
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,261
There is no need to raise a big rumpus.

154
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,701
I will be back soon.

155
00:11:18,381 --> 00:11:19,341
Take care

156
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,581
of the girl in Zizhu Peak for me.

157
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:23,901
Okay.

158
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:25,261
But that girl

159
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,781
seems to only listen to you,

160
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:29,021
so we may be unable to take care of her.

161
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,500
Are you afraid
that Wan Jie will hurt me again

162
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,540
since you don't want me to
go to Kunlun Sect with you, Master?

163
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,261
I was really scared on that day.

164
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:51,620
Chong,

165
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:55,701
I will give the Spirit Seal to you today.

166
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,941
It can fight back by
the other party's power,

167
00:11:58,141 --> 00:11:58,781
so

168
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,781
it can be powerful
when you face powerful enemies

169
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:00,660
and be weak when you face weak ones.

170
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,821
And it will be powerless
when there are no enemies.

171
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,821
But the Spirit Seal only works

172
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,500
when the other party
wants to kill you first.

173
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:07,100
If not,

174
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,660
it can't work.

175
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,381
Reach your hand out.

176
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,821
In this case,

177
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,381
no one will hurt you.

178
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,821
Master,

179
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:41,581
is it Wan Jie that stole the demon sword

180
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,701
and killed 3,000 disciples?

181
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,941
Was Mr. Immortal who saved me

182
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:47,300
also among them?

183
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,781
It rumors so,

184
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,781
but Wan Jie never
admitted that in person.

185
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:53,740
Besides,

186
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:56,740
being good or evil
depends on your thoughts.

187
00:12:57,141 --> 00:12:58,300
If you don't have evil thoughts,

188
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:00,620
even demons can do nothing to you.

189
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,660
Wan Jie has killed
many people these years.

190
00:13:03,021 --> 00:13:05,060
Since he has become a demon,

191
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:06,740
he should be punished,

192
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,420
not to mention the 3,000 dead disciples.

193
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,381
It's good

194
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,261
that you are grateful
to your benefactor.

195
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:13,821
However,

196
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:18,821
I'll tell you

197
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,581
the third rule of Zizhu Peak now.

198
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:22,420
You can't insist on taking revenges.

199
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,540
Enmity can blind you

200
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,021
and make you unable to get rid of it,

201
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,261
which will cause you to have Inner Demon.

202
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,300
Are you afraid I'll take revenge
for Mr. Immortal, Master?

203
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,141
Answer me.

204
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:34,781
Do you remember that?

205
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,740
Okay, I promise you.

206
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:40,701
But you must

207
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,901
be careful, Master.

208
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:48,180
Wait for me.

209
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,781
Wan Jie killed 3,000 disciples of my sect

210
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:58,781
in order to get the demon sword.

211
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,300
The 3,000 disciples

212
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,261
were parents

213
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
as well as children.

214
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,620
Changsheng Palace was also demolished,

215
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,341
but you didn't take revenge for that

216
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:10,701
and even colluded with him.

217
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:12,701
In my eyes,

218
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:15,180
you've already humiliated
Changsheng Palace

219
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:17,420
and caused trouble to the Immortal World.

220
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,100
Caused trouble to the Immortal World?

221
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,461
I cut the relationship with him
a long time ago.

222
00:14:25,021 --> 00:14:25,941
It's you.

223
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:27,941
(Kunlun Palace)
It's you

224
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:30,381
(Kunlun Palace)
that forced me to let him appear by all means.

225
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:32,941
Although Wan Jie should be killed,

226
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,060
you are also dirty

227
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,100
by using me to kill him.

228
00:14:37,261 --> 00:14:38,180
How dare you!

229
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,581
Are you angry?

230
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:43,860
Since you can't deal with the demons,

231
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,221
you turn to attack your own people.

232
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:50,660
I couldn't stop him from being a demon,

233
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,781
and I won't persuade him to be good now.

234
00:14:55,021 --> 00:14:56,660
Since we torture each other
when we are alive,

235
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,740
why don't you kill me to end this?

236
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,860
You should have died
for the 3,000 disciples.

237
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,500
The reason why I keep you alive

238
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:08,740
is that you are still useful.

239
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:10,620
You are just a bait

240
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,261
to allure Wan Jie to appear.

241
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,701
Lord of Kunlun Sect,

242
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:16,821
Miss Gong is Lord Ming's niece

243
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:18,461
and gained the immortal bones
hundreds of years ago,

244
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,100
so we can't be rude to her.

245
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,180
We come to arrest Wan Jie

246
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:23,461
and get the demon sword back today,

247
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:25,740
so you don't need to argue with her.

248
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,100
Well-said.

249
00:15:41,261 --> 00:15:42,021
Master.

250
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:03,461
Will you still tell me nothing

251
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:05,500
this time?

252
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,141
Stop trying that.

253
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,781
You can't help me.

254
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,941
Follow this direction.

255
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,381
Yingzhou.

256
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:35,620
Chong Zi.

257
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,701
Zhenzhu.

258
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,100
Why do you sleep here

259
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,740
in the daytime?

260
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:44,141
Master isn't here,

261
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,941
and I've gone everywhere
in Nanhua Mountain,

262
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,420
and people keep discussing me.

263
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,660
It's very boring.

264
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,701
Why didn't you visit me?

265
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,901
I did want to visit you,

266
00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:55,060
but Sage Tianji ordered me

267
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,620
to send a letter to Qinghua Palace,

268
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,860
and I just went back.

269
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:00,461
However, I have to follow
Senior Mu to Kunlun Sect

270
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,980
tomorrow morning,

271
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:04,660
so I came to tell you that.

272
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,060
I know

273
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:12,260
you worry about Sage Chonghua

274
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:13,741
and want to go with us,

275
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:14,581
right?

276
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,300
My master will take many disciples,

277
00:17:20,981 --> 00:17:21,741
and Qin Ke will take the lead.

278
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:23,020
Why don't you go with us

279
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,060
and see the gorgeous scene of Kunlun?

280
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,300
I am sure

281
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,341
nothing will happen

282
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,701
as long as you are obedient.

283
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:33,260
But I think Qin Ke

284
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,380
won't agree.

285
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:36,821
You can't know that only when you try it.

286
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:37,621
Try it.

287
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:48,741
He's coming. I'm leaving.

288
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:58,581
Qin Ke.

289
00:17:58,821 --> 00:17:59,540
Come here.

290
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:00,540
Come to drink tea.

291
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,780
No.

292
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:11,221
How did you know
what I wanted to say?

293
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:15,501
Since you will take many disciples,

294
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,621
it doesn't matter
if you take me together.

295
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,821
If it were in the past,
I would take you,

296
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:21,380
but you are famous now,

297
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,701
and everyone can recognize you,

298
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,540
so I can't take you.

299
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:24,540
I swear

300
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:25,941
I will be at the end of the team

301
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,380
and won't be discovered by others.

302
00:18:27,701 --> 00:18:28,701
Don't dream on that.

303
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,461
No one can take the responsibility

304
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:31,821
if Sage Chonghua finds it out
and blames us.

305
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,461
Qin Ke,

306
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,900
please.

307
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:39,180
I will say it's I

308
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,101
that follow you secretly

309
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:41,020
if Master blames us,

310
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,341
and I won't drag you down.

311
00:18:42,461 --> 00:18:43,621
It's useless even if I agree.

312
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:45,900
Senior Mu will send us off personally
tomorrow morning,

313
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:46,821
so he will definitely recognize you

314
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:47,981
if you are among us.

315
00:18:48,701 --> 00:18:49,821
Stop messing around.

316
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,380
Please.

317
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,300
Didn't you say
I didn't need to be afraid

318
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,140
when you were around me?

319
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,821
All right.

320
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:03,660
I will discuss it with Senior Mu.

321
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,300
If he doesn't agree,

322
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,741
I can't help that.

323
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
Take her together.

324
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,180
She may cause trouble

325
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,981
if she stays in Nanhua Mountain.

326
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,180
Senior Mu.

327
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,741
As Qin Ke appears in Zizhu Peak
at this time,

328
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,140
I know what you are planning.

329
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,180
Do you agree that I can
go with them, Senior Mu?

330
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,380
It's useless even if I don't agree.

331
00:19:25,701 --> 00:19:27,341
Will you give up if I don't agree?

332
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,420
Therefore, I'd better keep you with me.

333
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:31,341
At least, I can be relieved.

334
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,501
I'll go back to pack up now

335
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:34,140
and set off with you
tomorrow morning.

336
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,221
But I haven't said what you should
pay attention to when setting off.

337
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:38,260
Remember to wait for me tomorrow.

338
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:39,701
No, I'll wait for you tomorrow.

339
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:40,741
I'll wait for you.

340
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:47,101
Senior Mu,

341
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:48,420
will Councilor agree

342
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:50,380
if we take her together?

343
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,221
It shouldn't be a problem

344
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:54,020
if you take care of her more.

345
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,821
Look,

346
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,701
steamed stuffed buns.

347
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:26,260
Who is that man?

348
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:27,501
He is so unbridled.

349
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:29,861
What's wrong?

350
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,420
What happened, Chong Zi?

351
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,380
Don't call my name.

352
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,020
Young lady.

353
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,660
Young lady.

354
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,861
Young lady, it's you.

355
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,420
What are you doing?

356
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:48,581
- You are so weird.
- I didn't expect

357
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:49,861
the rumor was true.

358
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,821
Young Master Zhuo
indeed comes to Chong Zi.

359
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,101
Did you hear that?

360
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,660
He actually called her Young lady.

361
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,461
No, I don't know him.

362
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:02,300
You've changed a lot.

363
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,420
You are getting more and more beautiful

364
00:21:03,621 --> 00:21:05,501
after the days we didn't meet.

365
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,660
But why did you avoid me
once you saw me?

366
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,260
Don't talk nonsense.

367
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:10,621
I won't eat you,

368
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:12,101
so why do you keep distance from me?

369
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:25,501
Qin Ke,

370
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:26,780
he is rude to me.

371
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:36,341
Are you from Qinghua Palace?

372
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,501
I am Zhuo Hao

373
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:38,621
from Qinghua Palace.

374
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:42,621
I've heard about your reputation
for a long time, Young Master Zhuo.

375
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,861
I am Qin Ke,

376
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:46,260
Sage Tianji's disciple from Nanhua Sect.

377
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,260
I don't know why
you make things difficult for Chong Zi.

378
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,300
I've known her

379
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:53,020
since we were in Qinghua Palace.

380
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,221
And I just joked

381
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,260
when I happened to meet her.

382
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:57,581
You don't need to be nervous, Qin Ke.

383
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,821
But Chong Zi doesn't
like to be joked on.

384
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
You aren't her,

385
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,020
so how could you know that?

386
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:05,780
She is just shy.

387
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,221
Can't you tell that, Qin Ke?

388
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,780
I joined Nanhua Sect with Chong Zi,

389
00:22:10,941 --> 00:22:13,501
so I think I know her
better than you do.

390
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,140
I am not shy.

391
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,981
Look,

392
00:22:17,341 --> 00:22:18,741
she is so stubborn.

393
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:20,941
You also seem to

394
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:22,621
go to Kunlun Sect to help them.

395
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:24,420
How about we go together

396
00:22:24,741 --> 00:22:26,741
so that we can help each other
when something happens?

397
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:27,941
What do you think?

398
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,540
Are you worried about something?

399
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:45,660
Nanhua Sect and Qinghua Sect
have a good relationship,

400
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,101
so we should go together.

401
00:22:57,741 --> 00:22:59,621
I don't know him.

402
00:22:59,941 --> 00:23:00,701
Miss,

403
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,621
stand up and go to sit there.

404
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:05,461
Zhuo Hao.

405
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,501
Young lady, are you tired?

406
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,300
How about I help you to go
by having you on my back?

407
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,501
Young Master Zhuo,

408
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,060
you care about Chong Zi very much.

409
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,981
Unfortunately, there are
many women in Qinghua Palace

410
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,540
and keep an eye on us.

411
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,461
Many of them must be jealous.

412
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:25,981
I hope Chong Zi won't be bullied by them.

413
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,420
Don't think of me wrongly.

414
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,701
They are just

415
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:30,780
my sisters.

416
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,341
I hear you've

417
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,180
liked deceiving girls to be your sisters
since you were young,

418
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:36,300
and now you want to deceive Chong Zi.

419
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:38,180
Don't say that.

420
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,180
You don't know

421
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,660
that no one can be compared to Chong Zi

422
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,260
in my heart.

423
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,101
She is my...

424
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:45,300
Stop talking nonsense.

425
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:48,020
Fine, I want to say

426
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,380
she is Sage Chonghua's
excellent disciple.

427
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:53,660
Don't mention him.

428
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:56,101
It will make her miss him very much.

429
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:00,741
You are my young lady,

430
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:01,501
so you can only miss me

431
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:02,101
instead of others.

432
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:02,741
Let go of me.

433
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:03,461
- No.
- Let me go.

434
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:04,260
No.

435
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:05,581
Let go of me.

436
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,180
- Let go of me.
- No.

437
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,621
Qin Ke.

438
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,540
I didn't see you just now,

439
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:16,941
and you are here, Young Master Zhuo.

440
00:24:18,101 --> 00:24:19,300
Some female disciples of your sect

441
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,260
seem to be looking for you
to discuss something.

442
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,341
Okay, I'll go to check it.

443
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,900
Keep away from him.

444
00:24:45,341 --> 00:24:47,221
Qin Ke was worried about you
when protecting you.

445
00:24:47,461 --> 00:24:49,540
He was afraid
Young Master Zhuo would be rude to you.

446
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:51,900
I think it's hard for you
to make a choice.

447
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,180
For what?

448
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:01,420
It's late now,

449
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,020
so let's rest in the inn today

450
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:04,180
and go to Kunlun Sect

451
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,221
to visit the lords tomorrow morning.

452
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,140
There are not many rooms left,

453
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:15,380
so we have to live two by two.

454
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:16,621
I don't care about others,

455
00:25:16,861 --> 00:25:17,821
but I want a room

456
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:19,780
next to Chong Zi's.

457
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,140
How about you choose first?

458
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,660
I don't want to live with the two of them.

459
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,621
No.

460
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:31,540
No?

461
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:32,941
We don't want that, either.

462
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,780
Neither do I.

463
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:39,180
You are noble,

464
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:40,540
so you'd better not live with others.

465
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,660
Live alone.

466
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:51,420
Thank you, Qin Ke.

467
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:52,420
Thank you. Qin Ke.

468
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
Finally, it's my turn.

469
00:25:57,941 --> 00:25:58,461
(No.6)

470
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:00,661
(No.1)

471
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:02,141
(No.6)

472
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,180
No, I need to change the room.

473
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,461
I want to live closer to Chong Zi.

474
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:06,380
Let's go.

475
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:07,380
Go.

476
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:11,341
Go back to the room.

477
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:14,180
You will live with me?

478
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:15,461
You can't help that.

479
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:16,981
You don't mind it, do you?

480
00:26:17,981 --> 00:26:19,501
I don't want to live with you.

481
00:26:19,821 --> 00:26:20,821
It doesn't matter.

482
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,501
No.

483
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,020
Wan Jie,

484
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,861
I must find you

485
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,420
in order to persuade you to be good

486
00:26:40,981 --> 00:26:42,621
and stop you from doing evil things.

487
00:26:48,821 --> 00:26:49,780
Chong Zi,

488
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:51,420
we will go to Kunlun Sect tomorrow,

489
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:53,221
so accompany me to hang out tonight.

490
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:56,140
What's wrong?

491
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:58,821
Don't you like having fun
in the Mortal World the most?

492
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,260
Why do you hesitate

493
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:01,461
and look worried?

494
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,981
I'm worried about Master.

495
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:05,941
You can see him tomorrow.

496
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,701
Just accompany me today.

497
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,741
Okay?

498
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:09,741
Let's go.

499
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,900
Young lady.

500
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,780
Are you going to hang out, young lady?

501
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,861
We can go together.

502
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:18,341
I hurried on with my journey,

503
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:19,540
so I didn't have time to have fun.

504
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:20,501
I am tired.

505
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:21,701
I'll go back to sleep.

506
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,461
You have enough time to sleep,

507
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:25,020
but it's rare to go to the Mortal World.

508
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,581
- Let's go.
- Go.

509
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:27,981
No.

510
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,540
What are you doing here?

511
00:27:29,741 --> 00:27:31,581
The one who minds
others' business is here.

512
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:35,821
Young Master Zhuo wanted us to

513
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,420
hang out in the bazaar.

514
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,101
Then let's go together.

515
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,540
Miaoyuan happened to call me
to hang out together.

516
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,501
There is someone unwanted.

517
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,501
Let's go.

518
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,821
Let's see who is unwanted.

519
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:48,621
Go.

520
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,221
It smells so good.

521
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,941
This is good.

522
00:27:57,941 --> 00:27:59,020
There is also delicious food.

523
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:00,060
Ice-sugar gourds.

524
00:28:00,341 --> 00:28:01,101
It smells so good.

525
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,501
I like ice-sugar gourds.

526
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
Look, there are river lanterns.

527
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,101
They are pink.

528
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:08,501
Look, there are walnuts.

529
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,741
They are not.

530
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:10,900
Chong Zi, let's go there.

531
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,621
This bracelet is beautiful.

532
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:18,380
Try it.

533
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,821
The size fits me.

534
00:28:21,581 --> 00:28:22,501
Don't act

535
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,380
like you didn't come
to the Mortal World before.

536
00:28:24,581 --> 00:28:25,660
I feel ashamed

537
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,780
to be with you.

538
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:29,020
Then you can go to other places.

539
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,180
Why do you have to be with us?

540
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,821
Do you think I like that?

541
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:32,741
I want to...

542
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,140
Do you want to eat it?

543
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:36,300
Flatter me, and I can give it to you.

544
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,581
It's just cooked. Eat it when it's warm.

545
00:28:40,341 --> 00:28:41,780
No one will eat
steamed stuffed buns on the street.

546
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:42,941
Are you feeding dogs?

547
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,861
You are not better than me

548
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:46,221
by using an ice-sugar gourd
to please Chong Zi.

549
00:28:54,581 --> 00:28:55,941
Zhenzhu, come here.

550
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:56,821
Okay.

551
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:01,741
(Fragrant Wonton)

552
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:04,140
It's very shabby.

553
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,621
Then you can eat their food.

554
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:17,101
The steamed stuffed bun

555
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,140
tastes good.

556
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,260
It's acceptable.

557
00:29:28,621 --> 00:29:29,540
Here, Miss.

558
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,780
I can eat wonton now.

559
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,941
It's very hot.

560
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,180
Eat it slowly.

561
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,180
No one will eat it.

562
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,101
Young Master Zhuo,

563
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,701
you should have chosen the food that
won't make her look ugly while eating

564
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,300
if you want to please her.

565
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:03,060
It doesn't make her ugly.

566
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,380
I think she is good-looking.

567
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:07,660
It doesn't matter how you think,

568
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,501
but how she thinks matters.

569
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,741
Are you talking about me?

570
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:15,981
Don't flatter yourself.

571
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,900
Young Master Zhuo just joked

572
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,741
to cheer you up.

573
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,300
Do you think you deserve that?

574
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,540
Why do I not deserve that?

575
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:24,701
Why?

576
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,461
You are just a beggar,

577
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,621
and Sage Chonghua recruited you

578
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:28,501
out of sympathy.

579
00:30:28,621 --> 00:30:29,900
Everyone looks down on you.

580
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,741
It doesn't matter at all

581
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,341
if others look down on me.

582
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,501
Besides,

583
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:36,621
you are no better than me.

584
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:37,341
You...

585
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:39,461
I am a princess.

586
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:41,540
You were before you joined our sect.

587
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,420
Since you are in an immortal sect,

588
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:45,180
you have to forget

589
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:46,300
your identity in the Mortal World.

590
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:46,660
You...

591
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,861
Didn't the Councilor
tell you that before?

592
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:49,741
Well-done.

593
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,780
You are not only beautiful

594
00:30:51,941 --> 00:30:53,780
but also eloquent.

595
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,461
It seems we won't feel bored

596
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,341
in the following days.

597
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:59,861
I am eager to give you betrothal presents

598
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:02,621
and marry you now.

599
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,221
Are you willing, young lady?

600
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,180
Forget that.

601
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,501
What benefits can I have
if I marry you?

602
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,540
I can give you

603
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,701
whatever you want.

604
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,221
What can you give me?

605
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:13,221
Everything you have now

606
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,741
is given by Lord Zhuo.

607
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,900
They are not yours.

608
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,180
I own magical skills myself.

609
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,501
If you marry me,

610
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,380
I can teach all my magical skills to you.

611
00:31:22,621 --> 00:31:23,780
I don't think it's necessary.

612
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,140
Could Nanhua Sect's sword skills

613
00:31:27,341 --> 00:31:28,581
be worse than Qinghua Sect's?

614
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,581
I...

615
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,780
I can take you to travel the world.

616
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:37,861
Don't you like eating desserts
of the Mortal World?

617
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:39,060
If you marry me,

618
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:39,701
I will take you

619
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:40,420
to go wherever you want,

620
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:41,101
eat wherever you want,

621
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:41,900
and play whatever you want.

622
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:44,900
Young Master Zhuo,

623
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:47,621
members of our sect love people

624
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:50,420
and aim to kill demons
in the Mortal World.

625
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,741
If we only want to have fun,

626
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,420
it's opposite to our goal.

627
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,300
It doesn't matter
if you like indulging yourself,

628
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,861
but don't corrupt Chong Zi.

629
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,420
Exactly.

630
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,461
Although Chong Zi likes having fun,

631
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:04,380
she knows arresting Wan Jie
is the most important.

632
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:05,180
Right?

633
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:07,260
Otherwise, Qin Ke

634
00:32:07,341 --> 00:32:08,621
wouldn't have taken her together.

635
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:09,540
Wait.

636
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,420
Qin Ke took Chong Zi together?

637
00:32:18,941 --> 00:32:20,341
Do the Councilor
and Sage Chonghua know that?

638
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,260
How ridiculous!

639
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:28,380
Do you know it will drag Qin Ke down?

640
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,221
What if Lord Chonghua and
the Councilor know that?

641
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,501
Qin Ke got punished

642
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:32,341
because of you,

643
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,260
and you drag him down again.

644
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:34,981
Why are you so selfish?

645
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,501
Why do you only consider for yourself?

646
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,461
This is my business.

647
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:41,260
I begged Qin Ke for that,

648
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:43,861
so blame me if you are angry.

649
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:44,621
You...

650
00:32:45,461 --> 00:32:46,260
You are so childish.

651
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,981
Can you afford it?

652
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,821
You...

653
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,540
I'll go to explain it to Miaoyuan.

654
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:01,861
Qin Ke.

655
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:05,821
She really thinks she is a senior.

656
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:07,020
It's not a big deal.

657
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:08,941
Young lady, don't worry.

658
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:10,540
It's none of your business.

659
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,660
Chong Zi, I'm sorry.

660
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:15,380
I shouldn't have said that.

661
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:16,581
I have a big mouth.

662
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,780
I forced Qin Ke to take me together.

663
00:33:18,981 --> 00:33:20,300
Miaoyuan is right.

664
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,341
What if your master knows that?

665
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,900
It doesn't matter.

666
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,900
At most,

667
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:26,981
I'll be punished to kneel.

668
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:29,780
Sorry.

669
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:37,380
Miaoyuan,

670
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:39,140
what does this letter mean?

671
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,701
Did you tell Councilor Sage
that Chong Zi left Nanhua Mountain?

672
00:33:42,341 --> 00:33:43,461
We can't hide it.

673
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:44,341
Listen,

674
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:45,461
don't try to help her

675
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,660
and ask for punishment for her.

676
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,060
Since you dote on her that much,

677
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,621
she'll cause trouble sooner or later.

678
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:54,020
I'll bear the consequence alone.

679
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:55,461
Don't worry, Miaoyuan.

680
00:33:55,861 --> 00:33:57,621
When I left Nanhua Mountain,

681
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,780
I've decided that once I'm discovered,

682
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,180
I'll tell everyone

683
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,900
Qin Ke is forced by me,

684
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,861
and I'll bear the punishment.

685
00:34:04,221 --> 00:34:05,341
Although your words are moving,

686
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,420
Qin Ke will also be punished

687
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,140
if Sage Chonghua defends you.

688
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:11,941
All right, stop arguing.

689
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:18,380
Don't take the responsibility alone.

690
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,420
I've prepared

691
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:21,061
for the consequence at the beginning.

692
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:22,660
It doesn't matter if I will be punished.

693
00:34:23,741 --> 00:34:25,340
But I don't want to drag others down.

694
00:34:27,221 --> 00:34:28,061
Yes.

695
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,301
You don't want that,

696
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,900
but someone disobeyed
Master's order because of you.

697
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:33,301
Nanhua Sect's rules

698
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,580
aren't useless.

699
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:36,340
We shouldn't hide this thing,

700
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,140
nor should we deceive the sages.

701
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:39,660
I've told the Councilor about this thing.

702
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:40,501
He said

703
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,420
he would ask
Supervisor Sage to take you back.

704
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,420
Before that,

705
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,781
please be obedient

706
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,701
and don't cause any trouble.

707
00:35:08,221 --> 00:35:09,061
Oh, no.

708
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:11,820
I wanted to meet Master happily

709
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:13,501
and give him a surprise,

710
00:35:13,741 --> 00:35:15,140
but it's over.

711
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,820
I'm sure Master thinks I humiliated him.

712
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,741
I don't want to be
scolded by him when seeing him.

713
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:22,420
Sage Chonghua dotes on you very much,

714
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:24,660
so he won't be angry with you.

715
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:27,301
But it's I that should
tell Master this thing.

716
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,180
It's unforgivable of Miaoyuan to stop me

717
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,860
from seeing Master.

718
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:33,301
All right, Chong Zi.

719
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:35,261
Let's sleep now.

720
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:32,340
You shouldn't have told on me.

721
00:36:54,741 --> 00:36:56,501
Miaoyuan.

722
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,100
What's wrong, Miaoyuan?

723
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:21,221
A turtle?

724
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,701
Stop joking me.

725
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,701
It must be Chong Zi.

726
00:37:28,221 --> 00:37:29,660
Go and call her here.

727
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,781
I want her to apologize to me.

728
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,501
Calm down, Miaoyuan.

729
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,701
Wash off the turtle on your face first.

730
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,820
No.

731
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:43,820
It's the evidence.

732
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,860
Go to find her.

733
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,221
Don't defend her this time.

734
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:16,061
My young lady is in a good mood today.

735
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,461
Did you think it through?

736
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:20,180
Do you decide to marry me?

737
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:27,221
After

738
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,221
I vent my anger,

739
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,660
I become happy.

740
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,100
Qin Ke.

741
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:36,061
Chong Zi,

742
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,900
you went too far this time.

743
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,100
It's because she told on me.

744
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:43,061
I must take revenge for you,

745
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,501
not to mention me.

746
00:38:58,261 --> 00:38:58,900
Miaoyuan,

747
00:38:59,221 --> 00:39:01,021
I brought Chong Zi here
to apologize to you.

748
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,140
Say sorry to me?

749
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,501
Since she dared to break into my room

750
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:07,501
to do such a thing to me,

751
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:08,981
who knows if she will

752
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,941
poison me or disfigure me?

753
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:12,900
Miaoyuan, sorry.

754
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,860
I don't deserve that.

755
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:17,021
You're Sage Chonghua's disciple,

756
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,100
so no one dares to blame you.

757
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,620
I'll apologize to you for her.

758
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,981
Qin Ke, you don't need to do that.

759
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,140
It's wrong of me
to draw a turtle on your face,

760
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:32,180
but you shouldn't have told on me.

761
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,541
We're even now.

762
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:35,781
You...

763
00:40:00,301 --> 00:40:01,620
Who dares to bully my young lady?

764
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,021
I'll never let her go.

765
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,140
You went too far.

766
00:40:15,741 --> 00:40:16,620
Qin Ke,

767
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:17,781
get out of my way.

768
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,701
I must teach her a lesson today.

769
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:42,660
Young Master Zhuo,

770
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:44,820
please don't interfere
in my sect's business.

771
00:40:45,461 --> 00:40:46,580
Please leave now.

772
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,420
Otherwise, I'll report to Lord Zhuo

773
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,100
and ask him
to order someone to take you away.

774
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:50,981
You...

775
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,941
Miaoyuan,

776
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:57,261
lead other disciples

777
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,461
to go to Senior Mu.

778
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:00,221
I'll stay here
and keep an eye on Chong Zi

779
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,620
until Supervisor Sage
comes to pick her up.

780
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,340
No one is allowed

781
00:41:07,741 --> 00:41:09,140
to mention this thing any longer.
