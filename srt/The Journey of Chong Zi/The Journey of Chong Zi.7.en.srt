=The Journey of Chongzi=
(Adapted from "The Journey of Chongzi" by Shu Ke)

27
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,927
=Episode 7=

28
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:43,807
(Changyuan Inn)

29
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:11,247
Mr. Luo, your clothes are dusty.

30
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:18,928
Chong Zi is responsible

31
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:20,527
for Sage Chonghua's clothes,

32
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:21,928
so he isn't used
to letting others do this.

33
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:24,807
Why do you come here?

34
00:03:25,008 --> 00:03:26,928
Councilor Sage asked me to tell you

35
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,928
to pick Chong Zi up from Yingzhou.

36
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:30,768
Why did Chong Zi leave Nanhua Mountain?

37
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:34,247
It's also my fault.

38
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:37,008
I thought she had made progress
in practicing magical skills,

39
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,928
so it wasn't bad for her to
leave the mountain to gain experiences.

40
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:44,047
I can't find Wan Jie after spending
a long time searching for him.

41
00:03:44,447 --> 00:03:46,488
If he comes back to Kunlun Sect
and hurts Chong Zi,

42
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:48,247
I'll punish you.

43
00:04:21,288 --> 00:04:22,447
Are you mad at me?

44
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:24,528
No.

45
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:26,488
How could I be mad at you?

46
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:29,007
I hope you won't be mad at me instead.

47
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:29,928
Otherwise...

48
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:31,127
I was willing to do that,

49
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:32,248
so don't feel guilty.

50
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:33,928
Otherwise,
I won't help you next time.

51
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:37,007
Don't worry, Qin Ke.

52
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,567
I promise I won't do that again.

53
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,688
I should act with dignity

54
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:43,208
no matter if I'm an immortal or not.

55
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:45,047
Since I wanted to leave the mountain,

56
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:46,808
I should have asked Master for agreement

57
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:48,928
instead of

58
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:50,607
dragging you down

59
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:52,528
and irritating Master.

60
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:54,528
However,

61
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,408
Master will come here no matter what,

62
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:58,688
so I think it's better for me to hang out

63
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,688
than waiting here doing nothing.

64
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:02,808
I can buy gifts for Master

65
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,808
and Councilor Sage

66
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:06,447
to cool them down.

67
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:11,447
I know you can't sit still.

68
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:14,528
Qin Ke, don't worry.

69
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:16,408
Master will come here,

70
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,127
so I won't run about.

71
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,567
There is Shuixin Pavilion in the south,

72
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:21,648
and its landform is excellent.

73
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:23,768
Immortals nearby
will go there to cultivate themselves.

74
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:26,488
It's also good for you
to go there to practice.

75
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,688
Qin Ke, let's go there.

76
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:30,887
I have to receive Sage Chonghua.

77
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,607
This incense is specially
made by Kunlun Sect.

78
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:38,607
If you add your spiritual power into it,

79
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:39,887
immortals for 500 meters around

80
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,047
can feel that.

81
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,208
Take this with you for safety.

82
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:47,248
Then I'm leaving, Qin Ke.

83
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:16,928
Do you still refuse to go with me

84
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:20,447
after they treated you like that?

85
00:07:03,127 --> 00:07:04,488
Here is full of spiritual power.

86
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:06,127
It's indeed a good place.

87
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:10,567
(Where can we go?)

88
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,408
(In the six worlds,)

89
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,808
(there must be a place we can go.)

90
00:07:16,248 --> 00:07:17,887
(Their voices...)

91
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:20,167
(If you really want to save me,)

92
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,567
(go to die.)

93
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:24,167
(How hard can it be?)

94
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,808
(It's them.)

95
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,047
Does Wang Yue

96
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:39,287
know your thoughts?

97
00:07:39,847 --> 00:07:41,607
Now you're chased after
by immortal sects,

98
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,488
and you can hide in the Demon Palace.

99
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,287
But if Wang Yue doesn't accept you,

100
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,047
I'm afraid

101
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:50,607
you will end up with death.

102
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:52,208
Are you worrying about me?

103
00:07:52,727 --> 00:07:53,488
I am asking you

104
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:55,208
to stop your wishful thinking.

105
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,327
We can never go back to the past.

106
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:03,648
My 3,000 peers died because of you.

107
00:08:03,928 --> 00:08:05,408
But we're alive.

108
00:08:05,727 --> 00:08:07,167
(So what?)

109
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,887
I'm not what I used to be,

110
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,047
and you're not my senior anymore.

111
00:08:13,688 --> 00:08:16,408
If I had died with them,

112
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:19,887
it might be better than now.

113
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:22,287
It would be better than

114
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,607
seeing you who are like a ghost.

115
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:26,808
I'm like a ghost...

116
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,088
Supervisor Sage and Senior Mu.

117
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:42,567
Where is she?

118
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,447
She went to Shuixin Pavilion.
I'll call her back.

119
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:46,408
No need. I'll go myself.

120
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,048
I know

121
00:08:57,648 --> 00:08:59,447
you can't bear leaving me alone.

122
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:00,648
But the one I love

123
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:02,927
is Chu Bufu who died for righteousness,

124
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:05,887
not you.

125
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,048
Only when you die

126
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:14,007
will you return to be Chu Bufu.

127
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:16,968
If not,

128
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,288
you will be Wan Jie forever.

129
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:28,807
(Chu Bufu? Who is he?)

130
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:30,887
Can I also be an immortal?

131
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:31,887
Before becoming an immortal,

132
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:34,247
one must first learn to cultivate
immortal bones.

133
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,648
Mr. Immortal?

134
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:48,807
You've been eavesdropping
for a long time.

135
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:49,927
Mr. Immortal,

136
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:52,567
it's me. I'm Chongzi.

137
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:54,048
It's you.

138
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,447
Can't you recognize me, Mr. Immortal?

139
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:02,208
You actually become
Luo Yinfan's disciple.

140
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:04,367
No, you're not him.

141
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,327
He was a hero who saved the world.

142
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,927
You're not him.
You're the Demon King who killed him.

143
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:11,968
Then tell me

144
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:14,687
what's the difference
between me and him?

145
00:10:25,848 --> 00:10:27,127
Master.

146
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,487
What have you done to Chong Zi?

147
00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:35,887
I didn't expect you,

148
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,048
Luo Yinfan, the sage from Nanhua Sect,

149
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:41,247
to forget himself for his disciple.

150
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:43,088
It's very rare.

151
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:46,608
But you know Chong Zi

152
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:48,088
because of me,

153
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:50,528
so you should thank me.

154
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:51,927
You don't deserve to call her name.

155
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,007
Luo Yinfan,

156
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,687
believe it or not,

157
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:57,567
no matter how hard you protect her,

158
00:10:58,327 --> 00:10:59,768
she was born with evil breath,

159
00:10:59,848 --> 00:11:02,648
and she will go somewhere
she should go one day.

160
00:11:08,807 --> 00:11:09,567
Master.

161
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:10,608
Kneel down.

162
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:14,208
Don't make me repeat that.

163
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,048
- Master...
- Kneel down!

164
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:23,687
You ignored my order
and made the decision yourself.

165
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:25,567
You don't deserve to be my disciple.

166
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:28,127
It's my fault to leave Nanhua Mountain
without your permission,

167
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,848
but it's because I worried about you.

168
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:31,848
- I don't want you to...
- Shut up.

169
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:34,408
Don't use me as an excuse.

170
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:40,648
Mr. Luo, I didn't
keep a close eye on Chong Zi.

171
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:42,848
As her senior,
I didn't perform my duty well.

172
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:44,887
I made the main mistake,
and Chong Zi made the minor one.

173
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,408
I am teaching my disciple a lesson,

174
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,408
and I don't want others outside
of Zizhu Peak to interfere in this.

175
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:53,848
You acted willfully
and dragged others down,

176
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:55,487
so you should be punished more.

177
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:58,327
The ground is damp,

178
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:00,327
and Chong Zi hasn't
gained the immortal bones.

179
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:02,447
I'm afraid it'll cause her to be ill
if she kneels for a long time.

180
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,247
How about you take her back first

181
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,288
and take time to
deal with this matter, Mr. Luo?

182
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:07,648
I worried about you,

183
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,247
so I came here.

184
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:10,567
I don't think I'm wrong.

185
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:11,408
Fine.

186
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:13,088
Then kneel here

187
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,007
until you think it through.

188
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:16,687
No one is allowed to accompany her.

189
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,567
Well...

190
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:23,807
Mr. Luo.

191
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:44,048
Mr. Luo.

192
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:46,728
I should take the responsibility.

193
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:48,887
I permitted Chong Zi to
leave the mountain personally,

194
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:50,088
so it's not all her fault.

195
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:51,608
Qin Ke,

196
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,208
go back to Liuhe Hall

197
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:54,447
and ask your master for the punishment.

198
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:57,367
Yes, Mr. Luo.

199
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:03,447
I've kept Chong Zi on Zizhu Peak

200
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:04,648
for many years

201
00:13:05,007 --> 00:13:06,168
because I hope

202
00:13:06,848 --> 00:13:08,687
she won't be affected by evil power.

203
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:11,567
Even if I let her leave the mountain,
I was very worried.

204
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:12,567
However,

205
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:14,687
look what you have caused her to do.

206
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,728
You know the reason
why I recruited Chong Zi

207
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:18,127
as my disciple.

208
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,048
Yes.

209
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:25,168
Chong Zi

210
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,887
can't be in danger.

211
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:31,088
But Chong Zi did miss you

212
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:33,807
on Zizhu Peak.

213
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:53,327

214

221
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:31,408
Sorry, I caused you to be punished.

222
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,687
Don't say that, Senior Mu.

223
00:15:34,007 --> 00:15:36,408
In fact, even if I had known
I would be punished,

224
00:15:36,848 --> 00:15:38,408
I wouldn't have regretted
leaving the mountain.

225
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:43,768
I am useless.

226
00:15:44,168 --> 00:15:45,848
My knees are sore

227
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,367
after kneeling for only one night.

228
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:52,567
Is Master still mad at me?

229
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,327
Don't hold the grudge
against your master.

230
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,807
Although he said to punish you,

231
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:57,807
he cherishes you.

232
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:02,208
It's my fault to disobey Master's order,

233
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,208
but I think

234
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:06,288
it isn't wrong of me to worry about him.

235
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:08,288
He can punish me,

236
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,367
but he shouldn't ignore me.

237
00:16:11,088 --> 00:16:11,887
How about this?

238
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:13,687
I'll take you back first,

239
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,648
and you apologize to
your master obediently.

240
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,168
He doesn't want you
to become ill by kneeling.

241
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,127
Since Master punished me to kneel,

242
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:23,927
I must keep kneeling

243
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:25,968
until he cools down.

244
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,367
What if your legs get hurt,

245
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:31,247
and you're unable to walk anymore?

246
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,088
Then I'll pester him

247
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,247
and let him have me on his back.

248
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,367
I'll go

249
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:37,807
wherever he goes.

250
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:49,168
They don't hurt that much.

251
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:50,768
Thank you, Senior Mu.

252
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,768
Actually, it's also good
if you can think it in this way.

253
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:55,447
You must remember

254
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:58,648
that your master always cherishes you.

255
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:02,648
That's why I'm willing to be punished.

256
00:17:02,848 --> 00:17:04,247
I want Master to know

257
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:06,048
that I wanted to see him sincerely.

258
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:52,007
Why hasn't she apologized to me yet?

259
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:56,688
Am I too strict?

260
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,808
(But I'm more scared)

261
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:15,207
(than angry.)

262
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,087
(I'm afraid that you'll
be the same as Wan Jie,)

263
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:22,607
(and that you'll leave me.)

264
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:29,887
Master.

265
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:34,207
Let's go back.

266
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:38,808
Master,

267
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:40,487
I succeed in kneeling
until you cool down.

268
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,847
What do you want to say?

269
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:53,007
I'm wrong,

270
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,967
but I'm not regretful at all.

271
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,048
I missed you so much

272
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,528
that I wanted to see you

273
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:01,568
even if I knew you would be angry.

274
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:03,247
Besides,

275
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:04,847
I've never hated you

276
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:07,288
during the days kneeling here.

277
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:10,168
I missed your kindness to me

278
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:12,887
and our days spent on Zizhu Peak.

279
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,808
And what matters the most

280
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:17,887
is that I knew you wouldn't

281
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,328
leave me alone

282
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:21,087
and would go back to see me.

283
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,967
By the way, look.

284
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:25,568
The immortal fruit in Shuixin Pavilion

285
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:27,808
is different from Nanhua Mountain's.

286
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:31,127
I want to make it into a lantern

287
00:20:31,808 --> 00:20:33,928
and put it on your desk.

288
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:44,887
Your sincerity

289
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:47,808
is more important than any other things.

290
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,887
I just hope you won't be angry.

291
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:53,808
But you must take me together

292
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,367
when you leave
the mountain in the future.

293
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:57,247
I'll go wherever you go.

294
00:20:57,568 --> 00:20:59,967
Don't think you can leave me alone
before saving the world.

295
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:03,568
You're so stupid.

296
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,568
It's safe here.

297
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:36,688
Leave.

298
00:21:37,448 --> 00:21:39,847
I won't tell your whereabouts to others.

299
00:21:40,928 --> 00:21:42,168
Keran,

300
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:44,288
what do you mean?

301
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:50,808
No one is here,

302
00:21:51,887 --> 00:21:54,487
and the immortals rarely come here.

303
00:21:55,568 --> 00:21:57,487
It suits me the best

304
00:21:58,288 --> 00:21:59,808
as my exile place.

305
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:02,328
Since you've left the immortal sect,

306
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:04,247
we shouldn't end up like this.

307
00:22:04,328 --> 00:22:05,928
We're different.

308
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:09,847
Let me keep my last dignity, okay?

309
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,087
As long as you are a demon,

310
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:32,328
we will

311
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:35,328
never be together.

312
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:04,928
Chong Zi, you're finally awake.

313
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:08,528
I just woke up, and I'm starving now.

314
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,288
Only you could sleep that well.

315
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:11,328
You don't know

316
00:24:11,328 --> 00:24:12,328
what happened after your master

317
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:13,808
brought you back.

318
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:17,487
Did anything happen to Qin Ke?

319
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:20,928
He's fine but grounded.

320
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,007
But Senior Mu...

321
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,048
Senior Mu?

322
00:24:25,127 --> 00:24:26,607
What happened to him?

323
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:28,847
He disobeyed our sect's rule,

324
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,487
so he was punished to
be whipped by Councilor Sage

325
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:32,528
and his identity as
the chief disciple is suspended.

326
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,247
Besides, he has to reflect
on himself in Patriarch's Hall.

327
00:24:38,448 --> 00:24:39,168
Why...

328
00:24:39,487 --> 00:24:41,087
Why did they punish Senior Mu?

329
00:24:41,207 --> 00:24:43,007
I should be the one to be whipped.

330
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:44,288
I forced them to take me together,

331
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:45,528
they didn't...

332
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:48,048
Even if we know
it's you that caused the trouble

333
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:49,528
and should be punished,

334
00:24:50,168 --> 00:24:51,928
you're Sage Chonghua's disciple,

335
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:53,727
so Councilor Sage can't
punish you even if he is angry.

336
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:55,727
But he had to warn other disciples

337
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,928
and maintain his prestige,

338
00:24:57,048 --> 00:24:59,207
so he had to punish his own disciple.

339
00:24:59,408 --> 00:25:00,087
Well,

340
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:02,448
I'll go to beg him for mercy.

341
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:05,528
You are smart in daily life,

342
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:07,367
but you're not when
facing important events.

343
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,768
The punishment is almost finished,

344
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,928
so why do you go to him?
Do you want to pour more fuel on fire?

345
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:13,727
Then

346
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:15,928
I'll beg Master for mercy.

347
00:25:16,087 --> 00:25:18,528
You're also risking your head now.

348
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:20,448
I think you'd better stay calm.

349
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:26,487
Mind your own business.

350
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:28,568
Never irritate the sages again.

351
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,768
But I have to think about
ways to help them.

352
00:25:47,528 --> 00:25:48,648
Qin Ke.

353
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:53,048
Chong Zi?

354
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:54,967
Why do you come here?

355
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:56,408
We're friends.

356
00:25:56,528 --> 00:25:57,528
You're punished for me,

357
00:25:57,727 --> 00:25:59,288
so how could I ignore you?

358
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:01,448
I'm sorry to have dragged you down.

359
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,127
I'm too willful.

360
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,487
But I swear

361
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,607
I'll help you at all costs

362
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:08,288
whenever you need me.

363
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:10,048
Let's make a pinky swear.

364
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,568
You don't believe me.

365
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:19,168
You took a big risk for me,

366
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:21,648
and you must tell me whatever
difficulties you meet in the future.

367
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:24,727
Promise me.

368
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:38,288
The pinky swear is done.

369
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,688
I've never made
a pinky swear with others before.

370
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:45,928
Well, I'll regard it as your first time.

371
00:26:47,487 --> 00:26:49,168
By the way, these cakes are for you.

372
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:50,688
I'll go to visit you in a few days.

373
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:54,847
Where are you going?

374
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:57,727
I'm going to visit Senior Mu.

375
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:01,887
He is involved in this trouble by us.

376
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:03,688
This is the Feather Cream.

377
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,127
It helps to activate blood
and remove stasis a lot.

378
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,127
Take this to him.

379
00:27:09,168 --> 00:27:10,448
Councilor Sage is very cruel

380
00:27:10,568 --> 00:27:12,448
and forbids us to
give medicine to Senior Mu.

381
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:14,808
He wants Senior Mu to suffer the pain.

382
00:27:15,928 --> 00:27:17,048
Thanks for your medicine, Qin Ke.

383
00:27:17,127 --> 00:27:18,568
I'll never tell others

384
00:27:18,648 --> 00:27:20,247
that this medicine is given by you.

385
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:48,087
(Patriarch's Hall)

386
00:27:49,087 --> 00:27:51,247
Senior Mu and the others see it every day,
so it must be safe.

387
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:52,487
I don't need to be scared.

388
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:54,648
It's sealed now,

389
00:27:54,768 --> 00:27:55,887
and it's just a piece of scrap iron.

390
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:57,528
I don't need to be scared.

391
00:28:01,487 --> 00:28:02,607
Chong Zi.

392
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:04,168
Senior Mu.

393
00:28:09,928 --> 00:28:10,967
Senior Mu.

394
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,648
I'm sorry.

395
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:14,367
I dragged you down.

396
00:28:15,288 --> 00:28:16,408
It's not a serious punishment.

397
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:18,007
Don't be sad.

398
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:19,487
But you're suspended.

399
00:28:19,607 --> 00:28:20,967
It's temporary.

400
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:23,648
After leaving here, I'm still
the chief disciple of Nanhua Sect.

401
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:25,048
But you

402
00:28:25,408 --> 00:28:27,048
can't irritate your master again.

403
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:30,607
Senior Mu,

404
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:32,127
this medicine can help to
activate blood and remove stasis.

405
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:33,328
Take it.

406
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:39,328
Why did you steal medicine?

407
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:41,448
I didn't steal it. It's...

408
00:28:42,408 --> 00:28:44,367
I didn't steal it, anyway.

409
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:46,727
You

410
00:28:47,087 --> 00:28:49,127
should take care of yourself.

411
00:28:52,048 --> 00:28:54,048
You sneaked out, didn't you?

412
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:56,048
Senior Mu,

413
00:28:56,247 --> 00:28:58,367
why do you treat me so well?

414
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:01,007
Can't I do that?

415
00:29:03,448 --> 00:29:05,127
I don't think I deserve that.

416
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:11,887
It's because you're Chong Zi.

417
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:16,328
All right, you should go back now.

418
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:18,487
Otherwise, your master
will blame you if he knows this.

419
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:19,928
Moreover,

420
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:22,207
come to Patriarch's Hall less
in the future,

421
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:25,528
in case someone will
witness you and tell on you.

422
00:29:47,048 --> 00:29:48,367
Master,

423
00:29:48,847 --> 00:29:50,007
I'm back.

424
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:56,087
Master, do you remember

425
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:58,087
the Mr. Immortal I told you about?

426
00:29:58,448 --> 00:30:01,207
Is his name Chu Bufu?

427
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:10,247
Where did you hear this name?

428
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:12,528
I heard Miss Gong

429
00:30:12,607 --> 00:30:14,808
mentioned this name to Wan Jie.

430
00:30:14,887 --> 00:30:16,247
Does it have anything to do with you?

431
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:19,688
I think Wan Jie, Chu Bufu,

432
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:21,247
and Mr. Immortal

433
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:22,887
must be connected.

434
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:24,887
And Wan Jie's face...

435
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:26,007
Rest early.

436
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:27,607
Stay on Zizhu Peak

437
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:29,568
to cultivate yourself
and improve your temper

438
00:30:29,887 --> 00:30:31,448
from tomorrow.

439
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:32,928
I...

440
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:03,967
Wan Jie.

441
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:10,087
It's rare to see you come here.

442
00:31:10,688 --> 00:31:12,607
It's said you have the woman you want,

443
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:15,207
but why do you have a long face?

444
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:16,367
Get out of my way.

445
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:49,007
You rarely come to me.

446
00:31:49,247 --> 00:31:51,048
I want to remove
the Demon Pill from my body.

447
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:53,328
I know you have a method.

448
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:57,288
It's not easy.

449
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:01,928
When the Demon Pill
was put into your body,

450
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:04,207
it has become Qi

451
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:07,928
and intertwined with your Soul Threads.

452
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:09,688
It has become

453
00:32:10,487 --> 00:32:13,127
part of your primordial spirit.

454
00:32:18,328 --> 00:32:19,648
If you want to remove it,

455
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:22,007
I do have a method.

456
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:24,007
But I'm afraid

457
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,568
you can't bear the pain.

458
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:29,768
I've experienced changing
to be a demon from an immortal,

459
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:32,887
and I've suffered a lot,

460
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:36,768
so I can bear all kinds of pain.

461
00:32:37,328 --> 00:32:38,928
But after it is removed,

462
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,607
all your power

463
00:32:40,808 --> 00:32:42,887
will disappear
along with the Demon Pill.

464
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,727
By then,

465
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,207
you can't learn any skills,

466
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:48,768
and won't be a demon nor an immortal.

467
00:32:49,288 --> 00:32:50,247
By then,

468
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:52,648
what should you do?

469
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:53,887
I don't need that.

470
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:57,448
I only want to be what I used to be.

471
00:33:00,127 --> 00:33:01,727
You'll never understand that.

472
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,048
Tell me

473
00:33:05,328 --> 00:33:07,247
your conditions.

474
00:33:11,928 --> 00:33:13,207
Never mind.

475
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:15,448
Immortals are the same as demons,

476
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:17,328
and we do things as we like.

477
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:20,288
It's not easy to remove the Demon Pill,

478
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:22,648
and I need time to prepare.

479
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:24,607
Before that,

480
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:28,568
I want you to do one thing for me.

481
00:33:29,448 --> 00:33:30,408
Go ahead.

482
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:32,487
Catch one person for me.

483
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:35,528
Who?

484
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:51,007
What are you writing? It's ugly.

485
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:53,007
It has been many days,

486
00:33:53,328 --> 00:33:55,007
and Master doesn't allow me
to leave the mountain,

487
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,768
nor does he speak to me.

488
00:33:57,967 --> 00:33:59,727
He asks me to either
read books on magical skills

489
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:01,648
or practice magical skills every day.

490
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:04,528
I think he's still mad at me.

491
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,127
By the way,

492
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:08,487
why didn't you come to me?

493
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,408
I came to you,

494
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:12,247
but your master said
you were cultivating yourself

495
00:34:12,367 --> 00:34:13,528
and didn't allow us to disturb you,

496
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:14,967
nor would you meet anyone.

497
00:34:16,288 --> 00:34:18,528
I am grounded by Master.

498
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:27,088
But Chong Zi,

499
00:34:27,647 --> 00:34:29,647
what trouble did you cause
in Shuixin Pavilion?

500
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:31,848
It's said to be your master's first time

501
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,407
being that angry.

502
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:35,088
I met Wan Jie.

503
00:34:35,647 --> 00:34:37,727
Wan Jie? You met him?

504
00:34:37,888 --> 00:34:40,167
Did you have a fight?

505
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:41,768
Fight?

506
00:34:42,128 --> 00:34:43,927
How could I match him?

507
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:45,927
I was attacked by him.

508
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,848
However,

509
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:52,048
I think Wan Jie

510
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:53,288
looks like Mr. Immortal

511
00:34:53,288 --> 00:34:54,647
that I used to know.

512
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:56,808
Mr. Immortal?

513
00:34:57,808 --> 00:34:58,888
Besides,

514
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:01,128
I always feel Master and Wan Jie

515
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,007
used to know each other.

516
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,848
But when I mentioned that to Master,

517
00:35:06,128 --> 00:35:07,687
he would always be angry,

518
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:09,487
so I didn't dare to ask him much.

519
00:35:11,007 --> 00:35:12,407
But since Master acts like that,

520
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:15,128
does it mean
Mr. Immortal is still alive?

521
00:35:17,808 --> 00:35:19,167
What's his surname?

522
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:21,328
Let me think.

523
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:24,528
His surname is Chu.

524
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:26,088
Did no one tell you that?

525
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,487
Of course your master
won't tell you that

526
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:34,848
because before being a demon,

527
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:36,608
Wan Jie was Chu Bufu,

528
00:35:36,608 --> 00:35:38,687
the famous chief disciple
of Changsheng Palace

529
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:41,528
as well as your Mr. Immortal.

530
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,967
The chief disciple of Changsheng Palace?

531
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,207
Wan Jie?

532
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:50,927
They are actually the same person.

533
00:35:52,048 --> 00:35:53,487
When we heard about that,

534
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,088
we also felt unbelievable

535
00:35:55,568 --> 00:35:58,007
because we didn't think
that kind of person would be a demon.

536
00:36:00,088 --> 00:36:01,447
I remember the first time I saw him

537
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:03,888
was at the Meeting of Immortal Sects
ten years ago.

538
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:07,888
He was wearing white clothes
on that day.

539
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:12,247
- Come to see him.
- Look.

540
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,288
He's so handsome and elegant.

541
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:20,528
I really like him.

542
00:36:25,128 --> 00:36:26,447
He's very good-looking.

543
00:36:27,848 --> 00:36:28,647
I know him.

544
00:36:28,727 --> 00:36:30,608
He's Chu Bufu from Changsheng Palace.

545
00:36:31,568 --> 00:36:32,727
He's so handsome.

546
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:40,808
Anyone who saw him

547
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:42,687
liked his gentleness

548
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:43,487
and beauty.

549
00:36:43,727 --> 00:36:47,247
Unfortunately, he made a mistake
several years ago.

550
00:36:51,288 --> 00:36:52,368
What did he do?

551
00:36:58,407 --> 00:36:59,848
What happened back then?

552
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:04,967
It's a taboo among immortals.

553
00:37:05,128 --> 00:37:06,768
We don't dare to mention that now.

554
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:10,447
After Sage Chonghua
got the Wufang Pearl,

555
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:12,768
Chu Bufu took the lead
to send Ni Lun's Sword

556
00:37:12,888 --> 00:37:14,247
to Nanhua Sect for purification.

557
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,328
However, the 3,000 disciples who went
with him died tragically in one night,

558
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:18,888
and Ni Lun's Sword went missing.
And then...

559
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:22,207
And then Wan Jie, the Demon King,
appeared.

560
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:24,048
It's rumored he killed his peers

561
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:25,528
in order to occupy the demon sword.

562
00:37:26,528 --> 00:37:27,288
I don't believe that.

563
00:37:27,848 --> 00:37:29,368
I was just a beggar back then,

564
00:37:29,528 --> 00:37:31,048
and he helped me,

565
00:37:31,328 --> 00:37:32,927
so how could he...

566
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:36,207
There must be something behind it.

567
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:38,768
Perhaps.

568
00:37:39,447 --> 00:37:41,247
But we can't deny the fact

569
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:42,687
that the 3,000 disciples
died accidentally.

570
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:45,927
I don't believe that

571
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:47,687
unless he admits it personally.

572
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:49,568
Wan Jie used to be the Demon King,

573
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,207
so why do you insist on believing him?

574
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:52,687
He is my benefactor.

575
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:55,128
I wouldn't have joined
Nanhua Sect without him,

576
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,848
nor would I have met Master.

577
00:37:57,647 --> 00:37:58,808
He's the best person I've ever met

578
00:37:58,848 --> 00:37:59,848
besides Master.

579
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:02,167
I'd rather doubt myself than him.

580
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,288
In that case,

581
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:08,888
he may have his reason.

582
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:14,007
No wonder Miss Gong was also involved

583
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:15,967
when Wan Jie was chased after
by Changsheng Palace.

584
00:38:16,768 --> 00:38:18,487
It's because Chu Bufu and Miss Gong

585
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:20,568
were a couple in the Immortal World.

586
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:23,808
Does Changsheng Palace

587
00:38:23,888 --> 00:38:26,808
want to use Miss Gong
to allure Wan Jie...

588
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:30,128
To allure Chu Bufu to appear?

589
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:38,888
Chong Zi,

590
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:40,608
what's wrong?

591
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:42,288
I'm fine.

592
00:38:42,927 --> 00:38:43,927
Zhenzhu,

593
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:45,687
I feel a little uncomfortable,

594
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:47,808
and I want to stay alone.

595
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:50,247
Okay, take care of yourself.

596
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,808
I'll come to you a few days later.

597
00:38:52,768 --> 00:38:53,888
Don't think randomly.

598
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:55,687
I'll help you to ask around these days.

599
00:38:55,808 --> 00:38:57,768
Don't get stuck in your thoughts.

600
00:38:59,007 --> 00:38:59,888
Goodbye.

601
