Aunt's accounts are so unclear.

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,041
The numbers don't even match.

31
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,560
It's ridiculously bad.

she spends money so generously.

I can't give this store to Aunt anymore.

Miss Wen.

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,560
Uncle Wen, come with me to the store.

40
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:03,321
Miss Wen, Mr. Wen is dying.

41
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,481
Father! Father!

42
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:17,520
Father!

43
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,761
Zi,

44
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,080
don't be too sad.

45
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:26,640
This day would come eventually.

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,241
Father.

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,080
Don't say that anymore.

48
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,681
Please don't.

49
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,640
Your pendant

50
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:40,201
was in your swaddling clothes.

51
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:42,520
It is likely

52
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:46,000
to be related
to your biological parents.

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,961
If there is a chance,

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,321
I still hope

55
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,440
you can find your origin.

56
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:57,280
Father,

57
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,681
I promise you,

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,920
I promise you.

59
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:04,360
Although I don't know

60
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,201
who your biological parents are,

61
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,000
I can see that

62
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,081
you are different from other girls.

63
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,560
You are not an ordinary person.

64
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:29,280
I also know that

65
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:32,240
your aunt and your sister

66
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,761
treat you badly.

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,440
But without you,

68
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,201
our Wen family will be ruined.

69
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,641
Father.

70
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:51,120
Zi,

71
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
you must hold

72
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:59,120
your life in your own hands.

73
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,120
After I die,

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,440
take care of yourself.

75
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680

76

Go away!

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,601
what would we do without you?

Mother,

104
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,201
will Mr. Wu marry me?

105
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:49,641
What are you afraid of?

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
The bride price given by them

107
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,321
is for Miss Wen.

108
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,720
What's wrong with him marrying you?

109
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,761
Besides,

110
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,361
if he knows that

111
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,680
Wen Zi is a foundling,

112
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,361
he won't marry her.

113
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,960
(Gentle Breeze)

114
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,440
How can Uncle

115
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,800
marry this wild girl to me?

116
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,600
I want to marry the first daughter
of the Wen family.

117
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,881
I can't afford this Wen Zi.

118
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:46,961
I want to withdraw from the marriage.

119
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,201
Young Master, our Yu

120
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:50,401
is indeed

121
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,680
the first daughter of the Wen family.

122
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
But I heard that

123
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:56,560
Wen Zi is in charge of
the Wen family now.

124
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:58,440
What good would it do me

125
00:08:58,641 --> 00:08:59,641
to marry your Wen Yu?

126
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:03,081
How can we let that wild girl
be in charge of the Wen family?

127
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:06,000
Besides, I'm in charge of everything

128
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:07,881
in the Wen family now.

129
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:11,401
I also know that you are suppressed

130
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,040
by your brother in the Wu family.

131
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,440
And your father is very strict.

132
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:20,161
You still owe a lot of money to
the Drunken House, right?

133
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,040
Young Master,

134
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:23,120
there are a lot of vases and antiques

135
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,881
in Wen's Mansion.

136
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,841
You can take them away

137
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
as Wen Yu's dowry.

138
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,720
(Mr. Wen's Memorial Tablet)

139
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:50,641
Put it down.

140
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,240
Great.

141
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,521
This is Mr. Wen's collection.

142
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,841
And these paintings, these items

143
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,360
all belonged to Mr. Wen.

144
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,560
Who are you to take them?

145
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,000
Because I'm the future

146
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
son-in-law of your Wen family.

147
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,040
You...

148
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,761
My father died less than seven days ago,

149
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:07,201
yet you take the opportunity
to plunder my house.

150
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:08,360
What right do you have to do this?

151
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,841
Our Wen family is a big family at least,

152
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,321
you can't be so reckless here.

153
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,000
I am the son-in-law of your family.

154
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,721
Mr. Wen's stuff

155
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,521
is also mine.

156
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:18,961
Since that,

157
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,721
I'll make it clear.

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,680
I don't agree to this marriage.

159
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:24,521
How dare you, a wild girl,

160
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:25,961
to reason in front of me?

161
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,560
I haven't had time to deal with you

162
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:30,040
for pretending to be Miss Wen
and deceiving me.

163
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,201
Then withdraw from the marriage
and put down the things.

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Withdraw?

165
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,040
Why?

166
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:36,040
I'm telling you,

167
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,761
I'll marry Miss Wen for sure.

168
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,040
Not you,

169
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,321
but your sister, Wen Yu.

170
00:10:42,521 --> 00:10:43,641
But,

171
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,321
I don't mind you being my concubine.

172
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,321
How dare you?

173
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:54,240
I let Young Master Wu

174
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:56,000
help carry the sundries.

175
00:10:56,841 --> 00:10:58,281
We're all on the same side.

176
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,440
Don't break the peace.

177
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:01,761
Sundries?

178
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,881
These were all
my father's beloved things.

179
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:05,881
How could they become unwanted sundries?

180
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:08,081
You first took the account book

181
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,401
and the keys to the treasury from me,

182
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,240
and now you're selling
my father's things.

183
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:13,721
Next it's my turn, right?

184
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:16,961
Aunt, aren't you a bit too eager?

185
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:19,321
Interesting.

186
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,521
Your father?

187
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,721
He's not your father.

188
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:24,680
You're not even a member
of the Wen family.

189
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:26,040
You're just an outsider.

190
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,841
I'm handling the family affairs
of the Wen family.

191
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:30,721
Who are you to say anything?

192
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:33,800
Mother.

193
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,521
Burn all these worthless

194
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,920
books and paintings.

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,360
Show the wild girl

196
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,680
who is in charge of the Wen family.

197
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:56,440
How dare you!

198
00:11:56,521 --> 00:11:57,881
Why wouldn't I dare?

199
00:11:58,281 --> 00:12:00,440
You are no longer Miss Wen.

200
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,841
Do it!

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,040
Don't touch Miss...

202
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:05,360
Hit him!

203
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,641
Uncle Wen. Don't hit him!

204
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:10,120
Uncle Wen.

205
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:11,920
Miss Wen.

206
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:16,081
Let go of me!

207
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:20,440
That's Mr. Wen's painting of
the late lady and Miss Wen!

208
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:22,321
Let me go!

209
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:24,120
You can't burn it!

210
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,761
Don't hit him!

211
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:34,401
Xique!

212
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,360
Xique!

213
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:40,560
Xique!

214
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:42,120
Uncle Wen!

215
00:12:45,081 --> 00:12:46,321
Uncle Wen!

216
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:48,401
Uncle Wen!

217
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,120
I'll beat you to death!

218
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:46,881
Miss Wen,

219
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,000
let's go.

220
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:51,240
Demon!

221
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,081
There's a demon in our Wen family!

222
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,321
De... Demon!

223
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,840
(Mr. Wen's Memorial Tablet)

224
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,201
Father,

225
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:03,881
today is the day of your burial.

226
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:06,600
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

227
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:10,521
You asked me to guard our family,

228
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:13,721
but now I can't even enter the house.

229
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:17,961
Despite the ordeal,

230
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:21,240
I remember what you said.

231
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,721
This is not my destiny.

232
00:15:24,521 --> 00:15:25,761
I will live well

233
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,201
in my own way.

234
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,721
Miss Wen.

235
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,480
I'm useless.

236
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,401
Uncle Wen, it's not your fault.

237
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:38,480
Maybe it's like what my father said.

238
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,081
I was not born to be an ordinary person.

239
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,081
The world is so big.

240
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,721
There's always a place for me.

241
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,721
The first day of next month

242
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:54,120
is a quinquennial day for
Nanhua Mountain to recruit disciples.

243
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:56,081
Why don't you have a try?

244
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:01,920
Uncle Wen, I want to go to Nanhua.

245
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:03,440
I want to learn spells.

246
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,961
So that even if I'm not with you,

247
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:07,881
I can still guard you well.

248
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,680
Besides,

249
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,120
I also want to know
if the sage in the portrait

250
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,401
is like what the legend says.

251
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:16,841
Miss Wen,
didn't you meet the sage before?

252
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:19,360
You were born with fate,

253
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,081
and you will achieve what you want.

254
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,521
Didn't you believe it before?

255
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,480
I believe it now.

256
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,841
I do.

257
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:31,161
Uncle Wen,

258
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,240
I'm leaving now.

259
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,440
Take care of yourself.

260
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:37,081
Miss Wen,

261
00:16:37,841 --> 00:16:39,081
I can't bear to part with you.

262
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:42,401
Me too.

263
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:44,600
My father is dead.

264
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're my only family.

265
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,360
But people have to learn
to be independent.

266
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:53,560
I've grown up.

267
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,680
I can do it.

268
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,360
You're going out alone as a girl,

269
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,680
and you must be careful.

270
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:04,401
If you run into any trouble,

271
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:06,000
come back to me.

272
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:08,600
I'll always be here,

273
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,360
staying with Mr. Wen.

274
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,600
Can anyone tell me

275
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,080
where is the Nanhua Mountain?

276
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,240
It's you.

277
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,641
Are you really going to Nanhua
for mentorship?

278
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,441
Why are you here?

279
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:15,480
Don't worry.

280
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,240
I'm a good person.

281
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:19,200
I just happened to be passing by.

282
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,681
I wanted to go to Nanhua

283
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,480
to see if there really is a sage.

284
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,600
Then can you tell me

285
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:28,641
which of these two paths should I take?

286
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,641
The small road leads to Nanhua.

287
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,681
The big road leads to Shanyang.

288
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,401
How could the small road lead to Nanhua?

289
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:45,600
My father said that

290
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:47,801
people are dangerous out there,

291
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,720
it is better to be careful.

292
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,080
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

293
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,360
I'm leaving now.

294
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:56,881
Farewell, sir.

295
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:01,000
Don't call me that.

296
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,881
It sounds weird.

297
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,000
I didn't

298
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,641
introduce myself to you.

299
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,041
My name is Wang Yue,

300
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,080
meaning the dead moon.

301
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,681
Your name

302
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,000
is quite beautiful.

303
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,720
How come I'm back here again?

304
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,840
Wang Yue really did not lie to me.

305
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,720
This is really the way to Shanyang.

306
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,080
I should have listened to him.

307
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
I told her that I was a good person,

308
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,120
but she didn't seem to believe me.

309
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:26,120
You're shameless to say that.

310
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,881
You did it on purpose.

311
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
But

312
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,600
she just looks a bit similar.

313
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:33,600
Are you sure it's her?

314
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,360
(You'd better be late.)

315
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:38,320
(You'll have a good master.)

316
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:21,080
It's you.

317
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:26,561
I'm sorry.

318
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:29,641
I'm late.

319
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,521
Father.

320
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:46,120
Uncle Wen.

321
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,801
Don't!

322
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:50,761
Don't go!

323
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:23,641
It's you! It's you!

324
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,960
You're the sage

325
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,320
who protects Yangzhou, right?

326
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,480
I met you when I was a child.

327
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:30,921
Others didn't believe me.

328
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,840
But I knew it was you.

329
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,641
I was so scared.

330
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,921
I thought I was going to die.

331
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,441
You saved me, right?

332
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:39,240
You're Sage Chonghua,

333
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,761
am I right?

334
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,960
I didn't expect you to

335
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:46,120
remember such an early event.

336
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:47,761
My name is Wen Zi.

337
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,041
Last night I had an accident,

338
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:50,761
thank you for saving me.

339
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:53,240
Before, you were Chongzi,
[*Literally a little bug]

340
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,041
and now you are Wenzi.
[*Literally a little mosquito]

341
00:24:58,921 --> 00:25:00,120
By the way, Mr. Sage,

342
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:01,960
can you take me to Nanhua?

343
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:04,441
No, I can't.

344
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,441
I am about to go to Nanhua
for mentorship.

345
00:25:07,921 --> 00:25:09,561
Since I met you by chance,

346
00:25:09,761 --> 00:25:10,401
why not

347
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,881
acknowledge you as my master?

348
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,801
Why should I accept you as my disciple?

349
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,240
Sage Chonghua has been blessing Yangzhou.

350
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,041
If it weren't for you,

351
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:21,720
I wouldn't have grown up safely.

352
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:24,320
I want to learn spells from you.

353
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:25,641
I want to

354
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:27,681
help the weak
and the righteous just like you.

355
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,681
The Immortal World
is not as free as the Mortal World,

356
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,281
and you'll lose control of yourself.

357
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:35,720
I don't care.

358
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,761
Now that you know who I am,

359
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,561
do you know that

360
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:42,120
I don't accept disciples?

361
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,881
You didn't reject me

362
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,080
from the beginning,

363
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:47,360
and just asked me the reason.

364
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:48,320
This means that

365
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:50,360
you approve of me in your heart.

366
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,521
I didn't expect you

367
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,960
to be so eloquent.

368
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:56,600
I am very good.

369
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:58,840
But once you enter Nanhua,

370
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,761
you have to give up everything you have,

371
00:26:01,441 --> 00:26:02,761
including your freedom.

372
00:26:04,281 --> 00:26:05,921
As long as I'm with you,

373
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,161
I'm willing.

374
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,881
It's not that easy.

375
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:18,161
Is this the unconscious child?

376
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,161
Yinfan,

377
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,600
you...

378
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,320
(The lady of the Immortal World
is really different.)

379
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,921
(She's so elegant.)

380
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,000
She was attacked by the demons
and was frightened.

381
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,401
Thank you, Miss Zhuo.

382
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,080
Drink the medicine while it's hot.

383
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,281
I've added some honeydew specially.

384
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:50,000
It's not very bitter.

385
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,080
You really added honeydew.

386
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:03,720
Don't drink it if it's bitter.

387
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:13,080
You still have some left.

388
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,041
Come on,

389
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:16,720
drink it all.

390
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,161
I've made the right amount of medicine.

391
00:27:24,921 --> 00:27:27,441
Yinfan, you're having no scruples.

392
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:29,480
Is it because you still can't let her go?

393
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:33,120
This girl

394
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:35,881
is just like her.

395
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,120
(She?)

396
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,720
(Who is she?)

397
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,561
She's just an ordinary person.

398
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,000
I just saved her.

399
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:49,000
I hope it was just to save her.

400
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,240
Yinfan,

401
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:54,120
I'd like to talk with you for a moment.

402
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,200
She seems to want to be your disciple.

403
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
I don't think

404
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,720
it's a good fit

405
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:11,041
for her and for you.

406
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:15,441
This is my business.

407
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:18,521
I'm saying this for your sake.

408
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,681
Taking her with you,

409
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,801
aren't you afraid of
getting into trouble again?

410
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:34,881
What do you want?

411
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,401
Martial arts?

412
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:38,921
Power? Or money?

413
00:28:39,881 --> 00:28:41,761
Isn't it better to live a happy life
in the Mortal World

414
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,161
than to enter the immortal sect?

415
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:47,240
Since I've met Mr. Sage,

416
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,720
how can I be willing
to be an ordinary person?

417
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:55,720
Master, you are willing to accept me,

418
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,200
right?

419
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,441
Master,

420
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:01,720
please don't go.

421
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
If you leave,

422
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,561
you won't find
such a good disciple like me.

423
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,041
You are not yet a disciple
of the immortal sect.

424
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,480
Don't kneel like this.

425
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,400
Get up.

426
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,840
♪If never blow away the clouds♪

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,801
Kneel down.

429
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,720
Kneel down.

430
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Acknowledge me.

431
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:39,881
I'm Wen Zi from Yangzhou,
greetings to Master.

439
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,480
I'm Luo Yinfan, Sage Chonghua.

440
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:29,161
Since you've become my disciple,

441
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:30,801
you must abide by the rules of the sect,

442
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,840
put Nanhua's safety first,

443
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,681
and think of the people of the world.

444
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,761
Don't do anything against the rules.

445
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:39,120
I've kept it in mind.

446
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:40,600
Get up.

447
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:50,521
Miss Zhuo, as you see,

448
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:52,600
she is now a disciple
of the immortal sect.

449
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,641
You are still the same as before.

450
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:57,561
No one can change

451
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,320
what you decide.

452
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:15,000
She's just an ordinary girl

453
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:16,480
with mediocre qualifications

454
00:31:16,881 --> 00:31:17,720
and happens to have the same face

455
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:19,080
as your disciple.

456
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,480
But you're going to take her
back to Nanhua.

457
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:24,561
Sage Chonghua,
you're so opinionated and affectionate.

458
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,480
It has nothing to do with her.

459
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:28,921
Miss Wen Zi has no relatives,

460
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,761
and she's going to Nanhua for mentorship.

461
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,641
I just did it to help her.

462
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:35,641
If it's really as aboveboard as you say,

463
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:39,120
then wouldn't it be a waste of time

464
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:41,441
to use your spell to hide her face?

465
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:48,041
Paper can't wrap fire.

466
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:49,521
Once all the immortals in Nanhua

467
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:51,240
know her true face,

468
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:52,881
how do you think

469
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,120
will this girl live in Nanhua?

470
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:01,000
I will find the way.

471
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:13,921
Master,

472
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:16,200
have you changed your mind?

473
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,840
Let's go.

474
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,480
Come back to Nanhua with me.

475
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,881
But I think Miss Zhuo

476
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:27,881
does not want me to be your disciple.

477
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
I...

478
00:32:31,161 --> 00:32:32,720
You don't have to
think about anything else.

479
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,441
From now on,

480
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:36,681
you only need to listen to me alone.

481
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,281
Yes, Master.

482
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,521
- Mr. Luo.
- Mr. Luo.

483
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,000
(Liuhe Hall)

484
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,281
Just do it. Go ahead.

485
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:41,401
Yes.

486
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:44,401
Yu Du, this thing...

487
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:50,960
Yinfan.

488
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,561
Who is she?

489
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:55,480
This is my new disciple.

490
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,281
Yinfan, you're finally
willing to accept a disciple again.

491
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:00,720
Although it's against the rules,

492
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,281
I still want to congratulate you.

493
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:04,360
Councilor, am I right?

494
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,201
Now that you have a new disciple,

495
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:10,760
teach her the rules properly,

496
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:13,320
and don't let her damage
our Nanhua's reputation.

497
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:15,840
What's your name?

498
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,241
My name is Wen Zi.

499
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,441
I give her a new name,

500
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:30,120
Chong Zi.

501
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:32,800
What...

502
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:11,441
Fly. Fly.

503
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:22,201
Do you have to give her this name?

504
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,040
My disciple

505
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:27,881
must be called by this name.

506
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:31,481
You know

507
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,600
how sensitive this name is in Nanhua.

508
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:35,961
But you did it on purpose.

509
00:35:36,441 --> 00:35:37,441
Aren't you afraid that

510
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:40,320
other sects will criticize us?

511
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:44,520
She's just an ordinary girl,

512
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,401
what kind of criticism can there be?

513
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,360
The immortal sect should be able to

514
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,441
accept an ordinary girl,

515
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:52,320
right?

516
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:54,120
You...

517
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,001
Yinfan.

518
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,040
Yin...

519
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,401
Who is she?

520
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:06,681
Don't know.

521
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,241
She's so close to Sage Chonghua.

522
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,721
She should be the new disciple
of Sage Chonghua.

523
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:59,201
I always feel that this child

524
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,881
is strange,

525
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:04,161
as if there is some secret in her.

526
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:12,080
Just an ordinary child.

527
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:13,921
There's nothing unclean about her.

528
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:16,241
Don't worry,
there's nothing wrong with her.

529
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,360
I cultivate here every year,

530
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:44,120
you don't have to come
to pick me up every time.

531
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,681
It's common for our disciples
to be in cultivation.

532
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:48,201
I'm just here to pick you up

533
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:50,120
in place of our masters, why not?

534
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,241
Thank you, Senior Miaoyuan.

535
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:53,681
You must not know

536
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,600
what happened in Nanhua

537
00:37:54,681 --> 00:37:55,961
while you were in seclusion.

538
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,120
I don't care.

539
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,840
Luo Yinfan has taken on a new disciple
named Chong Zi.

540
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,961
Luo Yinfan named

541
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:09,280
his new disciple Chong Zi?

542
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:13,560
He's really Supervisor Sage,

543
00:38:13,881 --> 00:38:15,320
who always gives us surprises.

544
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,520
Don't you

545
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,520
want to meet her?

546
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,241
They just have the same name.

547
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,600
No need to be surprised.

548
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:23,441
Great.

549
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:25,921
Seclusion does cultivate the will.

550
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,721
Those who are dead are dead.

551
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:29,600
Those who are still alive

552
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:31,641
should not dwell on the past.

553
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,681
Why don't you also
come to cultivate for a while?

554
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:39,721
It'll be good for both you and Nanhua.

555
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:42,760
Well, no need.

556
00:38:43,881 --> 00:38:45,120
If you have nothing else to do,

557
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
I'm going to see Sage Tianji.

558
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,520
I'll go with you.

559
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,280
Master, can you wait for me?

560
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,961
Let's go.

561
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,800
(Chonghua Palace)

562
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:05,001
You'll stay in
that side hall afterwards.

563
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:07,040
I am always in the main hall.

564
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,961
Come to see me in two hours.

565
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,360
(Chong Zi)

566
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,640
(Chong Zi)

567
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,681
(Master is truly powerful.)

568
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,921
(He had expected me to come.)
