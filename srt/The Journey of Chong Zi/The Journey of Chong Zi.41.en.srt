1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,640
(A Hundred Years Later)

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,600
The story says,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,279
a hundred years ago,

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,520
during the ultimate battle between

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,239
Supreme Sage and Demon Zi,

6
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:19,639
the sky fell and the earth cracked,

7
00:00:19,799 --> 00:00:22,000
and there was a wholesale slaughter.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Demon Zi summoned the monster Lion
to devour the Resting Soil,

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,879
break the Six-world Monument,

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,119
trying to release all the demons.

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:38,040
The Supreme Sage exhibited the unique skill

12
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:39,439
Mirror Heart Skill

13
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,680
to press her under the boulder.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,240
Then he sealed all the demon with his body.

15
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:51,080
From then on, the Demon

16
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:55,560
longer dared to do harm
to the mortal world,

17
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:01,080
and the piping times of peace came back.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,839
- Great!
- Great!

19
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,199
It's like this really happened.

20
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,559
- Great!
- Bravo!

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,839
Darling.

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,319
I got the wine.

23
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:14,080
Let's go home.

24
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,319
Let's listen to the story again
next time, shall we?

25
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:19,440
Do you like

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,040
this kind of nonsense?

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,319
I don't care.

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
It's attractive anyway.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,480
Okay.

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,919
Let's come again next time.

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,360
Let's go.

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,720
(Xichun Restaurant)

33
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,639
Darling.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,879
Hold my hand tight.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,760
Look.

36
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,760
What a full moon.

37
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,800
So nice.

38
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,720
It's mine.

39
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:58,599
Give it back to me.

40
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,120
Give it back to me.

41
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,160
Take it.

42
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,720
Give it back to me.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,519
- Piss off. Run.
- Go.

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,959
Piss off.

45
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,080
(I don't want to be a beggar anymore.)

46
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
