(Adapted from "The Journey of Chongzi" by Shu Ke)

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,000
=Episode 19=

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,040
Qin Ke, why were you in a daze

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,440
while competing with me?

30
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:05,921
Don't try to let me win on purpose.

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,360
I don't want that.

32
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:10,721
I was distracted because of poor skills.

33
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,880
It's being late. Go to rest early.

34
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,841
(Why does it feel so familiar?)

35
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,081
Miss.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,441
Miss.

37
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:32,001
What's wrong with you?

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,441
Are you injured?

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,161
(Hengyang Inn)
I'm from Luocheng,

40
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:38,880
where Dragon King is making trouble.

41
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,040
I saw candlelight in the distance,

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,001
so I wanted to find a place to rest.

43
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,801
This medicine was given to me
by my friend and it works very well.

44
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,841
Could it be that you and your friend
are staying here

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,880
because of being persecuted
by Dragon King?

46
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:57,441
We are here to eliminate harm
for the people.

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,040
Now the town is in chaos,

48
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,680
and the people have suffered
countless casualties.

49
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,201
It may be dangerous for you alone.

50
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,520
Unless

51
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,400
you are from Nanhua?

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,240
Exactly.

53
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:09,441
We have a lot of people,

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,841
and we will be more careful.

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,721
If so,

56
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:15,400
I have one request.

57
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:18,120
May I go into town with you?

58
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:20,760
With your protection,
I will not be afraid.

59
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,641
You just escaped,

60
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,600
why do you want to go back?

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,600
My husband is still in the town.

62
00:03:26,841 --> 00:03:28,240
He is seriously ill,

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,680
and I came to gather herbs
and sell plants

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,641
for his sake.

65
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,161
I'm out of town.

66
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:34,921
I don't know what's going on inside.

67
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:36,520
I...

68
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,801
I have to go back to check.

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,561
If anything happens to him,

70
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,641
what is the use of me
picking these herbs?

71
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:46,880
Don't worry.

72
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
I will follow far behind the team

73
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,680
and will not disturb you.

74
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,960
I will tell my senior tomorrow.

75
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,441
And you can follow us from afar.

76
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,361
Thank you so much.

77
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,081
Chong Zi followed them there

78
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:02,680
and said that it's your order.

79
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,161
Is it true?

80
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,281
I wanted to go down the mountain
with Chong Zi.

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,240
I just let her go first.

82
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:10,001
How could she...

83
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,600
Chong Zi is a disciple of Nanhua,

84
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,680
and she has to practice.

85
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:16,281
Alright, I have to go.

86
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,520
Goodbye.

87
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:37,800
Qin Ke.

88
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:58,120
Junior Qin.

89
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,721
You are finally here.

90
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,561
The Dragon King took many people away.

91
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,960
Luohe River is now
full of huge waves.

92
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,721
We'd better not rush forward now.

93
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,120
How dare the Dragon King
be so rampant?

94
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,881
We have found the way

95
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,520
to Qianchi Cave
at the bottom of the river.

96
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:14,001
It's just that there are nearly
two thousand water monsters.

97
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,841
Moreover, the Dragon King has practiced
for 500 years and is difficult to deal with.

98
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:19,640
These disciples should not
take risks easily.

99
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,321
Now that we have explored
the way to Qianchi Cave,

100
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,520
I will take a team there

101
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,360
to fight against the Dragon King.

102
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
It would be very dangerous.

103
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,400
Which of you would like to go with me?

104
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,441
- I'm going.
- I'm going.

105
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:38,601
I'd also like to go.

106
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,561
No way.

107
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,200
I'm going.

108
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
No.

109
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,400
Miaoyuan.

110
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,161
Take everyone to find the surviving people.

111
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,601
I'm going to make contact with
the seniors who are stationed here.

112
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:49,640
Why?

113
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:51,841
Haven't we always acted together?

114
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:53,920
Disciples of Team One.

115
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,200
Let's get started.

116
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,721
The others will be led
by Senior Miaoyuan

117
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:58,240
to settle down the surviving people

118
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,841
and try to save
as many people as possible.

119
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,481
If everything goes well,

120
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,761
I'll come back tomorrow
and arrange the next move.

121
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,080
Take care.

122
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:06,400
Don't act rashly.

123
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:08,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

124
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:23,360
(Where is Shuixian?)

125
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,080
Wake up, kid.

126
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,960
- Mom.
- You are awake.

127
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:38,841
Thank you, miss.

128
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:41,520
Zhenzhu, have you seen
a lady selling flowers?

129
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,360
If you see her, let me know.

130
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,080
Senior.

131
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:47,481
Senior.

132
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,481
Senior.

133
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,920
Senior Qin Ke and the others

134
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,640
were sucked into Qainchi Cave
by the Dragon King.

135
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,240
They have been missing for four hours.

136
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,240
What?

137
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,360
Senior.

138
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:01,881
Step aside.

139
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,281
Senior, calm down. If you go now,

140
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:05,960
one more person will be missing.

141
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:07,761
You may not be able to save him.

142
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,240
Yes, you are right.

143
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,881
I can't do it alone.

144
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,321
Let's go save him together.

145
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,800
I order all of you

146
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:16,481
to go to Qianchi Cave together.

147
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,721
It's not a good idea.

148
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:19,281
Qin Ke has Demon-constraining Silk
with him.

149
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:20,960
The Dragon King wouldn't
be able to do anything to him.

150
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,041
He must be trapped at the bottom
of the river at most.

151
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,881
That's easy enough for you to say.

152
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,481
It's not you who is trapped.

153
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,321
I can't let Qin Ke be in trouble
without doing anything.

154
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,841
We have to do something,

155
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,640
but be cautious.

156
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,321
I think

157
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:37,481
we should go to the nearest
Yunfeng Sect for help.

158
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,200
If we rush forward like this,

159
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:40,561
not only will we not have
the ability to fight,

160
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,441
but we may also drag Qin Ke down.

161
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,120
Yunfeng Sect isn't that strong,

162
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,960
but they have always been friends
with Nanhua.

163
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:47,520
If we ask for help,

164
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,721
they will certainly not sit idly by.

165
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,880
You don't have much strength left.

166
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,681
You'd better go back to Nanhua
with me to make amends.

167
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,960
Make amends for what?

168
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,681
I've been free all my life

169
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,440
and I hate the immortal sects most.

170
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,960
You are really carefree.

171
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,041
Have you ever thought about

172
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,121
how innocent those people who
have been harmed by you are?

173
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,801
If you want to take me down,
just do it.

174
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:51,041
Why talking about this?

175
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:53,960
Don't you dare to admit

176
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:55,681
what you have done?

177
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:56,721
Ridiculous.

178
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,440
If I am right,

179
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,000
Qianchi Crave should be right
under the river.

180
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,520
Qin Ke is also there.

181
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Let's go.

182
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,161
If you want to go,

183
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:22,080
get past me first.

184
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,121
Shuixian.

185
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,400
No.

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,440
You are not Shuixian.

187
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:37,560
Who are you?

188
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,880
What are you talking about, Chong Zi?

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,960
I am Shuixian.

190
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,760
You know someone of the Demon World?

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You... you are from the Demon World?

192
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,960
Yes.

193
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,520
I am Yin Shuixian,
protector of the Demon World.

194
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:53,721
Remember it now?

195
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,440
You traitor, how dare you collude
with a demon?

196
00:09:56,481 --> 00:09:57,681
I'm going to tell Councilor Sage.

197
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:58,801
You!

198
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,801
Yin Shuixian

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,880
used to be a famous senior
of Tianshan Sect.

200
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:07,801
Seeing is believing.

201
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,161
I've been hearing about you from others.

202
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,841
You are really extraordinary

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,640
and worthy of your name.

204
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:18,200
Tianshan Sect?

205
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:19,880
Chong Zi.

206
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,721
How could you know her?

207
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,841
Yin Shuixian is someone
hard to deal with.

208
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,520
It's a pity that she became a demon

209
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,281
and is despised by the whole world.

210
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:32,200
No.

211
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:34,281
She is stalling for time.

212
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:36,601
If this continues,
Qin Ke will be in danger.

213
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:41,080
You seem to be smart.

214
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,281
If you rush into the river,
you won't be able to save him,

215
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,241
and you will even lose your own lives.

216
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:47,320
If your Senior Qin

217
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:49,000
could subdue the Dragon King,

218
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,041
he'd have been here long ago.

219
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,440
You are deliberately making us
deal with the Dragon King

220
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,440
so that you can reap the benefits.

221
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,121
We will definitely take down
the Dragon King.

222
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:00,640
You better stop

223
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,041
- wasting your efforts.
- Ridiculous.

224
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:04,921
Just a protector of the Demon World.

225
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:06,721
I can deal with you alone.

226
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,560
(No.)

227
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,921
(The disciples of Nanhua must have been
entangled by the demon.)

228
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,560
If you are worried about your fellows,
just go up.

229
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:46,241
And you'll escape.

230
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,481
There's not a winner yet.

231
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,760
I won't run away.

232
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,281
After you get things done,

233
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,841
let's fight again.

234
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,161
I didn't expect you to be so generous.

235
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,281
Why did you bother

236
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:57,681
the residents on the banks
of Luohe River?

237
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,041
Would you believe me if I said
I never hurt anyone?

238
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,241
I have witnessed the misery
of the people.

239
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,960
How could I believe you?

240
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:05,241
Forget it.

241
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,760
It's no use talking to you.

242
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,841
This is between me and the demons.

243
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,601
Zhenzhu.

244
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,161
Chong Zi is so great.

245
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:13,440
Of course.

246
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,481
Chong Zi is good at many things.

247
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:16,960
It's just that you don't know.

248
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,520
- Why are you here?
- To do you a favor.

249
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,080
Don't forget that

250
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,960
our target is the Dragon King.

251
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,681
I will deal with them.

252
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Go get the Dragon King out
from the river.

253
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,681
Qin Ke.

254
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,361
Don't bother.

255
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,281
Qin Ke.

256
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,560
Are you okay?

257
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:49,841
Why are you alone?

258
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Where is the Dragon King?

259
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:53,041
You killed him?

260
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,241
There is no more Dragon King
in this world.

261
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,801
I don't care about the grievances

262
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,241
between the demons
and the Dragon King.

263
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,681
But I can't ignore

264
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:05,440
what you did to the people here.

265
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,601
Master.

266
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:36,880
- My king.
- My king.

267
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,921
Yin Shuixian.

268
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:42,440
Are you worthy of Xueling
who sacrificed

269
00:13:42,681 --> 00:13:44,241
for such reckless actions?

270
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:45,681
Luo Yinfan.

271
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,601
The ones who have truly

272
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,320
failed Xueling are you.

273
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,361
So impenitent.

274
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:55,960
Luo Yinfan.

275
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:58,241
You got a good disciple.

276
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,200
I like her.

277
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:10,801
(It's him.)

278
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,241
I am a good person.

279
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,400
I will not lie to you.

280
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,400
My name is Wang Yue,

281
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:17,960
meaning

282
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,241
dead moon.

283
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:21,481
Mr. Luo, aren't we
going to hunt them down?

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,200
Where is the Dragon King?

285
00:14:24,361 --> 00:14:25,000
Mr. Luo.

286
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,241
Junior Qin Ke has dealt with
the Dragon King.

287
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,400
I'm not asking you.

288
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:34,000
Why did you lie?

289
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:37,241
Isn't the Dragon King dead?

290
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,000
I will ask you one last time.

291
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,000
Where is the Dragon King now?

292
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:44,801
I made my own decision and let him go.

293
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,801
But I can't ignore

294
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,440
what you did to the people here.

295
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,440
Master, Qin Ke must have

296
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:55,560
his reasons for doing this.

297
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:57,121
Qin Ke, tell us

298
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:58,320
what happened

299
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,400
in Qianchi Cave.

300
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:01,400
My fellows and I

301
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,000
chased the Dragon King to Qianchi Cave.

302
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,921
The Dragon King was at a disadvantage.

303
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,481
There were a few times
when he could run to the shore,

304
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:09,000
but he had no intention of
starting the battle,

305
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:10,880
and taking the people on the shore
as hostages.

306
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,841
Later,

307
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,400
when the protector
of the Demon World came,

308
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,000
he was worried about our disciples,

309
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,601
so he asked me to go ashore first
to meet the enemy.

310
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,640
His various behaviors

311
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,841
made me think that he is not a villain.

312
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,000
So I persuaded him to tell me the truth.

313
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:24,921
You'd better tell me everything.

314
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:25,841
Otherwise,

315
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:27,960
even if we can get out alive today,

316
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:28,921
the immortal sect will

317
00:15:28,921 --> 00:15:30,681
treat you as a remnant of the demons
in the future.

318
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,200
You have offended the immortal sect,

319
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,880
but you don't want
to join the Demon World.

320
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:35,841
So you will have to hide all day long.

321
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,640
Do you want to live a life like this?

322
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:40,481
If you are willing to trust me,

323
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,560
I will help you today.

324
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
When the demons see
you and me together,

325
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:46,400
they will stay away
from you in the future.

326
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,161
Two options,

327
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,601
life or death. It's up to you.

328
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,041
Are you serious?

329
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:59,000
The Dragon King didn't harm the people
on the banks of Luohe River.

330
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,320
It was the demons
who pretended to be him

331
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,361
and killed countless people in order to
force him to become a demon several times,

332
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,361
and then used our power to deal with him.

333
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,481
If what you said is true,

334
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:08,760
the Dragon King

335
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:10,921
owes Nanhua a great favor.

336
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,481
Why did you let him go?

337
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,760
I have to let him go.

338
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,161
Why?

339
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,640
You helped him out of the siege,

340
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:19,200
and he should surrender to Nanhua.

341
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:21,361
In this way, you'd have made
a great contribution.

342
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:23,560
With the character of the Dragon King,

343
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:24,681
he is more suitable to be

344
00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:25,921
a free monster in the world

345
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,721
than staying in the immortal sect.

346
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,041
I made my own decision.

347
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,880
Supervisor Sage, please punish me.

348
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:40,640
In the three worlds of mortals,
monsters and demons,

349
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,000
not all races

350
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:43,640
are suitable
for cultivating immortal bones.

351
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,760
For a free monster who is used
to being at ease,

352
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,481
instead of forcing him to submit
to the immortal sect,

353
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:49,241
it is better to adapt to local conditions

354
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,841
and let him play to his strengths.

355
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,880
Qin Ke.

356
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,161
You are right.

357
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,760
Tell the Dragon King for me that

358
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,241
Nanhua granted him permission
not to follow the immortal sect.

359
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,721
But from now on, he has to protect
the peace of Luohe River.

360
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:06,601
As long as he doesn't
submit to the demons

361
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:07,920
nor harm the people,

362
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,881
if he is in trouble one day,

363
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,200
Nanhua will definitely help him.

364
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Yes.

365
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,601
I asked to you take care.

366
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:31,721
But you still rushed ahead regardless.

367
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:33,001
Your magical power is still weak.

368
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:35,401
If you hadn't taken the wise counsel
I gave you with you,

369
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,320
you would have been seriously injured.

370
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:39,560
I was too self-willed

371
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:41,841
to follow the seniors down the mountain
without authorization

372
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,521
and made you worry.

373
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:45,121
Although you went down the mountain
on your own,

374
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,680
you were calm
when fighting Yin Shuixian,

375
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:49,080
and put the overall situation first.

376
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,521
It's not a fault.

377
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,080
I meant to take you with me,

378
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:54,881
but didn't expect you to misunderstand me.

379
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:57,481
So you don't need to blame yourself.

380
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,401
You did a good job.

381
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:03,841
Master, you never blame me,

382
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,200
is it because of

383
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,200
the disciple you had?

384
00:18:09,401 --> 00:18:11,080
But I'm different from her.

385
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,761
I'd never sympathize with the demons.

386
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,361
I won't have anything to do
with them either.

387
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:19,601
Master.

388
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:22,841
Did you take me as her substitute?

389
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,761
How could you be a substitute?

390
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,960
Master, trust me.

391
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,241
I will never hurt you

392
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,241
like she did,

393
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:31,960
and

394
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,601
I will make you proud of me.

395
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:34,560
Chong.

396
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:35,841
Stop it.

397
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,200
I just hope you are

398
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,521
safe and sound by my side.

399
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,521
Nothing else

400
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:45,841
matters.

401
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,440
(Liuhe Hall)

402
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,560
Who would have thought that
a mere Dragon King

403
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,440
could attract Demon King Wang Yue
to show up?

404
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,601
I guess

405
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,481
the demons are trying
to reap the benefits.

406
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,960
Nice try.

407
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,881
Now that the battle

408
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,560
between the Demon World and
the Immortal World is inevitable,

409
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,481
we might as well

410
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:09,440
join hands with several sects

411
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:11,121
to directly attack the demons

412
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,001
and wipe them out in one fell swoop.

413
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,641
No.

414
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,280
It is really inappropriate to
start a war with the demons now.

415
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:28,960
I've fought with Wang Yue once.

416
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,080
Although I'm slightly better,

417
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:32,680
I don't know

418
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:34,881
if he deliberately concealed his strength.

419
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:36,881
If we acted rashly,

420
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:38,960
it would only
increase unnecessary casualties.

421
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:41,841
I agree with Yinfan.

422
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:43,361
The stakes are high.

423
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,960
The immortal sects should be responsible.

424
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:48,761
But look, Qinghua Palace is overcautious.

425
00:19:48,881 --> 00:19:50,800
Not even a single person
of Changsheng Palace came.

426
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:52,521
It can be told that they are unwilling
to take the lead.

427
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,280
Unless...

428
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,121
Unless we discuss it with
the Tianshan Sect first.

429
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,761
If we can reach a consensus,

430
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Qinghua Sect and Changsheng Palace

431
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,200
will have to go.

432
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:07,241
Exactly.

433
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:11,040
Yinfan, what do you think?

434
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:19,761
I still have things to attend to.

435
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,721
You can go first.

436
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:27,841
What are you

437
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,280
going to do?

438
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,001
For that girl

439
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,440
again?

440
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,320
It is only natural for a master
to worry about his disciple.

441
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:39,001
Councilor, please

442
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,280
take the disciples to Tianshan first.

443
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
Yinfan, after you settle down
with Chong Zi,

444
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,481
go there yourself, okay?

445
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:50,001
I will make a decision after
discussing with my disciple.

446
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,601
What?

447
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,121
Discuss with her?

448
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,001
Qin Ke, Miaoyuan.

449
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,241
Immediately set off with me

450
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:00,680
for Tianshan.

451
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,601
Yes.

452
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:12,881
Shuixian.

453
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,721
I've said it many times,
it's windy at night.

454
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Can't you obediently wait for me
in the house?

455
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,401
Wouldn't it be better

456
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:24,800
to see you sooner?

457
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:28,641
Forget it.

458
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,241
I'll come back earlier next time.

459
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:33,841
Let's go.

460
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:51,761
Look how cold you are.

461
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:55,800
Here.

462
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,320
Can't you

463
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:02,521
take care of yourself

464
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,641
while I'm away?

465
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:05,040
Sorry, Shuixian.

466
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
I...

467
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:11,241
I'm not angry, why apologizing?

468
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:13,560
Because of me,

469
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,001
you are running around all day
and working hard outside.

470
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,160
I...

471
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,200
Stop talking.

472
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:22,560
You are sick, and can't get worried.

473
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:27,200
It's okay, everything's fine.

474
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:29,761
Really?

475
00:22:33,361 --> 00:22:34,800
No matter how big troubles are,

476
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,241
as long as I see you,

477
00:22:36,361 --> 00:22:37,960
they will all disappear.

478
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,800
You are my reassurance.

479
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:49,960
As long as you are here,

480
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:51,800
the world

481
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:54,241
is valuable to me.

482
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,160
If only I could be with you all the time.

483
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,200
Are you leaving again?

484
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:07,080
I'm going to send some plants to Tuzhou.

485
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:08,800
But it won't take long.

486
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,200
Just wait for me at home.

487
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,680
Don't get out.

488
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:13,361
Okay.

489
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:14,841
I'll wait for you to come back.

490
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,721
The light is on.

491
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,200
- The light is on.
- So bright.

492
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,440
Look at the sky.

493
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,121
It's a dream.

494
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,241
Zi, why did I dream about Master again?

495
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:42,841
No way.

496
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,401
I can't ask for more

497
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:45,881
just because Master treats me well.

498
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:52,320
But wasn't Master

499
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,320
just a sage before he became my master?

500
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,881
It makes sense.

501
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,761
Are you also laughing at me?

502
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Chong.

503
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:06,721
You are not healed yet.

504
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,121
Why are you here

505
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,481
instead of resting in the room?

506
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,520
♪Come and pick up the shattered sword♪

507
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,240
♪With your magnanimity♪

508
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,920
♪To the vast sky♪

509
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,440
♪One day♪

510
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,840
♪There will be daylight♪

511
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:39,440
Master.

512
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,800
Thank you for your gift.

513
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,080
Don't eat too much.
Sweets are not good for recovery.

514
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,680
Master, I'm fine now.

515
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:53,160
I can eat five more.

516
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,200
Try it. It's so sweet.

517
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:08,680
How is it? Is it sweet?

518
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,800
I wanted to say that
I was going to Tianshan.

519
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:15,560
But your spiritual power
has not recovered yet.

520
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:18,001
I can't let you stay on Zizhu Peak alone.

521
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:19,680
Master.

522
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,401
Am I going to be alone

523
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,680
at home again?

524
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:24,200
I just want to ask

525
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,361
if you are willing to
go to Tianshan with me.

526
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,361
Of course.

527
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,160
But last time I was in Luohe,

528
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,040
I ashamed you.

529
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,521
This time...

530
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,440
It's because I wasn't
by your side last time.

531
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:39,680
But this time is different.

532
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:41,440
We're just going to negotiate.

533
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,200
You don't have to fight.

534
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:45,320
The snow scenery of Tianshan
is very beautiful.

535
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:47,440
Just play around there.

536
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:49,481
Miss Zhuo will also go.

537
00:26:49,601 --> 00:26:51,401
Let her check on you.

538
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,200
Master, can I have more?

539
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:01,841
So greedy.

540
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:21,080
We have received a message that

541
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:23,920
they are on their way to Tianshan Sect.

542
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,440
Tianshan Sect?

543
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,521
Heavenly Lake.

544
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,121
Could it be that...

545
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,080
My king, if it succeeds,

546
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,960
it would be a great fortune for us.

547
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:49,320
Yin Xinmo.

548
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:51,160
This time the operation

549
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,481
is up to you to arrange.

550
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:02,280
What should I do?

551
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,160
He will assist you in action.

552
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:07,361
By then,

553
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:09,601
you will know what to do.

554
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:13,481
I got it, it's just...

555
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,241
Who is he indeed?

556
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,800
Is he believable?

557
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,601
He is the most loyal subordinate
in our Demon World.

558
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,440
Your seniority

559
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,121
is far

560
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:28,001
behind him.

Chong.

574
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:02,080
Master.

575
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,401
Look, the snow

576
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,521
is so soft.

577
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:42,600
Watch your steps.

(Tianshan)

583
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,040
Yue Qiao, chief disciple
of Tianshan Sect.

584
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,440
Su Xiaoxiao, disciple of Tianshan Sect.

585
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:18,040
- Greetings to Sage.
- Greetings to Sage.

586
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,560
Councilor Sage of your sect
has already arrived

587
00:31:20,641 --> 00:31:22,320
and is having tea with Lord Lan.

588
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:24,320
They sent us down to meet you two.

589
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:26,080
Please follow us.

590
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,761
The snow scenery of Tianshan
is really beautiful.

591
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,641
No matter how hard it is, it is worth it.

592
00:31:29,841 --> 00:31:30,521
Exactly.

593
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,721
Tianshan Sect is one of the ten sects
of the immortal sects,

594
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:34,361
founded by Patriarch Yuanzhi.

595
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:36,320
When Patriarch Yuanzhi
passed by Tianshan,

596
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,680
he was fascinated by the snow scene,

597
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:39,641
so he settled down here.

598
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:41,001
Then he got inspiration from the snow

599
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,440
and created Tianshan swordsmanship.

600
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:43,440
It is ethereal and elegant,

601
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:46,040
beautiful and unpredictable,
so it is famous all over the world.

602
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:48,601
Please come with me.

603
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:51,200
Chong, let's go.

604
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,241
Chong.

605
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,761
Take care.

606
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:18,560
Master, hurry up.

607
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,361
Master, hurry up.

608
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,241
Zhenzhu.

609
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:39,560
Chong Zi.

610
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,721
Chong Zi.

611
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,121
Chong, slow down.

612
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,401
Chong Zi.

613
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:45,881
Chong.

614
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,440
(Tianshan Hall)
What an ignorant girl.

615
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,001
She tripped and fell even when
watching the snow.

616
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:50,721
So careless.

617
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:54,641
The ground is slippery.

618
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:55,761
Junior, be careful.

619
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,721
Get up.

620
00:32:57,761 --> 00:32:59,280
Thank you, Senior.

621
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:04,280
I've informed Lord Lan.

622
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,560
Mr. Luo.

623
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,641
I'm late.

624
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,241
Sorry, Lord Lan.

625
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:14,960
You must be tired of travelling.

626
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:17,481
Why don't you take a break
before discussion?

627
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:19,881
Thank you, but proper business
is top priority.

628
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,481
Who is this lady?

629
00:33:24,721 --> 00:33:25,800
She's the disciple

630
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:27,841
of Supervisor Sage.

631
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,641
I've long heard that Sage Chonghua

632
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:32,481
accepted a skilled disciple.

633
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,080
So that's her.

634
00:33:34,361 --> 00:33:35,440
Chong Zi.

635
00:33:35,761 --> 00:33:37,960
Greet Lord Lan.

636
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,481
Greetings to Lord Lan.

637
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,641
I heard that you performed well

638
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,800
during the siege of the Dragon King
in Luohe.

639
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:47,761
You are worthy of being
Sage Chonghua's disciple.

640
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:50,521
Lord Lan, she's flattered.

641
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:52,601
Watch out.

642
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,841
The snow looks easy to walk on,

643
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,401
but you have to pay attention
to every step.

644
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:58,001
Many kids suffer when
they first arrive here.

645
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,920
Back then, Xueling's...

646
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:05,160
Just forget about the scandal.

647
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:07,680
Lord Zhuo has been waiting for you
for a long time.

648
00:34:08,201 --> 00:34:09,441
Please come with me.

649
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,201
I heard that plum blossoms in Tianshan
are amazing.

650
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:28,280
Senior Yue Qiao,
could you show me around?

651
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:30,201
If you have time,

652
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,240
it's fine with me.

653
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:48,841
Chong Zi.

654
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:53,121
Senior, sorry.

655
00:34:53,201 --> 00:34:54,720
My bad.

656
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,681
Did you do it on purpose?

657
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,520
- I...
- What are you doing?

658
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:05,720
Master.

659
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,121
I wanted you and Qin Ke

660
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,720
to help the disciples of Tianshan

661
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,040
arrange the dinner together.

662
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,201
But look

663
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,601
what you are doing here.

664
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,121
Master, they did it first.

665
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,161
Why are you

666
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,520
as ignorant as her?

667
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,401
I...

668
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:32,921
Reflect on yourself in your room.

669
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,641
And you.

670
00:35:34,961 --> 00:35:36,520
Go back to your room.

671
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,760
Yes.

672
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,520
The two of you.

673
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:50,121
Reflect on yourselves in your room.

674
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,080
Councilor.

675
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,441
Chong Zi came to Tianshan
for the first time,

676
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,040
maybe she didn't know the rules here.

677
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,080
I'll stay and teach her

678
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,760
so she won't make another mistake.

679
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,720
Look at you.

680
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:13,841
You know that Councilor is always strict.

681
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,040
Why is he mad at this?

682
00:36:16,161 --> 00:36:17,881
Everyone played snowball fights
when they were kids,

683
00:36:17,961 --> 00:36:19,000
right?

684
00:36:19,121 --> 00:36:21,201
If this is Nanhua, you can do
whatever you want.

685
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,881
But this is Tianshan after all.

686
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:25,040
It makes sense.

687
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,520
Qin Ke, tell me about

688
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,800
the rules of the Tianshan Sect.

689
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,881
For example,

690
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,641
what is the scandal

691
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:34,881
that Lord Lan mentioned just now?

692
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,080
I'm afraid I would make a mistake again.

693
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,681
Do you remember Protector Yin Shuixian?

694
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:42,841
She used to be a disciple of Tianshan.

695
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:44,961
Her master was Sage Xueling.

696
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:47,881
Sage Xueling died in the Heavenly Lake

697
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:49,161
in that battle between
immortals and demons.

698
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,000
Yin Shuixian stole his body.

699
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:52,881
Then came the news that
she became a demon.

700
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,681
And she was despised by
the entire immortal sect.

701
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,961
Why did Yin Shuixian steal the body?

702
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:01,441
Because Sage Xueling was her true love.

703
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:04,080
She shouldn't have stolen his body anyway.

704
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,760
If she really loved him,

705
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:07,480
how could she become a demon?

706
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:13,961
By the way,

707
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:15,800
there is a Plum Blossom Ridge
behind the guest rooms

708
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:16,720
with few people there.

709
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,841
If you really want to have fun,

710
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,201
I'll take you there

711
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:20,280
after I am finished here.

712
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:22,441
The sages will not go there.

713
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,401
Okay.

714
00:37:46,921 --> 00:37:48,320
I really didn't expect that

715
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,161
there is someone more boring than me

716
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,601
in the world of ice and snow.

717
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:55,480
Shall we

718
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:56,441
play it together?

719
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,601
Don't you have anything to do?

720
00:37:58,201 --> 00:37:59,361
No.

721
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,361
I've been idle for ten years.

722
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
You!

723
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,280
Who are you?

724
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,881
Don't you know me?

725
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,320
Why should I know you?

726
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:15,641
Are you famous?

727
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,600
(Qinghua Palace)

728
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,641
Qinghua Palace?

729
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:22,760
Are you

730
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,201
Zhuo Yao?

731
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,520
What are you laughing at?

732
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:29,641
You must be a newcomer.

733
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,961
This is Zhuo Hao,

734
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,961
Young Master of Qinghua Palace.

735
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:36,881
Tell me

736
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:39,161
which sect are you from?

737
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,280
Tianshan Sect, Changsheng Palace, or...

738
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,040
This is Chong Zi,

739
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,961
disciple of Supervisor Sage of Nanhua.

740
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,720
Greetings to Young Master Zhuo.

741
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:53,320
I have something to do and I am leaving.

742
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:54,720
Stop.

743
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,921
Tell me

744
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,401
what's your name.

745
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,240
Always the same.

746
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:06,361
Chong Zi.

747
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,681
Who gave you this name?

748
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,881
Luo Yinfan?

749
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,441
How dare he accept another disciple?

750
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,080
Why this name again?

751
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,961
Why not?

752
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
It's a matter of course that
my master should name me.

753
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,841
Just come to me alone.

754
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:20,320
You don't

755
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:22,441
deserve it.

756
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,841
Go back and tell Luo Yinfan that

757
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,760
one day I will personally
settle accounts with him.

758
00:39:27,961 --> 00:39:29,361
Listen, don't mess around.

759
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:31,000
Never hurt my master.

760
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,441
The blind loyalty remains the same.

761
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,841
Piss off!

762
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,361
(It's so weird.)

763
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,240
(What's wrong with my name?)

764
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:21,841
Why are those from Qinghua

765
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,401
so rude?
