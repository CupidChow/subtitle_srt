=The Journey of Chongzi=
(Adapted from "The Journey of Chongzi" by Shu Ke)

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,000
=Episode 35=

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,520
You are truly affectionate.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,319
Trapped by love,

30
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:47,999
you were willing to become
a demon with her.

31
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,480
Who would have thought that

32
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,639
Yin Xinmo

33
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,359
is Leng Wanli,

34
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:57,720
the third disciple of Sage Xueling
of Tianshan?

35
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,720
(Master & Shuixian)

36
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,680
(Always and forever)

37
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:17,880
No way.

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,360
(Always and forever)

39
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,359
(Master & Shuixian)
No way.

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,040
Why?

41
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,880
Why?

42
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,960
Why did you make her
fall in love with you

43
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,759
and then dump her?

44
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,919
Why?

45
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,320
Sure enough,

46
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,040
nothing can be hidden from you.

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,080
For so many years,

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,559
even she didn't notice anything.

49
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,320
Back then,

50
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,320
you were best-of-class

51
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,160
among the younger generation of Tianshan.

52
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,839
After Yin Shuixian became a demon,

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,080
you disappeared from the immortal sect.

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Others thought

55
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,279
you were killed by the demons.

56
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,199
But instead,

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,520
you went to practice sorcery,

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,720
changed your appearance,

59
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:22,160
and became a demon with her.

60
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,359
You like Yin Shuixian so much,

61
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,720
but you never envied Xueling

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,040
because he is your master.

63
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:36,960
You've guarded her for so long,

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,919
while she didn't even know it
until she died.

65
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,199
Don't you feel unreconciled?

66
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,279
She's gone.

67
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,999
What can I do

68
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,919
even if

69
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,279
I am not reconciled?

70
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,520
Maybe Shuixian

71
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:58,359
already knew,

72
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,759
but just didn't want to admit it.

73
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,040
If that's the case,

74
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,600
why didn't she even say a word to me

75
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,160
in the end?

76
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,839
Since you already know,

77
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
why ask?

78
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,880
It's okay to let you know.

79
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,600
Yin Shuixian's last words

80
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,519
were to ask Demon Zi

81
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
to take good care of Xueling.

82
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,880
This is really cruel

83
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,720
to you.

84
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,640
You'd better

85
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,600
let go of your obsession completely

86
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,440
as she wanted.

87
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,600
What's done cannot be undone.

88
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,920
There is no looking back.

89
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,640
(Chonghua Palace)

90
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,280
(Chonghua Palace)

91
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,279
(What happened?)

92
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,679
(Why did I leave Zhubo behind?)

93
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,519
Master.

94
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,480
Ting Xue.

95
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,320
Do you remember

96
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,200
why I left Zhubo behind?

97
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,760
Yes.

98
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,640
You were quite sad

99
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,519
about the death of Zhuo Yunji
in Qinghua Palace.

100
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,839
Miss Zhuo died?

101
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,279
How?

102
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,399
Miss Zhuo...

103
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,320
Forget it.

104
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,679
Master, where are you going?

105
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,399
I am going around the Mortal World.

106
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:28,559
Wait for me, Master.

107
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,640
Did you open the Tianhe Gate?

108
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,320
Tianhe Gate is guarded by five beasts.

109
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,720
Every five hundred years,
there will be a new beast

110
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,320
to take over,

111
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,880
which is the Hundred-eyed Demon.

112
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,279
Now that the Hundred-eyed Demon died,

113
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:46,600
without the five beasts together,

114
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,239
the Tianhe Gate will naturally not close.

115
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,440
So

116
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,119
it wouldn't harm the Mortal World at all.

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,200
They are just there to guard the gate.

118
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,959
You asked me to subdue them,

119
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,160
but actually

120
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,519
you want to kill them?

121
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,239
Right.

122
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,880
But I didn't expect Luo Yinfan to come.

123
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,200
Even if he didn't strike,

124
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,640
Tian Zhixie would still kill it.

125
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,920
So you long planned to

126
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,920
use me

127
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,239
and keep me in the dark?

128
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,480
Yes.

129
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,480
Because I expected

130
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,920
you wouldn't do it.

131
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,119
You mutilated living beings.

132
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,480
The killing of alien races

133
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,200
has been going on since ancient times.

134
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,320
Didn't the immortal sect

135
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,559
kill other creatures?

136
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,480
Young Master.

137
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,519
Good for you.

138
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,320
Even you lied to me.

139
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,640
The immortal sect will naturally
take care of this matter.

140
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,079
Young Master, you'd better
leave this alone.

141
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,880
This is my own decision

142
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,160
and has nothing to do with anyone else.

143
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,440
Young Master, you are soft-hearted.

144
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,679
This is a fatal flaw.

145
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,399
You will never be able to

146
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,160
cultivate into a Celestial Demon like this.

147
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:00,999
Young Master.

148
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,679
It's not easy to block the Tianhe Gate.

149
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,279
The immortal sect will
send someone here soon.

150
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,119
Young Master.

151
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,799
Don't stay there long.

152
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,360
The East Sea has been quite
unsettled recently,

153
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,879
and many fishermen
who went fishing lost their lives.

154
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,160
Presumably it is because of
the monsters in the sea.

155
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,000
Hao.

156
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,839
Take someone to check it out.

157
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:58,079
Yes, Father.

158
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,319
You haven't been out for a long time.

159
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,680
This time is just an experience,

160
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,480
don't create any problems.

161
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,120
And you should handle things

162
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,240
related to Chong Zi carefully.

163
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't worry, Father.

164
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,279
I am now the lord of Qinghua.

165
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,079
I know what to do.

166
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,759
(It is the signal of the immortal sect.)

167
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,639
(Could it be that)

168
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,360
(something happened to the East Sea?)

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,720
(So this is the Tianhe Gate.)

170
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,399
(Then this collapsed pillar)

171
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,680
(should have been guarded
by the Hundred-Eyed Demon.)

172
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,519
(If I hadn't been deceived by Wang Yue,)

173
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,720
(how could the gate
be broken to this point,)

174
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,480
(and how could the water
of East Sea flow back?)

175
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,439
You are finally here.

176
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,639
You have indeed made much progress.

177
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:27,920
Qin Ke.

178
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,800
You and Lord Zhuo
should go to old lord Zhuo

179
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,600
to get the lacroixite for repairing the gate.

180
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes.

181
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,959
I am going to stabilize the Tianhe Gate.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
(Although it took a lot of my energy,)

183
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:00,439
(it is worth it in exchange
for these few hours.)

184
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,160
(I'll leave the rest to them.)

185
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,519
It's you.

186
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,480
It's you who broke the gate.

187
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,040
Zhubo.

188
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:33,360
Have you ever thought about

189
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,279
the consequences of breaking this gate

190
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,759
and the lives

191
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,680
of thousands of people?

192
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,959
Whatever you say.

193
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,519
I spared your life last time.

194
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,079
This time,

195
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:46,680
I will never tolerate you

196
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,879
doing evil in the world.

197
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,639
Luo Yinfan.

198
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,040
If today is my death day,

199
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,759
I will let the whole world die with me.

200
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,720
Time is running out.

201
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,879
Give this to Sage Chonghua.

202
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,680
Hurry up.

203
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,160
Sage Chonghua.

204
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,600
You can't kill her.

205
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,759
Repair the gate first.

206
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:27,959
Keep an eye on her.

207
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:29,160
Let's talk about it

208
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,079
after I finish fixing the gate.

209
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,160
As you can see,

210
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,759
he doesn't remember everything.

211
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,000
Just go.

212
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,279
If you let me go,

213
00:12:58,839 --> 00:12:59,959
you will be guilty of a serious crime.

214
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:00,839
Never mind.

215
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,079
Leave now.

216
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,560
I will try to figure out

217
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,959
the anomaly of Sage Chonghua.

218
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,319
You can only know the truth

219
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:07,600
when you are alive.

220
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,079
Our hero is back.

221
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,240
(Liuhe Hall)

222
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,399
Yinfan.

223
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,360
For the first time,

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,759
Tianhe Gate was closed

225
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,160
when one beast is missing.

226
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,839
You have done

227
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,560
another great thing.

228
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,120
This little effort

229
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:33,319
is not worth mentioning.

230
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,879
Now old lord Zhuo
is probably not feeling well.

231
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,560
If it wasn't for Zhuo Hao's help,

232
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
the Tianhe Gate

233
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,920
wouldn't have been blocked so smoothly.

234
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,879
We should thank them.

235
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,000
Yes.

236
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,680
It's a pity that

237
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,959
I didn't catch Demon Zi this time.

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,199
Demon Zi?

239
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,120
Why is she everywhere?

240
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,600
Councilor.

241
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,680
Demon Zi deliberately made
the water of East Sea flow backwards.

242
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,160
She has no regard for the safety
of the common people.

243
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,480
I'm afraid we can't keep her.

244
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,319
No worries.

245
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:05,360
Evil can never prevail over good.

246
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,439
I won't let her do whatever she wants.

247
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,759
It's just that

248
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,639
I don't think I've misjudged her.

249
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,040
Demon Zi has good intentions,

250
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,120
and even has spiritual power in her body.

251
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,160
She shouldn't be a demon.

252
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:19,759
Councilor, Senior,

253
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:22,439
do you know the origin of her?

254
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,720
Well...

255
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,160
Councilor.

256
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:27,279
Demon Zi is scheming.

257
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,160
She must have said something
to confuse Master.

258
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,720
If we don't kill her,

259
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,600
maybe next time
she'll keep playing tricks.

260
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,600
Ting Xue.

261
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,399
I am not ignorant

262
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,000
of your origin.

263
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,959
If it wasn't for Chong Zi,

264
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,720
how could you stay in the immortal sect

265
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,519
and have Miss Zhuo as your master?

266
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,959
Qin Ke!

267
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,800
Now is not the time to talk about this.

268
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,360
Master.

269
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,879
I don't say it, but it doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

270
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,839
Sage Chonghua.

271
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,279
Chong Zi is not from the Demon World.

272
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,120
And she's closely related

273
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,720
to the Immortal World.

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,759
Qin Ke.

275
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:58,959
Shut up!

276
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,319
I just think

277
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,639
Sage Chonghua should know about
the origin of Demon Zi.

278
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,399
There is no end to war

279
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,560
between the immortal sect
and the Demon World.

280
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,199
It's only a matter of time

281
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,639
before he meets Demon Zi again.

282
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:10,040
Knowing the origin of Demon Zi

283
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,439
can help Sage Chonghua

284
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,759
to subdue her,

285
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,560
isn't it?

286
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,720
Besides,

287
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,720
none of us should forget

288
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:22,480
what happened in the past.

289
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,360
You can hide it for a while,

290
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,279
but not for a lifetime.

291
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,439
I spoke out of turn.

292
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,680
I'm going to receive the punishment.

293
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,040
(I am not ignorant of your origin.)

294
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,879
(If it wasn't for Chong Zi,)

295
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,600
(how could you stay in the immortal sect)

296
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,279
(and have Miss Zhuo as your master?)

297
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,160
Do you know

298
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,920
Demon Zi?

299
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,560
I do.

300
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,439
Demon Zi and I

301
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,800
are old acquaintances.

302
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,240
We met you in the Mortal World.

303
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,759
But you finally chose me as your disciple.

304
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,040
Demon Zi held a grudge.

305
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,399
After she learned that Miss Zhuo
was in love with you,

306
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,920
she even killed her.

307
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,879
By then,

308
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,439
the two of you were going to get married,

309
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,399
I even regarded Miss Zhuo as
your wife.

310
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,360
She was my half master.

311
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,199
But Demon Zi killed her.

312
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,319
Master.

313
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,639
To avenge

314
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Miss Zhuo,

315
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,079
you should kill her.

316
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:33,759
Master.

317
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,000
Kill her.

318
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,319
I admit that

319
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,160
I admired you before.

320
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,439
But now that I understand your feelings,

321
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,959
I will definitely not pester you.

322
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,360
What's more,

323
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,240
I can't wrong myself.

324
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,079
Now

325
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,079
I just think of you

326
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:52,319
as a very important friend.

327
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
I can't watch you go on like this.

328
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,360
Seriously?

329
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,319
What Ting Xue said was true.

330
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,120
Back then,

331
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,280
Demon Zi and Ting Xue

332
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,120
came here together
to worship you as their master.

333
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:11,520
She wasn't called Demon Zi

334
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,280
at that time.

335
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,439
But she was

336
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,439
stubborn and had a lot of bad deeds,

337
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,280
contacting the demons,

338
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,280
stealing the demon sword
and the Tianmo Token.

339
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,159
She also murdered Zhuo Yunji

340
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,919
and killed her fellow disciples.

341
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,640
In the end, she was expelled by you.

342
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,360
With a grudge in her heart,

343
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,480
she defected to the Demon King.

344
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,400
Yes.

345
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Exactly.

346
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,720
That being said,

347
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,120
it's all my fault.

348
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,199
The lack of strict discipline
is the master's fault.

349
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,559
If I knew that she was born
with evil breath,

350
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,439
I should have saved her
and helped her.

351
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,520
Why did I leave her alone?

352
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
I cannot escape the blame

353
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,039
for her becoming a demon.

354
00:17:58,199 --> 00:17:59,679
No wonder she has deep resentment

355
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,799
every time she sees me.

356
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,439
The next time I see her,

357
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,280
I will persuade her to do good turns

358
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,760
to make up for my mistakes back then.

359
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:14,079
The Immortal World is supposed
to save people.

360
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,880
To save a life is to save a world.

361
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:20,000
The same is true for Demon Zi.

362
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,679
(I didn't expect Chong Zi)

363
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,919
(to have such a deep influence on him)

364
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,079
(that even Tears of Phoenix
doesn't work.)

365
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,120
Young Master.

366
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:08,079
You brought me back from the East Sea?

367
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,159
There were so many immortals on the shore.

368
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,120
Hard work for you.

369
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,600
If you are worried about

370
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,919
your spells,

371
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,600
you can rest assured.

372
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,120
What did you do?

373
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,000
Repairing the Tianhe Gate

374
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,079
consumed your remaining power.

375
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,880
I made it up for you

376
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,240
with my own.

377
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,120
You don't have to do so much for me.

378
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,120
I can't give you what you really want.

379
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,439
So, Young Master,

380
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,159
don't say that again.

381
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
Apart from these,

382
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:45,839
I can give you

383
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,199
everything else.

384
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,319
Young Master.

385
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,439
Where are you going?

386
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,760
Don't worry.

387
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,000
I just want to go for a walk
in the Mortal World.

388
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:38,600
Waiter.

389
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:39,959
One piece of roast chicken,

390
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,919
one piece of pig elbow,

391
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,280
and two jugs of good wine.

392
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,000
Sure, hold on.

393
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,600
Your hairpin looks so good.

394
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,600
You mean this one?

395
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,559
He worked

396
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:57,839
day and night for half a month

397
00:20:58,439 --> 00:20:59,240
just to

398
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,240
buy me this hairpin.

399
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,760
It's nothing expensive.

400
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:04,959
But when I saw it at the time,

401
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,720
I thought you would look good in it.

402
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,640
So

403
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,319
I had to buy it for you no matter what.

404
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,760
Although the lives of mortals

405
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,959
are stable,

406
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,000
they need money to do everything.

407
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm so anxious.

408
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,000
What? Is that Demon Zi?

409
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,679
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

410
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,159
Ladies and gentlemen.

411
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,480
Two jugs of good wine for you.

412
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,559
- Okay.
- Good appetite.

413
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,319
Here.

414
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,880
Take your time.

415
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,159
Miss Chong Zi.

416
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:39,880
Cheers.

417
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,799
Cheers.

418
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,880
Sir.

419
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,120
The wine

420
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,120
doesn't taste good at all.

421
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:52,280
Sorry, sir.

422
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,319
I'll check it out for you.

423
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,120
After all, it cannot be compared
with the past.

424
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,640
But we are entertaining Queen...

425
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,520
Miss Chong Zi.

426
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:04,319
Xichun Restaurant's wine

427
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,000
is the best.

428
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
It's just a bit far.

429
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,000
But it won't take long

430
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,039
for me to go get it.

431
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,280
I will go with you.

432
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,120
Great.

433
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:13,880
We haven't had

434
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,520
a good drink for a long time.

435
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,919
We can benefit from
Miss Chong Zi's coming today.

436
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:34,159
Queen Zi doesn't seem to be happy.

437
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,159
How could she be happy?

438
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,520
As a girl,

439
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,199
she has experienced so much.

440
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,360
If it were someone else,

441
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,039
they might not be able to
hold on long ago.

442
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,360
After all, she's become like this

443
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,880
for the one she loved.

444
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,640
- Go.
- Come on.

445
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:02,919
Elder, it's them.

446
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:03,839
It was the two of them

447
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,679
who were with Demon Zi just now.

448
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,839
They are certainly bad people.

449
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,039
Jinchi.

450
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,480
He harmed countless disciples of my sect,

451
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,640
and even became a demon.

452
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,839
We have to exterminate them.

453
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:16,520
We are ordinary people now,

454
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,319
and just want to live a stable life.

455
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,640
Ordinary people?

456
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,199
A stable life?

457
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:23,839
Jinchi.

458
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,039
Have you ever forgotten that

459
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,159
those immortal disciples

460
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,439
and ordinary people who died

461
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,159
also had families,

462
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,400
as well as people

463
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,000
they wanted to protect?

464
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,120
Hate begets hate.

465
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,480
In the end,

466
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,439
here comes retribution.

467
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,159
Darling.

468
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,199
Are you afraid?

469
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,159
No.

470
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
It's a pity that

471
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,439
we still couldn't drink the wine

472
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,559
of Xichun Restaurant

473
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,480
in the end.

474
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,839
(A person's eyes cannot lie.)

475
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,679
In addition to love and reluctance

476
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,959
in his eyes,

477
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
(there are deeper emotions.)

478
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,679
They were killed by those
of the Kunlun Sect.

479
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,839
If you feel upset,

480
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:00,880
I can kill them.

481
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,679
No need.

482
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,360
Even if I kill everyone in Kunlun,

483
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,880
the dead will never come back.

484
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,400
Zhenzhu.

485
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,039
Chengfeng.

486
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,799
Uncle.

487
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,319
Shuixian.

488
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,959
Lady Bai.

489
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,799
It won't happen again in the future.

490
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,079
You won't lose anyone.

491
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,000
I promise.

492
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,159
From the moment I chose
to become Demon Zi,

493
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,319
I knew that

494
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,159
I would lose everything.

495
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,679
Tian Zhixie.

496
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,760
Even you

497
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,959
will leave me one day,

498
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
won't you?

499
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,799
Young Master.

500
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,760
Tian Zhixie.

501
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,319
Didn't you say

502
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,039
you would do anything for me?

503
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,039
I want you to promise me

504
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,039
that you will never leave me,

505
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,959
let alone die.

506
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:17,520
I promise.

507
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:21,159
You can even give up
the great cause in your heart,

508
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,439
and I don't need to take revenge.

509
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,120
After all, what you like

510
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:33,120
is my identity as Demon Zi.

511
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:34,679
I promise you that

512
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,079
as long as you want,

513
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,280
I will let go of everything.

514
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,000
Let's travel through the six worlds

515
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,039
without being controlled by anyone.

516
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,520
That day,

517
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,919
Luo Yinfan said the same.

518
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,919
(I know)

519
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,559
(everything started because of Luo Yinfan.)

520
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,400
(His position in your heart)

521
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,439
(is something I can never replace.)

522
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,679
(Even if you can't be together,)

523
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,839
(I can't just watch him)

524
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,679
(hurt you again.)

525
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,480
(Let me be your Senior Mu)

526
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:02,640
(for one last time.)

527
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:29,880
Senior Qin.

528
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,120
Excuse me.

529
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,360
What's up?

530
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:35,959
Tian Zhixie, it's you.

531
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,319
I don't mean anything else.

532
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,760
I came to you for Chong Zi.

533
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,880
What happened to Chong Zi?

534
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:42,159
She's in a bad condition.

535
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,480
Let me ask you.

536
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,679
What happened to Luo Yinfan?

537
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,439
Why did he forget about Chong Zi?

538
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,319
Do you want to see Chong Zi

539
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,839
feel sad all the time because of this?

540
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,559
Councilor and my master

541
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,679
cast a spell on Supervisor.

542
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,240
He doesn't remember anything

543
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,760
about Chong Zi.

544
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,600
Could it be

545
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,880
Tears of Phoenix?

546
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,559
This is Nanhua's secret.

547
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,079
We were ordered

548
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
not to say a word to Sage Chonghua.

549
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:16,799
Didn't you either?

550
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,240
I tried to tell Sage Chonghua the truth.

551
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,679
But Tears of Phoenix has no antidote.

552
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,280
If I were the only one to tell him that,

553
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:26,120
he wouldn't believe it at all.

554
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,480
It has an antidote.

555
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,520
I know a way.

556
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,679
It's a pity that...

557
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,319
What's the way?

558
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,880
Phoenix blood.

559
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,280
It's a pity that this ancient beast

560
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,880
has long since disappeared.

561
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,679
The last time it appeared
was in Buzhou Mountain.

562
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,360
But that was five hundred years ago.

563
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,640
Even so,

564
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,520
I won't make Luo Yinfan

565
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,640
have an easy time.

566
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,280
(Chonghua Palace)

567
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,679
Chong.

568
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,079
No.

569
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,400
Demon Zi.

570
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,880
Chong Zi.

571
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,799
Master.

572
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm back.

573
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,480
Why are you back?

574
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,079
Master.

575
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,880
You brought me here.

576
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:58,199
This is my home.

577
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,079
Why can't I

578
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,240
go back?

579
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,000
Demon Zi.

580
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,640
I know that

581
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:05,240
you used to be my disciple.

582
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,360
It is my fault for

583
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,640
not keeping you under strict watch

584
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,199
and leading you astray.

585
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:12,439
If you sincerely repent

586
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,559
and come back to redeem your sins,

587
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,240
maybe

588
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:18,400
I will let you stay in Chonghua Palace.

589
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,600
Master.

590
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,520
What did I do wrong?

591
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,480
Do you still remember Starlight?

592
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,400
This is what you hand picked for me.

593
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,079
You told me to

594
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,760
care about all beings in the world

595
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,520
like a star in the sky.

596
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,799
I only hope that you will not
belittle yourself in the future,

597
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,199
and care about all living beings,

598
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,000
just like the stars in the sky.

599
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,480
The stick will be called

600
00:31:52,959 --> 00:31:53,799
Starlight.

601
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,439
But I can't be a star.

602
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,799
I can only be the dust under your feet.

603
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,000
Since you insist on being my enemy,

604
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,240
why did you accept me as your disciple?

605
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,319
I once sincerely accepted you as a disciple.

606
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,520
But what did you do?

607
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,159
Zhubo?

608
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:23,520
What?

609
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,600
Are you going to kill me with it again?

610
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,199
Kill you?

611
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,039
When did I kill you?

612
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:34,199
Yes, you've forgotten it all.

613
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,199
When I came to Nanhua for the first time,

614
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,439
everyone hid from me

615
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,039
and looked down on me.

616
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,919
But you accepted me.

617
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,480
You took me to Xichun Restaurant.

618
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:47,600
You taught me never to kill.

619
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,600
You personally taught me every move.

620
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,240
Just because I was born with evil breath,

621
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,439
I had to die.

622
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,720
I was killed by the sword Zhubo

623
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,240
of my beloved master.

624
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
The second time,

625
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,319
you cherished me very much,

626
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,039
but you were afraid that
I would repeat the same mistakes.

627
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,839
Fortunately, we were telepathic.

628
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,480
I got what you meant.

629
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,919
Someone accused me of killing Miss Zhuo.

630
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,959
You put me in the Ice Prison.

631
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:32,600
I believed in you.

632
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,480
But I was fully tortured there.

633
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,760
If Wang Yue hadn't restored my memory,

634
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,480
I would have died there long ago.

635
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,520
You asked me what I did?

636
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,760
I never did

637
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,760
everything you said.

638
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,159
Demon Zi.

639
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,079
Stop fooling me.

640
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,120
You really don't remember anything.

641
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,159
Who made you like this?

642
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:58,959
Min Yunzhong

643
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:00,120
or Yu Du?

644
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,839
I don't understand what you mean.

645
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,039
If Chong Zi is really

646
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,640
as heinous as you said,

647
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,800
why did you let her enter the sect twice,

648
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,679
and why did you insist on
accepting her as a disciple?

649
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,599
Why did Min Yunzhong pursue her

650
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,959
so hard to kill her?

651
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,280
Luo Yinfan.

652
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,720
Think about it yourself.

653
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:17,599
You are not Chong Zi.

654
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:19,800
Who are you?

655
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:30,679
What?

656
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,399
Does your chest hurt?

657
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,119
Shall I remind you

658
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,119
how you got hit by Heart Poison?

659
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,560
Shut up.

660
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,320
Chong!

661
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,679
Remember me the way I am now.

662
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,639
Luo Yinfan.

663
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,040
If you feel sad for the slightest bit,

664
00:35:04,399 --> 00:35:05,720
remember your mood now

665
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,720
the next time you take actions.

666
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,000
It's you.

667
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,840
Min Yunzhong insists on
erasing your memory,

668
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,560
so he will never let you recall it again.

669
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,639
But Luo Yinfan,

670
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,879
you hesitated.

671
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,760
You still love her,

672
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,919
then

673
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,159
and now.

674
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,399
It's really hard to

675
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,560
detoxify Tears of Phoenix.

676
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,280
I tried my best

677
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,679
to open only one crack.

678
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:30,919
But

679
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,599
it's enough.

680
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:40,800
Luo Yinfan.

681
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,639
Did you remember something?

682
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,879
Did you?

683
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:51,959
You've been her master
for two lifetimes.

684
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,919
Don't fail her again.

685
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,720
I am so envious

686
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,639
that you have

687
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,879
a good disciple.

688
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,320
Chong Zi.

689
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,399
That's all

690
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,599
I can do for you.

691
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,520
(Young Master.)

692
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,119
(Young Master.)

693
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,560
Tian Zhixie.

694
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,599
You are back.

695
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
(I'm back.)

696
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:15,199
Where are you?

697
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:16,199
(Young Master.)

698
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,800
(Here I am.)

699
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,919
Where have you been?

700
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:29,159
I've always been by your side.

701
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:32,320
Young Master.

702
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,320
Young Master, take care.

703
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:36,359
Although Shuiyue City

704
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,320
is your temporary shelter,

705
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,240
it is not suitable for staying
for a long time.

706
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,199
You are seriously injured

707
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,119
and have to take good care of yourself.

708
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,439
Tian Zhixie.

709
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,959
What are you talking about?

710
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,119
Young Master.

711
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,879
My greatest wish in this life

712
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:53,480
is to see you

713
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,520
take Demon King Ni Lun's place

714
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,040
and reign over the six worlds.

715
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,959
But your painful appearance

716
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,000
is not what I want.

717
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,119
I was so selfish

718
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,040
that I forced you into this situation.

719
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,800
Chongzi.

720
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,919
Sorry.

721
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:22,840
I can't accompany you to the end.

722
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:24,359
Tian Zhixie.

723
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:33,879
Why are you here?

724
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,320
Tian Zhixie died.

725
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,240
What?

726
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,599
No way.

727
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,520
No way.

728
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
I don't believe it.

729
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
Just now,

730
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,480
I felt his breath disappear.

731
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:57,080
Who did it?

732
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,959
I'm going to kill him.

733
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,639
Luo Yinfan.

734
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,639
(But Luo Yinfan,)

735
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,760
(you still love her,)

736
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,919
(then)

737
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,480
(and now.)

738
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:24,520
Now that all the sects
have joined forces,

739
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,679
things are going on smoothly.

740
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,199
Yinfan.

741
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,119
What exactly did I forget?

742
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,280
What is the relationship

743
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,119
between me and Chong Zi?

744
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:47,679
You don't need to

745
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:49,399
know about this.

746
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,720
I have to know.

747
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:54,879
Yinfan.

748
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,240
We are afraid that you can't bear it

749
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:58,240
after you know the whole story.

750
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,919
I know what you are afraid of.

751
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,159
Whenever I think of her,

752
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,399
my heart aches.

753
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,720
Tian Zhixie told me that

754
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,639
I was once hit by Heart Poison.

755
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,080
I didn't believe it.

756
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,320
Because only those in love

757
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,679
would be poisoned.

758
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,800
Tell me

759
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,720
what happened

760
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,119
between me and Chong Zi before.

761
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,679
Did I...

762
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:25,560
No.

763
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,280
Not before,

764
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:33,159
nor in the future.

765
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,639
Even if you don't say anything,

766
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,199
someone will tell me.

767
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,760
Yinfan.

768
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,000
Sage Chonghua.

769
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,359
Demon Zi went on her killing spree
in the Kunlun Sect today,

770
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,399
and said that

771
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,199
if she can't come to Nanhua Mountain
to seek revenge,

772
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:52,359
she will kill every disciple
of the Kunlun Sect.
