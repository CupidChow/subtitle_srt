=The Journey of Chongzi=
(Adapted from "The Journey of Chongzi" by Shu Ke)

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,000
=Episode 40=

28
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,820
Let's put an end to it

29
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,100
after we separate today.

30
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,621
When I see you next time,

31
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:47,301
we'll be on the battlefield.

32
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:49,981
Don't worry.

33
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,140
I won't show you any mercy.

34
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,500
I think you should also...

35
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:58,140
Okay.

36
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:02,780
I'll do whatever you want,

37
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:05,981
and you can do whatever you want,

38
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,621
whether to start a war

39
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,180
or to destroy the world.

40
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:14,020
But at this moment,

41
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:20,020
I beg you to let go of your obsession,

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,981
and be my Chong Zi

43
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:29,261
just for one day.

44
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,100
Can you do it?

45
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:44,300
Okay.

46
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,061
It's so quiet.

47
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,180
The world is so quiet

48
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:21,341
that it seems like
there had never been any strife.

49
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,981
Chong.

50
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,421
Do you still remember

51
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,380
that you once told me

52
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:36,100
we would protect lives together

53
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:38,300
- And I would protect you.
- and you would protect me?

54
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,020
Does that

55
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:45,020
still count?

56
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,580
I also want it to count,

57
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,901
but the world doesn't allow it.

58
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:55,061
If there is no place for me in this world,

59
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,781
then I'll...

60
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,940
You'll do what?

61
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:03,901
I'll destroy the old world

62
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,061
and create a new one.

63
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,941
Chong.

64
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,941
Can you not leave?

65
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,661
Can I call you Master one last time?

66
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,140
You will always be my Chong.

67
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,260
(Patriarch's Hall)

68
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,140
Master.

69
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,101
I've mastered the Mirror Heart Skill

70
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,101
according to the ancient book,

71
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:45,700
but why can't I

72
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,260
use it?

73
00:06:48,061 --> 00:06:49,341
Is it true that the Mirror Heart Skill

74
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,541
can never be acquired?

75
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,381
It's the way to the God World.

76
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,260
If you're not a god,

77
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:57,061
even if our master is here,

78
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,260
nothing can be changed.

79
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,941
Gods don't have emotions and desires.

80
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,300
If you want to become a god,

81
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:07,061
you have to let go of everything,

82
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:09,460
but the only thing

83
00:07:09,901 --> 00:07:11,580
you can't let go of is love.

84
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:13,420
Is there no way to acquire

85
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,221
the Mirror Heart Skill?

86
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:17,980
I'm afraid

87
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,541
there is no way in your case.

88
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,221
Then I'll live with her

89
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,980
and die with her.

90
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:26,221
Everyone.

91
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,980
The war is approaching.

92
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,661
All the immortal sects

93
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:31,740
should put aside our old grudges

94
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,501
to fight against the demons together.

95
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:34,821
We're faced with powerful enemies.

96
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,300
There is no time for hesitation.

97
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:40,061
The Qinghua Sect will do the best
to fight against the demons.

98
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,460
Sir, please

99
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:43,700
keep on top of this war.

100
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,101
The immortal sects have an advantage
in the war with the demons.

101
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:49,180
Councilor Sage will plan for it.

102
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,180
Well,

103
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,260
do you want to deal with

104
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,980
the Celestial Demon on your own?

105
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,661
Demon Zi has the Tianmo Token,

106
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,420
which will summon
the demons from the Void.

107
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,580
I'm afraid

108
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:00,300
you're no match for them on your own.

109
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:02,621
I know what to do.

110
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:07,180
Once the demons from the Void
break through the Tongtian Portal,

111
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,700
the six worlds will face
an inevitable catastrophe.

112
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,101
I'm afraid even Supervisor Sage

113
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,980
won't be able to turn the tide at that time.

114
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,621
Don't worry.

115
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:19,781
I've ordered the disciples
of Nanhua and Tianshan

116
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:22,541
to seal and reinforce the Heavenly Lake

117
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:25,860
with Resting Soil and Colorful Stones.

118
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,901
Then the demons from the Void
won't be able

119
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,941
to enter the Immortal World
through that portal.

120
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:33,260
Since the road has been sealed
with Resting Soil,

121
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,901
there is no way for the demons to break in.

122
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,981
Everything is interrelated
and mutually restrained.

123
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,901
The demons' magical power
doesn't work on Resting Soil.

124
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:43,140
Sage Min, you're far-sighted indeed.

125
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,221
What you did will surely protect
all the immortal sects.

126
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,460
I am

127
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,700
half relieved now.

128
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:48,940
In that case,

129
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,341
as long as we prepare it well
in the Mortal World,

130
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,741
we'll be able to kill the Celestial Demon.

131
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,120
(Xichun Restaurant)

132
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,741
Sir.

133
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,020
How dare you leave the house

134
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,060
at this time?

135
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,101
I heard that tomorrow will be
the catastrophe of the six worlds.

136
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,341
You two should find a place
to take refuge before it's too late.

137
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,901
When the immortals
and the demons start a war,

138
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,700
it's always us mortals who suffer.

139
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:22,861
Do you still have anything to eat?

140
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:25,421
We're closing now.

141
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:26,620
You're a regular customer.

142
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,820
If you're really hungry,

143
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,260
you can go to the kitchen
and get it for yourself.

144
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,620
There should be
one last plate of peanuts.

145
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:33,221
I have to take refuge now.

146
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,940
Sir.

147
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,181
Is Chong Zi

148
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,620
really gonna attack the immortal sects?

149
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,820
Don't worry.

150
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:00,981
She won't.

151
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:04,341
The Fusheng Sect will fight
to protect the Mortal World,

152
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,140
but I owe my life

153
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,901
to Chong Zi.

154
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:11,700
If the time comes
when I really have to choose,

155
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,020
I'll risk my life

156
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:16,421
to stop her.

157
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:19,140
Because that would be

158
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,020
what she used to want to see the most.

159
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:24,820
When it comes to that moment,

160
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,020
she would rather sacrifice herself.

161
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,380
- Celestial Demon.
- Celestial Demon.

162
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,140
- Celestial Demon.
- Celestial Demon.

163
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:42,341
- Celestial Demon.
- Celestial Demon.

164
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:53,380
All demons, hear my order.

165
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:56,101
The Heavenly Lake is open,
and all devils shall come out

166
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,341
and follow me
to attack the Immortal World.

167
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:00,940
We won't stop

168
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:02,221
until we die.

169
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,700
I want the Immortal World

170
00:11:07,421 --> 00:11:08,541
to no longer exist.

171
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:11,020
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

172
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:13,541
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

173
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,661
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

174
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:29,341
What's happening?

175
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,700
Lord, look.

176
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,460
Get down to the undersea passage

177
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:36,380
and guard the Colorful Stones
and the Resting Soil.

178
00:11:37,661 --> 00:11:38,661
It's too late.

179
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:48,981
Stop him!

180
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:54,101
Notify the immortal sects

181
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,060
that the Heavenly Lake is lost.

182
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,981
Yes.

183
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:11,341
Are you all right, son?

184
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,460
Are you all right?

185
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,260
I'm fine.

186
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:15,140
I'm all right. Thank you.

187
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:16,060
Hurry.

188
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:27,661
Mr. Hai Sheng.

189
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,700
Something happened to Nanhua.

190
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,861
I have to go back and check it out.

191
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,221
I'll leave this place to you.

192
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,981

Stop it.

245
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,140
No way.

246
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:01,741
Tianshan's Heavenly Lake is lost.

247
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,060
There will only be more and more demons.

248
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,181
Demon Zi has gone up
to the Tongtian Portal.

249
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:08,580
We can't let other demons

250
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:10,060
get near the Six-world Monument.

251
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,901
Where is Wang Yue?

252
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,661
Did he set up an ambush
at the Six-world Monument?

253
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:19,700
Yinfan is there alone. Doesn't it mean...

254
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,221
Master.

255
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:22,341
I'll go with you.

256
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,140
Ke.

257
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,101
Wang Yue and Demon Zi came prepared.

258
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,140
What's more,

259
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,020
I read the celestial signs
a few days ago. It wasn't good.

260
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:33,260
It was even worse than the last battle
between the immortals and the demons.

261
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,221
I'm afraid

262
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,221
today is a catastrophe of the six worlds.

263
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,060
Then I can't just sit back and watch.

264
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,781
Ke, don't you understand?

265
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,741
You're no longer a disciple of Nanhua.

266
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:43,580
It's not your responsibility
to go up there with us.

267
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,060
If you go with us,

268
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,260
you might not be able to come back.

269
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,301
This time,

270
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,620
I'm not doing it for the immortal sects

271
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,060
or Chong Zi.

272
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,861
I'm doing it for the people
of the Immortal World.

273
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,580
Please let me go with you
to the Six-world Monument.

274
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:14,661
My presentiment

275
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:16,140
came true.

276
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:18,140
Even if

277
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,741
Celestial King Yunqiu
comes back alive now,

278
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,541
he can't stop
the Six-world Monument from falling.

279
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:25,020
I failed

280
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,700
to protect Nanhua
that has existed for ten thousand years.

281
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,741
Chong Zi made it.

282
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,060
You could have stopped her.

283
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:37,901
Why did you let her repeat her mistakes?

284
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,741
I never thought
she is doing anything wrong!

285
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,060
It's your fault.

286
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,861
Qin Ke.

287
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:44,221
You're not like me.

288
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:45,741
There are things you can't let go of.

289
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:46,661
But I

290
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,741
don't care about anything else

291
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,661
but her.

292
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:01,781
The Six-world Monument is broken.

293
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,580
The six worlds will fall into
demonic possession in an instant.

294
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,581
Is there nothing we can do?

295
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:24,380
(Gods don't have emotions and desires.)

296
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:26,941
If you want to become a god,

297
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,581
you have to let go of everything,

298
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,980
but the only thing

299
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,941
you can't let go of is love.

300
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,860
Is there no way to acquire

301
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:36,701
the Mirror Heart Skill?

302
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,500
I'm afraid

303
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,140
there is no way in your case.

304
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:43,260
I can't use the Mirror Heart Skill

305
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,740
because there is love in me.

306
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,461
But it's not easy for me

307
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,781
to stop loving you.

308
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:54,781
We've reached a stalemate.

309
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,901
But how could I not know

310
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:01,941
the key to breaking the deadlock

311
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,461
is not about you,

312
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,140
but me?

313
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,140
Even if you kill me now,

314
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:12,901
nothing will be changed.

315

Luo Yinfan.

316
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,301
What are you doing?

317
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:06,980
It has nothing to do with you.

318
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,980
This is my own decision.

319
00:19:19,821 --> 00:19:20,661
Chong.

320
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:22,901
Don't be afraid.

321
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:27,901

00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,220
Hao!

337
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:44,220
Hao.

338
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,740
Come home with me.

339
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:53,661
Let's go home.

340
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,980
Father.

341
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Let's go home.

342
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:02,781
Father.

343
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,421
Father!

344
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,220
Father!

345
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:09,941
Father!

346
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,740
Father!

347
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:37,901
(What just happened?)

348
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:39,581
(Where is Master?)

349
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:44,701
(What's going on?)

350
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,901
What did I just see?

351
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:51,380
Why is there no one here?

352
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,461
Chong.

353
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,461
Master.

354
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,821
You're really here.

355
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,140
Master.

356
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:05,500
Are you all right?

357
00:23:05,821 --> 00:23:06,701
I'm fine.

358
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:07,980
Chong.

359
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,461
Don't worry about me.

360
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,620
But, Master,

361
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,181
why am I here in Chonghua Palace?

362
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,821
This is the Realm of Void.

363
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,620
The Realm of Void?

364
00:23:21,181 --> 00:23:22,941
This is the world
inside the Six-world Monument.

365
00:23:23,421 --> 00:23:24,821
What you just saw

366
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:27,581
is the echo of your obsession.

367
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,340
Echo?

368
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,941
You long for the six worlds
without the immortal sects,

369
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:36,260
but the war between immortals
and demons has existed forever.

370
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,541
The power of the immortal sects is needed

371
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,181
to check and control the demons.

372
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,301
We can't let one party dominate the world.

373
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:44,260
Without you,

374
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,740
there would be no Demon Palace of Jiuyou,

375
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,980
but there would still be
a new Celestial Demon.

376
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,821
Without me, there would be no Nanhua,

377
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,901
but there would still be
new immortal sects.

378
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:54,821
But the mortals

379
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,340
are the most innocent.

380
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:01,301
You've seen the world
after the fall of the Six-world Monument.

381
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,181
I believe it's not what you want to see.

382
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,340
But the Six-world Monument has fallen.

383
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:08,461
It can't be undone.

384
00:24:18,461 --> 00:24:19,860
What have I done?

385
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:40,260
Yu Du.

386
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:42,061
I'll leave Nanhua to you.

387
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,821
Mr. Min!

388
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,020
Although I'm not

389
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,500
as capable as the Celestial King Yunqiu,

390
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,380
I still remember the faith

391
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,661
he taught me.

392
00:25:42,181 --> 00:25:43,581
Yu Du.

393
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:50,020
You must protect Nanhua well!

394
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,181
Councilor Sage!

395
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,421
Mr. Min.

396
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,220
Mr. Min.

397
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,980
It's close.

398
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:21,260
Qin Ke!

399
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:21,941
No!

400
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,740
Ke!

401
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:23,941
What are you going to do?

402
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,461
I'll finish

403
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:27,421
Councilor Sage's work!

404
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,781
Ke!

405
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,461
Ke!

406
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:40,701
What are you doing?

407
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:54,500
(Ugly girl.)

408
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:56,421
(I haven't given up.)

409
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,781
(Ever since I joined Nanhua with you,)

410
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,581
(I've been dreaming)

411
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,461
(that I could protect you one day.)

412
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,020
(But I didn't pay attention
to how you really felt.)

413
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:06,860
(I've missed so much.)

414
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,781
(If I had known
it would end up with nothing,)

415
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:10,581
(I would rather
spend those years with you.)

416
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:12,860
(I failed to protect the world,)

417
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,061
(and I failed to protect you.)

418
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,541
(But I hope you can find your way back.)

419
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:18,140
(Don't hurt others,)

420
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:20,461
(and don't hurt yourself.)

421
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,181
Qin Ke!

422
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:56,100
Who said that it can't be undone?

423
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,461
Detach from external appearances
for meditation,

424
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,860
and maintain inner calmness for stability.

425
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,340
When detached from external appearances,

426
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,620
the mind remains calm.

427
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,541
Whether it's love,

428
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,901
hate,

429
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,301
pain,

430
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,020
or regret,

431
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:12,541
when people's wills come together,

432
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,500
they can overcome even fate.

433
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,380
Master.

434
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:17,901
I don't understand.

435
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:19,901
What can I do

436
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:21,980
to stop the fall
of the Six-world Monument?

437
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:27,100
Master.

438
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:30,740
Chong.

439
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,220
Don't you understand?

440
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,781
I don't exist anymore.

441
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:39,821
I had broken my meridians

442
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:42,220
before you thrust the sword into me.

443
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:43,701
So,

444
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:45,100
I don't blame you.

445
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:48,421
Chong.

446
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:52,461
Thank you.

447
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:55,860
I acquired the Mirror Heart Skill

505
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:17,661
You planned this.

506
00:32:18,301 --> 00:32:20,901
You asked Yin Xinmo to secretly attack
the Heavenly Lake with the Resting Soil

507
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,301
just to leave the Resting Soil
in the Heavenly Lake.

508
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:27,781
No.

509
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:30,140
The Resting Soil
is from the Realm of Void.

510
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,821
Only the people there can control it.

511
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,541
The Realm of Void has been sealed,

512
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,260
but you can control the Resting Soil.

513
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,541
Are you

514
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,781
the Demon of Void?

515
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,620
Does it matter

516
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:46,620
who I am?

517
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:48,100
I see.

518
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:50,980
No wonder I couldn't tell
where you came from.

519
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:55,181
Turns out you don't belong to
any demon tribe or immortal sect.

520
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:58,500
Demon Zi.

521
00:32:59,941 --> 00:33:01,980
Don't forget why you're here.

522
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,941
You can overthrow

523
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,340
the six worlds with your power alone.

524
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:08,301
Why did you use me to do it?

525
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:11,380
Because the Realm of Void was sealed
tens of thousands of years ago.

526
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,581
I had to use an external force

527
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:16,620
to open the tunnel,

528
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:18,781
and you were the perfect person to do it.

529
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,020
With the help of Tianmo Token
and Resting Soil,

530
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,901
the immortals and demons
will no longer be separated.

531
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,661
Isn't that a good thing?

532
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,941
Chong Zi.

533
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:38,260
What's the point of repeating

534
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:40,260
the cycle of birth and death?

535
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,061
Instead of destroying the world
and regenerating it,

536
00:33:43,901 --> 00:33:45,860
why not make the world a better place?

537
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,541
Wang Yue, stop now.

538
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,421
I won't let your plot succeed.

539
00:33:58,421 --> 00:33:59,661
Stop?

540
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:01,500
That won't happen.

541
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,980
Do you think you've won?

542
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:28,140
Sage Tianji.

543
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,661
Wang Yue has been sealed.

544
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,421
The Resting Soil has also been returned
to the Heavenly Lake.

545
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:33,701
There is one more thing.

546
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:39,580
I will destroy
the Tianmo Token in person.

547
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,741
From now on, there will be
no more blood relatives of Ni Lun

548
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:43,941
or demons from the Void.

549
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:00,421
Chong Zi.

550
00:35:01,261 --> 00:35:02,300
Go back to Nanhua.

551
00:35:06,661 --> 00:35:07,620
Young lady.

552
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,261
It's all over.

553
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:10,941
I'm glad you're still here,

554
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,780
and I'm also here.

555
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:13,540
Let me stay with you,

556
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,820
and let's protect
the world together, okay?

557
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,380
I also want to stay with you,

558
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,901
but I can't do it.

559
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:23,661
Now I'm

560
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,620
just like Uncle Wan.

561
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:27,901
The Sword of Ni Lun has been purified.

562
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,380
Master told me

563
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:36,780
that I should concern for
the lives in the world,

564
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,901
like the stars in the sky.

565
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:41,941
I can't fail him.

566
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,421
