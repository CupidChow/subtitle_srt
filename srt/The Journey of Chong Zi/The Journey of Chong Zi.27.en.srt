=The Journey of Chongzi=
(Adapted from "The Journey of Chongzi" by Shu Ke)

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,000
=Episode 27=

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,000
You were sent to the Ice Prison

29
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:43,640
because of her.

30
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:46,481
Why did you do this?

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,161
Don't ask me why I did this.

32
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,000
Do you know who you are?

33
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:52,721
I...

34
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:54,881
I’m Chong Zi.

35
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:57,000
You are,

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,280
but more than that.

37
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:02,640
Chongzi.

38
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:05,081
Some things should be returned to you.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,680
You will want to know.

40
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:21,321
- Kill her.
- Kill her.

41
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,920
In this way,

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,400
no one will dare to bully you again.

43
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,760
Nanhua cannot accept you.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,640
If you become an immortal,

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,760
you will become a disaster in the future.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,881
I want you.

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,161
From then on, you will take Chong
as your surname from Chonghua Palace,

48
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:38,840
and Zi from Zizhu Peak as your name,

49
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:40,161
your name will be Chong Zi.

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,000
Since Master protects the common people,

51
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:43,321
I will protect Master.

52
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:44,441
I won.

53
00:02:46,241 --> 00:02:47,081
Ugly girl.

54
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,000
Qin Ke from Chenzhou.

55
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:51,241
Greetings to Sage.

56
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,241
I am

57
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:54,480
Yan Zhenzhu,

58
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:55,801
the 361st generation disciple of Nanhua.

59
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,640
I'm kidding you.

60
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:58,360
It’s not being rude.

61
00:02:58,441 --> 00:02:59,161
Stop it.

62
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:00,560
I am not your young lady.

63
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,640
That being the case,

64
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,881
you might as well marry me

65
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:06,161
and discipline me for my father.

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,681
I just have one last question for you.

67
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,280
Does he know that

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,760
you like him so much?

69
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,601
Master, I don't want to leave you.

70
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:16,280
I only have Master in my heart.

71
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,881
But I'm just your master.

72
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:20,400
From now on,

73
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,081
watch your manner.

74
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:27,241
(If you really become a demon,)

75
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:28,881
(is it possible for you and your master)

76
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:30,640
(to coexist peacefully?)

77
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,120
Uncle.

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,241
(Don't let her)

79
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:41,161
(end up like me.)

80
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,000
Fortunately,

81
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,881
there is no afterlife.

82
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:00,801
I remembered.

83
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:02,801
I remembered

84
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,840
everything.

85
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
So

86
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:14,081
from the beginning,
you have been manipulating everything.

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,560
Exactly.

88
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,560
You have been using me
since the beginning.

89
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,361
You are using me too!

90
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:27,921
Back then, Demon King Ni Lun

91
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,481
and Celestial King Yunqiu
died together.

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
The right protector of Ni Lun,
the Dream Demon,

93
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,641
was seriously injured and died
in order to protect Ni Lun.

94
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,921
Before he died,

95
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:40,161
he passed on his demon power
to his daughter,

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
which is me.

97
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:48,881
I sneaked into Nanhua

98
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,201
to wait for an opportunity
to avenge my father.

99
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,840
Unfortunately, I am not strong enough.

100
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:56,881
Until your appearance,

101
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,960
I found that you
are born with evil breath.

102
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:02,080
At the beginning,

103
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,560
I really approached you to use your
evil breath to undo the Tianmo Token.

104
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,560
But later I treated you with sincerity.

105
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:14,441
It's all my fault that

106
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,161
you're in the situation you're in today.

107
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,201
You can hate me,

108
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,400
or you can be sad.

109
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,601
I dare not ask for your forgiveness.

110
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,761
But today

111
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,881
I have to rescue you.

112
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,960
Why are you all like this?

113
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:33,881
You have clearly hurt me

114
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,761
and used me,

115
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:38,400
but you pretend to be helpless

116
00:05:38,481 --> 00:05:40,120
and confident.

117
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,400
Chong Zi!

118
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,201
Master is like this.

119
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,161
So are you.

120
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
Chong Zi.

121
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,361
I didn’t mean to do this.

122
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,721
I was born to be the daughter
of the Dream Demon,

123
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,120
at the mercy of Wang Yue.

124
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,441
During the time in the immortal sect,

125
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:58,041
I got to know you and Chengfeng.

126
00:05:58,481 --> 00:06:01,481
How I wish
we had no identity distinction.

127
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,201
This time I failed you.

128
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,921
Let me take you away.

129
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
Go with us.

130
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,000
Where are we going?

131
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,761
We’ll take you home.

132
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:18,721
Home?

133
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:22,361
Because you are the blood relative
of the Demon King Ni Lun,

134
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,000
his daughter.

135
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,721
The Demon Palace

136
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,041
is your home.

137
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:32,441
Otherwise, where do you think

138
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,400
your evil breath comes from?

139
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,321
I am the next host of Demon Sword?

140
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:43,960
You must be lying.

141
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,840
How could I be the daughter of Ni Lun?

142
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,201
Watch out.

143
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
You are welcome.

144
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,520
I didn't intend to thank you.

145
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:22,560
That’s right.

146
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,520
It’s not necessary between us.

147
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,400
I need you to unlock
the Tianmo Token for me

148
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:31,840
and unify the six worlds.

149
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,441
You need me to protect you

150
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:34,721
and avenge you.

151
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,201
We just take what we need.

152
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,960
I will never go back with you.

153
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,481
If you want to stay

154
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,520
in this ice cave waiting for death,

155
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,641
I will not force you.

156
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,321
You have to be clear that

157
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:50,481
no one will treat you sincerely,

158
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:53,041
whether in the immortal sect
or in the Demon World.

159
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,840
Hold on.

160
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:03,520
Wan Jie really treated you well.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,960
But what’s the result?

162
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,400
Why are you looking at me like this?

163
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:10,721
Am I wrong?

164
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,520
The Demon King Wan Jie
was beyond redemption.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,161
Do you remember?

166
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,721
Even if you don't want
to find your origin,

167
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,520
don't you want to avenge Wan Jie?

168
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:26,041
Uncle.

169
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:28,800
Uncle.

170
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,441
And one more person.

171
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,080
Don't you want to go out and ask him

172
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:36,520
why he keeps putting you
in this situation

173
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,520
over and over again?

174
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:41,001
Your master

175
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:42,721
Luo Yinfan.

176
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,561
(Your master)

177
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:46,080
(Luo Yinfan.)

178
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:47,640
(Your master)

179
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:49,121
(Luo Yinfan.)

180
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Stop it.

181
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,481
Stop it!

182
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,320
Councilor, easy.

183
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,320
Yu Xuzi just said that there is something
wrong with the Ice Prison,

184
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,280
and he hopes for support.

185
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,320
- It may not necessarily be...
- It must be serious.

186
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,041
The Lord of Kunlun Sect has guarded
the Ice Prison for thousands of years.

187
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,361
When did you see him ask for help?

188
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,440
His letter this time must

189
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,241
have something to do with Nanhua.

190
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:25,440
Senior Yu Xuzi sent a letter
to ask for help.

191
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,880
I'm afraid there has been invaded.

192
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,241
No more delay.

193
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:30,801
Nanhua disciples

194
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:32,960
can’t be captured by the demons.

195
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:36,161
I will go with you.

196
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,801
Smart girl.

197
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,721
Please.

198
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:56,760
Yu Xuzi.

199
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,121
Never tell everyone that

200
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,721
you have guarded Kunlun
for thousands of years safely.

201
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
That's because

202
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:04,880
I don't like

203
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,001
this place.

204
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:41,840
- Zhenzhu.
- Leave me alone.

205
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:42,681
Leave.

206
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:00,320
Zhenzhu.

207
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,601
Zhenzhu.

208
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:12,280
This is...

209
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:15,200
This is my magic weapon.

210
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:18,921
It allows you to travel between Nanhua

211
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,001
and the Demon World.

212
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,161
You will need it.

213
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,681
Chong Zi.

214
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:34,801
It is my luck

215
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:37,121
to protect you.

216
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,121
Unfortunately...

217
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:43,361
Zhenzhu.

218
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:44,760
I can no longer

219
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
be with you.

220
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:53,161
I dare not

221
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,681
ask for your forgiveness.

222
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,840
If you have the chance,

223
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,200
apologize...

224
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:07,561
apologize...

225
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:08,921
apologize...

226
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,241
to

227
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,280
Chengfeng

228
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,481
for me.

229
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,561
Zhenzhu!

230
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:24,721
Zhenzhu.

231
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,721
I still want to call you Chongzi,

232
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,601
may I?

233
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,161
Sure.

234
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,840
Chongzi.

235
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,760
Zhenzhu.

236
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:46,280
Zhenzhu.

237
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,161
At least get out alive

238
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:52,921
if you want to have a chance

239
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,880
of delivering her word.

240
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:56,280
Let’s go.

241
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,320
I'm going to take her out with me.

242
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,001
There are no such rules
in the Demon World.

243
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:04,760
Let’s go.

244
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,241
Yinfan.

245
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Yinfan.

246
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:17,801
Stop, Yinfan.

247
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,241
Things haven't been figured out yet.

248
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,561
Where are you going?

249
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:22,481
Yinfan.

250
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:28,681
That devil has been locked
in the Ice Prison for so long,

251
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,481
what else can she do?

252
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,681
Qin Ke.

253
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,200
Go to check the demon sword
and Tianmo Token.

254
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,601
Yes.

255
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,481
No!

256
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,801
The Tianmo Token is gone.

257
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,121
Luo Yinfan came so fast.

258
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:35,080
Go catch up with him.

259
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,921
Show him how you are now.

260
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,560
♪It rains the whole night,
and a tear falls♪

261
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,601
Chong.

262
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,481
You lost weight.

263
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,560
♪I wander in the world day by day♪

264
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,041
You are injured.

265
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:28,880
Where is the injury?

266
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,481
Injured?

267
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,601
You locked me in the Ice Prison,

268
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,601
how could you not know
that I would be hurt?

269
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,440
It’s really cold there.

270
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,481
Every moment,

271
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,080
it seemed that countless knives

272
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,960
were scratching my bones,

273
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,880
and countless needles

274
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:54,561
were piercing my flesh.

275
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,001
I was hanging from an icicle.

276
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,320
A slight movement

277
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:02,280
was a bone scraping pain.

278
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,601
When I was in so much pain
that I had no strength,

279
00:16:09,481 --> 00:16:12,001
I could only sleep on tiptoes
for a while.

280
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,921
But I've made arrangements...

281
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:16,200
They said
I was imprisoned for three years.

282
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,640
Was it only three years?

283
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:23,041
There was neither day

284
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:24,400
nor night inside.

285
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,721
Every second

286
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,520
felt like a lifetime.

287
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:36,001
I tried to look up every day.

288
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,200
The sky in the Ice Prison was as blue

289
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:43,440
as the Sihai Sea in Nanhua.

290
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:48,241
Sometimes I wondered

291
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:50,361
if it wouldn’t hurt so much

292
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,601
when I remembered the days

293
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,481
with Master.

294
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,960
I called Master over and over again,

295
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,800
expecting you to take me out of there.

296
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,281
I just waited day after day

297
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:16,040
with this little bit of hope.

298
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:20,601
But you never came.

299
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:23,080
I really didn’t know.

300
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,121
That's not why

301
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:27,641
I sent you to the Ice Prison.

302
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,840
Why then?

303
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:30,121
To stop me from making trouble,

304
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,641
and to kill me again?

305
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,241
That blow isn’t enough
to vent your anger,

306
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,800
so you want me to suffer like this

307
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:39,401
to atone for my previous life, right?

308
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:42,281
Previous life?

309
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,121
Who told you?

310
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:47,680
Wang Yue?

311
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,361
Don't listen to their bewitching.

312
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:54,481
I want to thank him.

313
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:56,281
It was he who saved me

314
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:58,080
and told me everything.

315
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:00,521
Otherwise, I would still be kept
in the dark,

316
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,560
thinking that Master locked me up here

317
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:04,320
because I did something wrong.

318
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:07,200
I always thought that Master
had his difficulties.

319
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:11,401
Now it seems that

320
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:14,401
everything is nothing but planned.

321
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
You have been manipulating me
since the beginning.

322
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:19,960
It’s not like this, Chong.

323
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,241
I was even worried about being
a substitute for someone else.

324
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:27,401
In fact, there is no senior at all.

325
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:32,241
I am the senior.

326
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:34,001
I am Chong Zi.

327
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,641
I was also the one who took the
demon sword and betrayed the sect.

328
00:18:37,721 --> 00:18:38,641
Chong.

329
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:47,121
I was expecting you to come and save me.

330
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:49,080
How could you save me?

331
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,481
You can't save me,

332
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:51,920
and you don't want to.

333
00:18:52,241 --> 00:18:53,680
I never thought about it that way.

334
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:00,680
And this pendant.

335
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,641
I've always used it as a talisman.

336
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:05,761
I didn't expect it

337
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,281
to be used by you to spy on me.

338
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,241
Chong.

339
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,601
You know my feelings for you.

340
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,281
I've never done that

341
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:17,721
or thought about it.

342
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,560
You are scarier than any of them.

343
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,840
Why didn't you blow me to ashes

344
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,080
at that time,

345
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,800
but let me suffer like this?

346
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:30,200
This time

347
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,960
I clearly did nothing wrong!

348
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:39,721
Chong, don't think of me like that.

349
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,920
I have confessed every day

350
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,840
for the past three years.

351
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,320
My heart also hurts.

352
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:54,601
Zhenzhu.

353
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,200
Miaoyuan.

354
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,840
Zhenzhu.

355
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:00,320
Zhenzhu.

356
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:01,560
Miaoyuan.

357
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,601
Zhenzhu.

358
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:04,920
Miaoyuan.

359
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,800
This...

360
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,401
This...

361
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,440
What happened?

362
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,200
Zhenzhu.

363
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,641
Zhenzhu.

364
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,361
The demon’s clothes.

365
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,641
What’s going on?

366
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,241
I see.

367
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:40,721
She let go

368
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:42,761
of that devil

369
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:44,320
and killed Miaoyuan.

370
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:47,560
She’s the spy from the Demon World.

371
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,601
No.

372
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:50,881
Zhenzhu wouldn't do that.

373
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,401
You two have been married
for so many years.

374
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:53,440
Didn't you notice

375
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,361
something strange about her?

376
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,320
I don’t believe it.

377
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,840
Zhenzhu can’t be from the Demon World.

378
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,641
Shut up.

379
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,761
The witch from the Demon World

380
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:06,001
has deceived us very much.

381
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:09,080
I have to show you

382
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:12,080
if she is from the Demon World.

383
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,761
Take him away.

384
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,320
Zhenzhu.

385
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:16,680
Zhenzhu.

386
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:18,281
Zhenzhu.

387
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:19,800
Zhenzhu!

388
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,560
Councilor.

389
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:21,881
No!

390
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,560
Zhenzhu!

391
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,160
Zhenzhu!

392
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,200
Zhenzhu!

393
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,281
See?

394
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,080
Zhenzhu.

395
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:11,281
Which of us wronged her?

396
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:13,080
I am her master.

397
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,160
I was to blame for

398
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:18,401
being deceived by her.

399
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:23,200
What's the use of saying this now?

400
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,001
Master.

401
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,281
How's the situation outside?

402
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,481
The demon sword
and Tianmo Token are gone.

403
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,401
What?

404
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,840
Chong.

405
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,800
Go back with me.

406
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,481
I will explain to you,

407
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,080
okay?

408
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:24,481
Go back with you?

409
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:26,721
And let you kill me again?

410
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,001
It is a fact that you killed me,

411
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,121
and it is also true that
you put me in the Ice Prison.

412
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:33,721
What else do you want to explain?

413
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:35,440
Evil disciple!

414
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:39,481
Evil disciple!

415
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,840
Even the Ice Prison can't keep you.

416
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:43,440
If I'd known this beforehand,

417
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,241
I should have killed you
in the first place.

418
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,160
It's a pity that

419
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,040
it's not so easy for you to kill me now.

420
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,761
Who are you?

421
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,320
They said that

422
00:23:57,361 --> 00:23:58,401
I am the daughter of Ni Lun.

423
00:23:58,481 --> 00:23:59,200
Chong.

424
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,840
Chong.

425
00:24:03,481 --> 00:24:04,721
Don’t listen to what they say.

426
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:06,761
I will never trust you again.

427
00:24:09,521 --> 00:24:10,481
Chong.

428
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:15,121
Chong.

429
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:16,800
Come over.

430
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,121
Come to me.

431
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:26,840
I am begging you.

432
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,881
If you really want to save me,

433
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,560
come to me.

434
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,881
So

435
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:56,281
it's just my wishful thinking.

436
00:24:58,361 --> 00:25:00,560
The one who can't tolerate me is you,

437
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:03,121
Luo Yinfan.

438
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,641
Young Master.

439
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:15,761
I'm here to pick you up.

440
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,521
You...

441
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:18,160
What are you calling her?

442
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:20,401
Young Master.

443
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:23,401
The Demon King Ni Lun's
only blood relative,

444
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,361
Chong Zi.

445
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,040
Young Master.

446
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:49,281
The demon sword has been
waiting for you for a long time.

447
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,320
It finally found its true owner.

448
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:53,401
Chong.

449
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,121
Luo Yinfan.

450
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,560
Let me ask you one last time.

451
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:13,361
Have you ever had a crush on me?

452
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:20,761
Chong.

453
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,481
I never forgot you

454
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,080
for a single moment.

455
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,680

456

464

Chong.

465
00:27:14,481 --> 00:27:15,881
My king, you're back.

466
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,160
So this is the daughter of Ni Lun.

467
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:40,200
You should know all of them.

468
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,001
I won’t introduce them one by one.

469
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,200
How is it?

470
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,960
The Demon King Hall

471
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,160
is much better than

472
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:48,521
Nanhua which sticks to convention.

473
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,281
Good and bad don't lie in appearances.

474
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:53,840
The Demon World
and the Immortal World

475
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:55,241
are the same in my eyes.

476
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,521
You are finally here.

477
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,680
Isn’t this what you want?

478
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:03,840
I don't want you to
cultivate immortality,

479
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:05,881
but I also don't want you
to be a demon.

480
00:28:08,601 --> 00:28:09,920
The god of destiny makes fools
of the people.

481
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:12,560
That’s for sure.

482
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:14,281
Your husband

483
00:28:14,601 --> 00:28:16,001
doesn't know your identity

484
00:28:16,281 --> 00:28:18,080
as the protector of demons, right?

485
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,840
I have no intention of fighting with you.

486
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:22,601
But don't blame me for
being rude to you

487
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,160
if you insist on telling him.

488
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:26,721
You have been a demon for so long,

489
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,960
are you still afraid that others
will laugh at your identity?

490
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,080
Shuixian, you're just being
too polite to her.

491
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,001
Don’t you know that

492
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:45,721
any comer is a guest?

493
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,761
Demons have no distinction
between host and guest,

494
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,680
and have always competed for
the honorable and humble with strength.

495
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:08,320
(This sword...)

496
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,361
It’s been so many years.

497
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,320
Tian Zhixie is as powerful as usual.

498
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:22,721
Thousand-Faced Demon, Tian Zhixie.

499
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:28,281
See?

500
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,121
There are no less powerful characters
in the Demon World

501
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:33,040
than those in the immortal sect.

502
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,200
I will introduce them

503
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,121
to you later on.

504
00:29:38,481 --> 00:29:39,680
This is Demon God.

505
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,920
All the demons are protected by him.

506
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,560
Now that you have become a demon,

507
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,241
swear allegiance to the Demon God

508
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,160
and convert to the Demon World.

509
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
When have I ever become a demon,

510
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:53,721
and when have I ever said

511
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,040
to convert to the Demon World?

512
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:01,560
Demon King Hall is a land of freedom.

513
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:04,001
All beings have always come
and gone freely.

514
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,121
It's just that

515
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:08,481
the immortal sect can
no longer accommodate you.

516
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:09,721
If you leave here,

517
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:12,560
I'm afraid you won't even
have a place to stay.

518
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,560
Thank you.

519
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,560
But no need.

520
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:21,840
My king.

521
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:24,680
Look at how ignorant she is.

522
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,920
She's not as good as you say.

523
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:29,160
She’s like a wild girl

524
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,761
and will suffer a lot sooner or later.

525
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:35,200
She won’t go far.

526
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,361
I don't know why you let her go.

527
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,440
I let her go

528
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,920
just so she could come back
on her own.

529
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,080
Should I call you Tian Zhixie,

530
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,680
or Senior Mu?

531
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,320
Young Master, good vision.

532
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:29,800
You deliberately used
that sword just now.

533
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,160
Why are you here?

534
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:34,560
I’m just

535
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,241
coming back.

536
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,680
It turns out that Senior Mu,

537
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,440
who has cared most about me
for a long time,

538
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:44,960
is a spy of the Demon World.

539
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,601
You have done so many things

540
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:22,001
with me for a purpose.

541
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,241
Which one is the real you?

542
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,761
I’m the Thousand-Faced Demon.

543
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,121
All my faces are true

544
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,160
and false.

545
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:34,160
You just have to remember that

546
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:36,721
I'll be as good to you as ever.

547
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:38,840
You are good to me.

548
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:41,881
So you instigated Yan Zhenzhu
to use the nightmare technique on me.

549
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,481
You are good to me.

550
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:46,521
So you blamed Zhuo Yunji's death on me.

551
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,160
You are good to me.

552
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:50,401
So you caused my uncle to die
for the sword,

553
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:51,521
and to disappear completely.

554
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:54,401
We have known each other for so long,

555
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,040
have I ever hurt you?

556
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,121
Tian Zhixie!

557
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:05,001
The demon scent contained
in the demon sword

558
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:07,560
was left by Demon King Ni Lun
to Young Master.

559
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:09,040
Back then,

560
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:11,001
Nanhua wanted to purify it.

561
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,440
I couldn't find your whereabouts,

562
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:16,641
so I could only find the host
for the demon sword.

563
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,721
It's a pity that

564
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:20,800
God was kidding.

565
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,241
I didn't expect that the demon sword
would choose Chu Bufu.

566
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:29,721
Everything I do is for you.

567
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,761
Only you can

568
00:33:30,881 --> 00:33:32,401
break the seal of the Tianmo Token,

569
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:33,560
and only you can

570
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:36,521
fulfill the last will of
the Demon King Ni Lun

571
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:38,361
and unify the six worlds.

572
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,241
But how can you conclude that

573
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:41,680
I have something to do with Ni Lun?

574
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:43,241
I’m sure.

575
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,160
Otherwise, the Tianmo Token and the
demon sword wouldn't have reacted.

576
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:48,601
But my blood

577
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,160
can't undo the Tianmo Token.

578
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,481
That's because your evil breath
is not enough

579
00:33:52,721 --> 00:33:54,001
and it's not the right time yet.

580
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:56,560
But everyone knows that

581
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,040
Ni Lun has no blood relatives.

582
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:01,320
How can everyone know about this?

583
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,881
You only know that

584
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,920
your father is the Demon King Ni Lun.

585
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:10,081
Do you know

586
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,241
who your mother is?

587
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,721
It must be some witch.

588
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:16,041
What does it have to do with me?

589
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,721
If she was a witch,

590
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:19,801
it would be much easier.

591
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,440
Your mother

592
00:34:24,281 --> 00:34:26,241
was from Nanhua.

593
00:34:28,081 --> 00:34:28,960
Nanhua?

594
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,281
They couldn't beat the Demon King
head-on,

595
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:33,841
so they could only send a woman

596
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,600
to seduce him.

597
00:34:36,001 --> 00:34:37,360
How do you know it wasn’t true love?

598
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:38,400
True love?

599
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:43,200
She was just a pawn.

600
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:50,041
No!

601
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,400
No!

602
00:34:57,481 --> 00:34:58,521
Shuiji!

603
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,001
So what if it's true love?

604
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,400
If it wasn't for her,

605
00:35:10,721 --> 00:35:12,761
how could the Demon King
go to Nanhua impulsively,

606
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:15,360
and how could he fall into
Nanhua's trap and die?

607
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:21,241
After the fall of the Demon King,

608
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,481
I returned to the Demon King Hall.

609
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,041
Only Wang Yue was there.

610
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:28,920
He told me that

611
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,120
the Demon King and Shuiji had a baby.

612
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:37,600
I had no choice then.

613
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,721
After the death of the Demon King,

614
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,360
I left the Demon World

615
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:43,360
and wandered outside the six worlds.

616
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,360
While taking care of the Tianmo Token
in Nanhua,

617
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,841
I was also looking for you,
my Young Master,

618
00:35:49,521 --> 00:35:50,481
for the demon sword.

619
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:54,200
You have the blood of demons.

620
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Only you can

621
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,120
unlock the seal of the Tianmo Token

622
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,640
and complete the great cause.

623
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,360
Just based on my inborn evil breath,

624
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:04,360
how could you be sure that
I am that blood relative?

625
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,801
You look similar to Shuiji.

626
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:08,801
When you walked into
the Patriarch’s Hall,

627
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,081
the Tianmo Token shook.

628
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:12,241
And you can hold the demon sword.

629
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:17,600
And

630
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,160
after you went to Nanhua,

631
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:23,001
you became Luo Yinfan's disciple.

632
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,001
Even though Ni Lun
was my biological father,

633
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:28,640
he only gave me life,

634
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,200
but he never raised me.

635
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:33,041
Why should I inherit his selfishness

636
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:34,801
and help him fulfill his wish?

637
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:35,841
Have you forgotten

638
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,160
the torture you suffered
in Nanhua Mountain?

639
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:40,920
What's more, now you are a demon.

640
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,600
Nanhua will definitely not let you go.

641
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:44,281
You are now avenging yourself

642
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:46,321
and completing your cause.

643
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,200
I am loyal to the Demon King Ni Lun.

644
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,960
Even if he has fallen,

645
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,880
I will never occupy the territory
to be king.

646
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:02,200
I will do my best to assist you

647
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,960
in fulfilling your wish.

648
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:07,960
You are just trying to use me

649
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:09,841
to fulfill your own wishes.

650
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,160
My wish

651
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,801
started as your father's wish,

652
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,281
and it will eventually

653
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:20,440
become yours.

654
00:37:28,001 --> 00:37:30,081
The sinner Chong Zi escaped
from the Ice Prison.

655
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,321
The sword of Ni Lun then disappeared.

656
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,521
It’s a big deal.

657
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,561
I hope that

658
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:39,241
once you discover the whereabouts
of the traitor Chong Zi,

659
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
report it immediately,

660
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,841
or

661
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,521
arrest her.

662
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,680
Unexpectedly, Chong Zi was so capable

663
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:53,200
that even the Ice Prison
could not hold her.

664
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:56,041
Rumor has it that the Demon King
personally rescued Chong Zi,

665
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,960
and said that she is the blood relative
of Ni Lun.

666
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,721
Everyone.

667
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,321
You all know that

668
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:05,841
Ni Lun has no blood relatives.

669
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:08,120
So this can only be a rumor

670
00:38:08,241 --> 00:38:11,160
or a trick of the demons.

671
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,880
Don’t worry.

672
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:16,041
It's been a while since
the accident happened.

673
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:18,600
Why isn't there
an accurate statement yet?

674
00:38:18,761 --> 00:38:19,400
Exactly.

675
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,721
I remember that her evil breath
also broke out

676
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:23,880
in the Six-world Monument back then,

677
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:26,241
and Yinfan suppressed it.

678
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,440
I don't think the rumor is groundless.

679
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:31,680
Lord Ming is right.

680
00:38:32,481 --> 00:38:34,241
She must be a blood relative of Ni Lun.

681
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:36,200
Luo Yinfan.

682
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,081
Back then, you were the one who
tried your best to protect her,

683
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:42,001
and kept saying that you would
be responsible for what happened.

684
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,960
Now she’s gone.

685
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,440
How can you shoulder

686
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:47,400
this responsibility?

687
00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:50,120
Supervisor Sage is the chief
of the immortal sect.

688
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:53,440
And Chong Zi is from Nanhua sect.

689
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,360
Let's not talk about

690
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,120
holding him accountable.

691
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,481
But I wonder

692
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,200
how Sage Chonghua will make up
for his mistakes next.

693
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,761
It is not your turn to criticize
Sage Chonghua.

694
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,160
Yinfan.

695
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,200
Sage Chonghua.

696
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:24,761
Do you really believe
she became a demon?

697
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:28,200
You are her master.

698
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:29,440
Even if others don't care about her,

699
00:39:29,761 --> 00:39:31,241
how can you let her go on like this?

700
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,281
I don't need you to teach me.

701
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,160
If she is really the daughter

702
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,400
of the Demon King as the rumors say,

703
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
will you kill her?

704
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,041
Step aside.

705
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,081
No.

706
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,001
I know you're going to find that witch.

707
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
Who is a witch?

708
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:54,640
Who else could it be?

709
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,600
Zhuo Hao.

710
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,600
That woman is of the bloodline
of the Demon King.

711
00:39:58,801 --> 00:40:00,561
Even Nanhua
has drawn a clear line with her.

712
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:02,120
Why are you going to
get involved in the trouble

713
00:40:02,241 --> 00:40:03,321
and drag down Qinghua's reputation?

714
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,721
Chong Zi is my love,

715
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:06,001
not a trouble.

716
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,721
Even if she is involved with the demons,

717
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:08,960
she is held hostage.

718
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,321
I never hit a woman.

719
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:11,841
But if you slander her,

720
00:40:12,241 --> 00:40:13,640
don't blame me for being rude.

721
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:20,440
She’s your love.

722
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,400
What about me?

723
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:26,200
During these three years
in Qinghua Palace,

724
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,761
I have treated you wholeheartedly.

725
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,721
Can't you even see it?

726
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:31,960
So what if I can see it?

727
00:40:32,481 --> 00:40:33,880
If love pays off,

728
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:35,640
I would have married Chong Zi twice.

729
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,841
Step aside.

730
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,440
Since you know there are no results,

731
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:41,041
why are you still going for her?

732
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:45,880
Seriously,

733
00:40:46,281 --> 00:40:47,160
I have no idea.

734
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,081
I am just obsessed.

735
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,481
I don't deserve

736
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,200
your love.

737
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,481
Stop wasting time.

738
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,481
Zhuo Hao.

739
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,640
My king, do you think
she will go back?

740
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:22,041
If she doesn't come back

741
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,561
and can't be used by us,

742
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:24,680
I'm afraid

743
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:27,200
she will be a hidden danger
in the future.

744
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:31,440
She will come back.

745
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,640
(Puyao Hall)

746
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:16,640
What a lofty sage in Nanhua.

747
00:42:17,561 --> 00:42:19,960
People all say Sage Chonghua
protects the whole world.

748
00:42:21,761 --> 00:42:22,680
What about me?

749
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:24,841
What did I do wrong?

750
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:28,360
Aren't I worthy of being protected

751
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:30,281
and loved?
