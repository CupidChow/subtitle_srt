(Red-painted Column and Carved Rafter)

29
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,029
Are you Tian Zhixie,

30
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,669
protector of the Demon Palace?

31
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:03,095
Give me the sword.

32
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:06,269
In your dreams!

33
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:39,629
How come?

34
00:02:40,188 --> 00:02:43,229
I never thought
such a little immortal as you

35
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:46,308
could manage to suppress me.

36
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:47,709
All right.

37
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:51,069
It seems that
my real host hasn't yet appeared.

38
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:53,869
I'd better sacrifice you to the sword.

39
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:56,709
Say what you want.

40
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:59,548
As long as you become my container,

41
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:02,869
I'll realize your wish.

42
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:04,748
Let me save her.

43
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:06,948
Wan Jie!

44
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:08,748
No!

45
00:03:21,388 --> 00:03:22,388
Wan Jie,

46
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,789
you still get excited easily.

47
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:26,789
I knew you would turn me down.

48
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:28,668
I've come here

49
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:30,668
only to send you a message.

50
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,388
The view of
the Qinghua Palace is beautiful.

51
00:03:35,668 --> 00:03:38,748
Miss Gong may like it.

52
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:41,108
How do you know
she is in the Qinghua Palace?

53
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:46,909
(Panhai Town)
Sweet potato! Freshly roasted sweet potato!

54
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:48,229
Miss, come and see.

55
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:49,948
Miss, look at this.

56
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:51,468
It's sweet.

57
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:54,028
Sweet potato!

58
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,748
Sweet tasty potato!

59
00:03:57,548 --> 00:03:59,388
Come and see!

60
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:04,828
Master,

61
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:05,989
are you hungry?

62
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:08,308
My stomach is rumbling.

63
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:10,548
Taoist cultivators
should curb their desires.

64
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:11,748
Try your best to

65
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:13,468
curb the desire for food.

66
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,869
That's the rule on the mountain.

67
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:16,188
While in the Mortal World,

68
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:18,149
we should try various foods.

69
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:21,308
Moreover, it's emotions and pleasures

70
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,109
that make you a human being.

71
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:24,748
They are not bad things.

72
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:25,949
On the contrary, they can help people.

73
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,188
(Steamed Stuffed Bun)
Sir, steamed stuffed bun.

74
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,629
Freshly steamed bun.

75
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,509
Steamed bun. Come and see!

76
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:39,229
Freshly steamed bun! Come and see!

77
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:41,588
(Steamed Stuffed Bun)
Thin skin and lots of filling.

78
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:43,669
Come and see!

79
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,109
Miss, would you like some buns?

80
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:47,868
Cutie, what filling is in those buns?

81
00:04:48,028 --> 00:04:49,148
Various fillings.

82
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:50,349
- I want ten.
- I want, too.

83
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,389
Don't push. Get in line over there.

84
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:54,468
- Hurry.
- Sir.

85
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,428
OK. OK.

86
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:56,669
Everyone has their share.

87
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:58,629
Don't push, everyone.

88
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:01,349
Don't push. Everyone has their share.

89
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:02,789
Come on. Don't push.

90
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:04,109
Pay here.

91
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:04,868
Here's the money.

92
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:05,829
OK.

93
00:05:06,028 --> 00:05:06,949
- I want 20.
- OK.

94
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:08,949
Don't push.

95
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:10,909
- Yours.
- It smells good.

96
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:16,629
Freshly steamed buns.

97
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:23,909
Steamed stuffed buns!

98
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:25,229
Buns sold out today.

99
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:26,148
Please come early tomorrow.

100
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:27,829
Thanks, Miss.

101
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:30,909
Miss,

102
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:32,708
thank you so much.

103
00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:34,268
Thank you.

104
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:37,748
Master, look,

105
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:39,868
you can help people without
using magical skills.

106
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:42,188
Happiness in the Mortal World is simple.

107
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:43,988
This is the last bun.

108
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:45,468
Master, it's for you.

109
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:52,909
Go ahead.

110
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:55,588
Here.

111
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:56,669
Thanks, Miss.

112
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:08,468
It's you!

113
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:12,109
You know me?

114
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:15,229
Chong, this is...

115
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,349
He is the guy who used to bully me

116
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:18,468
and was once knocked flying by

117
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:20,229
Mr. Immortal using magical skills.

118
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:33,308
You, you are Chongzi?

119
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:36,428
It's been many years.

120
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:38,708
I thought you were dead already.

121
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:42,069
Why are you still so young?

122
00:06:45,148 --> 00:06:45,909
Chong,

123
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:48,468
time goes by differently in
the Immortal World and the Mortal World.

124
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,708
How is Dou doing?

125
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:57,708
I'll take you to see her.

126
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,859
(Xichun Restaurant)

127
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:04,699
(Xichun Restaurant)

128
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,109
Dou is here.

129
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:08,229
Xichun Restaurant?

130
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:10,069
Why didn't I see her last time?

131
00:07:12,028 --> 00:07:13,148
Perhaps we both grew up

132
00:07:13,428 --> 00:07:15,229
and didn't recognize each other.
Let's go.

133
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,028
Excuse me.

134
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:19,708
Why do you come again?

135
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:21,389
Is Hong Dou here?

136
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:24,509
Could you please ask her to come down?

137
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:30,428
You should go and see her yourselves.

138
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:32,549
I don't know what to do with her.

139
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,708
Come.

140
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:46,389
Where is Dou?

141
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:50,028
There.

142
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:22,988
No way.

143
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:25,588
No way.

144
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,309
Miss, why are you staring at me?

145
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:49,468
I'm not.

146
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:50,749
I think

147
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,869
you look like a friend of mine.

148
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:56,309
I wonder how she is doing now.

149
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:11,828
Dou.

150
00:09:13,588 --> 00:09:14,789
It was you!

151
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,429
I should have recognized you.

152
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:22,068
But you were safe and sound then.

153
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,068
What happened to you?

154
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:29,468
Dou.

155
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:41,068
Nine-time Refined Elixir.

156
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:42,429
Dou.

157
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:44,028
Dou.

158
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:46,148
You'll get better after taking it.

159
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:48,189
Dou.

160
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:49,989
Master,

161
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,429
why doesn't she get better?

162
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:54,989
Why?

163
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:57,869
Dou.

164
00:09:58,109 --> 00:09:59,229
The Nine-time Refined Elixir

165
00:10:00,749 --> 00:10:02,309
can't bring the dead back to life.

166
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:08,828
What happened exactly?

167
00:10:09,388 --> 00:10:10,588
A bully came yesterday.

168
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,349
He forced Hong Dou to be his concubine,

169
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,909
or he would send her to the brothel.

170
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:16,989
This morning when I came, she...

171
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:19,189
she already died in her room.

172
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:20,588
Where is the bully?

173
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:21,749
Chongzi,

174
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:23,189
to people like us,

175
00:10:23,468 --> 00:10:24,789
dying is as natural

176
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:26,229
as living.

177
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:27,588
Forget it.

178
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,388
I told Hong Dou to accept her fate,

179
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:31,989
- but she...
- I'll never resign to fate!

180
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:33,229
Where is Hong Dou?

181
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:35,028
Hand over Hong Dou!

182
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:37,028
Oh, my! They're here to take Hong Dou.

183
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:39,028
What should I do?

184
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:44,059
(Xichun Restaurant)

185
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:47,989
- Boss.
- Boss.

186
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,309
Pay your life for Dou's life!

187
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:55,869
Go and get her!

188
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,429
Spare me! Spare me, please!

189
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:25,549
I dare not do that again.

190
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:27,028
Help!

191
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:27,869
I dare not!

192
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,148
If you have wicked ideas again,

193
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:32,109
I'll know in no time.

194
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:34,588
And you will end up

195
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,588
like this bowl.

196
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:45,989
Spare me. Spare me!

197
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:47,109
- I dare not do it again!
- Chongzi.

198
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:48,309
I dare not do it again.

199
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:49,068
Boss.

200
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:50,189
- It's her.
- Chongzi,

201
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:52,909
it's great to meet you again.

202
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:54,909
We're lowly.

203
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,628
But you're different.

204
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:58,148
You must live well.

205
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:01,229
And live for Dou, too.

206
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:05,588
Get lost.

207
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:06,909
Yes. Yes.

208
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:08,068
Go away.

209
00:12:08,148 --> 00:12:09,669
- Go.
- Go.

210
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:14,869
Thanks.

211
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:30,828
Let's go and send Dou off.

212
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:05,468
Chongzi, this is Dingsheng cake.

213
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:06,468
If you have it,

214
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:08,068
you will win victory.

215
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:12,309
Let's eat it together.

216
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:13,749
I'll win victory.

217
00:13:14,068 --> 00:13:15,349
And you have to be safe.

218
00:13:20,388 --> 00:13:22,669
Didn't we agree that you must be safe?

219
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:24,189
Why...

220
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:29,268
Master, it was my fault.

221
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,189
I thought Dou would

222
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:33,869
have a happy life,

223
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:35,828
never expecting that

224
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,468
she was bullied under my nose.

225
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,549
If I recognized Dou,

226
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:43,109
she might

227
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:47,549
not die.

228
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,948
No one can change

229
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:54,349
the cycle of fate.

230
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:57,068
You and I are no exception.

231
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,789
Back then, I intended to
join Nanhua Sect,

232
00:14:00,468 --> 00:14:02,068
because I didn't want to be bullied.

233
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:03,948
I wanted to protect Dou and the others.

234
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:06,588
But now,

235
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:09,909
I feel confused.

236
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:13,268
Master,

237
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:15,789
if you were me,

238
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,148
what would you do?

239
00:14:19,388 --> 00:14:20,989
Over the past hundreds of years,

240
00:14:21,508 --> 00:14:22,669
I've experienced a lot of

241
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,468
joys and sorrows like this.

242
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:26,549
When you learn to be indifferent

243
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:28,508
to the helplessness in the world,

244
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:31,028
you'll become a real immortal.

245
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,388
Your previous friends

246
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:35,508
are no exception.

247
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:37,588
How can we watch mortals suffer

248
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,189
and do nothing?

249
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:42,309
I used to be

250
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:45,989
a mortal like Dou.

251
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:53,068
It isn't your responsibility

252
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:54,749
to make up for individuals' regrets

253
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,869
in the Mortal World.

254
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:58,508
Instead, you should create

255
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:01,429
a world in which they can live happily.

256
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:04,508
Only by sparing no efforts
to guard the six worlds

257
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:06,828
could you protect the common people

258
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:08,349
and more mortals

259
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:10,669
like Dou.

260
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,669
I kind of

261
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:14,869
understand your words.

262
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:17,708
But,

263
00:15:19,588 --> 00:15:20,669
can I be

264
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:22,789
a real immortal like you?

265
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:38,309
As long as you're with me,

266
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:40,588
nothing is impossible.

267
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:44,028
We'll be together

268
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:47,468
for a very, very,

269
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,708
very long time.

270
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:08,989
- Later, we'll...
- Mother.

271
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:10,229
- I'm going to kill you!
- I was wrong!

272
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:11,229
I'll break your leg.

273
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,189
- Dare you run again?
- Stop beating me!

274
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:13,268
Dare you run again?

275
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:14,268
Stop it!

276
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,189
You beat your daughter cruelly.

277
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,749
How can you call yourself a mother?

278
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:19,189
She doesn't behave.

279
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:20,309
I must beat her.

280
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:21,549
Who do you think you are?

281
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:23,148
If you don't stay out of it,

282
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:25,309
I'll break her leg when we get back.

283
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,268
Go!

284
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:27,669
Stop.

285
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:32,749
You look young.

286
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,588
Are you the girl's biological mother?

287
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:36,749
I...

288
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:37,708
Sir.

289
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:38,828
Miss, help me!

290
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:40,148
She isn't my biological mother.

291
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:41,749
She wants to sell me to a brothel.

292
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:46,068
Yes.

293
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:47,909
But in the end,

294
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:49,549
I'm still her mother.

295
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:51,948
You can't stop me.

296
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:57,429
Take it.

297
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:58,828
Set her free.

298
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:03,268
OK.

299
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:06,068
Xue belongs to you now.

300
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:08,189
Go.

301
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:15,628
Thanks, Sir. Thanks, Miss.

302
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,669
She said she was your stepmother.

303
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:18,949
Where is your father?

304
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:20,628
Why doesn't he protect you?

305
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,549
My father was a physician in the town

306
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,709
before he fell ill and died.

307
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:29,748
Now I don't have

308
00:17:30,228 --> 00:17:31,748
any family in the world.

309
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,069
Master.

310
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:44,469
Xue,

311
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:45,549
use this to buy some clothes and food

312
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:46,988
and run away from the town.

313
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:48,868
Don't let that evil woman
catch you again.

314
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:53,748
Isn't it enough?

315
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,829
Master.

316
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,709
I know myself well.

317
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:00,469
I know you may have other identities

318
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,348
and probably can't have me with you.

319
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,228
But I really want to follow you,

320
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:06,748
be your maid,

321
00:18:06,949 --> 00:18:08,628
and wait on you.

322
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:10,348
I'll never be talkative or meddling.

323
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:13,789
You're smart.

324
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,309
Xue,

325
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:21,469
you're free now. Get up.

326
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,789
I neither need a maid

327
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:26,429
nor need to be waited on.

328
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,228
Let's find an inn to stay for today.

329
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:31,709
Tomorrow, we'll find you a shelter.

330
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:33,709
Your father was a physician.

331
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,589
You should know
something about medicine.

332
00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:37,429
In my opinion,

333
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:39,469
you'd better work in a pharmacy
as an apprentice.

334
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:41,709
You'll get somewhere over time.

335
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:53,748
Master, seeing that
the mountain road was wet and cold,

336
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:55,789
Ting Xue insisted on
cooking us ginger tea.

337
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:57,789
I couldn't stop her.

338
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,709
She was gilding the lily.

339
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:06,268
Master,

340
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:08,268
when Ting Xue was bullied,

341
00:19:08,469 --> 00:19:09,789
it reminded me of my childhood.

342
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:15,069
She could guess our identities.

343
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:16,909
That means she isn't simple.

344
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,868
She's nothing like you.

345
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:29,028
Master, I'm sorry.

346
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,429
I wasted the present you had prepared.

347
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:34,789
You were trying to save the girl.

348
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,868
I won't blame you.

349
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:46,309
What's wrong?

350
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:49,268
Ting Xue is alone in the world.

351
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:50,949
If she's admitted to an immortal sect,

352
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:53,228
she will no longer suffer from hunger

353
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:54,628
or be bullied, right?

354
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:00,909
Not everyone has the quality.

355
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:03,748
Moreover, it isn't necessarily
a good thing for her

356
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:04,789
to join an immortal sect.

357
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:07,628
Tomorrow, let's find a pharmacy for her

358
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:09,589
to work in as an apprentice.

359
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:19,549
Xue,

360
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:22,628
are you OK? Does it hurt?

361
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:27,429
I didn't mean to

362
00:20:27,508 --> 00:20:29,228
eavesdrop on your conversation.

363
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:31,268
Your hand...

364
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:33,988
I talked nonsense before.

365
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:35,429
You're from the Immortal World,

366
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:37,268
which is unreachable to me.

367
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:39,988
I don't have the luck to follow you.

368
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:41,469
Xue,

369
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:43,268
I used to be a beggar.

370
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:45,228
I have an even humbler origin than you.

371
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:47,228
If I can make it, you can, too.

372
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:49,789
So you're also unfortunate?

373
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:58,628
Master, let Xue stay, would you?

374
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:31,228
Congratulations!

375
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:32,988
Thanks. This way, please.

376
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:36,148
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

377
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:38,348
This way, please.

378
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:43,909
Mr. Luo.

379
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:49,909
On behalf of the Nanhua Sect,

380
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,549
I congratulate your birthday.

381
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:53,549
I wish you longevity.

382
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:55,309
Thank you.

383
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:57,148
Mr. Luo,

384
00:21:57,388 --> 00:21:59,069
you've come thousands of miles
to our sect.

385
00:21:59,348 --> 00:22:01,789
We are greatly honored.

386
00:22:03,028 --> 00:22:04,709
Congratulations, Lord Zhuo.

387
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:08,388
I wish you boundless happiness
and longevity.

388
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:13,028
That's a great one!

389
00:22:14,228 --> 00:22:16,628
It fits the scene very well.

390
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:19,669
Mr. Luo, you're really lucky

391
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:22,549
to have such a clever disciple.

392
00:22:22,868 --> 00:22:24,108
I'm flattered.

393
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:25,669
Please.

394
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:41,429
Mr. Luo.

395
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:45,709
Lord Ming.

396
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,189
I've been waiting for you.

397
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:50,589
Chong Zi,

398
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:52,789
this is Lord Ming of Changsheng Palace.

399
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:55,709
Greetings, Lord Ming.

400
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:56,949
I already heard that

401
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:58,429
Mr. Luo recruited a disciple.

402
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:00,508
I've prepared
a peach of immortality for you.

403
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:07,148
Thanks, Lord Ming.

404
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:11,309
It's tasty.

405
00:23:12,268 --> 00:23:13,589
Chong Zi is innocent and artless.

406
00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:15,108
She is really adorable.

407
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:16,549
Hong Yi,

408
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:20,549
this is the first time
Chong Zi has come here.

409
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:22,789
Show her around.

410
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,309
Yes, Master.

411
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:25,108
Go ahead.

412
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:26,909
Chong Zi, please.

413
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:31,549
Mr. Luo,

414
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,549
Wan Jie disregarded our majesty

415
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:35,508
and threatened to abduct my niece.

416
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:36,988
Please help us.

417
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:39,028
Chong Zi, please.

418
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:41,108
Where is Miss Gong?

419
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:42,348
Mr. Luo, don't worry.

420
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:45,028
She is in the Dragon Abyss of the
East Sea beside the Qinghua Mountain.

421
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:46,148
She is fine.

422
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:47,868
The incident in those days

423
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:49,228
had nothing to do with my niece.

424
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,469
She didn't know
the whereabouts of Wan Jie.

425
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:53,868
But 3,000 disciples of various sects

426
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:55,148
died because of Wan Jie.

427
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,268
To seek revenge,

428
00:23:56,348 --> 00:23:57,469
the sects wouldn't stop questioning her.

429
00:23:57,909 --> 00:23:59,868
She's been hiding all these years.

430
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:01,508
She had a very hard time.

431
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:04,108
On receiving the message from Lord Ming,

432
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:06,348
I arranged for Miss Gong
to hide in our sect.

433
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:08,228
But this is only a temporary plan.

434
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:09,388
It's a matter of great importance.

435
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:10,789
So we have to invite you over

436
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,388
to discuss a plan.

437
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,228
They can't resist Wan Jie,
the Demon King,

438
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:16,028
by acting so recklessly.

439
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,148
Fortunately, Lord Zhuo
offered a helping hand,

440
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,829
or there will be more casualties.

441
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:22,669
My niece

442
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,549
is willing to lure him out.

443
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:26,189
If we can trap him

444
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:27,669
and retrieve the demon sword,

445
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,709
it will be a consolation
to the 3,000 dead disciples.

446
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:33,868
We still have to find out
whether the 3,000 disciples

447
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:35,748
were killed by Wan Jie.

448
00:24:36,148 --> 00:24:38,148
We need to make some arrangements
in the Dragon Abyss

449
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:39,108
in order to

450
00:24:39,469 --> 00:24:40,429
trap Wan Jie

451
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:41,829
and get the matter straight.

452
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:54,549
Is the Demon King Wan Jie so powerful?

453
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:57,469
He is said to be

454
00:24:57,709 --> 00:24:59,228
the most powerful in the Demon Palace

455
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:00,549
and the most dangerous.

456
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:03,108
Then, will he hurt my master?

457
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:05,469
Sage Chonghua won't be easily hurt.

458
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:06,709
In my opinion,

459
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:08,829
he isn't worth being dealt with
by your master.

460
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:10,589
As Mr. Luo's disciple,

461
00:25:10,748 --> 00:25:12,348
you can deal with him effortlessly.

462
00:25:12,868 --> 00:25:13,949
Me?

463
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:15,549
I can't.

464
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:18,108
Don't be so modest.

465
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:20,868
Mr. Luo had never recruited
a disciple in the past 1,000 years.

466
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,069
Chong Zi,

467
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:23,789
you must be talented.

468
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:26,789
I'm a little tired.

469
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:29,508
The Qinghua Palace is really big.

470
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:31,909
Though our palace is smaller than yours,

471
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:33,949
if we walk like this,

472
00:25:34,108 --> 00:25:35,909
it'll take us several days to
finish the tour.

473
00:25:36,388 --> 00:25:38,549
Why don't we ride the sword?

474
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:40,028
Ride the sword?

475
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:41,148
I don't...

476
00:25:42,189 --> 00:25:43,148
think so.

477
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,348
We'll stay for several more days.

478
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:46,868
I can look around every day.

479
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:47,709
Mr. Luo

480
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,228
used to visit our palace before.

481
00:25:49,628 --> 00:25:51,309
He always stayed in the Sea Building.

482
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:54,469
Lord Zhuo specially ordered us

483
00:25:54,748 --> 00:25:56,028
to keep the building for him.

484
00:25:56,228 --> 00:25:57,348
Since you're tired,

485
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,789
let me take you there to have a rest.

486
00:25:59,069 --> 00:25:59,949
You can wait for your master there,

487
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:00,669
OK?

488
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:02,949
Please.

489
00:26:13,988 --> 00:26:15,429
Miss, you have tears in your eyes.

490
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,469
Are you moved by the

491
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,148
beautiful scenery?

492
00:26:31,988 --> 00:26:33,589
If someone bullied you,

493
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:35,868
I'll help you to vent your spleen.

494
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,388
Sir, you misunderstood.

495
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:39,508
Ting Xue just came out

496
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:41,228
to enjoy the beautiful scenery.

497
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:42,388
Ting Xue, listen to the snow?

498
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:48,148
Listen to the rain at the Jimen Pass,
and the snow at the Yantai Platform.

499
00:26:48,348 --> 00:26:49,669
Palace dress couldn't ward off the cold.

500
00:26:50,189 --> 00:26:52,949
Feeling lazy to dress up,
she was getting thinner.

501
00:26:53,189 --> 00:26:54,949
Tears streamed down with rouge.

502
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:57,309
Ting Xue,

503
00:26:57,429 --> 00:26:59,709
are you Sage Chonghua's disciple?

504
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:01,589
Does that make

505
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:02,868
any difference?

506
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,669
You're the first disciple
he recruited in the last 1,000 years.

507
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:06,309
The news was carried to all sects.

508
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:10,508
I've now come to see

509
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:12,268
how different you are.

510
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:21,469
Looking closely,

511
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:22,868
you're prettier than I thought.

512
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,589
No wonder Mr. Luo would recruit you.

513
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:27,748
Hands off!

514
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:32,108
I'm not Sage Chonghua's disciple.

515
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:33,709
She is.

516
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:39,388
So you are the distinguished disciple

517
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:41,268
of Sage Chonghua.

518
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:42,829
Who are you?

519
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,348
Are you bullying Xue?

520
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:45,868
No, this childe...

521
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:48,669
I'm Zhuo Hao.
I admire Sage Chonghua's fame.

522
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,508
You want to see my master?

523
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:52,429
Then go to the lotus pond.

524
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:55,429
You're like mud that

525
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:56,868
can't be shaken off.

526
00:27:56,988 --> 00:27:58,228
As Sage Chonghua's disciple,

527
00:27:58,388 --> 00:28:00,189
you speak like a shrew.

528
00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:00,748
You...

529
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:02,429
I've come here to have

530
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:03,829
a sword fight with you.

531
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:05,669
I'd rather not.

532
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:08,789
Though our swordsmanship
doesn't stand out,

533
00:28:09,148 --> 00:28:10,309
compared with yours,

534
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:12,069
it isn't too inferior.

535
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:17,949
I don't know swordsmanship.

536
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,028
You have the wrong person.

537
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:22,309
So, you despise me like this?

538
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:24,189
I'm the young master of
the Qinghua Palace.

539
00:28:24,508 --> 00:28:26,829
Am I not qualified to
have a competition with you?

540
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:27,748
Let me go.

541
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:28,709
If you don't let me go,

542
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:30,789
I'll tell Master and Lord Zhuo.

543
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:34,628
How could Sage Chonghua's disciple
not know swordsmanship?

544
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:35,949
I'm afraid the lie you told

545
00:28:36,108 --> 00:28:37,669
would disgrace your master.

546
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:38,789
You!

547
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:14,589
(Oh, dear!)

548
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:16,228
(The girl can't swim.)

549
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:24,028
I told you I didn't know swordsmanship.

550
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:25,388
What do you want?

551
00:29:25,469 --> 00:29:26,348
You rascal!

552
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:27,469
Dare you call me a rascal?

553
00:29:27,628 --> 00:29:29,429
Sage Chonghua's disciple is just so so.

554
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:30,949
You can't even defeat a rascal.

555
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:31,949
I can't defeat you because

556
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:33,108
I haven't learned magical skills.

557
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,028
When I master magical skills,

558
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,148
I'll knock you over with one move,

559
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:36,868
and make you terrified
on hearing Chong Zi!

560
00:29:39,228 --> 00:29:40,429
Is your name Chong Zi?

561
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:42,228
You're not only bad at magical skills,

562
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:43,909
but also have an ill name.

563
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:46,909
But you do have a pretty face.

564
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:49,949
Why don't you marry me?

565
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:51,189
I'll protect you.

566
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:52,949
Anyway, if your master
doesn't teach you magical skills,

567
00:29:53,108 --> 00:29:54,388
he mustn't be fond of you.

568
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:55,268
You're a liar!

569
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:57,268
Master is the best to me in the world!

570
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:00,988
Chong Zi, don't be upset.

571
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:02,628
I was joking with you.

572
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:04,388
Yes, just now,

573
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:05,709
I made a mistake.

574
00:30:05,949 --> 00:30:07,469
But I didn't mean it.

575
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:08,388
- I won't listen! No!
- Chong Zi,

576
00:30:08,508 --> 00:30:09,549
don't tell your master

577
00:30:09,628 --> 00:30:10,628
what happened today,

578
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,949
lest it would hurt our feelings.

579
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:15,628
Young lady,

580
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:17,069
wait for me.

581
00:30:17,228 --> 00:30:18,309
Don't follow me.

582
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:20,949
Fine, I promise.

583
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:22,228
I won't tell my master.

584
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:24,868
Thanks, Chong Zi.

585
00:30:32,148 --> 00:30:33,748
But I have one condition.

586
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:35,628
What is it?

587
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:36,589
Didn't you say

588
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,348
my master was reluctant
to tell me magical skills?

589
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:39,429
You teach me one.

590
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:40,628
A piece of cake.

591
00:30:40,988 --> 00:30:43,148
If you want to see how powerful I am,

592
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,469
just speak out.

593
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:46,148
Don't brag on yourself!

594
00:30:46,508 --> 00:30:48,228
I really want to learn some skills.

595
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:50,909
I'm a born chatterbox.

596
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:52,508
I think Master wouldn't teach me

597
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:53,868
because he doesn't like me
being clamorous.

598
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:55,949
You can teach me to sit in meditation,

599
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:57,028
the kind that

600
00:30:57,268 --> 00:31:00,429
won't be affected by the outside world,
like Calm Deep Meditation.

601
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:01,628
Do you know it?

602
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:03,268
OK.

603
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:04,469
Behold.

604
00:31:44,348 --> 00:31:45,069
Chong.

605
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:49,028
Master.

606
00:31:51,988 --> 00:31:52,868
What are you doing?

607
00:31:53,228 --> 00:31:54,148
I...

608
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,388
Sage Chonghua!

609
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:06,348
Master,

610
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:08,108
he is the young master
of the Qinghua Palace.

611
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:10,789
He's here to visit you.

612
00:32:11,148 --> 00:32:12,268
If you don't like him,

613
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,469
I'll drive him out now.

614
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:17,589
Weird, it turns out you can be polite.

615
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:20,069
Then why were you so rude to me?

616
00:32:21,348 --> 00:32:22,789
If you blabber in front of my master,

617
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:23,829
I'll kill you.

618
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:25,829
Chong, don't be rude.

619
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:27,748
It's OK, sir.

620
00:32:28,028 --> 00:32:29,108
My master prefers quietness.

621
00:32:29,189 --> 00:32:30,508
You'd better leave now.

622
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:32,069
Actually,

623
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:33,549
you took me here.

624
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:34,988
You followed me here.

625
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:36,909
- I...
- Wait.

626
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,348
Are you friends?

627
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:40,268
Yes.

628
00:32:40,748 --> 00:32:41,549
Definitely not!

629
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:42,988
I'd rather say we're enemies.

630
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:44,469
I'm asking Mr. Zhuo.

631
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:46,108
My disciple doesn't like going out.

632
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:47,628
How did you know each other?

633
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:51,628
A riot of blooms dazzles the eye.

634
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:53,868
Young lady,

635
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:56,148
you're much funnier than Ting Xue.

636
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:58,228
Does your father know

637
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:59,988
you're wandering outside?

638
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:01,589
I don't care.

639
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:03,709
We become intimate at the first meeting.

640
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:05,228
We really hit it off.

641
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:06,789
Hit it off?

642
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:10,348
Cut the crap. Leave now!

643
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:11,589
Go!

644
00:33:11,748 --> 00:33:12,949
Quickly.

645
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:16,669
Master.

646
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:23,069
Young people

647
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:24,868
should make some friends.

648
00:33:25,189 --> 00:33:27,228
Master, don't believe him.

649
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:28,589
I hardly know him,

650
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:29,868
let alone make friends with him.

651
00:33:30,148 --> 00:33:30,789
Anyway...

652
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:33,148
Anyway, he's an annoying man.

653
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,108
Really?

654
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:38,268
Really.

655
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:46,469
I know why Chong Zi was nervous.

656
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,309
But how come Sage Chonghua

657
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:50,189
looked more nervous than her?

658
00:34:03,348 --> 00:34:06,309
When are you going to let me out?

659
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,108
The ocean view of Qinghua Palace

660
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:20,628
is indeed beautiful.

661
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:26,509
What are you looking at?

662
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:29,388
Master, the man over there

663
00:34:29,588 --> 00:34:30,749
sits still

664
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:32,509
like a statue.

665
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:33,788
Statue?

666
00:34:36,229 --> 00:34:37,189
The jujube is tasty.

667
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:38,588
That's Mr. Kunlun.

668
00:34:39,229 --> 00:34:40,749
Though with a cold appearance,

669
00:34:41,108 --> 00:34:42,348
he's easygoing.

670
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,828
The woman next to him is his wife,

671
00:34:45,068 --> 00:34:46,068
Madam Kunlun.

672
00:34:46,828 --> 00:34:48,788
I heard that Madam Kunlun

673
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:50,269
chased Mr. Kunlun relentlessly then,

674
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:51,868
and even sent him

675
00:34:52,148 --> 00:34:53,388
the betrothal gift first.

676
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:55,788
Bold and forthright as she is,

677
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,788
she can't avoid being criticized.

678
00:34:58,189 --> 00:34:59,388
Come on, honey,

679
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:00,749
let's drink.

680
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:09,189
What a fabulous couple!

681
00:35:09,788 --> 00:35:11,868
How could others know their joy?

682
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:15,548
In my opinion, your personality

683
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:17,429
is a little like hers.

684
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:32,229
Yummy.

685
00:35:39,108 --> 00:35:40,868
Is she Sage Chonghua's disciple?

686
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:43,509
She doesn't seem special.

687
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:44,989
What do you know?

688
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:47,308
Being brought up by Sage Chonghua alone

689
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:48,989
makes her more special
than other immortal ladies.

690
00:35:49,229 --> 00:35:51,669
So, the little disciple is the key to

691
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:53,669
win the favor of Mr. Luo?

692
00:35:54,148 --> 00:35:55,108
Sir,

693
00:35:58,469 --> 00:35:59,709
the lord of Yuyin Palace is here.

694
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:01,269
Would you come to have a chat?

695
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:02,989
Please wait for a minute.

696
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:04,709
OK.

697
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:07,749
Master,

698
00:36:08,868 --> 00:36:10,429
could you stay?

699
00:36:10,548 --> 00:36:13,388
If you leave, I'll feel bored.

700
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:15,628
Don't worry.
You'll have more company

701
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:17,229
than you want.

702
00:36:21,588 --> 00:36:22,429
Let's go.

703
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:23,828
Go.

704
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:27,348
- Miss.
- Miss.

705
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,868
Miss, this Blue Icy Ball

706
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:31,868
is cool and refreshing. Have a try.

707
00:36:31,909 --> 00:36:34,068
The Icy Ball is too cold.
Jade Peach Dew moistens your mouth.

708
00:36:34,068 --> 00:36:34,868
Try this first.

709
00:36:34,868 --> 00:36:36,348
Green Grape Wine should
go with cream cheese.

710
00:36:36,388 --> 00:36:37,509
Miss, try this.

711
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:38,989
- Miss, try this.
- Have a taste.

712
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:39,788
- Miss, try this.
- This is tasty.

713
00:36:40,628 --> 00:36:41,588
Sage!

714
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:43,229
Sage Chonghua!

715
00:36:46,868 --> 00:36:47,949
Sir,

716
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:50,348
you know I have feelings for you.

717
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:53,189
Why do you treat me as a stranger?

718
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:55,828
I don't have any connection with you.

719
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:58,469
It really hurts hearing you say so.

720
00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:00,269
Whenever you attend a grand meeting,

721
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:01,588
I'm there, too.

722
00:37:01,749 --> 00:37:03,949
And now you said that.

723
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,989
You're really heartless.

724
00:37:06,828 --> 00:37:07,469
Sir.

725
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:08,308
- Miss.
- Miss.

726
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:09,788
Could you tell me

727
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:11,189
what it takes

728
00:37:11,308 --> 00:37:12,709
for you to look at me once?

729
00:37:13,068 --> 00:37:14,429
Miss, watch your behavior.

730
00:37:15,308 --> 00:37:16,509
Who are you?

731
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:18,469
I'm talking with Sage Chonghua.

732
00:37:18,788 --> 00:37:20,108
You're in no position to interrupt.

733
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:21,949
Master, you hate people

734
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:23,469
touching your robe, don't you?

735
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,269
People person in particular.

736
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:28,429
If you want my master
to treat you differently,

737
00:37:28,588 --> 00:37:29,588
you'd better find out

738
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:30,868
about his preferences.

739
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,308
It's useless to throw yourself at him.

740
00:37:33,588 --> 00:37:34,229
You!

741
00:37:34,548 --> 00:37:35,348
Me?

742
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:37,189
I'm just a little disciple.

743
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,588
My words carry little weight.

744
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:41,509
But I know clearly what kind of woman

745
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:43,148
is qualified to be my master's wife.

746
00:37:44,788 --> 00:37:46,989
My master cares about the common people.

747
00:37:47,229 --> 00:37:48,828
Anyone who wants to stand by his side

748
00:37:49,108 --> 00:37:50,509
must practice magical skills well.

749
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:51,989
When he is going to kill demons,

750
00:37:52,108 --> 00:37:53,749
she should be able to help him

751
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:56,548
instead of pulling his sleeves

752
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:57,709
and cottoning up to him.

753
00:37:58,229 --> 00:38:00,269
That way, no matter
how many lives he has,

754
00:38:00,388 --> 00:38:01,788
she'll get him killed.

755
00:38:02,388 --> 00:38:04,108
Miss, don't you think so?

756
00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:12,469
Sage Chonghua's disciple

757
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:13,828
is really sharp-tongued.

758
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:15,509
Those stern and righteous words

759
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:17,429
are beyond all disputes.

760
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:19,348
No wonder you're his favorite disciple.

761
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:21,108
You're different.

762
00:38:21,628 --> 00:38:22,429
Over time,

763
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:24,989
you'll be a capable assistant.

764
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:30,388
My disciple is drunk
and talking nonsense.

765
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:31,949
Please don't be offended.

766
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:43,029
Everyone, thank you for
coming all the way here.

767
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:45,388
Please enjoy yourself.

768
00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:47,308
After everything is well deployed,

769
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:50,388
we'll need your help.

770
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,229
Mr. Luo,

771
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:08,229
have you heard from Yunji?

772
00:39:08,828 --> 00:39:10,229
She's stayed
in the Mortal World for years

773
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,509
and hasn't returned yet.

774
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:13,509
People can't reach her.

775
00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:16,269
I'm afraid she's too busy

776
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:18,029
to remember my birthday.

777
00:39:18,348 --> 00:39:19,469
Miss Zhuo cares about the people.

778
00:39:19,548 --> 00:39:20,868
By curing patients and saving people,

779
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,828
she accumulates virtue for you.

780
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,588
It's the best birthday gift.

781
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:26,669
That's true.

782
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:29,709
When my sister was at home,

783
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,788
she always talked about

784
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:33,269
having not seen you for years.

785
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:35,548
Today you're here, but she isn't.

786
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:38,308
Three years ago,
when a group of fox demons

787
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:39,429
raged in Qingzhou,

788
00:39:39,709 --> 00:39:41,189
I heard that Miss Zhuo

789
00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:43,148
was giving out elixirs
and helping people there.

790
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:45,669
But I had something important to do
and didn't visit her.

791
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:48,628
She would regret it for a while

792
00:39:49,308 --> 00:39:51,029
if she heard this.

793
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:56,749
Xiao Yi.

794
00:39:58,949 --> 00:39:59,548
Sir.

795
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:00,709
Where is Zhuo Hao?

796
00:40:01,189 --> 00:40:03,148
I asked him to come over early
to greet the distinguished guests.

797
00:40:03,229 --> 00:40:04,388
Why hasn't he come?

798
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,588
Young Master is coming.

799
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:10,989
The so-called birthday banquet

800
00:40:11,348 --> 00:40:12,388
is just a party for those old men

801
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:14,068
to have fun.

802
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:22,588
If the young lady wasn't here,

803
00:40:22,709 --> 00:40:23,749
I wouldn't come.

804
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:29,388
Hardly know him?

805
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,148
I...

806
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:32,429
Young lady.

807
00:40:32,588 --> 00:40:33,909
Why do you come to me again?

808
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,029
Why can't I come?

809
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:37,868
I feel as if I've parted from

810
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,709
my young lady for three years.

811
00:40:41,348 --> 00:40:42,669
Who is your young lady?

812
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,229
