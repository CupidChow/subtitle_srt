28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,920
Master.

29
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,000
Kneel down.

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,880
Stop!

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,720
Yue Qiao is not a disciple of Nanhua.

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,319
He is unforgivable.

33
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,559
But we shouldn't preside over lynching.

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,160
You!

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,920
Kneel down.

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,559
Sima Miaoyuan.

37
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,520
Your absence without leave

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,280
has caused a catastrophe

39
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,280
and brought shame to Nanhua.

40
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,800
I will punish you to guard the Poison Island
for three years,

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,160
and your immortal bones will be removed.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,559
Master, it's all about Yue Qiao's conspiracy.

43
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,920
What does it have to do with me?

44
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,479
You deserve to be punished
for what you did wrong.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,679
Someone.

46
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,559
Sima Miaoyuan.

47
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,920
You have no scruples about
the precepts of the immortal sect.

48
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,920
You are ashamed of the oath you made

49
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,440
when you entered Nanhua that day.

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,240
You can use this period of time
to reflect on yourself on the Poison Island.

51
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:26,440
Take her down
and send her to the Poison Island.

52
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,640
Yes.

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,199
Master, Master.

54
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:32,160
Master! Let me go.

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,199
Master. Master.

56
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,160
Master.

57
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:38,479
Master.

58
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,039
Let me go. Master!

59
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,520
What did I do wrong?

60
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,880
It was Chong Zi who killed Zhuo Yunji

61
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:47,199
and hurt Yue Qiao.

62
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,319
Instead of punishing her,

63
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,920
you punished me instead!

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now that you have been punished,

65
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,959
you should watch your words and deeds.

66
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:55,599
Chong Zi!

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,319
It's not that I want Chong Zi to die,

68
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:07,240
but that the whole world
can't tolerate her.

69
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,240
Can you take the risk?

70
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:12,280
As the Councilor of Nanhua,

71
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:13,720
I can't.

72
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,439
If you insist on protecting Chong Zi,

73
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,560
the two of us

74
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,199
will part ways from now on.

75
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,159
Even if your spells are very strong

76
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,840
and you are invincible in the six worlds,

77
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,400
if you don't think
about the common people,

78
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:29,759
what's the use?

79
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,120
Over the years,

80
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,439
I have been practicing Mirror Heart Skill,

81
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,279
just to get rid of the evil breath

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,999
on Chong Zi as soon as possible.

83
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,640
But things have come to this,

84
00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:41,279
how can I not know

85
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,560
the impact of the exposure
of the evil breath of Chong Zi?

86
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,999
So I will definitely not

87
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:48,080
take the world to risk again.

88
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:49,960
Well.

89
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,159
What are you going to do?

90
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,960
Keep her alive

91
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,360
and let her sleep in the Ice Prison

92
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,879
until the day I master
the Mirror Heart Skill.

93
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,199
Councilor, can you pretend that
there is no such person in Nanhua?

94
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:04,840
If I wasn't completely sure,

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,999
I definitely wouldn't wake her up.

96
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:17,039
Supervisor Sage

97
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
had made up his mind this time?

98
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
This time I feel that

99
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,080
he is different from the past,

100
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,999
and is still

101
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,719
the familiar Luo Yinfan.

102
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,039
It's okay, Master.

103
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,599
I am not cold at all.

104
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,840
This time I will definitely

105
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,920
solve all this for you.

106
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,640
Just pretend it's a dream.

107
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:04,599
Then I hope that there are

108
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,719
Zizhu Peak, Master, me,

109
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,879
and Lion.

110
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,319

111
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240

I brought him some medicine.

These are all left by my master
during her lifetime,

158
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,079

Thank you, Miss Ting Xue.

You even made a special trip here.

162
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,479
You are indeed as compassionate

as Miss Zhuo.

164

Due to the busy affairs in Kunlun,

166
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,360
I also brought you

167
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,920
some tranquilizing pills,

169
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,000
By the way, how is Chong Zi
doing recently?

170
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,159
I heard she was seriously injured.

171
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,560
I'd like to see her.

172
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Why are you looking for her?

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,639
Since Qinghua has already punished her,

174
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,440
I will naturally let her go.

175
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,240
If I don't even have such a mind,

176
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,000
how can I be worthy of being
Miss Zhuo's disciple?

177
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,479
Lord Yu Xuzi, please don't get me wrong.

178
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,839
Not at all.

179
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,880
I'm just a little surprised.

180
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,920
No one had ever seen her

181
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:54,719
in such a long time.

182
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,320
You are the first.

183
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,240
Go ahead.

184
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,440
Thank you, Lord Yu Xuzi.

185
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,200
(Zizhu Peak)

186
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,479
(Disciple Chong Zi)

187
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,519
(has evil breath in her body,)

188
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,040
(Nanhua)

189
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,159
(which hurt Miss Zhuo and Yue Qiao,)

190
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,039
(and is punished and imprisoned
in the Ice Prison.)

191
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,959
(She will never be released)

192
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,880
(without my permission.)

193
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,360
Master.

194
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
You won't give up on me, will you?

195
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:30,240
(Chong's suffering)

196
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,839
(is far more than mine a thousand times.)

197
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:36,800
(How could I not be ashamed
to relieve the heartache?)

198
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,159
(Luo Yinfan.)

199
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,599
(You have to remember the pain now.)

200
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,719
Chong Zi.

201
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,560
My master died so badly.

202
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,320
Why are you still sleeping here?

203
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,120
Why?

204
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,399
Didn't Luo Yinfan just

205
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,519
get you into a painless dream?

206
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,320
My master taught me this

207
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,680
when she was saving lives.

208
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,000
Since he can make you sleep,

209
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,880
I can make you wake up too.

210
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,399
Master.

211
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,760
Master, save me.

212
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,599
Master, why are you doing this to me?

213
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,000
This is what you deserve.

214
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,240
I don't want to see you anymore.

215
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,240
(Three Years Later)

216
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,639
We haven't seen each other
for three years,

217
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,120
and your swordsmanship
has improved a lot,

218
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,680
becoming sharper and more ruthless.

219
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,079
You didn't come all the way to Jingzhou
to find me

220
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,680
just to tell me these things, did you?

221
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,240
My father and I had a big fight

222
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,800
because of Chong Zi.

223
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,320
Three years.

224
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:29,120
I was punished to reflect on myself
for three full years.

225
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,719
But so what?

226
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,639
Luo Yinfan still sent Chong Zi
back to the Ice Prison.

227
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,719
I shouldn't have believed him back then.

228
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,279
You should say that

229
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,560
you shouldn't have believed me.

230
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If I hadn't stopped you...

231
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:45,800
You...

232
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,519
Forget it.

233
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:52,839
You probably didn't expect her

234
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,079
to be ended up like this at that time.

235
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
The funny thing is that she accepted it.

236
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,920
You're right.

237
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,279
We are outsiders after all

238
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,920
in a lot of things.

239
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,800
So what?

240
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,800
I'd rather be wrong.

241
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,440
It's the first time
I saw you drink alone.

242
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,320
It's rare.

243
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:31,639
Here.

244
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:37,960
In fact, you were not only persuading me

245
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,119
but also yourself.

246
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,720
After all, it is normal for me to be crazy.

247
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:45,119
But I really want to

248
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,600
see you go crazy.

249
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,279
Three years have passed.

250
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,080
Even if I refuse to obey in my heart,

251
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,759
my mind settles as still water.

252
00:17:57,999 --> 00:17:59,680
Don't tell me you regret it.

253
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:01,039
I do.

254
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Maybe my full-out result

255
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,200
would not be better than it is now.

256
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,159
But at least I won't

257
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:16,359
feel the wine tastes so bad as I do now.

258
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,399
Have you seen her

259
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,480
in the past three years?

260
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,920
I dare not go,

261
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,399
and no one dares to go.

262
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,720
It's cold, why are you sitting outside?

263
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,239
It has been three years

264
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,320
and I haven't recovered.

265
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,440
I'm afraid I won't
make it through the fall.

266
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Don't talk nonsense.

267
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,399
You are fine.

268
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,039
You have to watch the beautiful scenery
of the mountains every day with me.

269
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,239
Here.

270
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,279
Some things cannot be forced.

271
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,119
The mountain scenery is pleasant,

272
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,320
but there are always times of depression.

273
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,600
You accompanied me and took care of me
all these years,

274
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,239
living in seclusion in the mountains.

275
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,759
I will always keep in mind

276
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,440
all your meticulous care.

277
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,039
But when will this life

278
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,879
come to an end?

279
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:33,920
Darling.

280
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,320
I do everything for you willingly.

281
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,359
You don't have to think about it.

282
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,159
A happy state of mind

283
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,800
is good for your health.

284
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,600
But I have been with

285
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,680
the bitter medicine all day long,

286
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,320
and even my life has become
more and more narrow.

287
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,600
Shuixian.

288
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,279
Why don't we go out for a walk
some other day?

289
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,440
I'll feel happy even if we go to town.

290
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:02,759
No way.

291
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:05,359
Recently, the demons have been
causing troubles and people are noisy.

292
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,320
Maybe it will affect you.

293
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:09,039
I would never take that risk.

294
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,359
Darling.

295
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,960
Are you tired of

296
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,560
staying with me?

297
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:18,759
You fool.

298
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,920
How come?

299
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,920
I don't want to go anywhere,

300
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,519
I just want to be with you.

301
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:27,639
Okay.

302
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,440
Take the medicine.

303
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,239
Who sent you here?

304
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,480
Protector Yin is really affectionate.

305
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,519
Not only do you do the hard work
of a mortal,

306
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:55,600
but you also use your spiritual power
to keep him from growing old.

307
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,879
He probably doesn't even know it.

308
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,200
What does it have to do with you?

309
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,320
Take care of yourself and leave me alone.

310
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,720
It has nothing to do with me.

311
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,080
But the Demon King asked you to

312
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,119
bring your mind

313
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
back to your job.

314
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,320
Demon King is going to take actions?

315
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,320
Her evil breath has been revealed so far.

316
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,080
Luo Yinfan worked so hard

317
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,800
to protect her.

318
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,239
Even I'm about to be moved.

319
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,359
Right,

320
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,200
Sha Yihuan?

321
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,920
Kunlun's Ice Chain torture

322
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,560
is something that even the demons
can't match.

323
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,239
Chong Zi would definitely be
worse off than dead.

324
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,279
She is worthy of being
a descendant of Ni Lun

325
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:30,560
and endured for so long.

326
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,800
It's been three years.

327
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,399
According to your instructions,

328
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,480
we waited for her evil breath to appear

329
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,800
before stealing the holy sword.

330
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,200
Now that everything is ready,

331
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,159
why do you still acquiesce

332
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,680
in her staying in the Ice Prison?

333
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,080
I tried my best
to cover up your demon scent

334
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,600
with the leaves of Zhurong fruits,

335
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,639
so that you have been lurking
in the immortal sect to this day.

336
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:59,239
Now is the time for you to
make meritorious deeds.

337
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,840
Only one last step.

338
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:05,600
Get a nice victory.

339
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,879
Take it easy.

340
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,080
My king, please

341
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,200
make Chong Zi suffer less pain

342
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,200
for the sake of our friendship.

343
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,119
No.

344
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,560
It's not me.

345
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,399
It's not me.

346
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,879
How are you doing?

347
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:06,480
What happened to your face?

348
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,920
Do you remember

349
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,999
who kept you locked up here
for three years?

350
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,159
Of course.

351
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:13,480
Great.

352
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,960
Chong Zi has brought us
into such a situation,

353
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,039
she is now being tortured
in the Ice Prison,

354
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,960
and can no longer do evil again.

355
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,279
You're back.

356
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,239
And it's time for our revenge.

357
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,920
We have to make her suffer.

358
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,159
Life in the Ice Prison is worse than death.

359
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,879
How could she be better?

360
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:37,759
Now I just want to start over.

361
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,519
How could you turn hatred into nothing?

362
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,639
Senior.

363
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,639
Senior.

364
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,080
I am no longer qualified

365
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,480
to live up to what you call me.

366
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
No matter what,

367
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,840
it's Nanhua's rules and etiquette.

368
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,279
Are you still blaming me?

369
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,039
Supervisor has been protecting Chong Zi

370
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,800
from letting everyone discover
her evil breath,

371
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,759
but in the end, he failed because of you.

372
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,560
You survived.

373
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,920
But Chong Zi was doomed.

374
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,159
Although it has been three years,

375
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,440
I still can't pretend

376
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,320
that I don't blame you.

377
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,159
She is the one with evil breath.

378
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,080
Why are you all blaming me?

379
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,680
Master blamed me.

380
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,920
Even you are blaming me.

381
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:12,800
I was imprisoned on the Poison Island
for three years,

382
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,480
and I have been

383
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,920
tortured beyond recognition.

384
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,519
I was full of anticipation that

385
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,440
everything would be all right

386
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,960
when I got back.

387
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,519
I didn't expect you

388
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,840
to look at me like this.

389
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,920
Qin Ke.

390
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,960
I have nothing now.

391
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:57,359
You can still start over.

392
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,840
What about us?

393
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,480
Shall we

394
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,879
start over

395
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,359
as if nothing happened?

396
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,480
No way.

397
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,239
As long as Chong Zi hasn't
regained her freedom,

398
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:11,759
I cannot forgive you
from the bottom of my heart.

399
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,840
You will still be my senior,

400
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:19,680
but you will no longer be

401
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,879
that Sima Miaoyuan

402
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,200
who grew up with me.

403
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,399
Councilor.

404
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:01,080
Miaoyuan.

405
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,359
Master.

406
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,519
Master.

407
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,600
I...

408
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:17,639
I'm back.

409
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:22,399
It's been

410
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,840
three years.

411
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,920
I'm glad you are back.

412
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:29,159
I'm glad you are back.

413
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,119
Get up.

414
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,159
Now that your master asked,

415
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:38,560
just get up.

416
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:45,800
Master.

417
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,480
I stayed on the Poison Island
for three years,

418
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,759
and I missed Master

419
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,399
and Nanhua every moment.

420
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,279
It's my fault.

421
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,639
I used to have too many
distracting thoughts

422
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,879
and made many mistakes,

423
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:07,080
which brought shame to you.

424
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,359
In the future, I will definitely
abandon all the distracting thoughts

425
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,999
and devote myself to cultivation.

426
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:14,200
Master.

427
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,080
I want to start over.

428
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,480
Great.

429
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,159
Miaoyuan.

430
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,440
You need to know that

431
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,560
today is different from the past.

432
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,879
I hope you can cultivate from scratch,

433
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,440
temper your mind,

434
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:42,720
and rebuild your immortal bones
to redeem yourself.

435
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,200
Yes, Master.

436
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:47,039
With your current situation,

437
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,720
it is inconvenient for you

438
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,519
to live on Moyun Peak as a senior.

439
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,239
From tomorrow onwards,
you and the juniors

440
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,159
will practice together on Yuchen Peak.

441
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:58,840
You should stay temporarily
on Yuchen Peak,

442
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,399
and truly start over.

443
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,600
Master.

444
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,480
Why should I go to Yuchen Peak?

445
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,440
I don't want to go there.

446
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,879
Didn't you just say that

447
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,720
you want to give up distracting thoughts
and start over?

448
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,519
You forgot it?

449
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,200
But Master...

450
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
Alright, stop it.

451
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,720
Go pack up your luggage.

452
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,600
Yes.

453
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:37,680
Master.

454
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,039
(Chong Zi.)

455
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,600
(Everything I lost today is your fault.)

456
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:57,960
(I'm going to make you suffer
as much as I do.)

457
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:01,720
Councilor.

458
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,840
You are obviously very worried
about Miaoyuan.

459
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,960
Why are you so harsh on her?

460
00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:08,200
If you let her move to Yuchen Peak,

461
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,999
I'm afraid she will find it difficult
to accept it for a while.

462
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,239
If she wants to be my disciple

463
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,159
and Nanhua's senior,

464
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,600
she should behave well

465
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,320
and lead by example.

466
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:25,999
Tell her

467
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,800
to go to the Patriarch's Hall

468
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,680
to worship the patriarchs

469
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,560
before practicing tomorrow.

470
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,200
Let the past

471
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,680
be the past.

472
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,600
Why did you suddenly ask me out?

473
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,960
Don't you want revenge?

474
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,600
Remember what I told you then?

475
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,039
You figured it out?

476
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,279
I lost everything.

477
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,960
No one in the immortal sect
cares about me.

478
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,840
And I have nowhere to go
in the Mortal World.

479
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,119
Chong Zi

480
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,759
ruined everything for me.

481
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,119
It's the same to me.

482
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,399
But

483
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,840
since it's for revenge,

484
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,480
we have to be ruthless

485
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,920
and never give her a way out.

486
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,359
Junior.

487
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,239
Look who's coming to see you.

488
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:11,600
I knew that life in the Ice Prison
would be worse than death.

489
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:14,639
But I didn't expect you
to be so miserable.

490
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,759
How could Supervisor Sage
treat you like this?

491
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,639
I'm relieved

492
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,800
to see you so miserable.

493
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,159
Don't look at me like that.

494
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,480
I am what I am today

495
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,680
because of you.

496
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,119
You deserve to be locked up here
by your master.

497
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,200
Why have you become like this?

498
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,879
What a disappointment.

499
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,639
You didn't go crazy
after being stuck here for three years.

500
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,159
Are you tenacious

501
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,440
or lucky?

502
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,920
Don't you want to kill me?

503
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,039
I'd like to see

504
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,279
how you want to kill me.

505
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,920
Do you want to die?

506
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,800
Kill me if you dare.

507
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,159
If you can't kill me today,

508
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,319
I will kill you

509
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,079
tomorrow.

510
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,079
That's what we came for.

511
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:21,960
Since you want to die,

512
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,839
I will fulfill you.

513
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,639
Even the Ice Prison can't
suppress your evil breath.

514
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,359
You are not only impenitent,

515
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,760
but you dare to continue to
harm your fellow disciples.

516
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,920
Now that I killed him,

517
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,960
you will be the next one.

518
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:24,319
Why are you here?

519
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:26,359
To kill you.

520
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,480
So you are also a demon.

521
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,159
You colluded with Chong Zi.

522
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:34,240
No wonder...

523
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,599
You are in the same group.

524
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:40,680
My master has long discovered that
something was wrong with Chong Zi.

525
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,359
But she never gave herself away.

526
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,799
You lied to Councilor

527
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,639
and all of us!

528
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,079
What about you?

529
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,359
What is your intention

530
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,520
to bring Yue Qiao here to bully Chong Zi?

531
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,319
I didn't mean to kill you.

532
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:54,879
But now it looks like

533
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:57,280
I can't let you get out of here alive.

534
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,520
Do you dare to kill me?

535
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,839
Why not?

536
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:06,760
I am the Ninth Princess
of the Mortal World,

537
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,240
and also the disciple of Councilor.

538
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:12,680
How proud I was.

539
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,000
But it is because of you

540
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,760
that I have come to this point.

541
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,440
What does it have to do with Chong Zi?

542
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,079
It was your own narrow-mindedness

543
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,159
that made you ashamed.

544
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,799
You have become what you are today

545
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,079
because of your own fault.

546
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,480
It's you who deserve all of these.

547
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,720
I am an immortal and you are demons.

548
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,799
Darkness will never triumph over light.

549
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,079
If I die here,

550
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,119
the immortal sect
will definitely not let you go.

551
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:51,799
It's a pity that

552
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,200
no one can hear

553
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,280
your bold words.

554
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:00,399
I am not afraid of death.

555
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:05,399
Nanhua will avenge me.

556
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,720
I'm just not reconciled

557
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,079
to not being able to kill Chong Zi
with my own hands.

558
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,399
But even if I die,

559
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:22,680
I will never be killed by you.

560
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,040
Chong Zi.

561
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,200
Chongzi.

562
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:56,960
It's me.

563
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,359
Luo Yinfan is so cruel.

564
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:10,000
Finally someone came to see me.

565
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,960
Don't you understand?

566
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,159
I was the one who made you
fall into a nightmare

567
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,760
that night when Miss Zhuo was killed.

568
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,920
I know you don't want to believe it.

569
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,559
But it's all my doing.

570
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,000
Without them leading the way,

571
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,000
I would never have been able
to step into the Ice Prison.

572
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,639
It's not in vain that

573
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,639
I have spent the past three years

574
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,319
trying to lure these two in.

575
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,680
One is a brute

576
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,960
and the other is with an evil heart.

577
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,680
What a perfect match.

578
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,040
My real name is not Yan Zhenzhu.

579
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,440
I'm Sha Yihuan,
protector of the Demon World.

580
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,520
You must have heard my name

581
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,399
from Supervisor Sage.

582
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,040
Manipulating dreams

583
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,520
is what I am best at.

584
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:22,799
Those dreams of yours

585
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:25,319
are all under my control.

586
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,720
So Miss Zhuo...

587
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:34,399
It was you.

588
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,319
Right.

589
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,639
You were sent to the Ice Prison

590
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,639
because of her.

591
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,480
Why did you do this?

592
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,879
Don't ask me why I did this.

593
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,000
Do you know who you are?

594
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,639
I...

595
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,879
I'm Chong Zi.
