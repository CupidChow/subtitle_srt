=Episode 5=

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,439
Greetings, Father.

29
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:46,960
Well...

30
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,280
Look.

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,479
You didn't even change
before you came to see the guests.

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,199
Do you know what decency is?

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,799
It isn't your birthday until tomorrow.

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,960
I thought it was early,

35
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,959
so I didn't put on the new robe.

36
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,399
Is there anything wrong?

37
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:28,839
You're a grown-up,
but you're still mucking around!

38
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,599
You can teach me to sit in meditation.

39
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,679
You!

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,599
Don't you think I drew well?

41
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,640
Chong, don't be rude.

42
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,080
Stand back.

43
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,000
My disciple is naughty.

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,479
She really lacks manners.

45
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:09,199
Please forgive her.

46
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,319
Mr. Luo, never mind.

47
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:13,720
My son mucked around first.

48
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,720
He deserves a lesson.

49
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:18,039
Your disciple is clever
and quick-witted.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,640
She seems to be the only one

51
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,199
that can restrain

52
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,280
my lawless son.

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,160
Yes. In that case,

54
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,640
Chong Zi, why don't you marry me

55
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:31,399
and restrain me for my father?

56
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,440
What do you think?

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,240
Don't talk nonsense!

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,640
Don't be rude.

59
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,640
Mr. Luo,

60
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,280
if we can connect our sects

61
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:44,920
through this marriage,

62
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,199
I'll be more than pleased.

63
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,520
What is

64
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,800
your opinion?

65
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,640
My disciple is still young.

66
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,880
It's too early to consider her marriage.

67
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,759
My age is irrelevant.

68
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,039
Even if I'm old,
I don't want to marry you.

69
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,440
If you don't want to,

70
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,280
nobody can force you.

71
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,640
Mr. Luo, I don't think
you're a good master.

72
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,199
You don't even teach her skills.

73
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,080
Why don't you give her to me?

74
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,520
We will teach her.

75
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,000
Shut up!

76
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,520
How dare you talk nonsense
in front of Mr. Luo?

77
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,000
Apologize!

78
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,839
I didn't talk nonsense.

79
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:19,759
Mr. Luo does have boundless power.

80
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,599
But he hasn't taught Chong Zi anything.

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,879
You...

82
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:24,199
- Of the masters present,
- You...

83
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,319
which one wouldn't
teach their disciples?

84
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,759
If he wouldn't teach her,

85
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,159
he shouldn't be called a master.

86
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:29,520
You!

87
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,279
The most valuable virtue

88
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,719
of a master is to suit the teaching

89
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,039
to the ability of his disciples.

90
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,920
Mr. Luo has his own way
to teach his disciple.

91
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,400
How can you figure it out

92
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,520
in such a short time?

93
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,960
(What a beautiful lady!)

94
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,599
Aunt.

95
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,279
Have you realized your mistake?

96
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,279
Aunt, you're finally back.

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,039
I thought I couldn't see you

98
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:04,080
at my father's birthday banquet.

99
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,640
You didn't answer me.

100
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,960
Did you hear what I just said?

101
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:09,879
Yes, I did. I heard it all.

102
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:11,560
Aunt, it's good to have you back.

103
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,439
Get back to your seat.

104
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,039
Don't talk nonsense again.

105
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,520
Yao.

106
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,080
So you do know the way home.

107
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,560
I've stayed
in the Mortal World for years

108
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,400
without coming back to see you.

109
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,680
Please forgive me.

110
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,400
It's good to have you back.

111
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,560
Come.

112
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,719
Mr. Luo,

113
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,759
it's been a long time.

114
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:04,080
Yes, indeed.

115
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:05,360
Chong,

116
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,999
this is Miss Zhuo Yunji.

117
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,360
Hello, Miss Zhuo.

118
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,159
Miss Zhuo,

119
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,560
this is my disciple, Chong Zi.

120
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:18,560
Chong, nice to meet you.

121
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,279
This is the Condensation Pill
I prepared for Mr. Luo.

122
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,159
Would you like it?

123
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:34,960
Thanks, Miss Zhuo.

124
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,960
Mr. Luo, since everyone is here,

125
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,439
let's get down to business.

126
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,439
What do you think of our plan?

127
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,999
Feel free to voice your opinion.

128
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,680
I think it's the best plan
to use Gong Keran

129
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,159
to draw Wan Jie out.

130
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,120
The two of them acted in collusion

131
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,640
and wouldn't make a clean break.

132
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,879
It's Gong Keran's own fault

133
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,360
that she has ended up like this.

134
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,800
How can you say that my niece

135
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,759
acted in collusion with Wan Jie?

136
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,840
She is a poor woman, after all.

137
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:06,960
Yes.

138
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,319
Gong Keran is a poor woman,

139
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:10,999
but she has a marriage contract

140
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,439
with Wan Jie, doesn't she?

141
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,199
I didn't mean she shouldn't help.

142
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,879
I feel sorry for Keran,

143
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,999
but if we use her relationship
with Wan Jie

144
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:21,279
to catch him,

145
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,400
she can atone for her crime.

146
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,360
Mr. Luo,

147
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:27,879
what's your opinion?

148
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,800
We don't need Miss Gong to take risks.

149
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,920
There are other ways
to draw Wan Jie out.

150
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:38,680
Did you ask Miss Gong's opinion

151
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,640
before you made the plan?

152
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,439
When I was in the Mortal World,

153
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:43,400
I heard that hunters

154
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,319
would sew up the eyes of female birds.

155
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:46,319
When the female birds heard

156
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,999
their fellow birds flying by,

157
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,640
they would cry for help.

158
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,240
Then male birds would fall into the trap

159
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,560
and be caught in a net.

160
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,640
What the immortal sects do

161
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,879
is no different from that

162
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,039
illiterate countrymen do.

163
00:07:58,599 --> 00:07:59,960
Chong Zi is right.

164
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
We shouldn't

165
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,279
treat Miss Gong in this way.

166
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,599
You're only a little disciple.

167
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,640
What right do you have
to make wild comments?

168
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,439
The Immortal World

169
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,439
shoulders the responsibility
of guarding the world.

170
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,080
How can you compare us with mortals?

171
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,120
That is what I taught my disciple.

172
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,800
If we don't do things
better than mortals,

173
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:25,840
how can we be immortals?

174
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,120
Master, I want to go back.

175
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,840
I don't want to stay here.

176
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,399
OK.

177
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,959
Let's go back, then.

178
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:49,800
Are they really going to leave?

179
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:14,680
Master, did I say something wrong

180
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,680
and cause you trouble again?

181
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,519
They are far less

182
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,039
insightful than my disciple.

183
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:22,240
I don't want to talk to them.

184
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,159
I'm scared.

185
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,079
I thought

186
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,279
you would scold me.

187
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,039
How could I?

188
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,440
Mr. Luo.

189
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,360
Miss Zhuo.

190
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:34,880
Please call me Yunji

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,320
as you used to.

192
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,279
You are really wronged.

193
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,159
They went too far saying those words

194
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,680
in the hall.

195
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,839
I was reckless.

196
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,680
I must look ignorant.

197
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,000
You're forthright and sincere.
I like it.

198
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,079
Yinfan, you've chosen a good disciple.

199
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,039
By the way,

200
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,000
do you remember the swordsmanship

201
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,760
you taught me when we parted?

202
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,639
I want to ask for your advice

203
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,839
on some problems privately.

204
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,039
Chong, if you're tired,

205
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,039
go to rest first.

206
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,639
I'll talk with Miss Zhuo
for a few minutes before I go back.

207
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,719
So beautiful!

208
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,479
Look at Miss Zhuo.

209
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:20,440
She is not only beautiful
but also talks nicely

210
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,920
and excels in magical skills.

211
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,560
Everyone respects her.

212
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,120
What about me?

213
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,240
I can't hold my alcohol.

214
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,440
I like to eat and sleep.

215
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,320
Apart from that,

216
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,120
I can only draw turtles.

217
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,399
You practiced very hard in those days.

218
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,399
Now it has been years.

219
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,560
You seem to not have made progress.

220
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,959
With an obsession,

221
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,120
how could I make progress?

222
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,519
If it's an obsession,

223
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,360
you should put it aside
as soon as possible.

224
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,560
When you get rid of it,

225
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,880
you'll find a different world.

226
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,880
I heard that you worked hard
at making medicine in recent years,

227
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,560
and had made some achievements.

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,519
Using the skill to help people
is boundless kindness.

229
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,360
Your success equals failure.

230
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,200
You didn't give up cultivation in vain.

231
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,560
You're right.

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,800
I feel ashamed.

233
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,639
I have business to do.

234
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,599
See you, then.

235
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,479
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

236
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,839
I bumped into you carelessly.

237
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,440
Are you all right?

238
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,920
Get up.

239
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,880
Don't blame yourself for such a trifle.

240
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,800
But you

241
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,519
look unfamiliar.

242
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
I saved her a few days ago.

243
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:49,880
Her name is Ting Xue.

244
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,760
She knows simple medical skills.

245
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,079
She is smart and thoughtful.

246
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,279
Now that fate makes you meet,

247
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,000
why don't you take her as your disciple

248
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,880
and teach her medicine?

249
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,519
I find the kid adorable.

250
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,800
She has good aptitude.

251
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,200
She'll make achievements

252
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,560
if she learns from you.

253
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,760
Miss Zhuo,

254
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,479
I have humble origins.

255
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,800
Nobody wants to accept me.

256
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,880
If you don't mind,

257
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,440
I'll always follow your instructions.

258
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
Get up.

259
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,039
Young lady,

260
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,479
wait and see.

261
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,880
I must pay you back next time.

262
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,360
Father!

263
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,800
You didn't even know
the little girl had schemed against you.

264
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,880
Don't you think it's disgraceful?

265
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,519
Who knows she is so bold

266
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,599
and dares to provoke me?

267
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,399
Finally, someone can restrain you.

268
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,519
I'm so relieved.

269
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,760
Father, are you enjoying
my discomfiture?

270
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,560
You finally met your match.

271
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,519
Min Yunzhong wants to

272
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,039
marry his grandniece off to you.

273
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,200
But in my opinion,

274
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
she's not even close

275
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:22,399
to that smart little girl.

276
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,560
By the way,

277
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,240
something big will happen tomorrow.

278
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,760
You stay with

279
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,240
your young lady

280
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,599
in her room.

281
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Don't go anywhere.

282
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,760
What's the big thing?

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,120
I'm going, too.

284
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,279
Stop messing about!

285
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,120
We even need Luo Yinfan's help
to cope with the thing.

286
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,680
How can you handle it?

287
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,680
Don't make trouble,

288
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,599
lest I have to take care of you.

289
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,959
Master.

290
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,680
Master.

291
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,560
I gave Ting Xue to Miss Zhuo.

292
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,320
I asked her to call Miss Zhuo master

293
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560
and learn medicine from her.

294
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:46,320
Great.

295
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,880
Xue has her own master, too.

296
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,240
She won't be bullied again.

297
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,599
So...

298
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,519
Master.

299
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:58,360
What else do you want to say?

300
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,440
I want to know,

301
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,399
if you...

302
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,240
you'll marry Miss Zhuo.

303
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,599
Don't talk nonsense.

304
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,200
I didn't.

305
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,719
Lord Zhuo tried to bring you
and Miss Zhuo together.

306
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,240
I can tell that

307
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,440
Miss Zhuo likes you.

308
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,760
Absolute nonsense.

309
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,200
Many years ago,
I thought she was talented,

310
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,719
and gave her a little advice.

311
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,240
I regard her as a friend.

312
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,279
When you get married,

313
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,039
will you marry me off?

314
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,320
What are you thinking about?

315
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,959
Do you want to get married
at such a young age?

316
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,839
So you won't marry her?

317
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,120
I won't.

318
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,599
Don't forget the purpose of our trip.

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,079
Wan Jie will come tomorrow night.

320
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,440
This place is quiet.

321
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:40,000
He won't pay attention to it.

322
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,440
Though Zhuo Hao is young,

323
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,880
he has made achievements.

324
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,920
Mr. Zhuo told me that he would

325
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,320
let Zhuo Hao take care of you.

326
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,680
No.

327
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,479
Fine.

328
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,800
If you don't want him
to take care of you,

329
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,599
you must stay in your room

330
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,519
and not go anywhere.

331
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,880
How

332
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,279
are you doing?

333
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,279
Why are you here?

334
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,840
You want to die?

335
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,560
I won't die.

336
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:16,999
Neither can you.

337
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,560
Who do you think you are?

338
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,960
We have nothing to do with each other.

339
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,519
My life or death
is none of your business.

340
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,639
Tomorrow, when everyone

341
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,639
is at the banquet and unprepared,

342
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,519
I'll break Luo Yinfan's shield.

343
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,879
Then,

344
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,759
we can leave

345
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:30,519
this place together.

346
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:31,879
Are you insane?

347
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,560
They lock me up here

348
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,600
just to lure you into the trap.

349
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,920
We should break up.

350
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,960
Why do we have to torment each other?

351
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,960
Keran, are you OK?

352
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,359
I never thought the demon scent

353
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,440
on the sword was so powerful.

354
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,159
What about the demon sword?

355
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,159
No matter how powerful Ni Lun was,

356
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:58,960
he no longer exists.

357
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,440
We don't have to be afraid of him.

358
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,359
I've suppressed the demon breath

359
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,279
on the sword.

360
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,840
You can rest assured.

361
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,320
Lord, Chu,

362
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,560
the residual demon breath here
is too strong.

363
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:14,879
Many people

364
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:16,480
were hurt just now.

365
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,119
Now that we've got the demon sword,

366
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,639
we should leave quickly.

367
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,960
OK.

368
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:30,960
Why don't we go to Chenzhou first?

369
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,800
There we'll have a place to stay.

370
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,440
Let me save her.

371
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,200
Wan Jie,

372
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,720
no!

373
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,200
Sir, I've brought hot water

374
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,359
for you to soak your feet.

375
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:10,960
It's what mortals do.

376
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,279
Immortals don't need this.

377
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:22,759
If you don't want it,

378
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,279
let me warm your quilt.

379
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,639
Wait.

380
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:29,800
Even if I were a mortal,

381
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,239
I wouldn't need you

382
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,359
to do such useless things for me.

383
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm leaving tomorrow.

384
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,879
I may never see you again.

385
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,560
I...

386
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,440
I couldn't ask you
in front of Miss Zhuo.

387
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,320
But thinking it over and over,

388
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
I still want to know

389
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,639
if you can take me as your disciple.

390
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,879
I can do whatever Chong Zi does.

391
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,399
I'll do even better than her.

392
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,159
Please give me a chance.

393
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,879
I only recruit one disciple.

394
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:11,279
I'll forget this ever happened.

395
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,800
Leave.

396
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,239
But I have to tell you,

397
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:15,840
you are not even close

398
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,359
to Chong.

399
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,560
Then why did you save me?

400
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:23,039
You gave me hope but refused to
take me as your disciple.

401
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,519
Now you're driving me away.

402
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:25,879
Why?

403
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,399
Let me say it again.

404
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,639
I only recruit one disciple.

405
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,119
Get back and think it over.

406
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:57,399
Why do you treat me in this way?

407
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,039
Why do you drive me away?

408
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,680
Why could Chong Zi win your favor?

409
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,920
I'm no inferior to her.

410
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,600
It's really boring when Master is out.

411
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:23,920
I wonder what he is doing now.

412
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,720
Is he with Miss Zhuo?

413
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,399
They are really a good match.

414
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,800
And I'm a big problem.

415
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,080
Young lady.

416
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,119
Wanna run?

417
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:41,399
Let me go.

418
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,600
Why do you always bully me?

419
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,999
Aren't you ashamed?

420
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,639
I underestimated you.

421
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,080
You dared to make a fool of me

422
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,119
in front of so many people.

423
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,279
Of course you underestimated me.

424
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,720
It was no big deal.

425
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,720
If you don't let me go,

426
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,920
I'll draw another one on you

427
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,039
and let everyone know.

428
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,359
I'm going to tell my master.

429
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,119
Tell your master?

430
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:05,320
My father already told him that

431
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,920
he would let me accompany you.

432
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,039
If you don't behave or stay here,

433
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,999
I'll have to be unpleasant.

434
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:14,239
I don't need you to take care of me!

435
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,879
I haven't got even with you
for what happened yesterday.

436
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,239
Look how I will fix you today!

437
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,119
Get even for what?

438
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:19,480
It's tit-for-tat at most.

439
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,440
We're even.

440
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,680
If you dare to bully me again,

441
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,159
I'll tell your father.

442
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,639
Call me honey,

443
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
then I'll spare you.

444
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,680
Frivolous man. No way!

445
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,039
You swore at me?

446
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,999
Let me hear your swear again.

447
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,879
I don't think

448
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,600
you can do it now.

449
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,720
All right, I was just kidding.

450
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:54,039
Why are you crying?

451
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,200
Girls are such a pain in the ass.

452
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,080
Well, if you behave,

453
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,159
I'll lift the spell on you, OK?

454
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:09,279
Lord Zhuo, your son is bullying me again!

455
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,879
Believe it or not,
I'll throw you into the sea.

456
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,680
Keran.

457
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:37,200
We're surrounded.

458
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:38,320
You can't escape with me.

459
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,600
Just go.

460
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,159
I'll never

461
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,480
let go of your hand.

462
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:02,119
Why do you keep pestering me?

463
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:03,800
Because I've been waiting for you.

464
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,440
Tell me the answer.

465
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:07,480
As you can see,

466
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,279
the demon sword is in my hand now.

467
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,279
I don't care

468
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,920
what you think.

469
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:36,039
If you want to be dumb,

470
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,359
suit yourself.

471
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,320
I've created a shield around the house.

472
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,680
You can't go anywhere.

473
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,840
Stay put.

474
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,279
I'm going back to take a nap.

475
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,239
I'll come to fix you when I wake up.

476
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,080
(Zhuo Hao came here so early.)

477
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,359
(Wan Jie must have gone to)

478
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:00,080
(the Dragon Abyss to save Miss Gong.)

479
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,720
(I wonder how)

480
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,359
(Master is doing now.)

481
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,119
(Let me go.)

482
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,720
(You must leave with me today.)

483
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:11,279
(What right do you have to say that?)

484
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,200
(If it weren't for you,)

485
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,999
(would I get homeless and tortured?)

486
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,600
(Everyone has gone to the Dragon Abyss.)

487
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,840
(Who would come here?)

488
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,119
You've got my father

489
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,639
and my fellow brothers killed.

490
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,080
Don't torture me again.

491
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:34,239
If you really want to save me,

492
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,920
go to die.

493
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,440
After you die,

494
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,920
nobody will bother me again.

495
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:45,440
(Then I can live.)

496
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,279
If you really think so,

497
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,759
I will do that.

498
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:52,359
Where are you going?

499
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:54,440
How hard can it be?

500
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,600
I'm going out now.

501
00:26:57,639 --> 00:26:59,639
It's just what Luo Yinfan wants.

502
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,600
Stop.

503
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,759
Your life belongs to me.

504
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,759
You must die in my hands.

505
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,359
Chong!

506
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,879
Chong!

507
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
You're

508
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,279
Wang Yue, the Demon King?

509
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,680
Miss Gong,

510
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,759
it's been a long time.

511
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,480
I can't stay in the Demon World.

512
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,200
Let me go.

513
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,320
Is it worth putting yourself

514
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,999
in such a tight corner?

515
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,119
You'll never understand.

516
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,639
Don't I understand?

517
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,960
Those immortals and demons like you

518
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,080
are no different from amorous youths.

519
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:37,119
You should leave.

520
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,399
Go.

521
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,080
Next time,

522
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:50,759
I may not save you.

523
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,200
Chong.

524
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,159
Chong.

525
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:10,879
Chong.

526
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,600
Master.

527
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,200
Do you feel better?

528
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:18,039
That man

529
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,039
didn't hurt you, did he?

530
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,720
Silly girl.

531
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:24,279
You've followed me long enough.

532
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
When did you see me get hurt?

533
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,759
Chong.

534
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,320
Young lady!

535
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:37,519
Young lady, you...

536
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,320
How is Chong Zi?

537
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,200
Nothing serious.

538
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,119
Only her primordial spirit
has been damaged.

539
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:47,519
It's all your fault.

540
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:48,960
If you didn't sneak away

541
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,960
or trap Chong Zi here,

542
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:51,440
how could she suffer such a severe injury?

543
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,759
They are just kids.

544
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,600
Hao already feels guilty.

545
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,279
Don't blame him.

546
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,480
Come.

547
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,879
I think Wan Jie didn't intend to
damage her primordial spirit,

548
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:13,759
only his demon breath was too strong.

549
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,999
I have a prescription for her.

550
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,320
There's an adjuvant,

551
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,960
Red Moon Glossy Ganoderma,

552
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,600
which can only be found
in Nanhua Mountain.

553
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,879
You'd better take her back

554
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:28,560
for treatment.

555
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,639
Chong,

556
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,039
does it still hurt?

557
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,680
Master.

558
00:30:58,879 --> 00:30:59,960
Don't worry.

559
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,399
I've found you a miracle medicine.

560
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:04,680
I'll bring it to you
after it's decocted.

561
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,080
I don't want it.

562
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,800
Medicine is bitter.

563
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,039
Be good.

564
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,600
Your breath is very weak now.

565
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,600
Red Moon Glossy Ganoderma
can gather energy and breath.

566
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:14,720
It's good for you.

567
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,560
Really?

568
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,639
Have I ever lied to you?

569
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,920
If you feel bad,

570
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,720
stop talking.

571
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,359
Have a good sleep.

572
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:32,200
When you wake up,

573
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,440
everything will be fine.

574
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,159
I believe you, Master.

575
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,159
You are

576
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,519
the best medicine for me.

577
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,159
(Her breath is still faint.)

578
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,639
(I can't let it go on like this.)

579
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,200

(Chonghua Palace?)

587
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,080
(I'm back?)

588
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,680
(So, Master...)

589
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,759
You're...

590
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:12,680
Don't yell. I only took a nap.

591
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,320
I didn't mean to fall asleep.

592
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,800
You've just recovered
from a serious illness.

593
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,159
You need to nourish your spirit.

594
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:19,239
If you yell, your liver fire will grow.

595
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,399
You look much better now.

596
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,720
Right?
The medicine I decocted is effective.

597
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,200
Are you kidding me?

598
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,800
You almost smothered me.

599
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,039
You...

600
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,200
Who are you?

601
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,159
Me?

602
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,279
I'm here to take care of you
for Mr. Luo.

603
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,119
Yeah, I haven't told you my name.

604
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:40,519
I'm the 361st generation

605
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,920
of the disciples of Nanhua.

606
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:43,560
My master is Sage Tianji.

607
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,239
I'm the Idle Spell Immortal
specializing in refining medicine,

608
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,960
Yan Zhenzhu.

609
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:49,480
Spell Immortal specializing in
refining medicine?

610
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,080
Is there such kind of immortal
in Nanhua?

611
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,759
Nanhua is very big.

612
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:56,720
There are Sword Immortals
like your master and Councilor Sage,

613
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,159
who keep up our appearances

614
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,480
as well as Idle Immortals like me,

615
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,359
who spend the days at ease.

616
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,239
It doesn't matter, though.

617
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,920
Mr. Luo ordered me

618
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:08,399
to make you take the medicine.

619
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Come, open your mouth.

620
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,879
No. The smell is terrible.

621
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:13,879
Master said he wouldn't
make me take the medicine.

622
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,359
Really?

623
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,760
How does that work?

624
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,159
Do you want Mr. Luo to give you
artificial breath every day?

625
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,359
He's been doing that for days.

626
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,559
You should give him a break.

627
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,319
Artificial breath?

628
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,599
Master?

629
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,559
Of course.

630
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,960
When you were in a coma these days,

631
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,440
your master not only took care of you

632
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,799
but also asked Councilor Sage
for medicine.

633
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,920
If not, where do you think

634
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,200
the rare Red Moon Glossy Ganoderma

635
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,879
comes from?

636
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,599
So...

637
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,920
Why are you blushing?

638
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,799
I wasn't dreaming.

639
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,000
You...

640
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,559
Well, isn't it sweet?

641
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,119
Come on.

642
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,960
No, you must take it.

643
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,520
You're here as expected.

644
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,760
Where is Wan Jie?

645
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,879
Shouldn't I ask you this question?

646
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,879
How do I know where he is?

647
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,799
He saved you in the Qinghua Sect

648
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,000
and ran here with you.

649
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,000
Why don't you know where he is?

650
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,159
Did you see with your own eyes

651
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:35,440
that he ran here with me?

652
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,079
I...

653
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:38,319
The sages of Qinghua

654
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:40,079
made every preparation to catch Wan Jie.

655
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,639
If you didn't collaborate with him,

656
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,839
voluntarily help him,

657
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:46,440
or have something to do with him,

658
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,359
I really couldn't think of a good reason

659
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,839
to explain how you
escaped from the East Sea.

660
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,720
Miss Gong,

661
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,559
I'm not Lord Ming.

662
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:58,359
I won't be partial to you.

663
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,359
We've gone our separate ways already.

664
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,119
How could I collaborate with him?

665
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,000
You did...

666
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,119
Say one more word,

667
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,319
and I'll cut your tongue out.

668
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,599
It doesn't matter if you deny it.

669
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,680
Since you are here,

670
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,000
he mustn't be far away.

671
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,920
Miss Gong,

672
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,280
please come with us.

673
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,319
What if I say no?

674
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,520
If so,

675
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,879
we'll have to use force.

676
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,680
As long as you are in our hands,

677
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,159
he'll eventually show up.

678
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:48,960
Formation!

679
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,079
Yes!

680
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,159
Chong Zi, you look much better recently.

681
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,879
Mr. Luo does take great care of you.

682
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,159
Come on. Take out your magic weapon

683
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:12,079
and show me a couple of moves.

684
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,760
Magic weapon?

685
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,280
Don't you have one?

686
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,280
Seriously?

687
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,319
As an Idle Immortal, I even have one.

688
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,639
I guess

689
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,799
Mr. Luo must have his own plan.

690
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:31,720
Don't think too much.

691
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,440
He is so fond of you.

692
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,040
Even though he didn't
give you a magic weapon,

693
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,399
he must have taught you a few moves.

694
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,319
No?

695
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,319
That's odd.

696
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,599
He neither gave you a weapon
nor taught you any skills.

697
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,440
Does he intend to

698
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,720
raise you as trash?

699
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,799
Isn't she trash?

700
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:55,920
I heard that you let Wan Jie run away

701
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,359
and were injured by him.

702
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,359
Shame on you!

703
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,520
Is Wan Jie someone

704
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,799
we can take on alone?

705
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,159
Don't you think

706
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:05,000
it's a huge imposition?

707
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,200
To you, it is.

708
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,399
If it were me,

709
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,879
I wouldn't let him slip off so easily.

710
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:15,280
Though you have
the most powerful master,

711
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,839
you can only take a beating

712
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,200
facing a demon.

713
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:19,599
Mr. Luo must have been blind

714
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,399
to choose you as his disciple.

715
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:23,960
It's scary when you stare at me.

716
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:26,079
Which country woman
did you learn that from?

717
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:28,119
Mr. Luo doesn't teach that.

718
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,760
How dare you?

719
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,240
Why dare I not?

720
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,159
I'm not the one
whose magic weapon was snatched.

721
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,720
I never thought that your magic weapon

722
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,639
was used to cut your own neck.

723
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:46,960
The sword looks quite sharp.

724
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,359
Shall I try it?

725
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,399
Try what?

726
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,799
The sword.

727
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,680
I'm trash who doesn't
have a magic weapon.

728
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,000
And I don't know martial arts.

729
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,440
It will be normal if my hand

730
00:38:57,799 --> 00:38:58,839
shakes a little.

731
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
You...

732
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,920
Just now...

733
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:03,839
Just now, I was wrong.

734
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,480
I apologize.

735
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,920
Put down the sword first.

736
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,440
Chong Zi,

737
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:09,920
let her go.

738
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,520
Only to me?

739
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:14,159
Anyone else?

740
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:19,040
I'm sorry.

741
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,079
You scum...

742
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,280
If you slander my master again,

743
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,280
I won't spare you.

744
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:26,559
You...

745
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,079
She was right.

746
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,399
I'm trash.

747
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,559
Nonsense.

748
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:48,159
Trash can't snatch a sword

749
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,079
with bare hands.

750
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:52,040
Master.

751
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,240
Did you see that?

752
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,960
I didn't mean to make her suffer, I...

753
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,440
I just couldn't restrain my anger.

754
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,079
Chong,

755
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:03,879
do you really want a magic weapon?

756
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,119
No, no.

757
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,760
I haven't reached that level.

758
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,559
I don't have the right.

759
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,839
Master, if I say I want one,

760
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,000
will you blame me?

761
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,639
Silly girl.

762
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,920
The other day when I met Wan Jie,

763
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,520
if I had been a little useful,

764
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,079
you wouldn't have to
look for medicine around for me.

765
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:32,040
I don't want to
hide behind you all the time.

766
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,920
You do need something for self-defense.

767
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,920
Let me take you to pick your weapon.

768
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:52,920
Take a look.

769
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,879
Pick the one you like.

770
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:07,280
Master, shall I pick a sword

771
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,000
or something else?

772
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,599
Nanhua is the sword sect.

773
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,159
We usually use swords to fight enemies.

774
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,520
Because a sword has a sharp edge
and is convenient to attack.

775
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,359
But you don't have to use a sword.

776
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,159
Anything handy can be a magic weapon.

777
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:22,599
Even a piece of wood
or a roll of bamboo slips

778
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,599
will grow

779
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:25,480
a connection with its master over time.

780
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,280
But a good magic weapon

781
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,839
has a natural nimbus.

782
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,760
It can yield twice the result with half
the effort in defending or attacking.

783
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,879
But once you choose a magic weapon,

784
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,639
you shouldn't abandon it at will.

785
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,000
Otherwise, you can hardly

786
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,920
find another handy weapon again.

787
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:48,520
Master, would you pick one for me?

788
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,599
When I passed by Kunlun Mountain
200 years ago,

789
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,399
I unexpectedly got a piece of dark iron
that fell from the sky.

790
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,319
I intended to cast it into a sword
with the purest spirit stones

791
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,480
on Buzhou Mountain,

792
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,240
but the iron was very odd.

793
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,119
It seemed to come from the God World
and was extremely hard to melt.

794
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,359
In the end, I only made it into a staff.

795
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,639
Look, do you like it?

796
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,280
I like it.

797
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,480
Master, give it a name.

798
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,520
The stars are dimmer than the moon,

799
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,720
but they're never ashamed of it.

800
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:41,760
Still, they shine all over the world
and spread benefit to the people.

801
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,240
I hope that you won't
think lightly of yourself.

802
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:45,599
You should care about the people

803
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:47,559
just like the stars shining in the sky.

804
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,159
So, let's call it

805
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,319
Starlight.

806
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,960
With natural righteousness,

807
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,359
the original iron wouldn't
regard an evil person as its master.

808
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,159
Starlight is even more so.

809
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,839
Since it chooses you,

810
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,920
it must know that your heart is pure
and it's willing to serve you.

811
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,359
I'll take good care of you.

812
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,920
You should be good, too.

813
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:34,240
Starlight has no edge

814
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,040
and isn't as good as a sword
in attacking.

815
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,760
But it's more than enough for defense.

816
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,319
I want you to be less aggressive
and more restrained.

817
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:41,960
Don't be competitive

818
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,839
or hurt others.

819
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,159
Use it to protect yourself well.

820
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,280
To protect myself well,

821
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,879
shall I learn some skills?

822
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,879
Suppose

823
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,520
you learn some
self-defense skills first?

824
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,280
I get it.
