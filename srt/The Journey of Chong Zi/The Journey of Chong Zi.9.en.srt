=Episode 9=

28
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:10,325
Let me go if you dare.

29
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:11,444
Why are you

30
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:12,804
trapping me here?

31
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:18,404
Silence.

32
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:35,764
(Master said that this sword,)

33
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:37,404
(like Tianmo Token,)

34
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:39,404
(seals half of the demon power of Ni Lun.)

35
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,725
(If it was used to harm the six worlds...)

36
00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:59,245
Beat her.

37
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,645
You still like to use this trick
after all these years.

38
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:04,805
Why do you deny that
you are Mr. Immortal?

39
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:17,484
It seems that I haven't
taught you enough.

40
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:20,604
You can't destroy this sword.

41
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:23,365
Neither can you escape from here.

42
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:25,645
Stop wasting your time.

43
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:27,204
I know that

44
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:29,005
you colluded with Nanhua's spy

45
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,484
to deliberately take me here.

46
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:33,324
Smart.

47
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:35,285
You found it out.

48
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:37,564
Few people know about my
going to Immortal Prison.

49
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:39,445
Since you attacked us on the way,

50
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:42,165
someone must have tipped you off.

51
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,204
Someone threatened you with Miss Gong,

52
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:49,645
so you could only be obedient, right?

53
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:57,005
That's it.

54
00:03:57,165 --> 00:03:58,285
Just let me go.

55
00:03:58,484 --> 00:04:00,805
I will ask Master to
help you and Miss Gong.

56
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:03,165
Don't meddle in

57
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:05,124
my business.

58
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,044
Yinfan.

59
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:39,444
Calm down.

60
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:41,284
It's hard to find
the Land of Tribulations.

61
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:43,444
Look, that place

62
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:44,764
is surrounded by shields,

63
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:46,965
and was cast a hidden spell by Wan Jie.

64
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,405
Unless Wan Jie tells others

65
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:49,284
where this place is,

66
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:50,484
no one will know.

67
00:04:50,884 --> 00:04:51,484
I can only figure out

68
00:04:51,645 --> 00:04:53,484
a rough direction right now.

69
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:55,044
I have fought against Wan Jie.

70
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,764
He is no longer the Chu Bufu
he was back then,

71
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,764
and he is extremely demonic.

72
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:01,204
I'm afraid he'll take advantage of

73
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:03,284
Chong's evil breath.

74
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:10,685
Not in the Immortal World,

75
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,525
not in the Demon World.

76
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,245
Could it be the Land of Wilderness

77
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:16,565
adjacent to the Monster World?

78
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:18,724
Father, Father.

79
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:20,645
Father, what are you doing?

80
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,405
Why didn't you let me save Chong Zi?

81
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:23,284
Isn't this a good opportunity for me

82
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,204
to distinguish myself?

83
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:27,405
You want to save her at Demon Palace

84
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:28,925
with your little ability?

85
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,685
Do you feel like
you haven't hurt enough?

86
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:32,004
These are just minor injuries.

87
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:33,085
Not a big deal.

88
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:34,245
If you don't think I can make it,

89
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:35,604
you can send me more people

90
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:36,685
to help me.

91
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:37,884
You wish!

92
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:40,204
It's fine for you to
seek death yourself,

93
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:42,604
but never think about taking the lives
of others in Qinghua Palace.

94
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:43,965
Listen.

95
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:45,565
Don't try to be a hero.

96
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:47,004
Chong Zi is from Nanhua.

97
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:48,204
You don't get to save her.

98
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:50,245
Obediently stay in Qinghua
to recuperate,

99
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:51,565
and don't go anywhere.

100
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:53,525
Father! Father!

101
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:15,925
It looks like he didn't mean to harm me,

102
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:18,284
but just to trap me here.

103
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:31,125
Stop wasting your efforts.

104
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:33,484
You can't escape from here.

105
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:44,845
What's wrong?

106
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,604
Are you disappointed

107
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:49,565
to see I'm not dead?

108
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:52,004
Who wants you dead?

109
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:56,085
Don't you want to leave?

110
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,044
Of course I want to.

111
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,365
Why don't you be nice

112
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:01,925
and let me go?

113
00:07:02,845 --> 00:07:03,764
You wish.

114
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:05,565
Well...

115
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:07,204
I won't ask you to be nice.

116
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:09,085
Just be normal and treat me well.

117
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:10,085
And

118
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:11,324
I will treat you well.

119
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:25,324
Take some water.

120
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:35,484
Look, it's just the two of us here.

121
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:36,925
You are injured now

122
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:38,405
and need someone to take care of you.

123
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:40,845
Although you look down on me,

124
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:42,805
I have experience
in taking care of people.

125
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:44,685
My master even praised me for that.

126
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:47,484
I am not your master.

127
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:50,645
Of course, I only have one master.

128
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,164
You

129
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:54,164
can only be my uncle.

130
00:07:55,365 --> 00:07:56,965
Easy.

131
00:08:01,204 --> 00:08:02,245
Take a good rest.

132
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:03,565
I am leaving.

133
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:31,444
Master.

134
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:33,004
Did you know that

135
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:34,965
I was captured
to the Land of Tribulations?

136
00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:37,444
Are you worried about me,

137
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:39,644
and have you come to save me?

138
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,125
Chong.

139
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:07,964
Answer me.

140
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:19,565
What's going on?

141
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:39,125
What's going on, Uncle?

142
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:40,125
Piss off!

143
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:41,404
Uncle!

144
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:42,685
Piss off!

145
00:09:58,084 --> 00:09:58,964
Uncle.

146
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,205
Uncle!

147
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:01,604
Uncle!

148
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:06,005
Wake up, Uncle.

149
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:07,404
Uncle!

150
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:36,805
Chong.

151
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,885
Where are you?

152
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:40,644
Uncle.

153
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,005
Wake up, Uncle.

154
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:57,164
(As long as I leave here
with the demon sword,)

155
00:10:57,565 --> 00:10:59,005
(I can atone for my sins,)

156
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:01,284
(and I don't have to go to
the Immortal Prison anymore.)

157
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,084
(No way, there are shields outside.)

158
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:08,325
(Even if I take the sword,
I can't get out.)

159
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:10,765
(Unless...)

160
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,164
(He has no resistance now.)

161
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:25,805
(If I attack him,)

162
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:27,404
(he will die.)

163
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:32,164
(He's no longer the same
Mr. Immortal back then.)

164
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:35,844
(He is the Demon King
who bears the debt of blood.)

165
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:37,724
(I could kill him and)

166
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,685
(avenge those innocent people.)

167
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:51,325
(No.)

168
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:54,524
(If he hadn't pushed me just now,)

169
00:11:54,925 --> 00:11:56,484
(I would have been crushed to death
by that stone.)

170
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:58,724
(How could do this?)

171
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:02,404
You can be angry when you are bullied,

172
00:12:03,164 --> 00:12:05,404
but never think of
harming someone's life.

173
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:06,284
Do you know?

174
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:55,644
Nothing serious.

175
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,365
I thought

176
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:01,044
you ran away with the sword.

177
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:03,565
I wish I could.

178
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:05,604
But shields are everywhere.

179
00:14:06,005 --> 00:14:07,484
I couldn't get out.

180
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:11,164
You probably didn't know that

181
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:14,524
Luo Yinfan used
the Earthshock Spell just now.

182
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,765
He couldn't break into this place,

183
00:14:19,245 --> 00:14:20,565
so he used the spell

184
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:22,925
to shake the ground.

185
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:27,445
In fact,

186
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:29,964
if you responded with

187
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:32,325
your immortal spiritual power just now,

188
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:34,484
he would be able to sense it

189
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:37,005
and save you out.

190
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:44,524
Earthshock Spell consumes
a lot of spiritual energy.

191
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:48,125
Even Celestial King Yunqiu

192
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:51,325
rarely used such a spell.

193
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,445
It seems that Luo Yinfan

194
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:57,964
really cares about you.

195
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:01,844
Don't be silly.

196
00:15:02,365 --> 00:15:03,925
He thought you were not here

197
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:06,044
and left long ago.

198
00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:10,565
I am so stupid.

199
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:13,724
I felt this force was very familiar.

200
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:18,524
You don't have to regret it.

201
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:38,964
Take it.

202
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:49,125
Demon snake?

203
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:51,805
It's a good thing you didn't
take the sword with you.

204
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,604
It's not the real sword of Ni Lun,

205
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:58,445
but transformed by the demon snake,

206
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,765
which is highly poisonous by nature

207
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,404
and very obedient to its master.

208
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:09,205
You're lucky you didn't leave.

209
00:16:10,245 --> 00:16:11,404
Otherwise...

210
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:17,205
Just stay here.

211
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:19,844
Accept your fate.

212
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:23,325
Understand?

213
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:34,044
Yinfan, you are way too impulsive.

214
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:37,205
How could you use
Earthshock Spell at will?

215
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,604
What if something happens to you?

216
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:41,205
Don't forget that

217
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:43,365
you are the head of the immortal sect.

218
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:46,084
It's just not worth injuring yourself

219
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:48,885
looking for Chong Zi.

220
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,164
I'm fine.

221
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:52,044
Don't worry.

222
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:55,005
Yu Du.

223
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:56,565
Look at you.

224
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,084
Why didn't you

225
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,565
stop Yinfan in advance?

226
00:17:01,325 --> 00:17:03,164
If you really want to break into
the Land of Tribulations,

227
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:04,925
you must be super cautious.

228
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:06,445
Without full assurance,

229
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:07,005
how could you...

230
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,404
Councilor,

231
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:11,205
what's full assurance?

232
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:12,764
To dig up

233
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:14,805
the whole Land of Wilderness?

234
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,524
No need for that.

235
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:23,244
Finding the exact location
of the Land of Tribulations

236
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:25,124
is indeed impossible.

237
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:27,524
But

238
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:30,524
you shouldn't have used
such an extreme spell.

239
00:17:31,124 --> 00:17:32,004
Remember that

240
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:33,845
you are not the only one

241
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:36,364
in Nanhua.

242
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:38,485
I am willing to lead a team
of Nanhua disciples

243
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:40,244
to explore the Land of Wilderness.

244
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:41,284
Okay.

245
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:44,004
You have been practicing in seclusion
for several months,

246
00:17:44,284 --> 00:17:46,565
and it is time to test the results.

247
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:53,565
I would like to go with Qin Ke.

248
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:57,404
Great.

249
00:17:58,085 --> 00:17:59,085
Yinfan.

250
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:00,925
You should be relieved now.

251
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:02,284
It will be

252
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:03,644
faster than

253
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:04,925
your looking for her alone.

254
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:26,325
You've figured it out?

255
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:29,524
Since I can't get out,

256
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,845
I have no choice but to live here.

257
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,764
How did you get hurt?

258
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,725
I got internally injured

259
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:43,884
in the confrontation with Luo Yinfan.

260
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:50,325
Don't be complacent.

261
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:52,044
He's not that good.

262
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:54,925
If it weren't for the old wounds I had

263
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:56,644
when I turned into a demon,

264
00:18:57,685 --> 00:18:59,044
he wouldn't have succeeded.

265
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,044
I can't know

266
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:02,364
Luo Yinfan's methods any better.

267
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:04,244
Next time

268
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:06,524
I'll beat him back.

269
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:10,325
Don't hate my master.

270
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,764
I picked herbs for you

271
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,325
as an apology, okay?

272
00:19:17,164 --> 00:19:17,805
Your place

273
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:19,205
is really desolate,

274
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:20,764
and I can't find any good medicine.

275
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:22,445
I managed to find a few,

276
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:24,004
and I still need

277
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:25,364
- some strong ones.
- Strong ones?

278
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:30,404
It's better that you don't know.

279
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:34,205
If the medicine doesn't work,

280
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:37,884
I will kill Luo Yinfan's

281
00:19:38,004 --> 00:19:39,845
favorite disciple to take revenge.

282
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,284
You are obviously Chu Bufu
of Changsheng Palace.

283
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:51,044
Why don't you admit that?

284
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:03,644
It's a pity that

285
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:07,445
there is no more Chu Bufu

286
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:10,244
in the world.

287
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,124
Although Uncle looks fierce,

288
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:16,845
he saved me once.

289
00:20:17,244 --> 00:20:18,485
I would never

290
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:20,325
hit a person when he is down.

291
00:20:34,644 --> 00:20:36,004
Here comes the strong medicine.

292
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:17,364
I... I want spiritual power.

293
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:25,764
No!

294
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:27,485
I want spiritual power.

295
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:32,764
I want spiritual power.

296
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:08,325
According to Sage Tianji's
divination results,

297
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:10,205
the Land of Tribulations
is in this direction.

298
00:22:10,644 --> 00:22:11,605
Go find out

299
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,725
if Chong Zi is there.

300
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:16,445
Tell me and Qin Ke if you have any news.

301
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,205
It's not suitable.

302
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:22,364
What?

303
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:24,164
Don't you listen to me?

304
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,004
You should stay here.

305
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:28,605
I will take them to look for her.

306
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:31,284
You don't have to go there yourself.

307
00:22:31,404 --> 00:22:33,364
The disciple of Nanhua
was robbed by Wan Jie.

308
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:34,845
I have to try my best.

309
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:36,124
You don't want to do it

310
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,605
because the person who was taken away
was Chong Zi, right?

311
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:43,565
She should have gone
to the Immortal Prison.

312
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:46,044
If Chong Zi is really guilty,

313
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,205
it should be determined by the sages,

314
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:50,565
instead of allowing her to be taken away
by the Demon King.

315
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,605
This is the most basic view
of right and wrong.

316
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:07,644
I am going back.

317
00:23:08,004 --> 00:23:09,524
Why should I save her?

318
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:31,925
Help!

319
00:23:33,124 --> 00:23:34,085
Senior.

320
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:39,164
- Senior.
- Senior.

321
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:41,805
Senior.

322
00:23:44,364 --> 00:23:45,404
Senior.

323
00:23:46,085 --> 00:23:47,004
Is she over there?

324
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:48,205
No.

325
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:49,884
Senior.

326
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:51,725
Senior.

327
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:10,884
Don't hurt her.

328
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,325
You don't have to pretend.

329
00:24:20,644 --> 00:24:21,805
He has too much
demon energy in his body,

330
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:23,805
and he needs to absorb
my spiritual power to suppress it.

331
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:25,565
It's none of your business.

332
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:32,524
You can't hurt me.

333
00:24:32,884 --> 00:24:34,004
You can't kill me.

334
00:24:34,445 --> 00:24:35,244
You...

335
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:37,644
You are on the same team.

336
00:24:39,485 --> 00:24:41,764
Uncle, you can't kill innocent people.

337
00:24:42,205 --> 00:24:43,284
If you want spiritual power,

338
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:44,445
just take mine.

339
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,445
She clearly hates you so much,

340
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:49,164
why do you still save her?

341
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:50,164
I...

342
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:52,445
She doesn't like me,

343
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:54,044
and I don't like her either.

344
00:24:54,764 --> 00:24:55,605
But I couldn't

345
00:24:55,685 --> 00:24:57,085
watch her die

346
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:58,685
in front of me.

347
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:01,085
Are you so anxious to die?

348
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:02,725
No.

349
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,524
But I can't watch you do this.

350
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:11,605
Uncle.

351
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:14,485
Uncle, please.

352
00:25:14,644 --> 00:25:16,325
Let her go.

353
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:22,445
Piss off.

354
00:26:09,124 --> 00:26:10,325
How did you

355
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:12,325
find here?

356
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:15,845
Finding someone

357
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:17,524
is never hard for us.

358
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:19,325
Even if I'm stranding
in the Mortal World,

359
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:21,284
you low-level character

360
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:22,725
can never bully me.

361
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,325
Miss Gong,

362
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:30,325
bad temper can make people ugly.

363
00:26:30,845 --> 00:26:33,085
I'm just here to visit you
on behalf of the Demon King,

364
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:35,485
who's worried that you're
having a hard time living alone.

365
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:37,685
I don't need your kindness.

366
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,565
But I really feel sorry for you.

367
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:43,605
You really shouldn't

368
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:46,085
live here alone.

369
00:26:55,565 --> 00:26:57,565
Now the entire Immortal World
is looking for you.

370
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:58,965
But you didn't go back.

371
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,764
The Demon King invited you to
the Land of Tribulations.

372
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,164
Yet you also said no.

373
00:27:02,404 --> 00:27:03,445
Do you want to

374
00:27:03,685 --> 00:27:05,565
hide here forever?

375
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:07,524
So what?

376
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:10,925
The Immortal World only wants to
hold me hostage and use me,

377
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,325
I will not go back.

378
00:27:14,205 --> 00:27:15,364
But neither will I fall
into the Demon World

379
00:27:15,404 --> 00:27:16,925
like him.

380
00:27:19,364 --> 00:27:20,364
I'm not going anywhere

381
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:21,925
but here.

382
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:23,925
I know that

383
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:26,085
you disdain to associate
with the demons,

384
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,004
so you have been avoiding Wan Jie.

385
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,044
In fact, he promised
the Demon King one thing.

386
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:32,805
As long as he gets it done,

387
00:27:33,124 --> 00:27:34,764
he can get rid of the Demon World.

388
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:36,404
Then

389
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:39,565
you can do whatever you want.

390
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:43,644
You threatened him again?

391
00:27:45,124 --> 00:27:47,085
What did you ask him to do?

392
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:48,925
That's all I can say.

393
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:51,445
Think about it yourself.

394
00:28:50,845 --> 00:28:52,004
- Senior Mu.
- Senior Mu.

395
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:55,764
I rushed over when I got the message.

396
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:56,925
What happened?

397
00:28:57,124 --> 00:28:58,244
Senior Miaoyuan was taken away
by Wan Jie.

398
00:28:58,485 --> 00:28:59,445
I just found her

399
00:28:59,524 --> 00:29:00,325
near the Land of Tribulations.

400
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:02,164
Where is Wan Jie indeed?

401
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,284
What about Chong Zi?

402
00:29:04,725 --> 00:29:06,404
She's still in the Land of Tribulations.

403
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:15,485
Senior Mu.

404
00:29:16,205 --> 00:29:17,565
Are you the only one back?

405
00:29:21,284 --> 00:29:22,364
Take me to the Land of Tribulations.

406
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:24,805
Senior Mu, I have already
sent someone there.

407
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:26,485
That place is remote and difficult to find,

408
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,004
and shields have been set up.

409
00:29:28,404 --> 00:29:30,925
I'm afraid it will be difficult to
break through for a while.

410
00:29:37,364 --> 00:29:38,284
Forget it.

411
00:29:39,004 --> 00:29:40,565
I will send you two back to Nanhua first

412
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:42,244
and report to the Supervisor Sage.

413
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,205
Let's go.

414
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:48,004
Wan Jie is really terrible.

415
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:49,644
He arrested me

416
00:29:49,884 --> 00:29:51,925
and wanted to absorb my
spiritual energy to practice.

417
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:54,445
I managed to escape.

418
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:56,284
If Wan Jie wanted to kill you,

419
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:58,004
how could you escape

420
00:29:58,445 --> 00:29:59,605
with your magical skills?

421
00:30:06,244 --> 00:30:07,085
Miaoyuan.

422
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:08,685
Say it.

423
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:11,044
Master, Mr. Luo.

424
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:13,485
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

425
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:15,565
It was Wanjie who let me go first,

426
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:17,884
and I escaped from
the Land of Tribulations.

427
00:30:27,404 --> 00:30:28,605
Now that he let you go,

428
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:31,004
you were not in danger.

429
00:30:32,044 --> 00:30:33,085
Why didn't you

430
00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:35,044
bring Chong Zi back?

431
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:42,244
Maybe you

432
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:44,364
don't need to worry too much
about Chong Zi.

433
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:46,284
Chong Zi is not in danger.

434
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:48,644
Not only did Wan Jie not hurt her,

435
00:30:49,124 --> 00:30:50,685
but he treated her

436
00:30:51,205 --> 00:30:52,685
in a special way.

437
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:59,244
Wan Jie let me go

438
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:01,364
because of Chong Zi's persuasion.

439
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:03,284
And I also heard

440
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:07,085
Chong Zi called Wan Jie

441
00:31:07,524 --> 00:31:08,124
Uncle.

442
00:31:08,244 --> 00:31:09,124
Enough.

443
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:14,284
Take me to the Land of Tribulations now.

444
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:16,764
Yes.

445
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:41,605
Uncle.

446
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:43,325
You are awake.

447
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:46,845
Here.

448
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:54,644
I knew

449
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:55,845
you would never hurt us.

450
00:31:56,244 --> 00:31:57,884
You usually pretend to be fierce

451
00:31:58,164 --> 00:31:59,565
just to scare us.

452
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:01,485
You are good-hearted,

453
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:04,164
but born with evil breath.

454
00:32:05,044 --> 00:32:05,725
How can you gain a foothold

455
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:07,805
in the Immortal World
and the Demon World?

456
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:12,685
Are you complimenting me?

457
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:14,325
Why do you think

458
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:15,925
the person who threatened me

459
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:18,605
didn't send you to the Immortal Prison?

460
00:32:21,284 --> 00:32:22,925
He didn't let me go
to the Immortal Prison

461
00:32:23,205 --> 00:32:24,925
because it would be useful to keep me.

462
00:32:25,925 --> 00:32:27,644
He wants to use me to
unravel the Tianmo Token?

463
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:30,485
If I'm imprisoned in the Immortal Prison
for hundreds of years,

464
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:31,884
he won't be able to wait any longer.

465
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:35,805
But to unravel the Tianmo Token
requires the blood relatives of Ni Lun.

466
00:32:36,284 --> 00:32:38,404
Although I was born
with evil breath like him,

467
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:40,205
it doesn't work.

468
00:32:40,565 --> 00:32:41,884
Some things are doomed.

469
00:32:42,445 --> 00:32:43,445
You can't escape.

470
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,284
You are born with evil breath.

471
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:47,325
if you join the practice of the demons,

472
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:48,805
you will surely achieve great success.

473
00:32:49,644 --> 00:32:50,965
I don't want that.

474
00:32:51,124 --> 00:32:52,445
But the immortal sect can't keep you.

475
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:55,164
Then I won't be a demon either.

476
00:32:57,244 --> 00:32:58,485
But you...

477
00:32:58,845 --> 00:33:00,445
Why did you turn into a demon?

478
00:33:01,044 --> 00:33:02,364
If you have any difficulties,

479
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:04,524
I can tell my master for you.

480
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,044
I look inconspicuous,

481
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,364
but I do have the right to speak

482
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:10,244
in the immortal sect,

483
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:12,284
especially in front of my master.

484
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:19,884
I know you will always be
my Mr. Immortal,

485
00:33:20,244 --> 00:33:21,925
and Chu Bufu from Changsheng Palace.

486
00:33:46,845 --> 00:33:49,124
Senior Miaoyuan has always been
at odds with me,

487
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,445
she must haven't told Master
that I was here.

488
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:54,364
I have to find a way to let Master know.

489
00:34:14,884 --> 00:34:16,844
Uncle, aren't you bored

490
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:18,564
staying here all the time?

491
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:20,604
So noisy.

492
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:25,005
I'll shut up. Go ahead.

493
00:34:37,844 --> 00:34:39,844
Here you can only eat fruit every day.

494
00:34:40,124 --> 00:34:40,925
Uncle.

495
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:43,045
You don't live by this every day, do you?

496
00:34:43,404 --> 00:34:44,644
It's edible,

497
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,725
just not very tasty.

498
00:34:57,925 --> 00:34:59,604
Uncle, where are you going?

499
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:00,685
Listen.

500
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:01,564
I know a bazaar

501
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:02,965
with lots of fine food and fun,

502
00:35:03,124 --> 00:35:05,084
and the pastries there
are simply outstanding.

503
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:05,844
No.

504
00:35:06,324 --> 00:35:07,124
Please.

505
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:08,525
I'll take you to have a taste, okay?

506
00:35:08,644 --> 00:35:10,644
Come on.

507
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:13,884
Uncle.

508
00:35:39,965 --> 00:35:41,245
Why did you bring me here?

509
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:44,124
This is where we first met.

510
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:45,844
I didn't expect you to remember.

511
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:46,884
I don't remember.

512
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:48,285
Don't be sentimental.

513
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:50,245
It doesn't matter if you don't remember.

514
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:52,005
I always remember it.

515
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:54,685
At that time, someone fell from the sky

516
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,005
and saved me.

517
00:36:00,884 --> 00:36:01,884
Uncle.

518
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:04,804
As long as you want to,
you can definitely turn back.

519
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:08,324
I will help you,

520
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:10,644
just like how you helped me back then.

521
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:17,806
(Xichun Restaurant)

522
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:23,844
Have you brought Miss Gong here?

523
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:26,564
Yes.

524
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:28,884
I just don't know

525
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,124
if she still remembers this place.

526
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:34,844
Last time, Master also said that

527
00:36:34,884 --> 00:36:36,404
he would bring me to Xichun Restaurant.

528
00:36:36,685 --> 00:36:37,925
Then...

529
00:36:40,205 --> 00:36:41,685
Nothing else.

530
00:36:42,844 --> 00:36:44,124
Your master doesn't

531
00:36:44,844 --> 00:36:46,164
treat you that well.

532
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,525
Nonsense!

533
00:36:47,644 --> 00:36:49,564
He is really nice to me.

534
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:53,525
I hope it will be like this in the future.

535
00:36:55,164 --> 00:36:56,564
You are born with evil breath.

536
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:58,324
I don't think

537
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:00,045
you will have an easy life in the future.

538
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:04,164
It's not much better now.

539
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:10,644
I've already brought you here,

540
00:37:11,205 --> 00:37:12,285
isn't it good?

541
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,804
Another drawer of
sweet-scented osmanthus cake.

542
00:37:15,164 --> 00:37:15,804
Got it.

543
00:37:37,884 --> 00:37:40,525
Don't drink, you'll get drunk.

544
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:43,245
I don't want to take care of a drunkard.

545
00:37:44,644 --> 00:37:46,164
Since I got it done,

546
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:48,045
I drank for celebration.

547
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:51,285
I managed it.

548
00:37:51,844 --> 00:37:54,925
Yu Xuzi and Lord Ming
are really two idiots.

549
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:57,164
They really thought I was Gong Keran,

550
00:37:57,285 --> 00:37:59,564
and even fought for me.

551
00:38:00,324 --> 00:38:01,725
They want to kill Wan Jie,

552
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:04,164
but they don't dare
to fight openly with him,

553
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:07,205
so they can only use a woman
to force him to submit.

554
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:11,485
Do they really think that
if they catch Gong Keran,

555
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:14,045
they will get Wan Jie?

556
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:17,485
So ridiculous.

557
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:19,205
Yu Xuzi

558
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,084
is bad and stupid.

559
00:38:21,725 --> 00:38:23,445
Just because he didn't get Gong Keran,

560
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:25,804
everyone knew about it.

561
00:38:26,685 --> 00:38:27,685
The next step

562
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:29,285
is to see if Wan Jie

563
00:38:29,564 --> 00:38:31,604
will make a move for Gong Keran.

564
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:33,364
I don't think

565
00:38:34,844 --> 00:38:37,005
there is anyone worse than you.

566
00:38:40,804 --> 00:38:42,285
I am a good man.

567
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:51,124
What if Wan Jie
doesn't fall into the trap?

568
00:38:52,324 --> 00:38:53,725
He will.

569
00:38:54,324 --> 00:38:56,925
In order to protect the holy sword,

570
00:38:57,324 --> 00:38:59,005
he himself became a demon unwillingly.

571
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:00,364
He still doesn't believe that

572
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:02,884
he is a member of the demons.

573
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:04,925
For this identity,

574
00:39:05,404 --> 00:39:06,804
and for Gong Keran,

575
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,084
he is willing to do anything.

576
00:39:09,884 --> 00:39:11,844
He just doesn't know
how to appreciate favors.

577
00:39:16,765 --> 00:39:18,925
What's wrong with the Demon World?

578
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,685
It's much better than the Immortal World.

579
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:26,084
How can they

580
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,124
understand our fun?

581
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:36,005
Have you heard?

582
00:39:36,245 --> 00:39:37,164
Yu Xuzi of Kunlun Sect

583
00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:38,564
got into a fight with the
Lord of Changsheng Palace

584
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:40,005
for an immortal lady.

585
00:39:40,164 --> 00:39:41,084
How did you know?

586
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,084
I have a brother who lives
near Qingchang Mountain.

587
00:39:43,324 --> 00:39:44,406
(Xichun Restaurant)
That's where it happened.

588
00:39:45,205 --> 00:39:47,285
They fought hard.

589
00:39:47,725 --> 00:39:49,364
They said that the other party
kidnapped the immortal lady

590
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:51,005
and should be handed over
to the immortal sect.

591
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:52,604
But neither of them admits it.

592
00:39:56,804 --> 00:39:58,205
- Is what you just said true?
- Uncle.

593
00:39:58,445 --> 00:39:59,685
Which immortal lady?

594
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:01,245
Where?

595
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:02,404
I don't know.

596
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,124
Tell me!

597
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:04,285
Uncle.

598
00:40:08,445 --> 00:40:09,884
Qingchang Mountain is not far from here.

599
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:11,045
If you are worried,

600
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:12,205
you can go and have a look.

601
00:40:12,324 --> 00:40:13,685
Keran was already...

602
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:18,564
Did they find it out?

603
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:25,445
Why are you in such a hurry to let me go?

604
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:28,045
You want to take the opportunity
to escape?

605
00:40:28,124 --> 00:40:30,005
Does it matter if I run or not?

606
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:31,205
If this is true,

607
00:40:31,364 --> 00:40:33,124
Miss Gong will be in danger.

608
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:35,884
I'll be right here waiting for you,
not going anywhere.

609
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:37,644
How can I trust you?

610
00:40:37,844 --> 00:40:39,725
I vouch for it with my life.

611
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:41,164
If I break my oath,

612
00:40:41,285 --> 00:40:41,844
I will be struck by lightning.

613
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,084
What do I want your life for?

614
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:48,765
I'll be back in three days at most.

615
00:40:49,725 --> 00:40:50,564
Stay here

616
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:51,725
and don't go anywhere, understand?

617
00:40:51,844 --> 00:40:52,925
Uncle.

618
00:40:53,525 --> 00:40:55,084
Are you sure about this?

619
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:57,485
If they use Miss Gong to set up a trap,

620
00:40:57,685 --> 00:40:59,285
what will you do?

621
00:41:04,884 --> 00:41:06,124
Even if it's a trap,

622
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:08,205
I have to go.

623
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:09,765
Uncle.
