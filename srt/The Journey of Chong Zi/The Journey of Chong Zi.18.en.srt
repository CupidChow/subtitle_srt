=The Journey of Chongzi=
(Adapted from "The Journey of Chongzi" by Shu Ke)

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,000
=Episode 18=

28
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,480
What's wrong?

29
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:49,920
I don't know.

30
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
I just feel familiar here,

31
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,200
but I've never been here before.

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,520
It seems you two

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,801
are destined to go to our restaurant.

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,240
Although our restaurant is small,

35
00:01:58,361 --> 00:01:59,240
we've been running it smoothly

36
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,681
all the time,

37
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:02,641
as if we're blessed.

38
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:03,721
Our boss also says

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
that we won't change our dishes,
nor will we close the restaurant

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,040
because we need to pay a sage back.

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,560
The reason why I work here

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,320
is that I also want to be
blessed by the sage.

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,801
Sir, miss, your dishes are ready.

44
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,120
What else do you need?

45
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:17,881
Two pots of wine.

46
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,320
Got it. Wait a minute.

47
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:22,200
Master, are you going to drink wine?

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,521
I just do as the local people do.

49
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:27,081
I also need to taste the Mortal
World's food occasionally.

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,521
Can't I do that?

51
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:32,001
Of course you can. It's rare for
us to have interest in drinking.

52
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:33,801
Master, just enjoy yourself.

53
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:35,241
I'll keep sober

54
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,441
and watch you over.

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
(Panhai Town)

56
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,400
You said to keep sober,

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,200
but you're worse at
drinking than before.

58
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,560
Before?

59
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:01,001
Nothing.

60
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,721
Have you been happy during these days?

61
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:04,601
Yes.

62
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,480
I have you with me

63
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,441
and built friendships with many people.

64
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,361
Everything is wonderful.

65
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,641
You're bad at drinking,

66
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:20,361
so drink less in the future.

67
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,280
My father said

68
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,081
he would take me to try
all kinds of cuisine in the world,

69
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:30,081
but he didn't keep his word

70
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,320
and died.

71
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,320
Master,

72
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,521
you won't do that, will you?

73
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:39,521
I won't.

74
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,241
From now on,

75
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:47,920
I won't leave you alone.

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,081
Master, I found a kitchen

77
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,361
that hasn't been used for a long time,

78
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,801
so I cleaned it

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,961
and cooked some cakes.

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Try them.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,040
How is it?

82
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:23,281
It's delicious.

83
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,320
You're really good at cooking.

84
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:28,121
It's good you like them.

85
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:30,521
I would usually learn to cook
from the cook at home in the past.

86
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,720
Since you like the cakes,

87
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:33,200
please name them.

88
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,920
Master,

89
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:38,000
don't force yourself
if you don't like them.

90
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:40,160
I'll cook the Overwhelming Cakes

91
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,000
when I am free.

92
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,880
Overwhelming Cakes.

93
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,841
Is that all?

94
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:50,880
Do you have any problem?

95
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:53,121
No, as long as you like it.

96
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:57,681
Qin Ke.

97
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:02,200
I come to play chess with you
to ask for advice, Mr. Luo.

98
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,240
(Chonghua Palace)

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,040
We haven't played for a long time,

100
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:18,000
and you've made great progress.

101
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,880
I'm sorry that I haven't asked
you for advice for a long time.

102
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,241
Mr. Luo,

103
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:25,401
why did you recruit her

104
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
and name her Chong Zi?

105
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:30,121
You seem to have lost.

106
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,320
I always can't beat you on chess,

107
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,121
nor can I see through your thoughts.

108
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,401
I just think

109
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,480
it's all unfair

110
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:44,961
to that girl.

111
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,880
It's my business to recruit a disciple.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,361
What if she knows the truth?

113
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:16,000
You are too talkative.

114
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,841
I know you won't answer me.

115
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,040
We needn't have played chess today.

116
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,961
I'm leaving.

117
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,681
Master, I wonder

118
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,281
if I can ask you a question.

119
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:49,961
Go ahead.

120
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,880
I don't mean to pry into your thoughts,

121
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,841
but I just want to know

122
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:58,000
why you, as a sage of Nanhua Sect,

123
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,320
would recruit me,

124
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,160
who is normal
and not good at everything.

125
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,361
And you treat me so well.

126
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:06,961
I don't know that, either.

127
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,561
You've been in Nanhua Sect for days,

128
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:12,561
and you should have a magic weapon now.

129
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,040
Go to Senior Mu tomorrow,

130
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:15,720
and find one you can use
without difficulty.

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,600
I can teach you a new spell.

132
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,561
Can I...

133
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,561
Can I have my own magic weapon?

134
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,600
Supervisor Sage has told me

135
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,160
that you could select anyone you like.

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,521
There are Spell Immortals and
Sword Immortals in immortal sects,

137
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:05,401
and most of our disciples cultivate
themselves to be Sword Immortals.

138
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:06,641
Different from Spell Immortals,

139
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,561
we have magic weapons.

140
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:12,000
Supervisor Sage has
the left sword, Mofeng.

141
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,440
And Councilor Sage

142
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,681
has a tower-like sword named Futu Jie.

143
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,760
As for Sage Tianji,

144
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,641
he takes charge of Ministry of Secrets,

145
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,720
and his magic weapon
is called the Book of Secrets.

146
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:25,480
How about you, Senior Mu?

147
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,600
I...

148
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,040
I only have a normal steel sword
as the magic weapon,

149
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:31,121
but it's easy to use.

150
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,481
Immortal cultivators should be

151
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:33,880
as pure as you.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,880
I'll follow your example.

153
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:52,161
Magic Weapons are psychic
and choose their masters themselves.

154
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,320
I think your magic weapon
must be waiting for you.

155
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,000
What's this?

156
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,961
It looks ordinary.

157
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,281
Is it also a magic weapon?

158
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,880
It's not ordinary.

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
It's called the Soul-binding Thread.

160
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
You'd better

161
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,721
not touch it.

162
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,841
Try it.

163
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,200
This sword is comfortable.
It suits me very much.

164
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:24,560
Are you injured?

165
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
No.

166
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,800
Senior Mu,

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,041
why am I not chosen by any magic weapon?

168
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:32,281
It happens

169
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,200
occasionally.

170
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,440
Perhaps it's because you and magic
weapons haven't been destined now.

171
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:37,800
You don't need to insist on that.

172
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,760
Master.

173
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:51,000
What's wrong?

174
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:53,000
No magic weapons chose me.

175
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:56,281
Will I have no magic weapons
to use in the future?

176
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,481
You won't be hurt

177
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:07,880
when you're by my side,

178
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,601
so it doesn't matter if you don't
have a magic weapon.

179
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
No.

180
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,800
I can't protect you in that case.

181
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:17,641
If I could be a little more useful,

182
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:20,240
you needn't have searched
medicine everywhere for me.

183
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't want to hide behind you forever.

184
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:24,961
Okay.

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,880
Follow me.

186
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,800
It's shining.

187
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
I have an interaction with it.

188
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,161
Master, is...

189
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,641
Is this my magic weapon?

190
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,601
Since you have it,

191
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:31,841
why didn't you show it to me before?

192
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,440
Everything is destined,

193
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
and so are magic weapons.

194
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:36,360
If it's yours,

195
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,680
it'll be yours no matter what.

196
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,680
Master, I can't control it
no matter how.

197
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:49,281
Magic weapons are psychic,

198
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,041
and they will react when
meeting their masters.

199
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,721
As long as you tame it,

200
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,161
it'll be obedient.

201
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,880
Follow my actions.

211
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:24,120
I give the magic weapon, Starlight,

212
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,320
to you now.

213
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:28,081
Thank you, Master.

214
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:31,120
Master,

215
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,921
you already named it.

216
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,041
Is it because Starlight

217
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:36,000
used to have a master?

218
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,481
You're its only master now.

219
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,921
I don't care what
happened to you before.

220
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:48,560
Master has me as his only disciple,

221
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,481
and you have me as your only master.

222
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,601
Starlight has no blade,

223
00:14:54,841 --> 00:14:56,240
so it's not good at
attacking like a sword,

224
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:57,921
but it can defend you very well.

225
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,721
I also hope you can be
less sharp and control yourself,

226
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,200
not to be competitive,

227
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,921
nor can you hurt others.

228
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:05,521
I see.

229
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,560
You should also
use it to protect yourself.

230
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,800
From now on, you will be with it.

231
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:12,320
Balance the six worlds
and protect people.

232
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,320
From now on, I will be with it.

233
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,921
I'll balance the six worlds
and protect people.

234
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:21,200
Get up.

235
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:25,680
Let's go back.

236
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,720
(Chonghua Palace)

237
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:31,481
Master,

238
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,521
I always want to ask you a question.

239
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,721
Why is there a sword?

240
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,041
Its name is Zhubo

241
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:41,601
and used to be my sword.

242
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:43,880
Did you change
your magic weapon before?

243
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,721
Senior Mu said

244
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,921
once we chose our magic weapon,

245
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:48,161
we couldn't change it.

246
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:50,680
Why did you abandon it?

247
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
Is it because

248
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,120
it worked less than Mofeng?

249
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,320
I did one thing wrongly before.

250
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,841
You did one thing wrongly?

251
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,880
I've heard much

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,601
about your deeds.

253
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,240
You repaired the King's Furnace,
guarded the Heavenly Gate,

254
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:06,641
and broke into Demon Palace alone.

255
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,240
Each of them is amazing.

256
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
It's said

257
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,921
you're unbeatable,

258
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:14,481
so how could you do anything wrong?

259
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,921
Even if I'm unbeatable
in the six worlds,

260
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,081
I can't know what will happen tomorrow

261
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,560
or the day after tomorrow.

262
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,961
Moreover,

263
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:29,161
I'll also make a mistake
even if I'm unbeatable.

264
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:34,401
(Zhubo and Mofeng)

265
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,481
(were created in the same furnace.)

266
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:39,041
(One thousand years ago,)

267
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:41,760
(my master gave them to me,)

268
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:44,440
(and I kept practicing them)

269
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:48,281
(for thousands of years)

270
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:50,641
(until)

271
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:52,320
(I committed)

272
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,281
(an unforgivable thing with Zhubo,)

273
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,120
(and I abandoned it from then on.)

274
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,641
That's why I don't use it.

275
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,561
What's wrong?

276
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,681
What happened?

277
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,521
- Dragon King is coming! Run!
- It's Dragon King!

278
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:28,561
- It's Dragon King! Run!
- Run!

279
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,120
- Run!
- Run! It's Dragon King!

280
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,801
Run!

281
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,801
It's Dragon King!

282
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,120
Dragon King?

283
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:49,801
He's just a water snake

284
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,801
and becomes a monster after cultivating
himself for hundreds of years,

285
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,521
but he occupies rivers
and announces himself a king.

286
00:17:53,681 --> 00:17:54,840
The area of Luohe River

287
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,480
could be said to be his kingdom.

288
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,120
Then we must take actions
as soon as possible

289
00:18:00,321 --> 00:18:02,161
because Luohe River
has a difficult terrain.

290
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:05,041
Otherwise, we will be later
than Nanhua Sect.

291
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:06,681
I'm willing to go.

292
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,880
Demon Palace is about 1.8 km

293
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,801
away from Luohe River,

294
00:18:12,201 --> 00:18:14,080
and Nanhua Sect is...

295
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,600
1.3 km away from that.

296
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,120
Then order Protector Yin to go.

297
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,600
Message her as soon as possible.

298
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,880
How is Protector Yin?

299
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,480
Where is she?

300
00:18:27,321 --> 00:18:29,480
She's in a village outside Luohe River.

301
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,120
No wonder someone
asks to go there eagerly.

302
00:19:27,521 --> 00:19:29,161
- Honey.
- Shuixian.

303
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:32,360
It's okay. You don't need to get up.

304
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,561
I'm not that weak.

305
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,000
I heard the Dragon King
caused trouble here today,

306
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:40,801
so don't leave home if you don't
have anything to deal with.

307
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:41,720
If you need anything,

308
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,921
I'll bring it back for you later.

309
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,041
Do you have to go out?

310
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:51,401
Epiphyllum is blooming
in the countryside tonight,

311
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:54,000
and I'm afraid I can't sell it by
a good price if I miss it.

312
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,561
I'll go with people
from the immortal sects,

313
00:19:57,681 --> 00:19:59,000
and I promise I'll be safe.

314
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,681
No.

315
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,441
I can't feel assured.

316
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:27,720
We haven't wiped the demons out

317
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,281
while remaining evildoers
of the Monster World stir up trouble.

318
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:43,960
Mr. Luo,

319
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,000
why do you have interests
in coming here today?

320
00:20:47,281 --> 00:20:49,561
Don't you always ignore everything?

321
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,080
Yinfan has been on
Zizhu Peak all the time,

322
00:20:55,201 --> 00:20:56,760
and he actually left the peak today.

323
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,441
He indeed becomes different
after having a disciple.

324
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:01,201
Yes.

325
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,201
Since you came from afar,

326
00:21:03,321 --> 00:21:04,960
I think you must have something
to negotiate with us.

327
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,120
Therefore, Yinfan must come here.

328
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,600
I took the liberty of coming today

329
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,201
because the Dragon King,
who is from the Monster World,

330
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:13,720
stirs up trouble in Luohe River

331
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:15,201
and hurts people.

332
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:16,480
I hope your sect

333
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:18,041
could give a hand to my sect

334
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:20,321
and wipe him out together.

335
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,401
Don't worry. It's always

336
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:25,321
our unshirkable responsibility
to wipe demons and monsters out.

337
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:27,681
We've been getting along
with the Dragon King for a long time,

338
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,360
and he's always been keeping his place

339
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:31,000
to avoid offending my sect.

340
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:33,521
But I don't know

341
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:35,921
why he stirred up trouble
without any reason.

342
00:21:36,201 --> 00:21:37,401
Are you afraid

343
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:39,240
that it relates to the demons, Lord Zhuo?

344
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,321
Yes.

345
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,441
We must make a prompt decision.

346
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:45,681
Immortals and demons
are extremely antagonistic.

347
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,600
If monsters hedge obstacles in the way,

348
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,521
we must eradicate them
as soon as possible

349
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
so that the demons could
stay out of our business.

350
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,080
Yinfan,

351
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,240
since it may be related to the demons,

352
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,000
how about you go to Luohe River
and wipe the monster out?

353
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,041
I'll go.

354
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
Yinfan,

355
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:09,401
I don't mean to scold you,

356
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,561
but you can't always be alone

357
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,760
and take actions without others' help.

358
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,360
Think about it.

359
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,921
The new disciples

360
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,120
have joined our sect for some days,

361
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:19,840
so why not take them

362
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,720
to steel themselves

363
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,321
this time?

364
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,801
Sir,

365
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,041
I'll depend on you

366
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,360
to wipe the Dragon King out.

367
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:45,641
Sage Chonghua actually
gave you Starlight?

368
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,161
Try it.

369
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:49,600
No.

370
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:52,041
I can't use your magic weapon casually.

371
00:22:57,681 --> 00:22:58,681
Lion.

372
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,720
Why are you here?

373
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,360
What food do you bring to me?

374
00:23:27,921 --> 00:23:29,240
Your master actually asked Lion

375
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:30,521
to bring cakes for you.

376
00:23:30,681 --> 00:23:32,681
It's a holy animal that
guards the mountain.

377
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,041
It's not that legendary.

378
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:36,600
As for the cakes,

379
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,401
although they are small,

380
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
your spiritual power will be
improved after you eat them.

381
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:42,921
The lord of Qinghua Palace came today,

382
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,760
so I think they might
be served for them.

383
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:46,720
Normal immortal disciples

384
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,041
are impossible to eat such good food.

385
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,720
Eat them.

386
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,641
Do you always eat them?

387
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:00,760
I didn't expect you to
be such kind of person.

388
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,641
Don't think you can be light-hearted,

389
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:04,120
although your master
treats you well now.

390
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,921
Supervisor Sage

391
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,321
is never soft-hearted
when punishing people.

392
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,801
He deserves his reputation
as indifference and ruthlessness.

393
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:12,880
He's not indifferent nor ruthless.

394
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,041
You don't know that.

395
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,041
You used to have a senior,
and your master treated her...

396
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:19,240
I had a senior?

397
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,080
Why does Master never
mention that to me?

398
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:23,561
Well,

399
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,441
what kind of person was my senior?

400
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:31,921
She was pure and innocent

401
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,000
and looked similar to you.

402
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:37,000
When she joined Nanhua Sect,
she had evil breath,

403
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,161
and only your master
was willing to recruit her.

404
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:41,120
However, she did something wrong

405
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,000
and died.

406
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,400
(Chong Zi)

407
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,161
(Master is truly powerful.)

408
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,161
(He had expected me to come.)

409
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,801
This girl

410
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,600
is just like her.

411
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,441
No wonder those things
were already put there.

412
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,240
I only regarded them

413
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:07,441
as the gifts that were
prepared in advance by Master.

414
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,801
However,

415
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,201
they turned out to be
my senior's old possessions.

416
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:13,441
Then why didn't Master explain it to me

417
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:14,960
and let me misunderstand it?

418
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:16,360
Does he

419
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,441
really regard me as my senior?

420
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,521
Don't mind it.

421
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,000
Supervisor Sage is busy,

422
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,641
so perhaps he forgot
to put those things away.

423
00:25:26,921 --> 00:25:28,441
How did my senior die?

424
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,161
Why does Master never mention it to me?

425
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:39,161
She was executed by
Supervisor Sage with Zhubo Sword,

426
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:40,760
so even others

427
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,960
will never mention her,

428
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,521
let alone your master.

429
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,480
Did my senior do an evil thing

430
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:48,801
that disobeyed my master
and betrayed the sect?

431
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,281
She prevented the demon sword
from being purified for the demons,

432
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:53,240
so Supervisor Sage...

433
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,521
My senior was an immortal,

434
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,321
but she actually colluded
with the demons.

435
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,840
It was really unforgivable.

436
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:02,161
Master prepared so many things for her

437
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:04,760
and treated her well,
but she committed such a thing.

438
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:07,321
I'm sure she disappointed Master.

439
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,880
I won't do that.

440
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,600
I'll never betray Master.

441
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,041
As long as I'm here,

442
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,161
Master

443
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:15,161
doesn't need to miss
the one who hurt him.

444
00:26:15,321 --> 00:26:16,681
It's in the past.

445
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,801
Supervisor Sage treats you so well

446
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:19,281
that I'm jealous of you.

447
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,360
My master, Tianji,

448
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,041
never cares about me.

449
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,041
Supervisor Sage gave
Starlight to you in the end.

450
00:26:27,161 --> 00:26:29,480
This magic weapon
is specially for his disciples.

451
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,681
Don't worry. I'm not like my senior.

452
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:38,681
I'll never abandon you.

453
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:50,080
Zhenzhu.

454
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:52,801
Zhenzhu, who is he?

455
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:55,480
He's just a nerd.

456
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,321
His name is Chengfeng, my senior.

457
00:26:58,401 --> 00:26:59,521
This is Chong Zi.

458
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,840
She's the famous Chong Zi.

459
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:04,600
I've heard your reputation
for a long time.

460
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,441
Thank you, Chenfeng.

461
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,041
What happened? Why are you so excited?

462
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:11,281
Nanhua Sect and Qinghua Sect will
go to wipe the Dragon King out together,

463
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:12,720
and the sages are selecting disciples

464
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,441
to steel themselves.

465
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:14,880
It's a rare chance
to leave the mountain.

466
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,480
Don't waste time. Let's go.

467
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:17,641
Am I also qualified to go with you?

468
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,720
Of course.

469
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,960
You're Supervisor Sage's disciple,

470
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,161
so of course you can. Hurry up.

471
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:28,080
The Dragon King from
the Monster World does evil things,

472
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:31,480
causes trouble and
does harm to the Mortal World.

473
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,681
Sage Chonghua from Nanhua Sect

474
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:37,281
will lead you to go to wipe him out

475
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:41,921
in order to enhance your braveness
and cultivate your magical power.

476
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:46,360
Who are willing to leave
the mountain with Sage Chonghua?

477
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,240
- Me.
- Me.

478
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,480
I'm willing, too.

479
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:56,281
You just joined Nanhua Sect
and don't have a high cultivation,

480
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,641
so it's improper for you
to leave the mountain.

481
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,240
Who else?

482
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,000
- Us.
- Us.

483
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:17,521
Good.

484
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:20,201
With you going with him, I feel assured.

485
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,521
Qin Ke and Miaoyuan,

486
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,521
Supervisor Sage likes being alone,

487
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,120
so you two

488
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:31,161
take the lead of the team.

489
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,681
Miaoyuan and I

490
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,441
promise to protect disciples
from Nanhua Sect

491
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,321
and will never let the demons
and monsters hurt them.

492
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,000
(Why doesn't Master speak for me?)

493
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,720
(I'm his only disciple.)

494
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:53,840
Chong Zi.

495
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,401
You're good at nothing.

496
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:03,521
If you try to join the team
of wiping the Dragon King out,

497
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
you're just asking for a snub.

498
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,641
I think

499
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,720
you'd better stay on
Zizhu Peak obediently

500
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,760
and don't humiliate Nanhua Sect.

501
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,521
My master has taught me a lot,

502
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:15,201
so I'm not inferior to other disciples.

503
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:18,960
Do you think Supervisor Sage
teaches you sincerely?

504
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:21,321
You're just lucky.

505
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,240
You're right, Miaoyuan.

506
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:25,840
I'm indeed a nobody,

507
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,880
and I owe what I have to my master.

508
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,480
Look, Starlight is mine,

509
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:33,201
and so is Zizhu Peak.

510
00:29:33,561 --> 00:29:34,880
Even my master

511
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,880
has me as his only disciple.

512
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:50,360
Although Qinghua Palace
seemed to take the initiative

513
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,600
to invite us to wipe the Dragon King out,

514
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,880
in fact, they shuffled
the responsibility onto us.

515
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,960
However, Nanhua Sect
couldn't sit by and do nothing.

516
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,441
You need to be careful.

517
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,641
I heard the Dragon King

518
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,281
had thousands of monsters

519
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:10,041
in Qianchi Cave.

520
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,080
If those monsters are pure

521
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,401
and intelligential,

522
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,521
I'll spare their lives

523
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:18,480
and teach them to stop harming people

524
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:19,641
and quit being the demon.

525
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:22,521
They don't belong to our race,
so they won't be united with us.

526
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,921
You don't need to
bother to enlighten them,

527
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,681
just wipe them out.

528
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,240
I know what I should do.

529
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,480
By the way,

530
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,801
there is one more thing.

531
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:34,801
Chong Zi just joined Nanhua Sect,

532
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:38,720
so it's not time for her
to leave the mountain.

533
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,080
Just ask her to stay on Zizhu Peak

534
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,960
and never run out.

535
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,641
She's my disciple,
so she should follow me undoubtedly.

536
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:50,441
Although it's not time
for her to leave the mountain,

537
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:52,240
I'll take her together

538
00:30:52,921 --> 00:30:54,201
since she wants so.

539
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:57,521
Yinfan,

540
00:30:57,681 --> 00:30:59,880
don't dote on her too much, in case

541
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,480
you'll follow the same old disastrous
road and raise another evil creature.

542
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,201
I repeat

543
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,561
that Chong Zi isn't an evil creature.

544
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,561
They are not mine,

545
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,480
so they are meaningless.

546
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,401
(Although I'm not allowed to go,)

547
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,080
(I'll go.)

548
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:15,921
I hope

549
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:19,240
you won't forget your
aspiration of cultivation

550
00:32:19,641 --> 00:32:21,161
or let our sect down.

551
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:23,041
Keep the mission to redeem
lost souls from evilness in mind.

552
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:25,921
Protect people and
kill demons and monsters.

553
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,880
The first rule of leaving the mountain

554
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,441
is to hide your spirit scent.

555
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,600
Don't reveal yourselves
unless you have to.

556
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,000
Second,

557
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,840
don't cause trouble as you like.

558
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
Third,

559
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:39,480
be united and never
have internal conflicts.

560
00:32:40,801 --> 00:32:43,000
Qin Ke, you and me take the lead.

561
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,801
Mutong and the others
follow in the rear.

562
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,201
Chong.

563
00:33:18,921 --> 00:33:19,921
Chong?

564
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:05,880
- Qin Ke.
- Qin Ke.

565
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:07,800
We haven't left the mountain
for a long time,

566
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:09,921
and I don't know what
the Mortal World looks like now.

567
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,961
Look what they are.

568
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,641
The Shapeless Spell
used to keep monsters away.

569
00:34:24,721 --> 00:34:25,641
Where did you get them?

570
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:26,880
Keep your voice down.

571
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,560
I took them out secretly.

572
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:30,120
Don't expose them.

573
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:34,280
I'm afraid you'll be in danger

574
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:35,641
when facing the Dragon King,

575
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:38,441
so I refined them secretly
and brought them to you.

576
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,961
Take them

577
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:45,560
for your safety.

578
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,721
What good thing is it?

579
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:51,280
I also want one.

580
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,441
Chong Zi, why are you here?

581
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:00,761
Chengfeng, give two to her.

582
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,681
But

583
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:04,120
I cost much cultivation to refine them.

584
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,241
That's all I have,
and I've given them to you.

585
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
I'm just joking.

586
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,641
Since I leave the
mountain to steel myself,

587
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:10,161
I should depend on myself.

588
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:12,441
Chengfeng treats you so well.

589
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,721
Chong Zi?

590
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:17,360
Why are you here?

591
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:27,681
Do you know what crime it is
to sneak out from the mountain?

592
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,600
My master asked me to leave.

593
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:31,360
Yes, her master asked her to do so.

594
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,001
You also said so in the past.

595
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:34,681
I don't believe you.

596
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:36,840
In the past?

597
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:39,921
Supervisor Sage indeed wanted that.

598
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,320
He's ordered me privately

599
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:43,080
to permit Chong Zi
to leave the mountain.

600
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:46,001
Your master cares about you very much.

601
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:48,001
Since you've left the mountain,
follow us carefully.

602
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,360
Be cautious as much as you can.

603
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:55,840
Since you've been in our team,
be serious.

604
00:35:56,001 --> 00:35:57,161
We aim to steel ourselves,

605
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,001
so don't be casual.

606
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:36,401
(When Master knows I left the mountain,)

607
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,681
(he doesn't blame me)

608
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,360
(and also gives me
a wise counsel for my safety.)

609
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,280
(He's indeed worried about me.)

610
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,040
(Hengyang Inn)

611
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,280
Qin Ke.

612
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:54,721
Why haven't you slept when it's late?

613
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:57,761
Did I

614
00:36:57,961 --> 00:37:00,080
irritate Miaoyuan again today?

615
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,600
Miaoyuan is always willful,

616
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,120
so don't take it seriously.

617
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:04,360
Don't worry.

618
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:05,961
I won't take it seriously.

619
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:15,800
What are you thinking about?

620
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:18,681
I'm thinking when the fight
between the six worlds

621
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,921
could be ended in the place
where the moon shines.

622
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:26,280
In fact, I don't know

623
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:27,800
how many forces

624
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:29,360
monsters and demons have.

625
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,001
Since we'll go to Luohe River this time,

626
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:33,560
doesn't it mean monsters are demons?

627
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,880
When Ni Lun dominated the world,

628
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:37,201
he conquered the Monster World.

629
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:38,600
After he was defeated,

630
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:40,080
monsters ran away.

631
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:41,961
In these years,

632
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:44,280
monsters join the Demon World,

633
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,921
and only those small forces,
who are unwilling to give in,

634
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,280
spread in the Mortal World.

635
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Therefore, the demons may take advantage

636
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,600
of the Dragon King's disturbance
to the Mortal World to subdue him?

637
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,320
You deserve to be
Supervisor Sage's disciple.

638
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:00,401
You overpraise me.

639
00:38:01,961 --> 00:38:04,721
I lent the Bahuang Sword to you
because I wanted to help you,

640
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,520
but I didn't expect to make you injured.

641
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,241
I'm sorry I wasn't considerate enough.

642
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,401
It's not your fault, Qin Ke.

643
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:10,921
I'm not skilled enough to control it.

644
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,201
However,

645
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,280
I learned new moves from my master,

646
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,481
and I wonder if I can ask you for advice.

647
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,001
See if I've made progress.

648
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:22,600
You're really different
from other disciples.

649
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,120
Where?

650
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,280
