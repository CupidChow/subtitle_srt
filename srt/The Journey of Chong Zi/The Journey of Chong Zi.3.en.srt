=The Journey of Chongzi=
(Adapted from "The Journey of Chongzi" by Shu Ke)

27
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,001
=Episode 3=

28
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:42,281
Don't look at me,
we don't know each other.

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,201
My name is...

30
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:44,360
Ugly girl.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,561
You are ugly.

32
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:50,400
It's you!

33
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:52,521
Are you Qin...

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,080
Qin Ke?

35
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:56,841
You still remember my name.

36
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:00,400
This is Qin Ke from Chenzhou,

37
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,720
greetings to Sage Tianji
and Councilor Sage.

38
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:03,921
Ugly girl.

39
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:05,961
I know you're making fun of me.

40
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,801
You are the disciple of Sage Tianji.

41
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,201
How could I make fun of you?

42
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:10,720
And I remember

43
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,801
you pleaded for me back then.

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,241
I wasn't pleading for you.

45
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,000
I just can't stand the weak being bullied.

46
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:20,881
I am not weak at all.

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,000
Then why have you been
hiding on Zizhu Peak

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
all these years and dared not come out?

49
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:26,041
I...

50
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:30,440
I was concentrating on
practicing the breathing method.

51
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,280
You only learned the breathing method?

52
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:34,681
Hasn't your master

53
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:37,041
ever taught you other
immortal techniques?

54
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,080
My master told me not to worry.

55
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:44,080
Did you receive private lessons?

56
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,000
Nonsense.

57
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:46,801
Since the mentorship at Liuhe Hall,

58
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,161
Master began to teach all of us
to practice the techniques.

59
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:50,241
Well...

60
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:52,360
My master made his own arrangements.

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,961
Your techniques

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,961
are not worth showing off.

63
00:02:57,681 --> 00:02:59,440
You just saw it.

64
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:16,881
I can do more.

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,401
Aren't you very courageous?

66
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,881
Ugly girl, stand still.

67
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,601
We are about to fly.

68
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:51,521
Qin Ke.

69
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:52,440
How long will it take

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,280
to practice to fly like you?

71
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
I am not stepping on clouds.

72
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:57,881
I rely on the magic weapon,
the Bahuang Sword.

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,601
It's like a good friend to me.

74
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,761
How can I get the Bahuang Sword?

75
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
I also want a good friend.

76
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,200
Didn't your master give you
a magic weapon?

77
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:09,080
No.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,521
Look.

79
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:13,761
That's the Nanhua Peak.

80
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:15,121
It was the mountain road that we took

81
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,401
when we came to apprentice.

82
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:17,321
From here,

83
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,440
the main peak doesn't seem
to be that high.

84
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:20,761
Isn't it high?

85
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:21,841
Do other mountains look like

86
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,360
earth slopes to you?

87
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,801
Where is that?

88
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,600
So nice.

89
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,561
That's the Immortal Fruit Forest,
and I haven't been there yet.

90
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,961
I'll be there with you.

91
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,920
So many fruits.

92
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:47,080
It is said that the seeds
of crimson bead

93
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:48,480
come from the God World,

94
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,040
which can increase spiritual power.

95
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
So generally speaking,
Councilor only uses them

96
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,441
to entertain the lords of various sects.

97
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:56,480
Disciples like us

98
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,160
are not qualified to eat them.

99
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:00,121
Delicious.

100
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:02,441
- What did you say?
- No!

101
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,281
Let's go to check.

102
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,801
- Over there.
- Go.

103
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:20,721
Want one?

104
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,600
Why are we escaping?

105
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:31,801
This is my first time
going down the mountain,

106
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,281
and I don't recognize the forest.

107
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,121
If we are blamed,

108
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,681
I will make an apology
to the Councilor.

109
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,160
After all,

110
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,001
I've had it.

111
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,920
How about we each eat half of it?

112
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,121
Even if we are fined, it's worth it.

113
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:46,961
I'm not afraid of being punished.

114
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,001
My master is the person
who treats me the best

115
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,801
in the whole Nanhua,

116
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:52,600
no, the whole world.

117
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:54,561
She had only been down the mountain
for half a day,

118
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:56,441
and she caused so much trouble.

119
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:57,841
Chong Zi.

120
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:05,121
How dare you steal the crimson bead?

121
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,040
I...

122
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:08,080
I picked it openly.

123
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,801
Besides, no one was watching that forest.

124
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:11,040
How do I know we can't pick it?

125
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,640
A beggar

126
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,681
can never change the habit of stealing.

127
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,561
Why are you so unreasonable?

128
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,961
I said I didn't steal.

129
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,880
If I did,

130
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,040
how could I eat this fruit

131
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,241
in front of Senior Qin?

132
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:23,600
Miaoyuan.

133
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,600
Chong Zi didn't know that
the crimson bead can't be eaten.

134
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:26,681
I didn't remind her.

135
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:27,801
Don't speak for her.

136
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:29,521
She has been in Nanhua for three years,

137
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,241
doesn't she even understand
the most basic rules?

138
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,640
Why do you need to teach her?

139
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,801
Since she doesn't understand,

140
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,360
it's not too late to learn now,

141
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:40,681
so as not to break Nanhua's rules
in the future.

142
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:42,521
I will take her

143
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:44,681
to the Patriarch's Hall to learn now.

144
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,760
Let me go.

145
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,681
Chong Zi.

146
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,721
- Senior Mu.
- Senior Mu.

147
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,920
Senior Mu.

148
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,441
You still remember me?

149
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,040
You are the disciple of Sage Chonghua.

150
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:38,640
How could I forget you?

151
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,320
I got what happened.

152
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,001
Chong Zi didn't know that
the immortal fruits can't be picked up at will.

153
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,961
Forget it this time.

154
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:49,880
Don't do this again.

155
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:50,880
(Why?)

156
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,320
(Senior Mu.)

157
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:54,521
She did something wrong,
she should be punished

158
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,200
so that she can learn a lesson.

159
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,441
How could you...

160
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,961
Qin Ke.

161
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:05,121
Why did you take Chong Zi to the
Immortal Fruit Forest without authorization?

162
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,681
Those of the Immortal World should

163
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,880
guard against arrogance and impetuosity.

164
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,760
It is a taboo to show off

165
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,200
after only learning the basics.

166
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,880
Fortunately, Chong Zi is fine.

167
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:17,080
Otherwise,

168
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:19,561
how could you explain to Sage Chonghua?

169
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,401
Senior Mu, it's my fault.

170
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:25,561
I'm going to get punished.

171
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,841
It's not a big deal.

172
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,521
Just copy the scriptures once.

173
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,760
You should go.

174
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Thank you, Senior.

175
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:45,399
(Liuhe Hall)

176
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:47,398
Miaoyuan.

177
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:50,119
It is a good thing that
you maintain the rules of Nanhua.

178
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:52,358
But if this happens again,

179
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,199
don't argue with others,

180
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:56,199
just remit it to me directly.

181
00:08:57,718 --> 00:08:58,639
Also,

182
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,199
don't tell the Councilor about
what happened today.

183
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:04,199
Understand?

184
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,518
Yes.

185
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:07,319
I acted impulsively.

186
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,278
Thank you, Senior Mu,
for your advice.

187
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:25,239
Let Sage Chonghua

188
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:27,799
deal with the crimson bead.

189
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,239
Chong Zi.

190
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:32,918
You've grown up.

191
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:34,639
You can't be as immature

192
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,958
as when you first came here.

193
00:09:36,598 --> 00:09:37,518
Understand?

194
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,639
I'd like to.

195
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,358
But Senior, look.

196
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:44,038
Everyone else knows that
we can't eat the crimson bead,

197
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:45,759
except for me.

198
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,918
I don't know any rules,

199
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,478
or any spells.

200
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:50,958
I thought that after apprenticeship,

201
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,838
everyone followed the Master
to retreat on the mountain.

202
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,439
I just found out today that

203
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:55,958
I'm the only one like this.

204
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:57,759
I don't even have a magic weapon.

205
00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:59,838
Today I was even ridiculed
by Senior Miaoyuan

206
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:01,439
because I haven't been
to the Patriarch's Hall.

207
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,838
Really?

208
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,918
They also said that

209
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:06,958
I am not worthy to be a sage's disciple.

210
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:09,799
Is a sage's discipline

211
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:12,559
someone that others
can discuss in private?

212
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:13,759
Don't worry.

213
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,639
There are no taboos
in the Patriarch's Hall.

214
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,199
I'll take you around.

215
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,358
Let's go.

216
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,679
(Patriarch's Hall)

217
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:35,559
(Immortal's Memorial Tablet)

218
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:48,799
Senior Mu.

219
00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:50,718
What's that?

220
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:52,918
This is Tianmo Token,

221
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:56,559
a Demon King's token.

222
00:10:56,718 --> 00:10:57,518
Is it...

223
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,718
Is it from the Demon World?

224
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:01,278
Chong Zi.

225
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,398
When you cultivate in Nanhua,
you should be impenetrable.

226
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,518
You don't have to be
afraid of this thing.

227
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,679
What's wrong with you?

228
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,079
Senior Mu.

229
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:26,759
I'm afraid of Tianmo Token.

230
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:28,639
It is common to be afraid
when seeing something

231
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,718
from the Demon World for the first time.

232
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:32,398
The Tianmo Token is sealed, it's okay.

233
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,639
Senior Mu, I have something to do.

234
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,918
I am leaving.

235
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,119
Is the crimson bead delicious?

236
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:57,598
Master.

237
00:11:57,838 --> 00:11:59,158
You knew everything?

238
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:02,518
Senior Mu dared not lie to me.

239
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:04,879
You are such a troublemaker.

240
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:06,598
Qin Ke is also unruly.

241
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:08,799
Copying scriptures is too easy for him.

242
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:11,718
Master.

243
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,559
Sorry.

244
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:16,799
I really wanted to go down
the mountain this time.

245
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,838
I've had enough fun.

246
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:19,879
I swear that

247
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,559
without permission from you,

248
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,199
I will never go down the mountain again.

249
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:27,278
Good.

250
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,718
But

251
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:32,319
isn't it just a crimson bead?

252
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,718
It's nothing precious.

253
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:38,398
Sima Miaoyuan was exaggerating.

254
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,038
What is there in Nanhua Mountain

255
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,718
that my disciple cannot have?

256
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,278
It's just that it's too wasteful

257
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:45,999
for you to eat like this.

258
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:47,759
Next time I will refine it
into a pill

259
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,999
to replenish your spiritual energy.

260
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,879
I know

261
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,199
you are the best.

262
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:55,799
Now I will give you

263
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:57,879
the second rule of Zizhu Peak.

264
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,759
Don't be aggressive outside,

265
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,958
don't bully others,

266
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:04,718
and don't be bullied by others.

267
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,559
Yes, I will keep it in mind.

268
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,679
You mean

269
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,038
I can go down the mountain now?

270
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:13,679
Yes.

271
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,278
But never make any trouble.

272
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:17,598
Do you think Nanhua Mountain
is Zizhu Peak?

273
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:19,319
Thank you, Master.

274
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,079
But...

275
00:13:23,838 --> 00:13:25,038
But what?

276
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:26,598
But

277
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,398
I found out that the seniors

278
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,439
who went to Nanhua Mountain with me

279
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,478
have all learned spells.

280
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,679
Only me can do nothing.

281
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:37,239
And I have never been
to the Patriarch's Hall.

282
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,639
Master, why don't you teach me anything?

283
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,519
(Xi)

284
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,239
(Xi)

285
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,239
Xichun Restaurant's pastries.

286
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,799
Master, have you been to Panhai Town?

287
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:53,239
Eat it now.

288
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:01,598
It's still as tasty as I remembered.

289
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:05,999
You are not a kid anymore.

290
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:07,598
Why do you always

291
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,799
get dirty while eating?

292
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:15,759
Because you don't need to know these.

293
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:19,999
They will leave their masters one day,

294
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:22,119
so they have to learn spells.

295
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:24,478
But you won't leave me.

296
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:26,879
So you don't need to learn.

297
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,158
You are just coaxing me.

298
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:31,958
How come?

299
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:34,319
Or do you want to leave me?

300
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,639
No.

301
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,799
I never thought of leaving you.

302
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,518
Junior.

303
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:06,439
You practice this swordsmanship
day and night.

304
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:07,879
You should be good at it.

305
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:08,879
What's wrong with you today?

306
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,679
Miaoyuan, your swordsmanship
is getting better.

307
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,879
I'm inferior to you.

308
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:13,398
Liar.

309
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:15,718
You've been out of mind

310
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,358
since Chong Zi went down the mountain.

311
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,319
Are you still thinking about her?

312
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,038
Not at all.

313
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:23,999
I grew up with you.

314
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:25,799
I know what's on your mind.

315
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,158
I was just thinking that

316
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:28,838
if Sage Chonghua

317
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,718
never taught Chong Zi anything,

318
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,439
how could she gain a foothold
in the Immortal World in the future?

319
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,079
I want to help her.

320
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,518
But I can't seem to do anything.

321
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:41,199
Why are you thinking so much?

322
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:43,319
It's none of your business.

323
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:44,478
Don't forget that

324
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,319
it's because of her

325
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:47,358
that you were punished by Senior Mu
to copy scriptures.

326
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,999
Never think about her again.

327
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:52,439
If there is nothing else,

328
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,239
I am leaving.

329
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:57,398
She is a beggar who knows nothing.

330
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,598
On the day of apprenticeship,
you also saw that

331
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:00,759
she is with evil breath.

332
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,679
No one knows what she is.

333
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,518
Qin Ke, Chong Zi would only
bring you trouble.

334
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,158
Don't be entangled with her.

335
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,598
It's for your own good.

336
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,199
I mean it.

337
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,359
I heard that

338
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:22,158
you let Chong Zi
leave the Zizhu Peak yesterday.

339
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:23,559
I think she is noisy.

340
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,038
I don't think so.

341
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:26,118
It must be because

342
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,439
you want to show off
with your disciple.

343
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,158
But she doesn't know anything,

344
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:32,038
the same as when she first came here
three years ago.

345
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:34,679
The disciples who came to Nanhua
with her back then,

346
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,479
no matter how ordinary
their qualifications are,

347
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,278
they are already proficient

348
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,599
in basic swordsmanship.

349
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,679
Aren't you afraid that
she will be paranoid

350
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:42,878
after discovering something?

351
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:44,638
Isn't it that you

352
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,118
want her to know no spells?

353
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,679
As you can see,

354
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:49,959
when she didn't learn spells

355
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,398
and stayed with me

356
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:52,679
on Zizhu peak every day,

357
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,158
she never showed any evil breath,

358
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:55,638
let alone hurt anyone.

359
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:58,758
Please rest assured.

360
00:17:59,038 --> 00:17:59,918
In fact,

361
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,319
I was also worried that
she didn't know any spells,

362
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,038
but when I thought that

363
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,479
she would not leave me

364
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:09,238
and Zizhu Peak because of this,

365
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,559
I thought it was okay.

366
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:13,878
Now that you've said that,

367
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,679
I don't have to worry about it.

368
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:16,839
Yinfan, however,

369
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,799
if she can't do anything in the future,

370
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,238
it's a pity that

371
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:22,118
no one will inherit your superb spells.

372
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:24,158
Don't you consider taking
in more disciples?

373
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:27,599
Chong Zi is my only disciple.

374
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,479
The pendant is finally ready.

375
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:35,319
I wonder if Master will think that

376
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,758
I've grown up after receiving the gift,

377
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:37,799
and I am no longer
the troublesome Chong Zi

378
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,319
I used to be.

379
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:51,959
Who are you?

380
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:55,398
I have engraved this pendant
for many days,

381
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,238
and it is a gift to Master.

382
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,118
Why did you destroy it?

383
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:06,238
Master said that

384
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:08,278
I shall not kill, hurt others,

385
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:09,959
or harm the innocent.

386
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,359
I won't hurt you.

387
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:18,839
But don't bite me.

388
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:23,038
You little thing.

389
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:24,719
I asked you to guard Zizhu Peak,

390
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:26,079
not to hurt others.

391
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:34,599
You are so tiny.

392
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:35,758
All right.

393
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,398
Lion.

394
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,038
Did it hurt you?

395
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:45,918
Master, don't blame it.

396
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:46,959
It was my fault.

397
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:49,079
You said I was not allowed
to enter this forest.

398
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:51,118
But I still broke in.

399
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,799
Master.

400
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:04,199
This is my gift to you.

401
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:10,719
It's okay.

402
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,998
Fortunately, you are fine.

403
00:20:13,118 --> 00:20:14,799
It's raised by me and is called Lion.

404
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,839
I rescued it from the Demon World
a hundred years ago,

405
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:18,439
and brought it back to Nanhua.

406
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,998
It's wild but kindhearted.

407
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,998
It has been guarding Zizhu Peak

408
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,719
in the depths of this forest.

409
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,238
As soon as your master
heard Lion's yell,

410
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,158
he worried that you were in danger.

411
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,959
You are so lucky

412
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:38,439
to have a good master.

413
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:40,758
When you confronted Lion just now,

414
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:42,359
you controlled the evil breath.

415
00:20:42,878 --> 00:20:43,758
It's a progress.

416
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:45,479
I promised you not to kill,

417
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,959
nor to have the intention
of harming others.

418
00:20:47,758 --> 00:20:49,758
As long as you have good thoughts
and don't do evil things,

419
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:51,439
you can naturally suppress
the evil breath.

420
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,238
Maybe one day it will even disappear.

421
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:56,839
Don't worry, Master,
I won't do bad things.

422
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,199
I met an Immortal

423
00:20:58,238 --> 00:20:59,799
like you before.

424
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:01,158
He was dressed in white,

425
00:21:01,638 --> 00:21:03,079
and I didn't know his name,

426
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,679
so I called him Mr. Immortal.

427
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:06,599
He put a spell on me,

428
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:08,679
as long as someone hit me,
that person would fly out.

429
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:11,599
But it didn't work soon.

430
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,878
When?

431
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,199
It didn't work

432
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:18,839
soon after I met him.

433
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,359
There is no such person in the world,

434
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:26,959
so the spell was solved naturally.

435
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,599
Is he

436
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,199
gone?

437
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,638
He's dead?

438
00:21:34,998 --> 00:21:36,638
Immortals also die?

439
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,479
Immortals won't die easily.

440
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:40,439
But then something happened.

441
00:21:40,878 --> 00:21:42,278
The sword of Ni Lun was stolen,

442
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,839
and the Demon King Wan Jie
appeared in the world.

443
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,559
None of the three thousand disciples

444
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:46,919
who escorted the sword of Ni Lun back

445
00:21:47,078 --> 00:21:48,118
was spared.

446
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,198
Chong.

447
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:51,879
Do you remember

448
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:53,559
what that man looked like?

449
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,879
He is as good-looking

450
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,238
as you.

451
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,759
Did he have a sword with him?

452
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:08,679
You've been chasing for so long,

453
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:10,439
it's time to end.

454
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:14,439
Wan Jie, you have nowhere to escape.

455
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:15,559
Hand over the sword,

456
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:17,759
and I can make your death easier.

457
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,279
So overconfident.

458
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,639
The Ninth Heaven Thunder Fire Array.

459
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,718
What an insignificant skill.

460
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:52,598
Enough?

461
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:54,439
Piss off.

462
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,879
The sword of Ni Lun!

463
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,439
Run!

464
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:13,159
Run!

465
00:23:13,198 --> 00:23:13,919
Come on.

466
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:35,478
(I'm going to bring Keran back.)

467
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:48,799
Master.

468
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:49,879
You know what?

469
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:52,679
I came to Nanhua because of
Mr. Immortal's encouragement.

470
00:23:52,838 --> 00:23:54,279
I want to learn spells,

471
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:55,998
and to protect the people

472
00:23:56,078 --> 00:23:57,559
I want to protect like him.

473
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:00,238
Master, do you have someone
you want to protect?

474
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:03,399
We in the Immortal World
care about the common people.

475
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:04,718
What about you?

476
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,039
Who do you want to protect?

477
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,879
I want to protect Dou

478
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:09,759
from being bullied all the time.

479
00:24:10,118 --> 00:24:11,318
And

480
00:24:12,078 --> 00:24:12,998
you.

481
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,198
I don't want you to die

482
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,118
like Mr. Immortal.

483
00:24:18,318 --> 00:24:20,078
I won't die so easily.

484
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,118
I know that you have great spells.

485
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,838
You put others first in everything,

486
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,399
and never think about yourself.

487
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:28,838
I just thought that

488
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:30,759
since you protect the common people
in the world,

489
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:32,039
I will protect you.

490
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,078
I know I'm a little overwhelmed.

491
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,439
But if you don't teach me anything,

492
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:42,358
I will never be strong.

493
00:24:42,838 --> 00:24:45,039
Then if you are in danger,

494
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,519
I can only stand by and watch.

495
00:24:59,478 --> 00:25:00,478
Don't worry.

496
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,679
I won't let this happen.

497
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:06,998
Do you really want to go back
to the Mortal World?

498
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:17,559
(Panhai Town)

499
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:21,279
(Miss, take a look at the umbrellas.)

500
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:21,998
(Okay.)

501
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,919
I almost can't recognize Panhai Town.

502
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,679
It wasn't so prosperous here before.

503
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,559
I can't find Dou.

504
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,078
Perhaps she's no longer a beggar.

505
00:25:48,478 --> 00:25:49,598
(Xichun Restaurant)
Take your time.

506
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,879
Even if we can't find her today,

507
00:25:50,998 --> 00:25:52,078
there is still a chance.

508
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,318
We can find her anyway.

509
00:25:54,478 --> 00:25:55,318
Does it really taste good?

510
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,919
The pastries here are the best.

511
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,399
(Xichun Restaurant)
I bought some plum blossom puff pastries today.

512
00:25:58,478 --> 00:26:00,718
The taste is irresistible.

513
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,358
You have to try it.

514
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,439
(Xichun Restaurant)

515
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,478
What?

516
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:07,478
Hungry?

517
00:26:10,478 --> 00:26:13,439
Although I was begging
around here before,

518
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:14,718
I had never taken

519
00:26:14,718 --> 00:26:15,879
a whole piece of the dessert here.

520
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:17,159
Once,

521
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,799
Dou stole a piece of

522
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:20,159
lotus seed pastry for me.

523
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:22,998
But it was grabbed.

524
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:23,799
The two of us

525
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:25,838
had to lick the puff pastry in her hands.

526
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,759
But that was delicious too.

527
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,318
Take a try.

528
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:40,559
It's delicious.

529
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:41,919
I'm here with you.

530
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,318
You should eat alone.

531
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:44,998
Master.

532
00:26:44,998 --> 00:26:45,838
Just try it.

533
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:47,198
It really tastes good.

534
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,039
Come on.

535
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:51,879
Take a try.

536
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:53,238
Take a try.

537
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,039
How is it?

538
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,919
- Really nice.
- I told you.

539
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,358
You will like to eat what I like.

540
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:12,919
Master.

541
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:15,718
They say fine food goes well
with good wine.

542
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,958
May I try it today too?

543
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,998
So that's what you came up with.

544
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:24,718
Forget it.

545
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:26,439
It's all up to you today.

546
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:29,759
Chong.

547
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:31,238
Thank you, Master.

548
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:41,639
Master.

549
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:42,519
It's so spicy.

550
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,759
Why so spicy?

551
00:27:44,598 --> 00:27:45,759
Are you okay?

552
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:48,238
Yes.

553
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,679
(Xichun Restaurant)

554
00:27:52,598 --> 00:27:53,478
Cheers.

555
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:56,159
Chong.

556
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:57,478
Chong.

557
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:58,679
You are drunk.

558
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,198
- No more wine.
- You can't drink anymore.

559
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:01,559
Give it to me.

560
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,639
I'm not drunk.

561
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,478
Chong.

562
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:06,759
Give it to me.

563
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,399
Listen to me.

564
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,159
I'm not drunk.

565
00:28:12,598 --> 00:28:13,919
Drunk?

566
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,118
I'm

567
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,399
so happy now.

568
00:28:19,118 --> 00:28:19,958
Master.

569
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:21,879
Being drunk is to be happy?

570
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,318
Are you drunk then?

571
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:26,439
Of course I won't be drunk.

572
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:29,198
No way.

573
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,159
Then drink more.

574
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,639
- Drink.
- All right.

575
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:32,998
Why are you pretending to be innocent?

576
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,478
It's your honor to drink.

577
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,519
Sir.

578
00:28:36,718 --> 00:28:38,039
Calm down.

579
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:40,639
Hong Dou, apologize to him.

580
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,559
Sir.

581
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:44,039
She's not feeling well today.

582
00:28:44,478 --> 00:28:46,439
Sorry to offend you.

583
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:47,598
Drink.

584
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:48,919
Drink.

585
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:50,358
Sir.

586
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:52,998
Where are you from?

587
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,679
Leave us alone.

588
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:57,318
You come here to drink
with evil intentions.

589
00:28:57,598 --> 00:28:59,919
You are not worthy of the fine wines
from Xichun Restaurant.

590
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,679
I will hit you in the mouth.

591
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,519
How dare you hit me?

592
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:05,519
I will hit your hands.

593
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:07,358
Don't you know that one should never
hit others in the face?

594
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:08,958
I will hit you.

595
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,279
Hit you.

596
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,318
Hit you.

597
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,078
Don't move.

598
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:16,799
Pay.

599
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:23,399
This...

600
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,598
It's for your wine.

601
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,159
Thank you.

602
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:32,759
Miss, take the money.

603
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,159
Miss.

604
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,238
Why are you staring at me?

605
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:45,519
I'm not.

606
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,078
I think

607
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:50,399
you look like a friend of mine.

608
00:29:51,198 --> 00:29:53,639
I wonder how she is doing now.

609
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:02,879
Thank you for your help, Master,

610
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,919
so that

611
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:06,478
I upheld justice for that girl.

612
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:08,879
Look at you.

613
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,279
I really have to teach you
some spells in the future.

614
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:12,919
Otherwise,

615
00:30:13,238 --> 00:30:14,958
I will worry about you.

616
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,039
(Sorry, Chongzi.)

617
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:45,399
(Master is so handsome.)

618
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,078
Chong.

619
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,279
What are you looking at?

620
00:31:00,598 --> 00:31:01,879
Master.

621
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:03,838
I'm so hot.

622
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,919
I want to get some fresh air.

623
00:31:18,238 --> 00:31:18,879
Chong.

624
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:20,078
Wait for me here.

625
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:28,118
(Xichun Restaurant)

626
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:29,238
Master.

627
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:50,799
I'm an immortal of Nanhua.

628
00:31:50,998 --> 00:31:53,198
My Master is Luo Yinfan, Sage Chonghua.

629
00:31:53,318 --> 00:31:54,559
If you dare to do anything to me,

630
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,358
my master will not spare you.

631
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:10,279
Hide yourself.

632
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,159
Go back with me.

633
00:32:36,318 --> 00:32:37,478
You wish!

634
00:32:48,318 --> 00:32:49,879
Master, he ran away.

635
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:51,639
Why not hunt him down?

636
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,159
Let's go back to Chonghua Palace now.

637
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,039
(Chonghua Palace)
Right.

638
00:32:56,838 --> 00:32:58,639
We also just got the news.

639
00:32:59,358 --> 00:33:01,718
He killed the disciple
of Changsheng Palace,

640
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:03,519
and even uttered wild words

641
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,598
that he wanted to take Gong Keran away.

642
00:33:05,838 --> 00:33:09,078
Qinghua Palace has now received
a request for help.

643
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,318
Lord Ming hopes that Gong Keran

644
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,039
could hide in Qinghua Palace,

645
00:33:13,238 --> 00:33:14,958
and he would use the birthday
of Lord Zhuo to

646
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,279
ambush Wan Jie
and regain the demon sword.

647
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:19,838
Now Miss Gong

648
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:21,958
temporarily lives in the Dragon Abyss
in the East Sea.

649
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,519
This place is easy to defend
but difficult to attack,

650
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:25,519
and this time all the immortals
are gathered together.

651
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,879
Even if he dares to come
to rescue again,

652
00:33:26,998 --> 00:33:28,799
we will be able to trap him.

653
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:30,799
Wan Jie did play a risky move.

654
00:33:31,118 --> 00:33:32,759
But since he dared
to take such a big risk,

655
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:34,519
we should be more careful
in dealing with it.

656
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,598
How about I go to Qinghua

657
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,078
to celebrate the birthday
on behalf of Nanhua?

658
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,879
Shall we send disciples to support you?

659
00:33:42,118 --> 00:33:42,919
No need.

660
00:33:43,118 --> 00:33:45,639
None of you understand Wan Jie's
tricks better than I do.

661
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,519
It makes sense.

662
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:53,919
After all, you and Wan Jie...

663
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:01,838
Yinfan.

664
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,358
This gold-rimmed nanmu medicine box
is quite rare.

665
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:05,198
Choose a superior elixir

666
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:06,598
and put it in it

667
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,919
as a birthday gift for Lord Zhuo.

668
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,999
(Chonghua Palace)

669
00:34:20,598 --> 00:34:23,159
As soon as Master came back,

670
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:25,399
he went to discuss the matter with them.

671
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,078
What are they talking about?

672
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,239
(Chong Zi is my disciple.)

673
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:35,758
(Whether she goes or stays is up to me.)

674
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,679
(It would not be a good thing)

675
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,159
(for your disciple)

676
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:41,239
(if Wan Jie)

677
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:43,159
(had his eye)

678
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,518
(on Chong Zi.)

679
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:46,199
I will teach her protective techniques

680
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,719
to deal with demons.

681
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,239
What?

682
00:34:50,278 --> 00:34:51,879
You are going to teach her
immortal techniques?

683
00:34:52,278 --> 00:34:52,798
You...

684
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:54,518
Aren't you afraid of
arousing her evil breath?

685
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,199
In the past, she just stayed in Nanhua,

686
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:57,959
so naturally she didn't
need to learn spells.

687
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,679
But now the crisis is approaching.

688
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:01,679
I don't expect her to
uphold justice.

689
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:03,999
I just hope she can take care of herself

690
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,679
while I'm away.

691
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:06,679
You...

692
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:08,639
You must be crazy.

693
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:11,118
Her inborn evil breath
is already dangerous.

694
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:13,038
If she cultivates the immortal bones
and stays in Nanhua,

695
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,919
there will be endless troubles
in the future.

696
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:16,999
Could there be another...

697
00:35:17,318 --> 00:35:19,758
Another...

698
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:24,798
Why are you going to do this?

699
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:26,318
Nothing special.

700
00:35:26,598 --> 00:35:28,999
My disciple has good thoughts
and has never done evil.

701
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,798
I have no reason to let her go.

702
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:33,479
Then I will send her
into Sifang Furnace,

703
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:34,798
break up her primordial spirit,

704
00:35:35,038 --> 00:35:36,838
(Chonghua Palace)
and let her stay in Nanhua forever.

705
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:40,798
Try it if you dare.

706
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,558
I'm the Councilor Sage of Nanhua.

707
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:45,838
I would never take a chance

708
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:47,318
on this.

709
00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:49,358
Senior, if this is spread out,

710
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:51,239
others will definitely say that Nanhua's people
killed innocent people indiscriminately.

711
00:35:51,278 --> 00:35:52,278
We'll lose our reputation.

712
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,838
We'd lose our reputation

713
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:55,719
only when a Demon King appears in Nanhua.

714
00:35:59,038 --> 00:35:59,838
Yinfan.

715
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:02,358
You might as well hide Chong Zi
in the countryside,

716
00:36:02,518 --> 00:36:03,879
away from the disputes of the six worlds.

717
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:05,999
It's also a way.

718
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:08,758
I'm not going anywhere.

719
00:36:16,278 --> 00:36:17,879
My master needs someone by his side.

720
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:19,518
Nobody but I know

721
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,758
how to take care of him.

722
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:25,078
My master likes to drink on Zizhu Peak.

723
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,959
And he never does cleaning after drunk.

724
00:36:27,038 --> 00:36:29,679
And the pharmacy is in a mess.

725
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,598
I have to clean it every day.

726
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:33,838
Clothes are all over the floor

727
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:36,479
and it takes me a lot of time
to pack them up.

728
00:36:36,558 --> 00:36:37,598
Enough.

729
00:36:40,318 --> 00:36:42,159
I thought life was really hard

730
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,118
in the Mortal World.

731
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:46,399
I didn't expect that it
would be more difficult

732
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:50,399
to take care of Master in Nanhua.

733
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:51,999
Nonsense!

734
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,318
Yinfan.

735
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,239
You just let her say that about you?

736
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,199
She's exaggerating.

737
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:02,159
But it is true that

738
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,479
Chong manages Chonghua Palace.

739
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,038
You!

740
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:07,838
It turned out that Master
saw all my hard work.

741
00:37:08,038 --> 00:37:09,879
It's worth it for me to do so much.

742
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:10,798
I am willing to

743
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:13,239
share worries for Master.

744
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:14,358
You!

745
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,318
Councilor.

746
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:33,439
Master.

747
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:34,719
Master.

748
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,719
What? The show isn't over yet?

749
00:37:37,118 --> 00:37:38,479
You still owe me an explanation.

750
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:39,679
Do you want to slip away?

751
00:37:40,078 --> 00:37:41,439
Why should I?

752
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,078
I see.

753
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,639
Master is also hesitating
whether to send me away.

754
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:54,558
Go.

755
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:56,399
Where are you going?

756
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,879
Didn't Sage Tianji ask you

757
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,038
to send me to the countryside?

758
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:04,999
What else have you heard?

759
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:06,278
Just that one sentence

760
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:08,038
made me break in.

761
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:09,838
That's just what they said.

762
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,358
I didn't agree.

763
00:38:12,278 --> 00:38:14,719
Anyway, if you want to send me away,

764
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:16,758
I will pour ink into the Four Seas

765
00:38:17,038 --> 00:38:18,278
and set fire to Zizhu Peak.

766
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:19,838
By then, I will let everyone know that

767
00:38:20,038 --> 00:38:20,719
you are not

768
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:22,278
a serious immortal.

769
00:38:22,558 --> 00:38:23,919
You like to drink in private,

770
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,199
and you secretly go fishing
with Sage Tianji.

771
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:28,078
And everyone will laugh at you

772
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:30,358
for being a drunkard or a blind sage.

773
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:34,798
Master.

774
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:36,278
Why is this medicine not that bitter?

775
00:38:36,518 --> 00:38:37,598
It's specially prepared for you.

776
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,479
So I added some purple stamen honey.

777
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:41,199
People say yes to those they owe.

778
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,679
Now that you eat this,

779
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:45,078
you can never ruin the Four Seas

780
00:38:45,278 --> 00:38:46,479
and burn the Zizhu Peak.

781
00:38:46,598 --> 00:38:47,838
You must be afraid.

782
00:38:48,278 --> 00:38:49,999
You'll make me leave Zizhu Peak,

783
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:51,439
over

784
00:38:51,558 --> 00:38:52,518
my dead body.

785
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:55,838
Silly kid.

786
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,479
Do not talk lightly about life and death.

787
00:39:01,278 --> 00:39:02,278
But

788
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,798
if Zizhu Peak loses Chong,

789
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:07,199
maybe all seasons

790
00:39:07,518 --> 00:39:09,038
will become boring.

791
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:13,959
Take it for me.

792
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:30,199
It takes a hundred years to refine
one Nine-time Refined Elixir.

793
00:39:34,358 --> 00:39:35,118
Keep it for me.

794
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:37,838
And you will dedicate it
to Lord Zhuo later.

795
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:40,999
Are you going to
take me to Qinghua Palace?

796
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:42,358
I'm afraid you are playful.

797
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:44,038
It's better to take you by my side.

798
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,439
Master is so nice.

799
00:39:45,598 --> 00:39:47,318
It turned out that
I had suffered so much

800
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,518
in order to meet Master.

801
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,518
I wish I could meet you earlier

802
00:39:53,598 --> 00:39:55,038
and bring you by my side.

803
00:39:56,118 --> 00:39:56,999
That way,

804
00:39:57,278 --> 00:39:59,118
you wouldn't have gone through
so many ups and downs.

805
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:37,159
It's my fault

806
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,879
for disturbing your mood.

807
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,159
Why are you here?

808
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:45,518
This place

809
00:40:46,518 --> 00:40:47,758
is too lonely

810
00:40:48,399 --> 00:40:49,558
for you.

811
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,159
It's better to go back
to Demon King Hall

812
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,278
to play Guqin and perform music,
accompanied by beautiful women.

813
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:58,278
Wouldn't it be fun?

814
00:40:58,758 --> 00:40:59,639
Demon Palace?

815
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,679
Do you think you are qualified
to say the words "go back"?

816
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,318
Wang Yue, you are clear that

817
00:41:07,118 --> 00:41:08,679
I never belonged to you.

818
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:11,719
So, as the Demon King,

819
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:14,038
I've come to invite you myself.

820
00:41:14,358 --> 00:41:16,118
Do you think I will be grateful?

821
00:41:21,399 --> 00:41:22,639
Without you,

822
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:25,879
how could there be Wan Jie today?

823
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,038
Keran.

824
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:04,439
Master.

825
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:15,959
Master.

826
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:17,239
Master.

827
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:19,278
Master. Master.

828
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:21,358
Master, what happened?

829
00:42:23,798 --> 00:42:25,078
No.

830
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:28,159
The demons

831
00:42:28,598 --> 00:42:30,798
have broken the barrier.

832
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:32,598
You

833
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:38,118
have to protect the sword of Ni Lun.

834
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:41,159
- It can't be obtained...
- Master.

835
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,919
by the demons.

836
00:42:45,598 --> 00:42:46,719
Master.

837
00:42:47,479 --> 00:42:48,798
Master.

838
00:42:49,078 --> 00:42:50,598
Master.

839
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:04,518
Senior.

840
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:06,239
Let her go.

841
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:09,159
You came just in time.

842
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:11,479
Hand over the sword of Ni Lun.

843
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:13,199
You wish!

844
00:44:20,278 --> 00:44:21,199
Senior.

845
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:40,838
Are you Tian Zhixie,

846
00:44:42,118 --> 00:44:43,479
protector of the Demon Palace?

847
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,824
♪When affection turns into stars♪

848
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:09,858
♪Missing would go afar♪
