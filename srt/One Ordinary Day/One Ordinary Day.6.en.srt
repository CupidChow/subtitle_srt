It's okay. Don't be afraid.

6
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,530
Let's go in.

7
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,200
Goodness, look at these hyenas.

8
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,239
It's okay. It's all right.

9
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:12,739
Hey, Hyun Soo. It's okay.

10
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,688

Hey, Hyun Soo.

This walk-through isn't about winning or losing.

13
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,200
It's like a stage play, okay?

14
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,290
They'll do whatever it takes to provoke you...

15
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:00,170
to shake you all up.

16
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,790
Do not react to the things they say or show you.

17
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,629
Just think of it as a stage play and watch them.

18
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,680
Okay?

19
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,259
Yes?

20
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,680

This walk-through of the scene...

23
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,779
will be conducted...

24
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,699
by Chief Park Sang Bum from Chungang Police Station.

25
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,960
Let's begin.

26
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,349
The accused and the victim...

27
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:56,770
drank together right here.

28
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,479
As you can see,

29
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:02,099
they almost finished an entire bottle of tequila.

30
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,859
LSD and ketamine...

31
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,739
are the two drugs that they took.

32
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,698
- Chief Park, look here! - Look at the camera.

33
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:11,780
Over here!

34
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,789
Hey, boyfriend.

35
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:43,979
Around midnight,

36
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,649
the accused, who was drunk,

37
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,770
started sexually assaulting the victim.

38
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,030
He undressed the victim.

39
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,870
Be more brutal.

40
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,789
The victim strongly resisted.

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,370
So in the end,

42
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,580
he began to threaten her with this knife.

43
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,339
The victim got these cuts on her palm...

44
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,509
while tussling with the accused.

45
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,888
And these are the traces that he left...

46
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,560
while attempting to destroy evidence immediately after the incident.

47
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,889
They started...

48
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:23,269
right here,

49
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,769
and through this staircase,

50
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,730
they went upstairs.

51
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,860
Let's go upstairs now.

52
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,779
After taking down the victim,

53
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,870
the accused pushed her onto the bed and tried to rape her.

54
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,790
In this process,

55
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,420
this lamp here was knocked to the floor.

56
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:51,000
The victim continued to resist.

57
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,378
So the accused, who was furious, stabbed her...

58
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:56,719
on the right side of the neck and the left side of the chest.

59
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,509
He stabbed her twice.

60
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,189
Then he flipped the victim, who had no strength left to fight back,

61
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,560
and stabbed her ten times in the back.

62
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,110
As you can see, the stab wounds in this horrible photo...

63
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,319
are the result of this.

64
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,290
Hyun Soo. Hey, what's wrong?

65
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,250
The nebulizer!

66
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,208
Does anyone have a nebulizer?

67
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:56,878
- The nebulizer! - Call an ambulance!

68
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,089
Get me a nebulizer.

69
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,378
What are you doing? Get lost, jerk!

70
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,469
Hey, breathe!

71
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,009
Breathe! Hey!

72
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,389

- at 9am this morning... - Reporter Kang.

75
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,000
Drinking, smoking, stress, and dealing with trashy reporters.

76
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,420
Guess what's the worst for the skin out of the four things.

77
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,379
Gosh, watch what you say.

78
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,758
I'm no trashy reporter.

79
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,339
He was on the verge of death,

80
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,049
yet you were busy getting that all on camera.

81

conduct a walk-through of the scene.

86
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,689

88
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,459
Darn it.

89
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,669
You didn't suffer a cardiac arrest,

90
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,089
so don't worry about the complications.

91
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,180
If everything's okay tonight, you can be discharged tomorrow.

94

That was the best choice you could make at that moment.

95
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:04,379
I've met so many guys like you,

96

What did you do next?

128
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,629
I confirmed that he wasn't the taxi owner...

and ordered a breathalyzer test after smelling alcohol on him.

However, I couldn't because the battery in it died.

You weren't able to administer the test,

132
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:38,509
so how did you know that he was drunk?

133
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,480
He had lost focus in his eyes,

134
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,940
and he reeked of alcohol.

135

you took a detour to the crime scene.

171
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,639
- Yes. - So answer me.

172
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,179
How many unlawful acts...

173
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:49,940
did you commit that night?

174
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:53,360
- What? - Unlawful acts?

175
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,230
Is the woman...

176
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,610
dead?

177
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,700
Is the woman...

178
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:03,070
dead?

179
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,159
"Is the woman dead?"

180
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,210
What went through your mind...

181
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:12,878
when you heard that question?

182
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,210
At the time, I didn't think too much of it.

183
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,589
But when we found the knife in his jacket,

184
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,008
I realized what he meant.

185
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:22,139
Which was what?

186
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,889
I believed he was seeking confirmation.

187
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,559
So you're saying that he checked...

188
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,558
to see if the victim had died.

189
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,559
That's right.

190
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:33,809
That will be all.

191
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,730
"Is the woman dead?"

192
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,490
This was before he was arrested as a suspect,

193
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,990
so why would he have asked you this?

194
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,909
Well...

195
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,699
Because the victim being alive...

196
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,908
would only cause more trouble for him.

197
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,999
Could he have asked you this...

198
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,418
because he was worried about her?

199
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:56,629
Well...

200
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:00,508
He didn't sound worried if you ask me.

201
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:04,049
What about you then?

202
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,139
Did you feel bad for the victim?

203
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:08,519
Sorry?

204
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,898
Oh, yes. Of course, I...

205
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:16,019
Let's watch the dashcam footage together.

206
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,909
The call came in at 4am.

207
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:26,529
It was 4am, right?

208
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,080
The victim was 25 years of age.

209
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,919
Hold on a second. How many times was she stabbed?

210
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,840
I'm not sure. Probably 12 or 13.

211
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Is that your lottery ticket?

212
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,549
(Jury)

213
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,090
- What on earth? - Seriously?

214
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,759
Officer,

215
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,929
were you so sad and upset for the victim...

216
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:54,190
that you matched the numbers on your lottery ticket?

217
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Well...

218
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,768
But I...

219
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,860
(Judge)

220
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,279
That will be all.

221
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,289
(Prosecution)

222
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,789
The defendant's high school homeroom teacher...

223
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,750
will be summoned as the next witness.

224
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,380
In high school,

225
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,009
the defendant...

226
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,930
was advised to transfer schools.

227
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:33,890
Could you elaborate on that?

228
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:35,349
Hyun Soo...

229
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:36,349
(Witness)

230
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,230
Well, he fought with a classmate...

231
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:41,019
which led to a severe injury.

232
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,490
Two of his classmate's teeth got broken.

233
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,150
Physical altercation can happen between friends,

234
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,950
so a transfer of schools seems like cruel punishment.

235
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,740
Because it wasn't just a tussle.

236
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,410
Hyun Soo...

237
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,288
pushed him down the stairs.

238
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:58,380
(Jury)

239
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,880
During a physical altercation,

240
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,670
he pushed his classmate down the stairs.

241
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:08,469
One can say that both parties are responsible.

242
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:11,299
So why did the defendant have to transfer schools?

243
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,890
The friend's teeth didn't break...

244
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,680
before he tripped down the stairs.

245
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,059
It was the other way around.

246
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,599
What do you mean?

247
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,819
He was pushed off the stairs first.

248
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,730
And then Hyun Soo assaulted him...

249
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,029
while he lay unconscious.

250
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:36,039
(Jury)

251
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:37,789
Defendant.

252
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,750
(Defendant)

253
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,329
This is important,

254
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,089
so think long and hard...

255
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,089
before you tell us what really happened.

256
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,759
Well...

257
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,479
(Defendant)

258
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,150
My father partook in a strike...

259
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,990
to increase the base taxi fare by 30 cents.

260
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,200
The friend made snarky comments...

261
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,329
about the fact that it was only 30 cents.

262
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,750
From then on,

263
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,509
everyone teased me endlessly by calling me 30 Cents.

264
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:33,390
Why didn't you alert the school of the bullying?

265
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,930
Well...

266
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,769
I...

267
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,440
couldn't.

268
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,069
It would kill my father...

269
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,000
to have known.

270
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,750
Mr. Kim,

271
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:11,930
do you regret...

272
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,430
what happened in high school, and have you shown remorse?

273
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,019
Yes.

274
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,190
It was a lapse in judgement.

275
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:25,980
I apologized...

276
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:29,859
and also asked the friend for forgiveness.

277
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,700
That's right.

278
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,609
A lapse in judgement.

279
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:39,539
Today...

280
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:43,710
is my first day being first chair in a trial.

281
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:49,460
And I also slipped up.

282
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,549
Four years in college,

283
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,140
three years in law school,

284
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,930
and eight months of on-the-job training.

285
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,599
Despite the dozens of mock trials I participated in,

286
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,940
I made a mistake.

287
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
However,

288
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:14,240
isn't that the same for all of us?

289
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,369
The police officer who didn't provide water at the DUI checkpoint.

290
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:19,868
The officer who played his lottery ticket...

291
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:21,160
with numbers from the crime scene.

292
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:23,960
A son who physically assaulted another...

293
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:26,500
outraged by the insults made toward his father.

294
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,589
How can we say they are at fault?

295
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:34,259
Today in court, the prosecution failed...

296
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,258
to provide direct evidence linking my client to the murder.

297
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:40,759
All she did was blindly question his moral conduct.

298
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,059
"Is the woman dead?"

299
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,268
Is it logical and reasonable to assume that this one question...

300
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:53,190
is an admission of guilt?

301
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,279
That I can answer with certainty.

302
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,039
And my answer would be "no."

303
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,170
I rest my case.

304
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:36,319
Hyun Soo, do you remember this?

305
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,160
It looked like you had eaten fruit in her bedroom.

306
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:45,039
No, I don't recall eating the fruit.

307
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,039
There must've been a knife here.

308
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,339
Could it have been the knife you had?

309
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,970
That knife was in the kitchen.

310
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:01,339
What about the drugs?

311
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:04,309
The drugs that Hong Guk Hwa gave you that night.

312
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,180
Do you know where she got them?

313
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,599
Here, look.

314
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:12,730
This girl's name is Yoon Hyo Jung.

315
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,229
She and Hong Guk Hwa lived together.

316
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,690
Did she say anything about her?

317
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:20,029
The house is big enough,

318
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,029
so I let a friend stay with me.

319
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,579
But I had her leave after a big falling-out last week.

320
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,038
She did say she had a falling-out...

321
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,960
with a friend who was staying with her.

322
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,500
A falling-out?

323
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:38,838
Yes. They had a falling-out, and she had cut all ties with her.

324
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:39,930
I see.

325
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,509
They had a falling-out.

326
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:54,859
I'd say it's going very well so far.

327
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,779
The jurors are starting to listen to you.

328
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,190
I know this isn't easy, but try to stay strong.

329
00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:02,200
I'll do my best too.

330
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,029
- Okay. - Good.

331
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,679
(Prosecution Fails to Present Conclusive Evidence)

332

(Chrysanthemum Murder Case, Was Prosecution Overly Ambitious?)

333
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,989
Give me a moment. I'll go get ready to wash your hair.

334
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,029
Okay.

335
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,579
Kim Hyun Soo is probably not the killer, right?

336
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,789
Ms. Yoon Hyo Jung.

337
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:57,880
I heard you and Hong Guk Hwa had a big falling-out.

338
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,839
And that's why you cut all ties with her, right?

339
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:06,299

(There Can Be a New Beginning)

00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:46,380
Why did you and Hong Guk Hwa have a falling-out?

358
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,509
She had cut all ties with you, so you two must've had a big fight.

359
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,259
I don't know why I have to answer this question.

360
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,259
It's none of your business.

361
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,219
The drugs that she took.

362
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,518
Did you get her the drugs?

363
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,639
What are you talking about? It wasn't me.

364
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,769
Then who was it?

365
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,609
Who?

366
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:10,650
I bet you either got her the drugs or did it with her.

367
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,910

00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,919
Hyo Jung, what about here?

372
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,630
Did you shave the hair inside your ears?

373
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,289
What about your toenails and fingernails?

374
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:31,589
You see, I really don't care whether you do drugs or not.

375
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,179
As long as you're not the killer.

376
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,009
I swear. It really doesn't matter to me at all.

377
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,680
I'm done talking to you.

378
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,730
Did you kill Hong Guk Hwa?

379
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,098
I told you. It wasn't me.

380
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,899
Then you'd need an alibi.

381
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,690
Why do I need an alibi when I'm not the killer?

382
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:50,739
You lived together for two years...

383
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,949
but had a falling-out and cut all ties just before the incident.

384
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,950
Even if you weren't the person who got her the drugs,

385
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,950
you used them with her.

386
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,619
Look, Hyo Jung.

387
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,039
If the police investigated this case properly,

388
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,289
you'd be the prime suspect now. Do you realize that?

389
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:09,130
You don't want the police to come after you, do you?

390
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,670
You may get arrested.

391
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,798
I moved out a week before Guk Hwa died.

392
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,338
After that, I didn't call or visit her once...

393
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,508
because I was so angry.

394
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:20,930
Right. I find that very strange.

395
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:23,139
I understand that you two had a falling-out,

396
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,730
but your friend who you had lived with for two years died.

397
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,979
Plus, your stuff is still there.

398
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,940
And you haven't visited once? Why is that?

399
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:33,279
If I were you, I would've visited at least once out of curiosity.

400
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,609
I bet you intentionally...

401
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:39,159
avoided visiting her because you felt guilty about something.

402
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,739
It's got to be one of these two.

403
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,450
Either you killed her,

404
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,920
or you know who the killer is.

405
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,509
Ace Orthopaedics Clinic.

406
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,970
This therapist known as Bandage. You know him well, don't you?

407
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:00,309
He was your minion.

408
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,269
The Drug Squad caught him.

409
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,440
And that has led me here.

410
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,359
Kim Hyun Soo.

411
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,990
You know him, right?

412
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,368
I saw that he went to Ace Clinic for his dislocated shoulder...

413
00:30:22,369 --> 00:30:24,250
a few days ago.

414
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:29,039
Tell me everything you know.

415
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,799
About what?

416
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,549
Oh.

417
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:36,509
Do you not know that you smuggled a drug into this place?

418
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,639
You dislocated your shoulder, went to the clinic,

419
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,009
and delivered the drug.

420
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,970
Don't you remember?

421
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:56,190
You went to Ace Clinic for your dislocated shoulder.

422
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,609
And this man treated you.

423

(Kim Jae Hoon)

00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,490
As you can see, this guy is the pitcher.

425
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,829
And you caught the ball.

426
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,960
I just...

427
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,089
went there to get my shoulder fixed. That's all.

428
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,680
Tell me how you dislocated your shoulder.

429
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,509
I'm really sorry,

430
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:24,759
but how did I...

431
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,849
deliver the drug?

432
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,609
You're confusing me here.

433
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,660
Are you totally clueless? Or are you just a good actor?

434
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,369
The bandages that you had on your arm...

435
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,710
had been soaked with a narcotized solution.

436
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,960
You see, this isn't something we can just let go of.

437
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,679
Gosh.

438
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,059
Civil servants get paid peanuts and are always on the chopping block.

439
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,769
I have to deal with this because the higher-ups want me to.

440
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:14,440
But you know me. I hate dealing with a nuisance.

441
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,150
So let's not make things difficult for both our sakes...

442
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:19,779
and deal with this quietly.

443
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,779
You know, give and take.

444
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,539
I'm not here to get you, Hyun Soo.

445
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,250
I'm here to catch the one who put you up to it,

446
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,750
Do Ji Tae.

447
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:35,539
With everything that's going on,

448
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,089
there is no way you did it knowingly.

449
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:41,799
But think about it.

450
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,258
Let's say Do Ji Tae tells us everything.

451
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:46,390
But if you keep your mouth shut,

452
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:48,599
what do you think will happen?

453
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:52,440
You'll take the fall for it.

454
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,480
He'll stab you in the back.

455
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,200
Your case is on trial at the moment.

456
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:06,239
Giving the prosecution yet another thing to use against you...

457
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,700
won't do you any good. Am I wrong?

458
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,089
Those in prison are one of two kinds.

459
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,470
Backstabbers or those who get back-stabbed.

460
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,599
Being the former makes me invincible.

461
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,599
My secret is to not trust people.

462
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,859
You know that...

463
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,359
I can have you transferred.

464
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,950
Then you'll have to work your way to the top again.

465
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:47,069
Are you good with that?

466
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,410
Did you report to your superiors before bringing the party here?

467
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,380
How many correctional officers do you think have been in this place?

468
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:04,089
There have been seven wardens.

469
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:06,470
Deputy chiefs, chiefs,

470
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:11,219
and all those that rank higher than you.

471
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,099
Do you think their hands are clean?

472
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,860
Are you sure you can handle this?

473
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,690
You piece of...

474
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,289
You should get that.

475
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,670
Yes, sir.

476
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,460
Right.

477
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,050
Sorry?

478
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:49,929
But...

479
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,429
I see.

480
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,139
Yes, sir.

481
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,780
It stinks from miles away.

482
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,329
How high does the rotten food chain go up?

483
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:36,179
I hate to tell you this,

484
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:41,099
but I can't return without anything to show for myself.

485
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,980
Let me at least have something.

486
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:17,269
(Korean beef sirloin)

487
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:20,768
That will be 113 dollars.

488
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:22,769
You must pay extra if you wish to grill it here.

489
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:25,190
I thought your specialty was drugs,

490
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,360
but I see you're good with knives too, Mr. Um.

491
00:36:29,949 --> 00:36:30,949
Do I know you?

492
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,780
What I want to know is this.

493
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:36,409
Here.

494
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:40,658
Why did Hong Guk Hwa call you that night,

495
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:44,750
and where were you when the incident took place?

496
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Are you the police?

497
00:36:46,881 --> 00:36:48,549
When was the last time she bought from you?

498
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,170
Buy what from me?

499
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,880
I don't appreciate you jumping to conclusions.

500
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,719
Right here.

501
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,059
I bet you took her on as a client around the time...

502
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:01,769
she was denied treatment for her alcoholism.

503
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,150
I don't know what you're talking about.

504
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,900
You met her that night,

505
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:08,899
but you didn't sell her drugs.

506
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,570
Are you accusing me of killing her?

507
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,530
You've got to be kidding me.

508
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:18,489
Who was it though? Who gave up my name?

509
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:20,909
You probably know who it was.

510
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,860
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

511
00:37:57,659 --> 00:37:58,869
Goodness.

512
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:01,199
(Interview)

513
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:04,960
I forgot my phone.

514
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,710
Good day then.

515
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:09,500
Good luck with your business too.

516
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,880
In here or out there,

517
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,929
- it's the same old story. - Darn it.

518
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,389
Money can buy you anything.

519
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:21,139
You can buy anything you want...

520
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,889
whether it's food or clothes.

521
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:26,139
Correctional officers and inspectors alike.

522
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,109
To earn a living is why they work.

523
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,110
(Korea Post Bank Account, 100 dollars)

524
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,530
You're more tight-lipped than I expected.

525
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
What's this for?

526
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:47,920
Call your father.

527
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,170
I had his taxi delivered.

528
00:39:05,849 --> 00:39:07,018
Hello?

529
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:10,150
Dad, it's me, Hyun Soo.

530
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,650
Hyun Soo?

531
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,570
How are you calling me?

532
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,690
Isn't this a cell phone number?

533
00:39:15,739 --> 00:39:18,409
I happened to get my hands on one.

534
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,530
Dad, did you perhaps get your taxi back?

535
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:25,949
I just got it back, so how did you know that?

536
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:28,250
Really? Did you really get it back?

537
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,130
Yes, that's what I said.

538
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,789
The call came out of nowhere...

539
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,170
which was odd since they wouldn't listen when I begged.

540
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,178
I see. Well, I'll call you again when I can.

541
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,260
Hyun Soo?

542
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,099
Thank you.

543
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,030
It's yours now.

544
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:06,158
You've got to be kidding me.

545
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:09,119
Did you think I would let this slide?

546
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:12,000
Darn wench.

547
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,050
You were also going to see Guk Hwa that night, right?

548
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,590
Don't you know that I can also go to the cops about you?

549
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:25,349
Not this again. It's getting old.

550
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:29,480
Like I said, I didn't sleep with her.

551
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:33,059
- You darn cow. - Careful. It's hot.

552
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,769
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

553
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,988
It's too bad...

554
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:42,408
since only a consented recording is admissible.

555
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:44,989
From here, we'll find something we can use.

556
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:48,618
Guk Hwa had a falling-out with her roommate...

557
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:49,908
a week before the incident and had cut all ties,

558
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:51,828
and Um Ki Jong was her drug dealer.

559
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:54,539
The three were in a love triangle,

560
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,340
and the two of them have no alibi.

561
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,800
Anyone can tell that this is fishy.

562
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:04,089
I'll have them requested as witnesses...

563
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,929
and see to it that the subpoenas are delivered.

564
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,638
Do you have the CCTV footage from the day of the crime?

565
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:10,639
Oh, yes.

566
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,649
I secured all the CCTV footage...

567
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,690
that was on Hyun Soo's route that night.

568
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,940
However, there are a lot.

569
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,449
Are you going to watch them all?

570
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,250
I have to.

571
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,219
What?

572
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:14,769
I see.

573
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:24,730
(Gas Station, LPG)

574
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,420
Oh, Lee Chul Ho?

575
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,219
I'm afraid he quit last month though.

576
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:51,799
Why? Is there an issue?

577
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,469
Yes, with the delivery of ours.

578
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:55,059
I'd like for him to confirm something.

579
00:43:55,389 --> 00:43:57,678
Can I have the name and address?

580
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:59,349
The name is Hong Guk Hwa.

581
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,058
The address is 68 Chusa-ro, Chungang-Gu.

582
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:05,280
Let's see if I can find 68 Chusa-ro.

583
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,989
Ms. Hong Guk Hwa. Just a second.

584
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,610
Let's see.

585
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,579
A package was delivered last month.

586
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:15,539
Is there an issue with it?

587
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,079
A few disappeared en route.

588
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,709
Darn.

589
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,329
That jerk...

590
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,710
By the way, why did he quit?

591
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,219
Well...

592
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,889
Actually, he didn't quit. He was let go...

593
00:44:33,429 --> 00:44:36,099
because he hid the fact that he was wearing an electronic anklet.

594
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:39,639
It's illegal for a delivery business to hire sex offenders.

595
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:42,940
Oh, he had an ankle monitor?

596
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:56,199
(Yumin Ironworks)

597
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,460
- Thank you! - Thank you.

598
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,980
Darn, you stupid dog.

599
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,480
Gosh.

600
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,449
Goodness.

601
00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:42,500
Hello?

602
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:45,829
Anybody here?

603
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:49,800
Hello?

604
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,679
Anybody here?

605
00:45:57,139 --> 00:45:58,219
Hello?

606
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,139
- Who are you? - My gosh!

607
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,230
Evidence 109.

608
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:18,239
As soon as the defendant got into the stolen taxi...

609
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:20,619
Darn it.

610
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,710
He turned off the dashcam,

611
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:27,420
which was intentional.

612
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:30,340
Evidence 113.

613
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,550
CCTV footage from the scene, at 8:41pm.

614
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,760
He chose his victim.

615
00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:40,929
He was hunting for his victim.

616
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:51,939
Is there another reason...

617
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,780
why you believe that the murder was deliberate and premeditated?

618
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:56,780
What he did after the incident...

619
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,949
matches the patterns that sly, manipulative murderers exhibit.

620
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:05,250
He did not report the incident.

621
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,999
(Defendant)

622
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,380
He did not call the police...

623
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,750
and didn't even tell his parents or friends about it.

624
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,460
He didn't tell anyone until the moment he was arrested.

625
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,880
And that day,

626
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,719
he had at least three opportunities to turn himself in.

627
00:47:20,469 --> 00:47:22,139
As soon as he found the body,

628
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,309
when he was stopped at the DUI checkpoint,

629
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,099
and when he came to the police station.

630
00:47:26,389 --> 00:47:29,349
However, he did not say anything...

631
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,440
about the incident.

632
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,739
He attempted to destroy evidence at the scene and fled.

633
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,119
And he had the murder weapon on him until the moment he was arrested...

634
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:42,949
but showed no remorse whatsoever.

635
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:45,949
No.

636
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:48,460
Mr. Kim.

637
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:50,750
That is not true.

638
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,179
I did not kill her,

639
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,678
so why should I feel remorse?

640
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:05,558
The prosecutor is examining the witness.

641
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:07,768
Doing this can put you at a disadvantage.

642
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:09,599
No one believes me!

643
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:12,940
I've been telling the truth all along.

644
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,780
Why won't you listen to me?

645
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:19,030
If I don't speak out like this,

646
00:48:19,489 --> 00:48:21,570
everyone will believe what the detective is saying.

647
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,869
What I'm telling you is the truth,

648
00:48:25,949 --> 00:48:28,328
whereas that's just what he is claiming.

649
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:31,880
Are you insisting that the witness is lying now?

650
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,839
I did not kill her. It really wasn't me.

651
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,510
I did not kill Hong Guk Hwa.

652
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,760
I'm not a murderer.

653
00:48:43,139 --> 00:48:46,010
Mr. Kim, please calm down.

654
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:53,309
That's the kind of behaviour I'm talking about.

655
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:00,199
A murderer's violent nature.

656
00:49:02,909 --> 00:49:03,989
Mr. Kim.

657
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:07,869
If you'd like,

658
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:12,119
you can give evidence now.

659
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:14,539
It's simple.

660
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,130
All you have to do is be on the witness stand.

661
00:49:23,429 --> 00:49:25,599
Mr. Kim, you're very upset right now.

662
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,718
If you get up on the witness stand now,

663
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:30,098
and if something unexpected happens...

664
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:31,429
I'll do it.

665
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,440
I will get up on the witness stand.

666
00:49:36,769 --> 00:49:37,819
You made a wise decision.

667
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,900
Your Honour. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

668
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:41,779
As per Mr. Kim's request,

669
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:44,409
I would like to bring him in as a witness.

670
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,010
- Shall I pour you a glass too? - I'm good. I gave up drinking.

671
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:11,179
Not much happened that day.

672
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,639
Although that rude girl threw her cigarette butt at me.

673
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,809
Other than that, nothing happened.

674
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:21,738
You started chasing the taxi as soon as it drove off.

675
00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:23,110
No, I wasn't chasing it.

676
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:26,489
I had to take off too because I had somewhere to go.

677
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:28,409
Where did you have to go?

678
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:34,619
Why do you want to know that?

679
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:36,789
Well...

680
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:40,000
I noticed...

681
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,840
that you have been to Hong Guk Hwa's place in the past.

682
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:47,760
That's nothing odd because I used to work as a courier.

683
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,219
What's the problem?

684
00:50:51,769 --> 00:50:53,599
You knew Hong Guk Hwa,

685
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,149
and you followed her that night.

686
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:00,730
Anyone would think that it's suspicious.

687
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,280
Let me just say this one thing to you.

688
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:08,280
I had nothing to do with it.

689
00:51:09,989 --> 00:51:12,039
If I had anything to do with it,

690
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:14,079
the police would be here,

691
00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:16,119
not a lawyer.

692
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:19,210
Breaking and entering and rape.

693
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:21,340
An ex-con with the exact same priors...

694
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,759
followed the victim...

695
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,549
all the way to the Han River on the day of the incident.

696
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,300
Do you not think it's suspicious?

697
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:44,860
By the way,

698
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:48,659
did you come here alone?

699
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:51,989
What if I did?

700
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:54,489
Do you want to fight me?

701
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,369
Mr. Kim.

702
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,420
Would you say you're honest?

703
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,300
Pardon?

704
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,969
Do you think you're an honest person?

705
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:16,980
I think I am.

706
00:52:19,019 --> 00:52:21,099
Shall I give you a chance to change your answer?

707
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:24,230
No.

708
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,690
Okay.

709
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,780
You said you were honest,

710
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,239
so I expect you to answer my questions honestly.

711
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,369
On the day of the incident,

712
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:36,949
did you get your father's permission...

713
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:39,289
before leaving home in his taxi?

714
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,000
No.

715
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:45,130
You don't have a license to drive a taxi, do you?

716
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,340
- I don't. - So that's illegal.

717
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:53,510
Right.

718
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:56,809
Why did you tilt your head like that just now?

719
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:02,190
I'm just not sure...

720
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,779
if this is an important matter in this situation.

721
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,239
Because of your illegal act,

722
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,488
your father may lose his taxi license.

723
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:13,780
Is that not important to you?

724
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,449
I didn't think of that.

725
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:20,909
Do you enjoy endangering the lives of others?

726
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:24,420
No, I do not.

727
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,959
If that is the case, then why...

728
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,590
(Evidence 1)

729
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:31,969
Then why did you take illegal drugs...

730
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:36,009
and drive the taxi when your blood alcohol level was 0.12,

731
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:37,429
which is enough to get your license revoked?

732
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,150
Why did you pick her up?

733
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:45,519
(Jury)

734
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,769
She just got in the car.

735
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,738
I said the taxi was off duty and told her to get out but...

736
00:53:50,739 --> 00:53:52,610
If you pull over with your for-hire light on,

737
00:53:52,949 --> 00:53:55,449
the passenger would get in the car, of course.

738
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:01,159
Let's say the passenger was someone else.

739
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:02,959
If it was a guy,

740
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,460
would you still have gone to the park by the river with him?

741
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,380
- No. - In other words,

742
00:54:12,469 --> 00:54:14,719
you went there with her because it was her.

743
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,049
Hoping to get her into bed.

744
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:20,518
No, I never thought that.

745
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:22,519
You say that, but your actions say otherwise.

746
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,349
You did sleep with her a few hours later.

747
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,569
The thought of...

748
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,448
sleeping with an attractive woman whom you had just met...

749
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:34,949
must've gotten you very excited.

750
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:38,119
You had been drinking on top of the drugs,

751
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:40,539
so you couldn't think straight.

752
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
She said she didn't want it,

753
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:48,500
but you just went ahead and did it.

754
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,550
No, that is not what happened.

755
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,550
- We were attracted to each other... - No.

756
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:58,679
A woman who lived alone invited you over to her place...

757
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,010
and even gave you drugs, so I bet you thought she was easy.

758
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:03,389
You had been drinking, so you couldn't resist the urge.

759
00:55:03,769 --> 00:55:04,849
Mr. Kim.

760
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:07,269
Can you deny that?

761
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,820
(Judge)

762
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:21,658
(Supreme Court of Korea)

763
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:23,500
Ms. Hong trusted you.

764
00:55:24,619 --> 00:55:26,579
It is why she went out with you,

765
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,250
invited you into her home,

766
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,380
and had drinks with you.

767
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
However, you had other ideas.

768
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,760
You...

769
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:39,090
only saw her as someone who could satisfy your sexual needs.

770
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,679
This difference in thought.

771
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,969
This one lapse of judgement on Ms. Hong's part...

772
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,230
led to her death.

773
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:55,110
Hong Guk Hwa. You killed her, didn't you?

774
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,030
It wasn't me.

775
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,449
Whatever. It doesn't change the fact...

776
00:56:00,619 --> 00:56:02,738
that you'll have to sit in court...

777
00:56:02,739 --> 00:56:05,250
and provide an alibi for the time of death.

778
00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:07,619
Hey.

779
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,079
I said it wasn't me.

780
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,340
How did you feel after you slept with her?

781
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:27,559
I don't know.

782
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:32,360
How do you feel after such activities?

783
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:33,769
Defendant!

784
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,939
Please refrain yourself.

785
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,149
Then put yourself in my shoes.

786
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:40,698
I'm here speaking the truth,

787
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:42,988
but instead of listening, she's asking useless questions.

788
00:56:42,989 --> 00:56:45,789
Why didn't you speak the truth at the police station?

789
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,500
During your interrogation,

790
00:56:49,501 --> 00:56:51,880
you repeated "I don't know" 157 times.

791
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:57,090
Well, that...

792
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,388
That's what my attorney advised me to do.

793
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:06,809
No, you yelled that you couldn't remember,

794
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:08,678
but to questions that weren't in your favour,

795
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:11,309
you said that you didn't know.

796
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:17,189
You don't speak about Ms. Hong's death either.

797
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:19,400
Why is that? Well, it's simple.

798
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:22,239
It's because...

799
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,320
you...

800
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:27,288
killed her.

801
00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:31,539
No. How many times must I say that it wasn't me!

802
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,788
After you found her body,

803
00:57:33,789 --> 00:57:35,419
you stated...

804
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,550
that you fled the scene because you were flustered.

805
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,709
The horrific scene that you saw made you panic.

806
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:40,719
Is that right?

807
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:46,759
- Yes. - But actually, you went back there.

808
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,849
You returned to her house,

809
00:57:48,429 --> 00:57:50,309
grabbed your jacket with your car key inside,

810
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:51,638
got rid of the evidence,

811
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,149
took the knife which is the murder weapon,

812
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,059
and fled the scene for the second time.

813
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,860
Come on.

814
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:00,900
How can someone in a panic accomplish such activities?

815
00:58:06,369 --> 00:58:08,948
I know... I know how this may look.

816
00:58:08,949 --> 00:58:09,949
That's right.

817
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:12,789
It looks like...

818
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:16,289
a cold-blooded killer tried to clean up after him.

819
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,419
In the squad car that night,

820
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,090
why did you ask if the woman was dead?

821
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,010
That's...

822
00:58:27,429 --> 00:58:29,889
That was because I wanted...

823
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,638
to be wrong about her being dead.

824
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:36,860
Didn't it occur to you that you should call an ambulance?

825
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,988
No.

826
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:43,070
Why not?

827
00:58:47,989 --> 00:58:51,368
Because... Because I was scared.

828
00:58:51,369 --> 00:58:52,750
What were you scared of?

829
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,090
The police thinking that I did this to her.

830
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:04,590
So rather than trying to help a bleeding woman,

831
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,429
you were more worried...

832
00:59:09,139 --> 00:59:10,849
about being mistaken as the killer.

833
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,598
Even when it's the woman...

834
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:14,849
you made love to that night.

835
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,400
- I guess it can seem that way. - It does.

836
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,489
You fled the scene without trying to help her.

837
00:59:28,489 --> 00:59:30,489
How did you feel when you first...

838
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:32,539
found her?

839
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,669
I don't know.

840
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,630
How did you feel when you ran away?

841
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:52,349
Just like now,

842
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:57,019
you choose not to answer questions that aren't in your favour.

843
00:59:57,099 --> 00:59:58,730
Was this also your counsel's advice?

844
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:07,110
Do you know what I can't understand about you?

845
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,079
From the very beginning,

846
01:00:12,619 --> 01:00:14,369
you've been claiming your innocence,

847
01:00:14,869 --> 01:00:16,579
but that night,

848
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,539
you fled the scene for selfish reasons.

849
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,839
But then you returned...

850
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,130
to eliminate and contaminate incriminating evidence...

851
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:27,379
and drove under the influence...

852
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,469
just to flee the scene once again.

853
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,349
What if you called for an ambulance...

854
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:38,059
and the victim...

855
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:42,730
received medical treatment?

856
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,650
She might still be alive right now.

857
01:00:48,989 --> 01:00:53,829
(Supreme Court of Korea)

858
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,539
That night,

859
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,369
there was a sliver of hope.

860
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,829
There was a tiny window of opportunity,

861
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,209
but you wasted it by trying to only save yourself.

862
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:08,630
You turned a blind eye to Ms. Hong who was bleeding out.

863
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:10,010
So considering all that,

864
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,800
can it be said...

865
01:01:14,849 --> 01:01:16,889
that you are innocent?

866
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:31,570
Mr. Kim, you believe yourself to be honest,

867
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:33,489
so I'll ask you one last time.

868
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:36,789
Mr. Kim.

869
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,130
That night.

870
01:01:50,969 --> 01:01:53,510
Did you...

871
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,260
kill...

872
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:00,230
Ms. Hong Guk Hwa?

873
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:13,449
Mr. Kim?

874
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:16,579
I...

875
01:02:18,409 --> 01:02:20,119
I...

876
01:02:22,289 --> 01:02:23,579
I don't know.

877
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,840
I don't know anymore.
