What does that mean?

14
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:26,260
Does it mean there's a chance that you killed Ms. Hong?

It wasn't me.

19
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,459
Whatever. It doesn't change the fact...

20
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,590
that you'll have to sit in court...

21

40
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,468

Did you manage to teach Prosecutor An a thing or two again?

45

What about you? Is everything okay on your end?

46

Ms. Seo.

47
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,129
You sound upset. What happened?

48
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,430
I think I ruined everything.

49
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,980
I should have stopped him at all costs.

50

Both you and Ms. Seo did your best.

Don't worry too much, okay?

58
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:08,810
It's not like they obtained new evidence by examining you.

59

You're mistaken.

67
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,720
The knife pierced her neck...

68
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,930
and through her heart and lungs. She died on the spot.

69

Do you think it could be interpreted as an admission of guilt?

115

He could insist that he did not want to give false testimony...

172
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:25,939
(When in doubt, in favour of the defendant.)

173
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,819
(No one is presumed to be guilty.)

174
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,039
This was the first tattoo I got when I was 20.

175
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,880
Back then, I was a nerd who had his nose in books.

176
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,009
I got caught up in an assault case and was falsely accused.

177
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,309
No one believed me.

178
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,349
Like you, I tried everything I could.

179
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,769
I even tried to commit suicide.

180
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,569
At the brink of death, I had a revelation.

181
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,700
That I hold the key to my freedom.

182
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,210
To survive,

183
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,710
I must be the one to change.

184
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,720
The choice is yours, Hyun Soo.

185
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,278
(When in doubt, in favour of the defendant.)

186
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,859
(No one is presumed to be guilty.)

187
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,508
(The woman I used to love)

188
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:56,089
(You have 18 missed calls.)

189
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,769
What is with this mess?

190
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,240
You know that this is exactly why I divorced you.

191
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,368
What brings you by unannounced?

192
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:22,078
I called and texted you over ten times.

193
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,119
"Unannounced"?

194
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,420
I didn't come here because I was worried about you.

195
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,710
I wanted to talk to you before the witness examination.

196
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,930
Take a look.

197
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:37,299
Sure, thanks.

198
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,059
You know, about Kim Hyun Soo...

199
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,440
I know he's got asthma, but does he have anything else?

200
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
I'm not sure.

201
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,109
Have you seen a doctor yet?

202
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,200
A doctor? Come on.

203
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,868
I've still got it.

204
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:02,789
You know that.

205
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,039
No, I'm talking about...

206
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,460
your atopic dermatitis.

207
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:10,750
Oh, that.

208
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,549
Lawyer Shin Joong Han.

209
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,719
Don't rely on an unscientific folk remedy like this.

210
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,349
You need to see a dermatologist.

211
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,058
If dermatologists could cure it, I wouldn't still be dealing with it.

212
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,980
It's not like I wanted to resort to a home remedy like this.

213
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,779
Lawyer Shin Joong Han.

214
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,279
I don't want to see you give up.

215
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:43,289
Whether it's your atopic dermatitis, the trial,

216
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,119
or your family.

217
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:08,349
Just leave it. I'll clean up.

218
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:24,200
(An exchange of kind words stirs companionship.)

219
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,479
(Accused: Kim Hyun Soo)

220
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,858
(List of Witnesses, Ha No Seok)

221
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:00,528
(Yoo Seung Hoon, First Witness)

222
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:02,608
(List of Suspects)

223
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,199
(Yoon Hyo Jung, had a falling out with Hong Guk Hwa)

224
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,909
(Um Ki Jong, provided drugs to Hong Guk Hwa)

225
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,579
(Lee Chul Ho, courier who served the vicinity of Hong Guk Hwa's home)

226
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,130
- Nice, yes! - Over here.

227
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:18,960
That's it!

228
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:25,930
(Law and Order)

229
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,720
Nice.

230
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,099
Yes, that was good.

231
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,250
Hey!

232
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,599
Witness, please come forward.

233
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,529
Take an oath.

234
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,369
Oath.

235
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,749
"I solemnly affirm that I will tell the truth, the whole truth..."

236
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,288
- "and nothing but the truth." - Hey, Hyun Soo.

237
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:39,288
"I understand that I would be committing perjury..."

238
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,879
There are some things...

239
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,509
the accused should never do in the courtroom.

240
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,799
For example, yawning like you did just now...

241
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,759
or leaning back in your chair with your legs crossed.

242
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,220
It's awfully rude, okay?

243
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,849
Such an attitude won't help you at all.

244
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,489
(Defendant)

245
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,200
What prompted you to start supplying the victim with drugs?

246
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,670
Guk Hwa was my girlfriend's roommate.

247
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,500
That's how I got to know her, and it happened very naturally.

248
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,048
But the thing is,

249
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:24,089
Guk Hwa said she used drugs when she was studying in the US.

250
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,630
Did you...

251
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,179
have sex with Ms. Hong?

252
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,390
(Defendant)

253
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,980
Do I have to answer this question?

254
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:38,479
The victim was stabbed 13 times by an unidentified male,

255
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,399
which was the direct cause of her death.

256
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,519
In such a case,

257
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,900
it's normal to suspect that it may have been a crime of passion.

258
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:48,410
Yes. Once, just because we were drunk.

259
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,410
I did sleep with her once.

260
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:54,789
You spoke with Ms. Hong on the phone on the day of the incident.

261
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:57,250
Did you have plans to see her that day?

262
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:02,879
Look. That crazy girl threatened me.

263
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,880
We slept together just because we were drunk.

264
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,130
When my girlfriend found out, she lied to her that I raped her.

265
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,140
Gosh, it still makes me so angry.

266
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,809
Then you probably wanted to kill her, right?

267
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,019
Objection, Your Honour.

268
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,348
Mr. Um is here as a witness,

269
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,230
but the counsel is treating him...

270
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:24,609
like a suspect.

271
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,980
Objection sustained.

272
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,950
Counsel, please be careful.

273
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,119
It is true that I was fuming mad,

274
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:36,119
but I wasn't angry enough to kill her. I'm not like that jerk.

275
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,880
Mr. Um.

276
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,589
Did the police interview you at all with regard to this case?

277
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,548
Either about the drugs...

278
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:49,589
or your relationship with the victim.

279
00:27:50,089 --> 00:27:51,130
No.

280
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,099
When you found out that Ms. Hong, your roommate,

281
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:02,900
had sexual intercourse with Mr. Um who was your boyfriend,

282
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:06,190
how did you feel?

283
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,940
I was freaking miserable, obviously.

284
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:10,650
Witness, you're in a courtroom now.

285
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,200
Please watch what you say.

286
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,450
A week before Ms. Hong's death,

287
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:20,789
the two of you had a big fight because of that,

288
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:22,039
and you were hurt pretty badly.

289
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,710
We did fight,

290
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,669
but you know what happens in a cat fight.

291
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,170
Just pulling each other's hair, that's all.

292
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,048
(Defence)

293
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:31,220
Then how come...

294
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,680
the doctor thought your injury required three weeks of treatment?

295
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,649
After the fight, you packed up and moved out. Then a week later,

296
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,769
on the day of the incident,

297
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:49,069
you called Ms. Hong.

298
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,950
Correct. Let's be honest. I was wronged,

299
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:54,490
so I thought she owed me an apology,

300
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,740
and I had to pick up my belongings that I had left at her place.

301
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,160
That's why I called her.

302
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,039
But she didn't pick up, and she ignored my texts too.

303
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,420
That must've made you angry.

304
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,630
No, not at all.

305
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,589
I had already made up my mind to break up with Ki Jong,

306
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,679
and I was hoping Guk Hwa and I could put it behind us...

307
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,430
and patch things up.

308
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:38,329
Ms. Yoon, then did the police ever ask you...

309
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:41,409
to come in for an interview regarding this case?

310
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,410
No.

311
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,039
You had a big falling-out with the victim,

312
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:47,710
and your boyfriend cheated on you with her.

313
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,589
I'd say you definitely had a motive for killing her.

314
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,470
But they never even asked you to come in for an interview?

315
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:55,470
Why should I be questioned? I didn't kill her.

316
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:58,599
That guy is the killer.

317
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,809
(Prosecution)

318
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:10,149
(Yoon Hyo Jung)

319
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,359
(Um Ki Jong)

320
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:14,150
These two here clearly didn't do it.

321
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,160
Why? We haven't confirmed whether their alibis check out.

322
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,829
When they were testifying in court,

323
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,869
they didn't get defensive at all.

324
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:26,210
They said everything without a second's hesitation.

325
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:28,669
That can only be done...

326
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,500
when people know for a fact that they're telling the truth.

327
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,970
But the thing is, they were in a relationship.

328
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:36,930
Maybe they talked to get their story straight.

329
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,049
No.

330
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,140
Even if they did, it doesn't matter.

331
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,140
Even people who lie all the time...

332
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:46,389
can't lie easily...

333
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,480
when they take the witness stand.

334
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:50,359

No, I don't even recall seeing her there.

You delivered a package to the victim's home address,

and she filed a complaint against you. Correct?

I do not feel the need to answer this question.

462

In August of 2017,

463

468
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,079
that has nothing to do with this case.

469
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:42,389
You followed Ms. Hong all the way to the park by the Han River.

470

That was just a coincidence.

She had filed a complaint against you.

472
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:50,899
You ran into her at the gas station by chance...

and just happened to run into her again at the park.

Then, she happened to die that very night.

475

Now, can that be called a coincidence?

476
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:02,079
Then maybe...

477
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:04,750
it was fate.

On the day of the incident,

479
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,340
your ankle monitor...

480
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,550
was turned off for about an hour.

481
00:47:19,889 --> 00:47:21,429
The battery died.

482
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:24,679
Well, it happens from time to time.

483
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,539
When did the police interview you?

484
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:48,289
They never did.

485
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:52,130
You have priors and were holding a grudge against the victim.

486
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,510
On top of that, you ran into her that night.

487
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,509
Then you disabled your ankle monitor...

488
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,050
and followed her all the way to the park,

489
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:05,139
yet the police never bothered to interview you?

490
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:07,019
Correct.

491
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:08,559
My gosh.

492
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,730
Mr. Lee, why do you think the police didn't ask you to come in?

493
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,110
I guess they know...

494
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:19,449
that I didn't kill her.

495
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,698

I really can't wrap my head around this.

and was found with the murder weapon...

502
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,380
is right there.

503
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:43,760
Why must I provide an alibi?

504
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,389

(Criminal Procedure Act)

506
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,539
My phone.

507
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,300
Did you give it to Park Doo Sik?

508
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,469
Why?

509
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:34,150
Why did you do that?

510
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,230
I had no choice.

511
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,900
I need to survive in this place too.

512
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:53,829
Thanks for everything anyway.

513

(Keyless Door Lock at Victim's Residence)

514
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,590
Ms. Hong had a keyless electronic door lock system installed.

515
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:32,058
As you know, anyone who knows the door code can get in.

516
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:33,888
And it was an older model, which can be disabled...

517
00:51:33,889 --> 00:51:35,889
with a stun gun or the master code.

(Rear Door to Terrace Left Open Due to Broken Doorknob)

519
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,150
What about these photos?

520
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:45,070
The door to the terrace was unlocked as the doorknob was broken,

521
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,820
so anyone could've come into the house.

522
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,279
Are you saying...

523
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,159
it is possible that there was an intruder that night?

524
00:51:53,369 --> 00:51:57,158
I will just say that the possibility cannot be totally ruled out.

525
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,289
Objection, Your Honour.

526
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,590
The possibility that there might have been an unknown intruder...

527
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,380
has nothing to do with the defendant's charges...

528
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,929
and why the prosecution decided to indict him.

529
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:11,599
It is completely irrelevant.

530
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:17,598
You also pointed out...

531
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,150
that there may have been another weapon.

532
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:23,319
Correct. A knife, which could have been used in the murder,

533
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,940
is unaccounted for.

534
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,489
- Is this it? - Yes.

535
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:30,279
(8-Piece Knife Set, 2 Missing Knives)

536
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,619
This is an eight-piece kitchen knife set.

537
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:35,329
They all look slightly different,

538
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:37,249
but the set is missing two knives.

539
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,250
One of them...

540
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,789
is the knife, which the prosecution insists was used in the murder.

541
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,960
But...

542
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,630
where is the other one, then?

543
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,959
(Missing Knife)

544
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,799
This photo was taken at the scene shortly after the incident.

545
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,969
As you can see, there was leftover fruit,

546
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:57,679
but the knife that was used to peel the fruit is missing.

547
00:52:57,809 --> 00:52:58,888
Objection, Your Honour.

548
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:00,059
(Judge)

549
00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:01,900
All right.

550
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:05,940
By saying there might be another possible murder weapon...

551
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,440
fully knowing Mr. Kim was found with the murder weapon on him,

552
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:12,109
the counsel is trying to distort such clear evidence.

553
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,530
It's nothing more than the counsel's subjective speculation.

554
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,539
And therefore, it is inadmissible.

555
00:53:17,789 --> 00:53:18,949
Objection sustained.

556
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,710
What you're looking at is the photo of the victim's right hand.

557
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,469
Could you elaborate on this?

558
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,800
Her hand was probably penetrated due to a knife game.

559
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:36,718
Your findings don't match that of the medical examiner...

560
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:37,929
who conducted the autopsy.

561
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,098
Could you explain why?

562
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:42,058
Traces of a fluorescence brightening agent...

563
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:44,018
and formaldehyde were found in the wound.

564
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:46,939
The combination of those chemicals is found mostly in toilet paper.

565
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,190
It indicates that someone tried to stop the bleeding.

566
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,739
Oh, no. My gosh!

567
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:56,029
Evidence which points to a knife game...

568
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,079
can be found on her dining table.

569
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:02,908
As you can see, this proves that the victim...

570
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:05,960
often engaged in the dangerous knife game.

571
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,550
The prosecution claims that the wound was inflicted on her...

572
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:14,468
when the knife slipped...

573
00:54:14,469 --> 00:54:17,138
from hitting her spine.

574
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:18,348
Do you agree?

575
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:20,099
I don't see how that can be true.

576
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:22,059
Could you elaborate?

577
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,479
If you look at her wounds,

578
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,769
you will see that the blade was facing up.

579
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,860
Like this?

580
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:32,239
Yes, according to those wounds,

581
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,448
the killer held the knife...

582
00:54:34,449 --> 00:54:38,030
with the blade facing up when stabbing her.

583
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:39,779
So what would happen...

584
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,239
if the knife slipped from one's grip?

585
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:47,710
If the killer was wounded from such an event,

586
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:52,380
the wound should be found on the inside of his hand.

587
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,178
As the report states,

588
00:54:55,179 --> 00:54:56,799
on the broken glass of the front door,

589
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,388
the defendant's blood, epithelial tissue,

590
00:54:58,389 --> 00:55:00,009
and DNA were found.

591
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:02,679
So he suffered the wound...

592
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:04,479
in the way he testified to.

593
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,019
From cutting himself on the broken glass.

594
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:10,269
My witness' findings...

595
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,859
go directly against those of the medical examiner...

596
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,280
who conducted the autopsy.

597
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:18,619
Does the prosecution have an objection?

598
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,949
How the wound was inflicted could be debatable...

599
00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:26,039
which is why it will heavily rely...

600
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:29,669
on the judgement of the jury and judges.

601
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,000
(Judge)

602
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:44,559
Mr. Kim, could you write your name on that piece of paper?

603
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:58,280
(Kim Hyun Soo)

604
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:02,698
Dr. Hong, what is shown on the screen?

605
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:06,448
It's the analysis report of the 13 wounds on the victim's body.

606
00:56:06,449 --> 00:56:08,038
The analysis...

607
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:10,078
helps us identify the suspect's traits.

608
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,289
And what would that be?

609
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,589
Eight out of the thirteen wounds were inflicted...

610
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,840
from the 1 o'clock position to the 7 o'clock position.

611
00:56:18,469 --> 00:56:23,260
One can presume that the killer is right-handed.

612
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:26,849
I see. But as you just saw,

613
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:29,269
the defendant...

614
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:32,019
is left-handed.

615
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,229
The fact that he is left-handed...

616
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:39,069
can be proved through multiple evidence.

617
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:40,569
He writes with his left hand,

618
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:41,699
plays table tennis with his left arm,

619
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:44,238
and plays badminton with his left arm too.

620
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:45,239
I object!

621
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:47,578
- Counsel is displaying... - This...

622
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:49,709
is the report written by the NFS medical examiner...

623
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,869
who conducted the autopsy.

624
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,920
Let's see. "The probability..."

625
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:57,010
"of the killer being right-handed..."

626
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,300
"is high."

627
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,260
High.

628
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,480
High!

629
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,480
That'll be all.

630
00:57:23,989 --> 00:57:25,329
You may cross-examine.

631
00:57:28,449 --> 00:57:29,449
Dr. Hong,

632
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:33,118
you are a senior researcher at the NFS...

633
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,129
and teach forensic medicine at a college.

634
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,419
- That's right. - Right.

635
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,050
Were you assigned to this case?

636
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:40,630
No.

637
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:42,299
Then why are you here today?

638
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,929
Could there be a particular reason?

639
00:57:46,889 --> 00:57:49,219
My presence was requested by Lawyer Shin Joong Han.

640
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,729
Do you have a close relationship with him?

641
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,190
We used to be married.

642
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,569
I'm sure that's what you were fishing for.

643
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,650
I see.

644
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,319
So you must have taken on this case for Mr. Shin's sake.

645
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,698
This I can say with certainty.

646
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:07,949
Not at all.

647
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:10,448
I can't really stand the man...

648
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:11,659
which is why I divorced him.

649
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,420
Then why are you here testifying?

650
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,459
I believe that...

651
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,170
the medical examiner's report is biased.

652
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:24,129
Despite there being other possibilities,

653
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,969
he presumed that the defendant was guilty.

654
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,309
The issue is that...

655
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:33,139
the jury believed his testimony to be the only truth.

656
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:37,689
I am here today to inform everyone...

657
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:40,860
that certain evidence can be interpreted differently.

658
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:46,159
After all, the jury has a right to hear from various experts.

659
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:49,409
You too, Ms. An.

660
00:58:54,579 --> 00:58:56,420
Thank you for pointing out the basics.

661
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
That'll be all.

662
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:01,510
(Defendant)

663
00:59:23,489 --> 00:59:25,899
(When in doubt, in favour of the defendant.)

664
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,320
(No one is presumed to be guilty.)

665
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,639
So what should I call you?

666
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:52,179
Anything you want.

667
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:11,118

672
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:40,059
