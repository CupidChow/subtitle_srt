A ten-year sentence for someone...

5
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,890
who stabbed a woman 13 times is unprecedented.

6
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,179
I've never had a client who stabbed me in the back like this.

7
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,148
Once in the courtroom, you can't deviate from what was agreed upon.

8
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:00,820
Don't you know how dangerous it is?

Thanks to you, all my hard work went down the drain.

10
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,409
Now, both the prosecution and the court will...

11
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:17,540
What were you thinking?

12
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:23,378
I'm sorry. But I was also...

13
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:25,340
You've already lost everyone's trust.

14
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,640
If the trial begins like this,

15
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,640
what is the probability of you winning it?

16
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,390
Ten or twenty percent at the most?

17
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,439
I'm out. You can handle the rest.

18

Hey, you can't score an exclusive scoop...

21
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,170
by doing things that everyone else does.

22
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,219
Look for a different angle.

23
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,638
An angle that others missed or cannot see.

24
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,559
Being brave enough to say no when everyone else is saying yes.

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,930
I sure know what that's like.

26
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,348
But most of the people who do that lose their footing and fall.

27
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:19,849
Some even break their nose.

Was it Goethe who said this?

29

There are only two kinds of things in life.

30

Things that you want to do but can't do.

31
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,360
And things that you can do...

32
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,449
but never do.

33
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,199
Are you a philosopher now?

34
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,500
What about you? Can you say you've done everything you could?

35

Inspecting the scene, gathering evidence,

36
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,959
looking for witnesses and suspects. What did you even do?

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,300
Hey, what did I not do?

38
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,799
Name one thing that I didn't do.

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,139
I even went to the scene and took photos of...

40
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:57,520
Forget it. I got fired long ago.

47

I'm telling you. Every rapist...

48
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,759
needs to get his package cut off.

49
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,980
Like this, you know? With a pair of scissors.

50
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,689
It's a mental illness.

51

Therapy can't fix it.

52
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:30,278

00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,740
can often result in the unexpected.

170
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,799
We're done here. You're dismissed.

171
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:34,009
I'll try harder.

172
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:36,059
Sure.

173
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:46,069
This is Dike also known as Lady Justice.

174
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,989
With the set of scales in her right hand,

175
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,529
she measures one's guilt.

176
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,450
With the sword in her left hand, she punishes those who have sinned.

177
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,038
Isn't it odd though?

178
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,039
Lady Justice is blindfolded.

179
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:02,329
Why do you think that is?

180
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:04,210
She's playing hide-and-seek!

181
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,798
She's blind.

182
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,459
No, she's not blind.

(Career Day, Shin Hye In's Father, Lawyer Shin Joong Han)

184
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,970
Everyone is equal in the eyes of the law.

185
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,139
So when one is being judged,

186
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,890
the law will be blind...

187
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:22,518
to a person's looks, occupation, gender, and wealth. In other words,

188
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,729
the law will stay blindfolded...

189
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,939
and only judge a person's sins...

190
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,439
according to the weight of their actions.

191
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,318
But a lawyer helps bad people.

192
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,910
Isn't that just as bad?

193
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,450
Well...

194
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,670
Who here knows Jean Valjean?

195
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,789
I see he's well-known.

To help a hungry child,

197
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,588
Jean Valjean stole a loaf of bread,

198
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:55,588
and the judge sentenced him to five years in prison.

199
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,798
Is that justice?

200
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,348
- No! - No!

201
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:00,680
Exactly.

202
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,808
It's true that he stole the bread,

203
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:06,309
but five years of imprisonment was unreasonable.

204
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:09,730
There are people who help those...

205
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,818
so that they don't suffer the same fate as he did.

206
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:15,029

Thank you.

So? Are you here to cut a joint defence deal with me?

Yes.

218

How does 35,000 dollars sound?

219
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,679
Kim Hyun Soo's parents said...

220
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,098
they couldn't afford anything more than 50,000 dollars.

221
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:04,348
And our chance of winning is very slim, so the firm...

222
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,268
Fine. 30,000 dollars, okay?

223
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:08,308
That's it. I can't go any lower than that.

224
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:09,900
I need to make ends meet.

225
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,359
And you'll be paying me,

226
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:15,029
not Hyun Soo's parents.

Sure!

You're more easygoing than I thought you'd be.

230
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:31,289
Right.

231
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,630
How about a jury trial?

232
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:43,089
We're already in the doghouse with the court,

233
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,009
so I'd say it's worth a shot.

234
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,930
But have you done it before?

235
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:50,390
A jury trial? You've never done it?

236
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,230
I have, about three times.

237
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,779
And I failed miserably.

238
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:03,869
Why don't you go ahead and request a jury trial?

239

The jurors didn't study law,

so things like precedents, legal logic, and principles...

How could you not know?

Why should I know? Not every lawyer keeps track of things like that.

00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:15,500
This is a painkiller.

336
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:21,049
Why do I need a painkiller?

337
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,679
The right arm would be better.

338
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,599
Wait, my arm? What for?

339
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,390
I need you to run an errand for me.

340
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,809
What kind of errand?

341
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,849
Nothing hard.

342
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,399
You'll go to the hospital for a dislocated shoulder...

343
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,768
and get it treated. That's all.

344
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:39,900
No, wait.

345
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:43,359
Let me... I'll find something else that you can use.

346
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,369
Like what?

347
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:52,119
What could you offer that I can't obtain myself?

348
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,500
Favours go both ways.

349
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,250
I helped you first, right?

350
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,880
Don't be too worried.

351
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,180
The doctor will easily pop your shoulder back in.

352
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,639
Relax your arm. Otherwise, it'll break.

Nothing hard.

356
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,839
You'll go to the hospital for a dislocated shoulder...

357

and get it treated. That's all.

358
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,139
We're done. You can come out now.

359
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,769
You won't need a cast,

360
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:02,769
but a compression bandage and a sling will be required.

361
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,908
I get that inmates want fresh air from time to time,

362
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:11,159
but a habitual dislocation of the shoulder...

363
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:12,909
will only make your life miserable.

364
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:14,869
Right.

365
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,039
- Is it the dislocated shoulder? - Yes.

366
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,170
Please lower your arm.

367
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,590
All right.

368
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,969
Can you lend me a hand?

369
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,550
Take deep breaths in and out.

370
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:34,849
You'll feel some pain.

371
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:37,429
Take deep breaths in and out. There you go.

372
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:40,519
Keep it up. All right.

373

Let's see.

374
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,569
Try and rotate your arm. Does that feel better?

375
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,069
Keep the right arm relaxed for a while.

376
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:54,030
I'll wrap the compression bandage, and you'll be good to go.

381
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,800
You may leave.

382
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:07,940
How's your shoulder?

383
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,699
It's good.

384

Yes.

387

Don't bother to know.

388
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,460
It's not like it'll change anything.

389

that you have something to say.

Hardly. That's not the case today.

503
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:25,760
We must not...

504
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:29,269
let that innocent face of his fool us.

505
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,139
We must not disgrace the victim who died such a brutal death...

506
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,149
or be tricked by the speculative questions...

507
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,610
of the defence counsel, who claims that Mr. Kim is not guilty.

508
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,940
Because this case...

509
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:43,909
is not about how Ms. Hong Guk Hwa...

510
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,949
lived her life.

511
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:49,079
Rather, it is about how she died...

512
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,170
and who...

513
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,840
killed her.

514

(Jury)

516
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:12,638
(Defendant)

517
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:13,809
I rest my case.

518
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:15,400
Hyun Soo.

519
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,859
Do not react to anything that happens in this courtroom.

520
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,530
Don't move or talk.

521
00:50:24,699 --> 00:50:26,198
Don't even move your eyes.

522
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:32,159
(Defendant)

523
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:40,750
Well...

524
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:45,130
Do you think the prosecution's claims are really true?

525
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,099
Is there anything missing in the evidence...

526
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,019
that the police have gathered?

527
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,610
Mr. Kim is an ordinary young man in his 20s.

528
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,949
Just like other young men that we see around us.

529
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,110
He's just an ordinary average guy.

530
00:51:12,619 --> 00:51:14,000
He's a son,

531
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:19,289
a brother,

532
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,550
and a friend.

533
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:29,888
Why did he stab a woman he met that day for the first time?

534
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:32,929
He stabbed her 13 times.

535
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:36,429
Why did he commit such a horrible act?

536
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:39,900
Is this naive-looking guy...

537
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,150
truly the killer,

538
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:44,650
as the prosecution is insisting?

539
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:53,158
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. As of this moment,

540
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:55,159
you must throw away all your biases and preconceptions...

541
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:58,289
and examine whether Mr. Kim is truly guilty...

542
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,669
beyond a reasonable doubt as the prosecution is insisting.

543
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:01,750
Why?

544
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,920
Because we're not here...

545
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,760
to prove Mr. Kim's innocence.

546
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:09,679
We're here to examine whether Mr. Kim is guilty.

547
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,598
And proving that he is guilty of the crime...

548
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,929
isn't my job.

549
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:17,429
That is the prosecution's job.

550
00:52:34,369 --> 00:52:37,159
Bloodflare detects bloodstains that aren't visible...

551
00:52:37,369 --> 00:52:38,619
to the naked eye.

552
00:52:39,619 --> 00:52:42,670
We have a photo of Mr. Kim taken on the day of the incident...

553
00:52:42,789 --> 00:52:44,500
with Bloodflare sprayed on him.

554
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,670
(Defence)

555
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,880
(Evidence Photo: With Bloodflare)

556
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,280
You inspected the crime scene, didn't you?

557
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,149
Yes, I did.

558
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,030
The bloodstains found on Mr. Kim's body.

559
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:17,289
Whose blood was it?

560
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,079
The blood belonged to Hong Guk Hwa, the victim.

561
00:53:22,789 --> 00:53:25,000
Is there any chance that it could be someone else's blood?

562
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,960
That is practically impossible.

563
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:32,429
All right. Then what does this photo tell us?

564
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,139
That he tampered with the scene and tried to destroy evidence.

565
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,889
Is there evidence that Mr. Kim was the one...

566
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:42,889
who tampered with the scene and attempted to destroy evidence?

567
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,189
Yes, we're sure that it was him.

568
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:47,149
He left other traces while trying to destroy evidence.

569
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:49,189
His fingerprints and shoe prints, for example.

570
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,570
(Crime Scene: Fingerprints Left During Attempt to Destroy Evidence)

571
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:55,489
Don't you think he left too many traces at the scene...

572
00:53:55,989 --> 00:53:58,449
for someone who was attempting to destroy evidence?

573
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:03,419
His prints, hairs, saliva, and DNA.

574
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,709
(Witness)

575
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:10,130
Do you think Mr. Kim deliberately approached the victim to kill her,

576
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,419
then actively and intentionally...

577
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,009
destroyed evidence at the scene?

578
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:17,389
Or would it make more sense to see it as a careless mistake...

579
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:21,219
made in panic mode after experiencing something unexpected?

580
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,530
I'd say the latter is more likely.

581
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:35,949
Right.

582
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:38,829
If it were a premeditated murder,

583
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,289
it wouldn't have been done this clumsily.

584
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:44,039
I rest my case.

585
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,259
What kind of knife was used to stab the victim?

586
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,260
It was a non-serrated, single-edge knife.

587
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,679
The length of the blade was about 15cm.

588
00:54:57,679 --> 00:54:59,260
For example...

589
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,769
(Evidence 1)

590
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,980
Something like this?

591
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,559
Correct.

592
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:16,030
Doctor.

593
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:19,739
You have 20 years of experience as a forensic pathologist.

594
00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:23,698
Would you please share your opinion on this case?

595
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:26,000
(Judge)

596
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,880
Mr. Kim's skin cells were found under the victim's nails,

597
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:31,960
and her blood was found on his body.

598
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,510
Mr. Kim had the murder weapon on him,

599
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:37,130
and the victim's blood and skin cells were found on it.

600
00:55:37,929 --> 00:55:39,509
Based on such solid evidence,

601
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:42,099
I believe that Mr. Kim is the killer.

602
00:55:47,059 --> 00:55:49,559
However, the evidence you listed just now...

603
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,018
cannot be considered direct evidence...

604
00:55:53,019 --> 00:55:55,110
to prove him guilty of Ms. Hong's murder.

605
00:55:55,739 --> 00:55:58,989
The wound on his palm can serve as direct evidence.

606
00:56:00,369 --> 00:56:03,409
"The wound on his palm."

607
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,210
- This wound? - Correct.

608
00:56:09,329 --> 00:56:12,669
When he was stabbing her,

609
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,589
the knife slipped out of his hand...

610
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,590
because it got stuck in her spine. That's how he got the wound.

611
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,230
How many stab wounds were found on the victim's body?

612
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:28,729
There were 13.

613
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:30,019
What could that mean?

614
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:35,230
Well, some might say that it points to a crime of passion.

615
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,189
So the killer had a grudge against her,

616
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:39,359
or it was someone she knew.

617
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,869
Defendant, did you know the victim prior to this event?

618
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:45,409
No.

619
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,920
The wound in that photo.

620
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,169
Could it be explained otherwise?

621
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:56,379
(Witness)

622
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,300
No, that's the only explanation.

623
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:01,130
Is that so?

624
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:03,509
(Evidence Photo: Stab wound on defendant's hand)

625
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:04,510
(Kim Hyun Soo's Drug Analysis Report)

626
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:08,309
Doctor, can you elaborate on this drug analysis report?

627
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,599
Various chemicals were detected in the test,

628
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,980
but only three are relevant in forensic medicine.

629
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,900
Alcohol, LSD, and ketamine.

630
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:22,659
Out of those, LSD and ketamine are psycho pharmaceuticals...

631
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,079
that are commonly known as narcotics.

632
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:29,329
Then what would happen to an average man of 175cm and 70kg...

633
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:32,288
if he consumed...

634
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:34,539
a combination of those with alcohol?

635
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,219
Psycho pharmaceuticals mixed with alcohol...

636
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,760
can affect one's central nervous system...

637
00:57:44,849 --> 00:57:47,429
which could lead to severe memory loss.

638
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,059
I see.

639
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:52,309
Then...

640
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:55,150
there's a good chance...

641
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:57,769
that the defendant can't actually remember what happened.

642
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,320
Right?

643
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,119
Well, with the drugs that he consumed?

644
00:58:07,409 --> 00:58:08,989
Yes, one will say...

645
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:12,328
that he was incapacitated.

646
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:14,578
Incapacitated.

647
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:16,669
"Incapacitated."

648
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:17,670
So in other words,

649
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:21,719
there is a medical reason behind the defendant...

650
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:25,259
not remembering about that night.

651
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,300
(Prosecution)

652
00:58:30,849 --> 00:58:34,349
I will only say that it's possible.

653
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:38,820
That'll be all.

654
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:40,779
(Jury)

655
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,689
- What? - Incapacitated?

656
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:45,409
- Could he not remember? - So it means...

657
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:53,619
The evidence.

658
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:57,960
The evidence obtained by the prosecution.

659
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:02,259
There are 117 exhibits that point to the defendant...

660
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,969
as the killer,

661
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,388
but all he says is that he didn't kill her...

662
00:59:08,389 --> 00:59:09,679
and that he doesn't remember.

663
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:14,139
That's the story he's sticking to.

664
00:59:15,809 --> 00:59:16,809
So how about this?

665
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:20,150
Maybe returning to the crime scene...

666
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,730
could trigger his memories.

667
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:27,948
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

669
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:32,539
If you were to see...

670
00:59:33,579 --> 00:59:36,459
the crime scene with your own eyes,

671
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,750
you would also realize...

672
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,880
just how ridiculous his amnesia claim is.

673
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:47,880
And right here is where...

674
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:52,179
I officially request that you join me,

675
00:59:52,809 --> 00:59:57,309
the defendant, and his lawyers on a walk-through of the crime scene.

676
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:58,980
- What? - Really?

677
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:02,110
Prosecutor, please approach.

678
01:00:05,989 --> 01:00:07,199
Don't worry too much.

679
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:08,739
Stay calm.

680
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:10,569
(Judge)

681
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:14,198
Prosecutor An, the media is all over this case as is.

682
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:15,750
Must you let it get more attention?

683
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:20,289
A walk-through of a crime scene in a trial by jury...

684
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,670
can be requested by the prosecution and jury.

685
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,420
How the jury decides is up to them.

686
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,009
Unbelievable.

687
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:30,428
(Judge)

688
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:31,510
All right, fine.

689
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:40,519
It seems like the jury must make an important decision.

690
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:44,940
If you agree to a walk-through of the crime scene,

691
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,239
please raise your hand.

692
01:00:57,699 --> 01:01:02,420
(Jury)

693
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,719
Can't...

694
01:01:12,929 --> 01:01:14,389
Can't I stay back?

695
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:16,969
I don't want to go to that house.

696
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:22,479
This is a bridge you must cross anyway.

697
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,690
If you refuse,

698
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,979
the jury will see it as guilt.

699

(Jury)

700
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,820
Hyun Soo, consider us...

701
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,949
on a moving train that can't be stopped.

702
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:37,079
Stopping now equals death.

703
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:39,159
We must see through this.

704
01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:50,469
We'll take a break of three hours...

705
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:54,469
and reconvene starting with a walk-through of the crime scene.

706
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,010
No...

707
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,159
Here they come!
