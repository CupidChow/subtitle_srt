00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,328
Anyone who intervenes...

172
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,789
meets the same fate.

173
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,039
One.

174
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,210
Two.

175
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,960
Three.

176
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,639
This is how you get someone to talk.

177
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,139
Sure. Duly noted.

178
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,258
All right.

179
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,180
Light touches, boys. You don't want to kill him.

180
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:35,269
Right.

181
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:38,900
All right. Let's see.

182
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,569
Goodness. What happened...

183
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,489
to your face, huh?

184
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,659
Who's he?

185
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,410
- Let's get you up. - That's Do Ji Tae.

186
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,249
The lion of the Northern Prison.

187
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,210
You'll be all right.

188
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,130
Some ointment will clear these wounds.

189
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,048
Following the ruling of the court,

190
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:10,719
an arrest warrant was validated...

191
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
for the suspect in the Chrysanthemum Murder Case.

192
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,558
Due to him being a flight risk...

193
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,229
and the evidence submitted by the police and prosecution...

194
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,229
My apologies, Ms. An. I let myself in.

195
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,440
When did you get here?

196
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,278
Why didn't you call me in advance?

197
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,818
Well, I know how busy you are.

198
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:28,819
So it seems like the suspect has been put in confinement...

199
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,500
According to Article 266 Clause 3-2 of the Criminal Procedure Act,

200
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,919
the representing prosecutor in an ongoing case...

201
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,919
has the right to prohibit one's access to case files.

202
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,088
You know that.

203
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:48,508
(Prosecutor An Tae Hee)

204
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:51,470
Yes, I do. It is why... Here you go.

205
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,759
It is why I'm filing a demurrer.

206
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,150
(Application for Access to Case Files)

207
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,900
You move quicker than I thought.

208
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,319
One should do what is needed, right?

209
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,740
This case...

210
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,250
It seems like the police moved hastily on this one.

211
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,868
Some parts of the case even seem forced.

212
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:23,039
Well, in my eyes, the evidence is solid.

213
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:25,838
I guess we're entitled to our opinions.

214
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,839
(Fool)

215
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,470
The worst-case scenario...

216
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:32,640
would be involuntary manslaughter.

217
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,809
When the victim was slashed 13 times?

218
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,430
It's why...

219
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,440
That is exactly why I don't think Hyun Soo is the killer.

220
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,319
Not once but 13 times.

221
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:50,699
It has to be the result of underlying resentment.

222
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Is that so?

223
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,450
Judging by the level of brutality,

224
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,910
I'm leaning toward this not being...

225
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:02,210
Kim Hyun Soo's first killing.

226
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,710
Not this again.

227
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:10,420
We both know that the police...

228
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,048
only have two options.

229
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:16,430
Find definitive evidence that links Hyun Soo to the crime...

230
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:19,849
or get a confession out of him.

231
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,808
All you have is circumstantial evidence though...

232
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:26,519
which is why you had him sent to prison. Right?

233
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:28,069
You have it seriously wrong.

234
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,650
That was the court's decision.

235
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,150
A mere prosecutor doesn't possess that kind of power.

236
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,119
Mr. Shin,

237
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:39,740
since you need to be present at the hearing...

238
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,539
Check this place out.

239
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:50,089
They do custom dress shoes.

240
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,759
Looks expensive.

241
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,970
It's nice though.

242
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:59,640
We should get going then.

243
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,859
Don't you have a press conference at 11am?

244
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,859
Goodness. Nothing gets past you, does it?

245
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:15,029
Shall we?

246
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:25,460
Keep a spare nebulizer just in case.

247
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,130
Please sign here.

248
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,220
(Kim Hyun Soo)

249
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,890
I'm sorry but...

250
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:41,519
Could I get an anti-inflammatory painkiller?

251
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,098
You don't look like you need it.

252
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:48,229
(Infirmary)

253
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,819
Please.

254
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Excuse me.

255
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,039
Here. They're painkillers.

256
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:05,660
I hope they can help.

257
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,420
What do you think you're doing?

258
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:17,720
I'm sorry. Please...

259
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,639
I gave him medicine.

260
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
You did?

261
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,269
But he belongs to us.

262
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,579
You have some nerve.

263
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,970
You. Know your place.

264
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,160
Around 4:25am on Wednesday,

265
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:24,829
Ms. Hong, a 25-year-old female,

266
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,788
was found murdered in her residence.

267
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,118
(Implementing Justice and Protecting Human Rights)

268
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,419
At a five-minute distance from the scene,

269
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,709
the police picked up Mr. Kim, the 25-year-old male suspect,

270
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,048
and escorted him to the station.

271
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:39,588
Jeez. Our chief cleans up well.

272
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:41,220
He finally has some good luck, for a change.

273
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,969
I heard he already got an offer.

274
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,019
Hansung? What's the average salary there?

275
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,849
The police presume that Kim raped...

276
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,808
and brutally murdered Hong, the victim,

277
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:53,939
- between midnight and 1am, - I'm home.

278
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,819
the estimated time of Hong's death,

279
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:58,990
under the influence of alcohol and drugs.

280
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,240
Based on the 13 stab wounds found on the victim's body,

281
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,618
the prosecution is leaning...

282
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:06,740
toward it being a killing with malice aforethought.

283
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,578
Due to the brutality of the crime...

284
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:11,619
and the possibility of the suspect having committed additional crimes,

285
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,328
the prosecution has decided...

286
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:16,038
to disclose the identity of the suspect to the public,

287
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,338
based on the Special Act...

288
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:20,170
on the Punishment of Specific Violent Crimes.

289
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,430
The accused is Kim Hyun Soo, a 25-year-old male.

290
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:32,139
He is a college student...

291
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,230
with no criminal record or any previous convictions,

292
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,018
but the police and prosecution are investigating him...

293
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:38,730
as they believe he was deeply involved in the murder.

294
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,568
You said there was a possibility that he committed additional crimes.

295
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:44,108
- Hey. - Could this be a serial case?

296
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,739
- How embarrassing. - You little...

297
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,239
- What? - You scumbag.

298
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,618
- Nothing has been confirmed yet. - Do you want to die?

299
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:51,539
- You little jerk. - Get lost.

300
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:53,829
Good grief.

301
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:08,349
Did Kim Hyun Soo and the victim take drugs together?

302

304
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,059
We can't tell you the details...

305
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,849
until we have the autopsy results...

306
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,649
- Hyun Soo, is it you? - Yes, it's me.

307
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,819
- I'm at the prison... - Hey! Stop.

308
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,119
This call is being recorded,

309
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:29,619
so calm down and be careful what you say.

310
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,289
- Okay? - Okay.

311
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,829
So? How are you holding up?

312
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:42,170
Well, I'm all right.

313
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,838
What's going to happen to me now?

314
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,548
In about ten days,

315
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,508
they'll hold a hearing to review the legality of confinement.

316
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:53,269
They want to make sure the arrest was lawful and reasonable.

317
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:55,809
Well, you don't need to worry about it.

318
00:25:56,769 --> 00:25:57,900
Ten days?

319
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:02,980
I can still get out, right?

320
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:04,069
Hyun Soo.

321
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:08,108
It's only natural to have a lot on your mind when you're in there,

322
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,990
but try not to think about anything. Okay?

323
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,039
Empty your mind. It'll help you cope with this.

324
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,910
I want to,

325
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:17,039
but it's hard.

326
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,500
Yes, I understand. But try not to think about anything.

327
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,299
Just tell yourself this one thing, Hyun Soo.

328
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:28,589
"I am getting out of here, no matter what."

329
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,390
Okay?

330
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,019
Okay.

Has Mr. Kim Hyun Soo confessed to everything?

334
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,619
We'll share more details with you at our next briefing.

335

I'm Kim Hyun Soo's attorney.

336
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,289
I'm an attorney who represents Mr. Kim Hyun Soo, the accused.

337
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,839
- May we interview you? - Sure.

338
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:09,179
The prosecution insists that Mr. Kim is guilty...

339
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,088
based on circumstantial evidence alone.

340
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,890
Here's what I'd like to ask the prosecutors.

341
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,970
Rape. Serial murders.

342
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,769
Where is the evidence?

343
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:22,018
The police made a hasty judgement and pegged him as the killer...

344
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:23,729
before they even launched their investigation.

345
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,400
And based on the results of the police investigation,

346
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:29,199
the prosecutors abused their authority...

347
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,859
and took the liberty of indicting Mr. Kim.

348
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,829
Hello, sir. It's been so long since we last spoke.

349
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,460
Yes.

350
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,170
You know, the Chrysanthemum case is causing quite a stir these days.

351
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:51,970
Would I be able to get Kim Hyun Soo's address?

352
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,829
Why... Why are you doing this?

353
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,380
Let go.

354
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,180
Help!

355
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,059
Hey, kiddo.

356
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,690
Why... Why are you doing this?

357
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,069
The court isn't the only place where trials take place.

358
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:00,829
This is why one should never do such a horrible thing.

359
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,429
Just a moment. This will hurt a little.

360
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,189
Stay still. Just a moment.

361
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,690
There, it's done.

362
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,400
Oh, boy.

363
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,660
My goodness. This is bad.

364
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:03,619
Doctor, can we just... I want to just chop them off.

365
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,910
The whole feet.

366
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:07,369
You see, these little buggers are very smart.

367
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:10,129
If we do that, they'll just move to a different part of the body.

368
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,379
They'll target the weakest part of your body.

369
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,008
Usually, a soft, moist spot that will make a good home.

370
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,589
For example...

371
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:24,219
- Darn it. - I'll prescribe you some ointment.

372
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,809
Apply plenty of it on the affected area.

373
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:27,929
You know the plastic wrap, right?

374
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,269
Make sure you wrap it around the feet.

375
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,268
You mean, the cling wrap for food?

376
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:33,269
Yes.

377
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,359
But wouldn't it keep the area wet?

378
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:39,990
If you don't want to do that, you can use aluminium foil instead.

379
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,240
What? That's nonsense.

380
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,079
I can't walk around like that. They're not sweet potatoes.

381
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,539
Well, if you don't want to do that...

382
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,710
We'll have to chop them off.

I doubt it's to disclose the evidence,

424
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,050
so why did you ask me here?

425
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,969
Kim Hyun Soo...

426
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,800
Do you believe he's innocent?

that he's guilty?

That night,

Hyun Soo had at least three opportunities to come clean.

431
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:21,869
When he first found Hong Guk Hwa's body,

432
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:25,000
he could've called the police,

433
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,380
but he fled the scene after trying to destroy evidence.

434
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:34,629
I'm sure he was flustered.

435
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,178
He wasn't thinking straight.

436
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:37,179
Fine.

437
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,308
When he was driven back to the crime scene...

438
00:37:40,309 --> 00:37:42,429
after being caught at the DUI checkpoint...

439
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:44,900
and at the police station,

440
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,609
all he did...

441
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,280
was ask if the girl had died.

442
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,900
Is the girl...

443
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,070
dead?

444
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,070

503
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:40,250
Hey, kid. Do you have shampoo?

504
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:45,300
Washing your scalp with soap will give you dandruff.

505
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:51,219
Here. Go ahead.

506
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:55,679
Thank you.

507
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:57,849
Are you and Do Ji Tae acquaintances?

508
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:01,650
We're not.

509
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,989
Kiddo, don't you also find it to be weird?

510
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:18,659
Why would Do Ji Tae show interest in someone like you?

511
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
Anyway, I'll see you around.

512
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:29,130
Be well.

513
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:53,909
I'm lawyer Park Mi Kyung.

514
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:56,619
Please have a seat.

515
00:44:56,789 --> 00:44:57,789
Right.

516
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,129
I felt bad about what was happening...

517
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,049
to a student at my Alma mater.

518
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,339
I raised my concern to Ms. Park,

519
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,679
and she gladly agreed to talk to you both.

520
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,510
Did you already sign with Mr. Shin Joong Han?

521
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:20,889
No, not yet.

522
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,809
He's a third-rate attorney.

523
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,190
In our circle, he's known for his work with petty offenders.

524
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:31,319
He negotiates payment with clients and demands hefty retainers...

525
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,360
while doing none of the actual work.

526
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,489
No wonder. I told you he seemed shady.

527
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,079
Right.

528
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:43,170
Here.

529
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,170
Thank you.

530
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,710
Meanwhile, our law firm...

531
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,718
has over a dozen lawyers who were former prosecutors and judges...

532
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:53,049
as well as an advisory team...

533
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,179
consisting of former detectives and NFS experts.

534
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:59,260
I have one clear rule at my law firm.

535
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:02,848
Whether the client is innocent or guilty,

536
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:05,440
he or she is to be returned home.

537
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:10,820
I will fight for Hyun Soo myself.

538
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:13,780
But...

539
00:46:14,949 --> 00:46:17,239
what about the retainer?

540
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:19,738
We can't afford much, you see.

541
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:20,739
Pro bono.

542
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,578
She'll do it for free.

543
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:29,380
- Right. - Sorry?

544
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,339
You'll take on Hyun Soo's case for free?

545
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,340
That's right.

546
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:40,138
So please do not be so worried...

547
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:41,969
and let us fight your battle.

548
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:44,768
My gosh. Thank you so much.

549
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:46,900
Goodness. Thank you so much.

550
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,400
Thank you.

(Shin Joong Han Law Firm)

552
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:02,619
Darn.

553
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:18,800
This is ridiculous.

554
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:22,349
This had better work.

555
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:43,579
This little...

556
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:47,710
I don't even know anymore.

557
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,630
Whatever. I don't know.

558
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,129
I really don't.

(Division 2)

560
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:00,969
Sorry?

561
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,849
A new lawyer? What do you mean?

562
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:04,889
Her name is Park Mi Kyung.

563
00:48:05,389 --> 00:48:07,230
She's the CEO of Bumhan Law Firm.

564
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,730
We met her yesterday.

565
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:13,479
Dad, I like Mr. Shin Joong Han.

566
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,570
Why would you suddenly do this?

567
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:17,110
You like him because you have no idea.

568
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,489
Apparently, everyone in the industry calls him a third-rate attorney.

569
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:22,320
He specializes in petty cases.

570
00:48:22,659 --> 00:48:24,659
And he doesn't do any work until he gets paid.

571
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,999
Even so, he's been helping me all along.

572
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,328
I'll feel bad if we suddenly hire someone else.

573
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:32,289
Why would you feel bad? He's done nothing.

574
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,669
Hyun Soo, Ms. Park has kindly offered...

575
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,460
to represent you free of charge.

576
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,630
For free?

577
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,299
Yes. She feels bad that you're being groundlessly accused...

578
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,719
and wants to help you, free of charge.

579
00:48:46,179 --> 00:48:48,730
You know we can't afford a lawyer. I'm so relieved.

580
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,480
Now, you have a competent lawyer representing you,

581
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:54,940
so everything will be okay.

582
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,650
Don't worry about anything.

583
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,239
Let's stay strong, okay?

584
00:49:02,659 --> 00:49:03,659
Okay.

(Underwear Clearance)

586
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:10,658
How much is this?

587
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:11,868
There's no price tag.

588
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:13,670
- If you buy 4, it's 10 dollars. - It's 10 dollars?

589
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,969
Oh, that boxer. It's 3 for 15 dollars.

590
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:24,139
- Okay, I'll get this one. - Sure.

591
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,300
- I don't need the box. - Okay.

592
00:49:28,889 --> 00:49:31,940
Hey, I did my best to pick out a nice one.

593
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:35,860
I hope this fits you.

594
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:38,150
Thank you.

595
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:40,820
And...

596
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,119
Here. This is in your inmate account.

597
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:47,780
My inmate account?

598
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,658
Yes, it's money you can spend here.

599
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:52,250
The balance was zero, so I've deposited a small amount.

600
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,630
I see. I guess my parents didn't know.

601
00:49:56,289 --> 00:49:57,289
Thank you.

602
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:59,670
No worries. It's not even much.

603
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:05,679
Well...

604
00:50:07,389 --> 00:50:08,469
Mr. Shin.

605
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:14,139
Yes, go ahead.

606
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:17,019
What? What is it?

607
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,519
Well...

608
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:20,650
This.

609
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:23,280
I really appreciate it,

610
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,199
but to tell you the truth,

611
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:28,619
I...

612
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,579
I have a new lawyer now.

613
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,170
What do you mean?

614
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,630
According to my parents,

615
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,760
a different lawyer...

616
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:49,889
has offered to help me for free.

617
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:56,389
Really?

618
00:50:58,269 --> 00:51:00,480
For free? I see.

619
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,780
Have they decided to go with a public defender?

620
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,570
I don't think so.

621
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:08,619
The lawyer's name is Park Mi Kyung.

622
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:10,869
She has her own law firm.

623
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:13,039
Park Mi Kyung?

624
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:14,750
Yes.

625
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,420
Lawyer Park Mi Kyung. I see.

626
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,010
She's famous. She's very well-known...

627
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,679
and well-respected.

628
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:34,808
I'm sorry. You helped me at my lowest point.

629
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:36,179
Don't be sorry.

630
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:39,440
This is probably better for you anyway.

631
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,150
All right.

632
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:45,069
If your parents have already decided to go with her,

633
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,239
what can I do?

634
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:49,949
Well...

635
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:53,159
All right.

636
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:57,159
Hold on.

637
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:00,670
Then should I just get going?

638
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,670
Darn it. I wish you had given me a heads-up.

639
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:10,429
Goodness. This is really awkward.

640
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:13,010
My gosh.

641
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,218
Please take this back.

642
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:20,269
No. I bought them for you, so just keep them.

643
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:22,440
And keep this too.

644
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,690
Thank you for all your help.

645
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,699
All right. Stay strong.

646
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:36,119
I hope everything goes well.

647
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,920
Hyun Soo, just in case...

648
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:53,349
No, never mind.

649
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:56,219
Let's go.

650
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,848
(Advanced Correctional Practice)

651
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:03,019
- Thank you. - No problem.

652
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,820
Hey, take this.

653
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,150
- It's okay. Take it. - Thank you.

654
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,800
- What are you doing? - You punk!

655
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,920
- Hey. - What's wrong with you?

656
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,679
Oh, no.

657
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,218
- Darn it. See this? - My back hurts.

658
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:37,179
- Like this? - Okay.

659
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:38,469
Keep it down.

660
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:41,388
- Goodness gracious. - Look at this.

661
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:42,689
Hold this!

662
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,150
- Oh, dear. - Come on.

663
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:47,980
Hey, you're young. Why are you so weak?

664
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,819
Hey, do it properly.

665
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,949
- Hey. - Hey, you need to do a better job.

666
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,409
- My goodness. - Hey.

667
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,319
- Look at this punk. - What's wrong with you?

668
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,829
- Hey. - Do a better job.

669
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:02,079
- Darn it. - I told you to hold it!

670
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:16,639
Here. Here you go. Darn it.

671
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,599
Here, take it.

672
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,190
Hey, what's going on?

673
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,940
Just eat your food. Mind your own business.

(Bumhan Law Firm)

675
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:46,170
- Mr. Shin Joong Han? - Yes.

676
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,788
Hello. I'm Seo Soo Jin, a lawyer who is assisting Ms. Park...

677
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:51,249
in this case.

678
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,960
Okay, let's go.

679
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,340
The thing is...

680
00:54:55,469 --> 00:54:56,550
What's the matter?

681
00:54:56,719 --> 00:54:58,800
She had an unexpected...

682
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:01,218
- She had... - Did she tell you to say...

683
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:02,639
that she had to step out?

684
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:04,389
No. She's really not here at the moment.

685
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:08,809
This is rude.

686
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:11,230
She stole my case from me,

687
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,489
and she's treating me like this? This is disrespectful.

688
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,159
I'm not following.

689
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,779
We met with Kim Hyun Soo's parents and...

690
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,449
Look, Ms. Seo Soo Jin.

691
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:25,909
That is called stealing.

692
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,710
I'm sorry, but I do not agree.

693
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:38,050
Ms. Seo, is this why you studied law?

694
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,510
To be used in theft?

695
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:44,428
To list these pathetic excuses?

696
00:55:44,429 --> 00:55:46,809
It can't be why you studied the Penal Code and the Civil Code,

697
00:55:47,269 --> 00:55:48,980
which is very hard to do.

698
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:52,320
If you'd like to leave a message for her, I'll happily pass it along.

699
00:55:59,409 --> 00:56:02,780
Do I really have to say it?

700
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,000
I'm sure you know why I'm here.

701
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:35,420
Darn it.

702
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:01,110
(Punish the murderer!)

703
00:58:56,539 --> 00:58:58,590
I didn't know people could smoke and even deal drugs...

704
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,710
inside a prison.

705
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,800
It is not allowed, but this place is just like the outside world.

706
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,090
It's possible for those with power.

707
00:59:09,429 --> 00:59:13,309
Cell phones, cigarettes, and meth.

708
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,110
Do Ji Tae controls all three items.

709
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,940
Trading them without his permission...

710
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,900
will result in the loss of a leg.

711
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:15,949
Out of these mongrels,

712
01:00:17,869 --> 01:00:20,289
who could've traded cigarettes behind my back?

713
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,920
Sorry?

714
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:25,710
Figure it out.

715
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,679
But... how?

716
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,260
If one says he can't remember,

717
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:33,050
make him remember.

718
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,239
But how...

719
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,029
am I supposed to know?

720
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:51,030
You will.

721
01:00:54,329 --> 01:00:55,329
You have to.

722
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:01,630
He's known as Bone Breaker.

723
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,130
He can break every bone in your body, you see.

724
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:12,888
Please... Please don't hurt me.

725
01:01:12,889 --> 01:01:14,469
Please don't.

726
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:17,019
No, wait.

727
01:01:17,889 --> 01:01:19,889
Just a second. What if...

728
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:22,480
What if I really don't know?

729
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,400
You do.

730
01:01:56,849 --> 01:01:57,929
I'm sorry,

731
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:02,269
but he doesn't seem to be here.

732
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:11,530
If that is true,

733
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,570
they'll all die today.

734
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:18,409
He's not here, so why?

735
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,500
Because he is here.

736
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,159
He's not here.

737
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:11,210
Follow me.

738
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:44,659
I'm one to always return the favour.

739
01:03:48,329 --> 01:03:49,539
Whenever you need help,

740
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:51,920
let me know.

741
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,849
But...

742
01:04:00,929 --> 01:04:02,559
I'll soon be out of here.

743
01:05:03,989 --> 01:05:04,989
Mr. Jung.

744
01:05:05,659 --> 01:05:06,829

747

- Darn rats. - Did someone die?

- Order! - Darn murderers!

754

- Someone died. - Did he die?

755
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:53,829
Hey!

756
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,920
Order!

757
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:17,110
- Get him. - After him!

758
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,360
Get back here, darn it!
