Give me your number so we can meet up later.

Nice, right? I booked a pool villa.

We're going to split the cost though.

Dad, are you done for the day?

I'm staying in tonight. I think I'm coming down with something.

36
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:43,960
You don't feel well, and you're drinking soju?

37
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:45,668
Why? Do you want some?

38

Just take a cab here.

Why would you be sorry?

127

so I need you to take care of this one.

171
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,470
You're in the area, so head over there now.

172
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,809
He wants us to head over there now. Can't we just let that guy go?

173
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,689
Here's the address.

174
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,779
Joongang-Gu 68, Choosa-ro.

175
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,529
Is 21 on your way? Over.

176
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,818
This is Patrol 24.

177
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:28,200
We'll be on standby in case they need backup, over.

178
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:30,490
Patrol 23 will...

179
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:32,950
Move the car.

180
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,420
We have to move the car.

181
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,750
Sir, you'll have to come with us.

182
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,799
Patrol 21, are you on your way to Joongang-dong for the break-in case?

183
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,680
Yes, sir. We're on our way. We'll arrive in five minutes.

184
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,849
Roger that. Joongang-dong...

185
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,309
Roger that.

186
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,019
Got the address.

187
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:04,528
We'll be on our way too.

188
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,319
Leaving in two minutes.

189
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,509
It's just around the corner.

190
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,759
Okay.

191
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,890
He must be the one who called it in.

192
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:49,450
It's that house over there.

193
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:53,369
I saw a man run in and dash off.

194
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,160
Did you see his face?

195
00:26:57,369 --> 00:26:59,079
Well, I did.

196
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,589
But my eyesight is bad.

197
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,500
I did see him...

198
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:05,960
leaving in a taxi.

199
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,680
In a taxi?

200
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,309
- Someone reported a break-in? - Yes, sir.

201
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Thank you.

202
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,210
Just a second.

203
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:24,289
Hold on.

204
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:56,779
You're at a crime scene. Remember that.

205
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,118
I'm sorry, sir.

206
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,410
Chief Park.

207
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,000
What happened?

208
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,079
A woman in her 20s has been stabbed.

209
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,920
The gentleman over there reported a breaking and entering.

210
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,508
He spotted a young man entering the house...

211
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:12,588
and then fleeing in a taxi.

212
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:14,220
He found it suspicious enough to call the police.

213
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:18,099
Who's that in there?

214
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,559
Oh, him. He's my arrest.

215
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,308
It seemed like drunk driving.

216
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:24,309
"Seemed like"?

217
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:26,940
The battery ran out on my breathalyser.

218
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,150
- I apologize. - We're sorry, sir.

219
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,819
Where's your head at?

220
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,399
(Police)

221
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,029
Take him to the station then.

222
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:37,528
Who entered the site?

223
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:39,279
Oh, right. Well, these two and...

224
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:41,700
Please exit the vehicle.

225
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:50,089
I see you're sweating. Do you feel hot?

226
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:51,589
No.

227
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:53,880
You'll be taken to the station for now.

228
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:02,680
Right. Keep up the good work then.

229
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,730
Please get in.

230
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:06,730
Watch your head.

231
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,230
That's it.

232
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:10,019
Good.

233
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:11,569
Off you go.

234
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:12,819
Good night, sir.

235
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:14,569
The victim...

236
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,169
The call came in at 4am.

237
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,170
It was 4am, right?

238
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,970
The victim was 25 years of age.

239
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
Hold on a second.

240
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,970
How many times was she stabbed?

241
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,480
I'm not sure. Probably 12 or 13.

242
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,559
Is that your lottery ticket?

243
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,150
Thirteen it is.

244
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,990
I have a good feeling about these numbers.

245
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,119
Is...

246
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:02,910
the woman...

247
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,199
dead?

248
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,829
Yes, probably.

249
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,000
Are you a witness?

250
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,839
No.

251
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:26,849
All right.

252
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:30,058
Just get going, will you?

253
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,230
But it wasn't on purpose.

254
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,479
It's not like I did anything wrong.

255
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,819
- No, don't. - I got him.

256
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:38,528
- Good evening. - Who do you have?

257
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,278
Chief Park Sang Bum sent him over.

258
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,990
- What for? - We don't know.

259
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,778
Put him on the couch then.

260
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,450
Sure thing. This way, please.

261
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,119
(Fairness and Kindness)

262
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:53,629
Take a seat here until the chief arrives.

263
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,459
(Chungang Police Station)

264
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,959
Good night, sir.

265
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,258
Keep up the good work.

266
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:00,259
Sure thing.

267
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,640
You've reached the police station.

268
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,019
Right. Sure thing.

269
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:12,848
Of course. We'll keep that in mind.

270
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:18,109
(Chungang Police Station)

271
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:40,338
The murder weapon isn't serrated.

272
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:43,130
It's a small knife that's about 15cm.

273
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:45,390
The specs are too common to give you a model.

274
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:46,559
And prints?

275
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,058
I have a few good ones,

276
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:50,599
but they probably belong to the victim.

277
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:52,439
Most killers wipe down surfaces...

278
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,190
or wear gloves to begin with.

279
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,690
So you don't think it was accidental?

280
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,318
Accidental killings aren't usually this gruesome.

281
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,399
(Police)

282
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,819
Unless it's a psycho, I mean.

What is it?

284
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,038
The team went out for drinks last night.

285
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,410
Darn. It's bad luck to take a dump at the scene of a homicide.

286
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,420
Hey, who has toilet paper?

- Right. - All right.

00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,278
Spitting at a police station?

290
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,199
- Unbelievable. - Why can I never get used to...

291
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,990
the smell of a police station?

292
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,329
It's been a while, guys.

293
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,369
Make way, will you?

294
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,579
- You psycho. - Is that so?

00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:57,630
What do you think you're looking at, you punk?

296
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,299
- Detective Lee. - Hey, you.

297
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,009
Don't you know who I am?

298
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,089
- You piece of scum. - What?

299

What was that you just blabbered?

300
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:09,510
Keep it down, will you? This isn't a fight club.

301
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,689
Say that again. What did you just say to me?

302
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,400
- What a sap. - A sap?

303
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,030
You must be out of your mind.

304
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,949
What are you looking at me for?

305
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,409
Why? Does it make you nervous?

306
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:32,289
Hey, hey!

307
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,130
Is the dead girl the owner of this house?

308
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,288
The guy did seem a bit weird.

309
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:42,750
He must've did a number on her.

310
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,170
This is why you can't trust the handsome type.

316
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,440
It's actually nothing.

Gosh. I apologize for that.

00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,359
Who took center stage?

339
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,110
Crazy jerk.

340
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,400
Sir, I'll be with you in a second.

Good work, Chief.

347
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:22,968
You look tired, Chief.

348
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,518
Who's the culprit? The son of a gun.

349
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:27,099
My gosh, brother. Shouldn't you be retiring soon?

350
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,189
What are you doing here, jerk?

351
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,820
And I'm not your brother, you little twerp.

352
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,320
Hey, eyes down.

353
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:43,909
What's this guy doing here?

354
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,329
I thought you sent him here, sir.

355
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,459
Since when did we do a sobriety test here?

356
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,669
A sobriety test? What are you talking about?

357
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,460
Do your job better, will you?

358
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,969
- I'm sorry, sir. - We apologize, sir.

359
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:04,559
He has weird eyes.

360
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:07,230
- Hey. - Yes, sir.

361
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:11,440
See if he has any drugs on him.

362
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:12,820
Yes, sir.

363
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,320
Sir, we have to search you.

364
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:29,419
By the way, I heard the victim was stabbed 13 times.

365
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,499
Yes.

366
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,129
We're estimating that it took place at around 2 to 3am.

367
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,339
The suspect is a man in his 20s.

368
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,259
He ran out of the house and fled in a taxi. That's all we know...

369
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,718
Hey, he didn't have to hail a taxi.

370
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,639
He just got in the taxi and left.

371
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,848
What's the difference?

372
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:48,190
You're awfully slow-witted. How did you even become a cop?

373
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:52,809
That punk drove off in his taxi.

374
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,949
A man in his 20s...

375
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,369
drove off in his taxi?

376
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,579
Put your hands behind your head.

377
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,170
You said the victim was stabbed.

378
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,800
Yes. The blade length is about 15cm, and the width is about 3cm.

379
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,269
- Officer Park. - What's that?

380
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,268
I... I didn't do it.

381
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:37,610
Don't move.

382
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:44,829
What is your name?

383
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,039
Kim Hyun Soo.

384
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:51,249
I...

385
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,250
It wasn't me.

386
00:40:52,251 --> 00:40:53,788
Where did you see him? What time?

387
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:56,420
A five-minute drive from the scene. He was driving a taxi.

388
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,129
We were wrapping up, so I'd say it was around 4am.

389
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,719
At 4:13am, sir.

390
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,718
Where is the taxi now?

391
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:05,099
We just left it there.

392
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:07,389
It would've been dangerous for him to drive.

393
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:09,138
What are you waiting for, Detective Park?

394
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:10,848
Recite the Miranda Rights.

395
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:13,598
Kim Hyun Soo, you are under arrest for murder.

396
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,689
You have the right against self-incrimination...

397
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,768
and will be given a chance to explain yourself.

398
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:16,859
You have the right to an attorney...

399
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,229
and may request the court to review the legality of the arrest.

400
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,360
I didn't do it.

401
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,159
It wasn't me.

402
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,449
It wasn't me.

403
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:28,579
I didn't do it.

404
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:30,289
It wasn't me.

405
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:32,789
It really wasn't me.

406
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,089
I didn't do it!

407
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,210
Be quiet!

408
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,590
Don't move!

409
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,260
Stay still. Darn it!

410
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,349
- It wasn't me... - Hey! Stay still!

411
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,510
Relax your arms!

412
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,849
Stay still! Don't move.

413
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,559
You cops are amazing. Way to go!

414
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,190
Stay still! Don't move.

415
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:05,280
It wasn't... It really wasn't me.

416
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,119
There, it's on.

417
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,449
- Hey, relax! - Relax.

420
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,759
Mom, just file a police report.

421
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,428
If you let him off, he'll do it again.

422
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:33,928
Hey, we have no idea what happened to your brother.

423
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:35,690
File a police report? For what?

424
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:38,269
Ji Soo, can you try calling him?

425
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:41,190

(Video Recording Consent Form)

428
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,960
I woke up...

429
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,879
and thought I should head home.

430
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,960
And?

431
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,420
So I went to her room to say goodbye to her...

432
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,098
and found her like that.

433
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:13,389
She was dead.

434
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:15,179
Then what did you do?

435
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:23,780
I ran away because I was scared.

436
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,650
I didn't... I really didn't do it.

437
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:35,159
Hyun Soo.

438
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:41,420
You are the last person who saw Hong Guk Hwa alive,

439
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,300
and you were also the first person to find her dead.

440
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,429
Do you know what we usually call people like that?

441
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:52,550
"Suspect."

442
00:43:56,389 --> 00:43:57,809
I'm sure you know what this room is for.

443
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:00,309
You must've seen it in movies or TV shows.

444
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,400
This is being recorded,

445
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:06,780
and it is admissible in court as evidence.

446
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:11,909
But you see,

447
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:15,989
the judges won't like this...

448
00:44:16,909 --> 00:44:18,659
because they don't like liars.

449
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,000
I...

450
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:23,500
I really didn't do it.

451
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:26,090
I can't say I did it...

452
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,219
when I didn't do it.

453
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:31,010
Then why did she die?

454
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:34,389
I don't know. I don't remember anything.

455
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:37,099
I woke up...

456
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:41,980
and found her like that.

Hyun Soo.

458
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,320
Claiming that you remember nothing is not a good strategy either.

459
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:58,159
Judges hate liars the most.

460
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:01,710
The second thing they hate...

461
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:05,130
is dealing with people who say they don't remember anything.

462
00:45:55,469 --> 00:45:57,050
Spray this on him.

463
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,150
Turn off the lights.

464
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,300
It...

465
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:41,349
It wasn't me.

I'm Lawyer Shin Joong Han...

474
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:12,380
We're here too.

475
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:16,050
What's up with him this morning?

476
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,599
Good to see you.

477
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:28,689
Hello, I'm Lawyer Shin Joong Han.

478
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,610
Yes, please have a seat.

479
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,280
It's been a rough night, hasn't it?

480
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,739
Let me see what you're up against.

481
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:44,739
I...

482
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,659
I would like a lawyer as well.

483
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:49,578
But you said you're innocent.

484
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:51,539
Why would you need a lawyer when you didn't do it?

485
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,009
- Have a good one. - Let's get going.

486
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,429
- Sure thing. - All right.

487
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,579
Darn, that stinks.

488
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,750
Hey, I think you've dumped enough in there.

489
00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:34,590
What does one have to eat to stink like that?

490
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,510
Talk about having a lousy morning.

491
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,049
One should wash their hands after taking a dump,

492
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,049
you disgusting moron.

493
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,050
Of course.

494
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:50,348
I saw a kid in the holding cell.

495
00:48:50,349 --> 00:48:51,559
One that looks like he's in a boy band.

496
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:55,190
Oh, him? He was arrested for rape and murder.

497
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,899
Rape and murder? With a face like that?

498
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,988
What do looks have to do with it?

499
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:02,530
He was drunk driving and was probably high on drugs.

500
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:04,409
The worst combination.

501
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:06,618
Why? Does he intrigue you?

502
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:08,659
As if.

503
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,919
Yes, it'll be 300 dollars and I take credit cards...

00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,260
with no additional interest for three months.

505
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,800
That's right.

506
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:24,469
Is that so? That's too bad then.

507
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:27,309
You should know though...

508
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:30,179
that no one charges less than I do.

509
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:32,519
Yes, please give me a call.

510
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:34,769
Pricey, my foot.

511
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,489
(For the People, With the People, Trustworthy Chungang Police)

512
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,170
I guess a poke won't hurt.

513
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:32,449
Did you get yourself a lawyer?

514
00:50:35,329 --> 00:50:36,329
What?

515
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,130
You see,

516
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,339
I didn't do this.

517
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,678
All I did was have drinks with her and...

518
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:47,550
No, stop that.

519
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:53,230
From here on out, keep this in mind.

520
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:57,269
You are not to talk with anyone else.

521
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,609
If someone asks your opinion on Korean reunification,

522
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,230
you will say you don't know.

523
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,570
If someone asks who created Hangul,

524
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,699
you will say you don't know.

525
00:51:07,989 --> 00:51:10,280
To any question, you will only say,

526
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:11,539
"I don't know."

527
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:14,699
"Talk to my lawyer."

528
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Understand?

529
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,129
But it really wasn't me.

530
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,090
What did I just tell you?

531
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:28,130
Right.

532
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:34,389
I bet you have no idea what's going on.

533
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,179
Am I right?

534
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:43,610
By the way, what's your name?

535
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,030
It's Kim Hyun Soo.

536
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:49,659
Hyun Soo?

537
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,119
"Hyun" as in generous and "Soo" as in outstanding?

538
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,159
- Yes. - I see.

539
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:55,789
I like that name.

540
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,409
It has energy to it.

541
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:00,170
I'm...

542
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,500
Lawyer Shin Joong Han.

543
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,380
Shin Joong Han.

544
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,340
Here.

545
00:52:09,469 --> 00:52:10,550
I hope...

546
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:12,550
we get along.

547
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:18,690
Sure.
