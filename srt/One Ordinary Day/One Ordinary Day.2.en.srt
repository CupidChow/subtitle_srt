(Holding Cell 2)

00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:42,539
Guk Hwa...

6
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:48,629
Her name was...

7
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,129
Guk Hwa.

8
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,490
(Episode 2: The Suspect)

9
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,240
First off,

10
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:17,199
we should make sure they can't get your arrest warrant issued.

11
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:19,289
If they manage to get it, it'll be a headache...

12
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,909
for both of us.

13
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,330
It'll work to your disadvantage at the trial.

14
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,629
You met Chief Park Sang Bum, didn't you?

15
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Yes.

16
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:31,879
Tell them he forced a confession out of you.

17
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:36,349
But he didn't.

18
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,099
Perhaps they forgot to recite the Miranda Rights.

19
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,099
No, they recited the whole thing.

20
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,270
They did?

21
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,859
They usually use force when making an arrest...

22
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,949
without a warrant in such an emergency situation.

23
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,330
They must've cursed at you at least. "You scumbag!"

24
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,038
Hey! Can you do something about the light bulb here?

25
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,039
It's so distracting. Fix it already.

26
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,500
Are we at a club or what?

27
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,379
This is bad.

28
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:19,600
Where are you going?

29
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,768
I need to figure out what's going on.

30
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:25,399
I'll listen to what the police have to say and eat something.

31
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,360
By the way, have you eaten yet?

32
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,189
I'm not hungry.

33
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,699
Really? Okay.

34
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,870
Hey, let me out.

35
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,389
What did the victim look like when she was found?

36
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,480
I didn't see the victim at the scene.

37
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:09,859
But from what I've heard, he slashed the girl like this...

38
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,689
Actually, no. He stabbed her deeply.

39
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,899
Not just once. 13 times.

40
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,199
So obviously, she wasn't found in good condition.

41
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,199
Thirteen times...

42
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,040
Who's in charge of the case?

43
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,459
- Chief Park Sang Bum. - Why did he take it on?

44
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,550
He'll retire soon.

45
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,588
It's not like volunteering for it will make him rich.

46
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:37,129
Well, he still has three months left.

47
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,929
(Chungang Police Station)

48
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,389
It's not looking good.

49
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,389
You don't want to drink this?

50
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,230
I'm hungry. I want food.

51
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,310
You can drink this after your meal.

52
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,529
Here you go.

53
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,029
- Here you go. - Thank you.

54
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:04,449
- I'd like lots of solid bits. - Sure.

55
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:09,790
Yes.

56
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,500
- Thank you. - Here you go.

57
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,420
Shall we?

58
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,980
I already told you everything.

59
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,230
I parked my car there to rest for a moment.

60
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,149
After a drink or two?

61
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,949
No, not at all.

62
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,829
Draw a circle on the face you saw.

63
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,209
You already know who it is.

64
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:36,750
It's this punk right here.

65
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,889
Sign your name at the bottom.

66
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:58,730
(Seung Hoon)

67
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,790
- Oh, boy. - Have you tried it?

68
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,750
What? The red ginseng extract?

69
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:17,420
Hey, when I put it on,

70
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,838
it stinks all day. My goodness.

71
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,878
Have you tried it yourself?

72
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,720
That's why I told you to put it on at night.

73
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,259
You never told me that.

74
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,850
Yes, I did.

75
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,019
Darn it. No wonder.

76
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:36,610
Everyone cares a great deal for my feet.

77
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,819
I have atopic dermatitis.

78
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,360
But it's not contagious, so don't worry.

79
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,860
You have asthma, don't you?

80
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,070
I had asthma when I was little,

81
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,870
so I can tell from that wheezing.

82
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,250
Hyun Soo.

83
00:08:57,129 --> 00:08:59,879
I can relate to how you must be feeling right now,

84
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,589
so let me give you two pieces of advice.

85
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,470
Listen carefully and keep them etched in your heart.

86
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,889
Okay?

87
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:10,179
- Okay. - First,

88
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,350
the truth and justice.

89
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,480
Such things don't exist here, so don't even think about it.

90
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,519
Facts don't matter, and neither do your claims.

91
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,730
So what matters?

92
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,399
Repeat after me.

93
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:27,200
"What has to be a fact for me to be at an advantage?"

94
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,080
"What has to be a fact for me to be at an advantage?"

95
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,120
Good. Here's the second one.

96
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,918
From here on,

97
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:40,378
when referring to what happened last night,

98
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,799
everyone will just call it "that night."

99
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,220
Repeat after me. "That night."

100
00:09:49,299 --> 00:09:51,009
"That night."

101
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,309
Good.

102
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,809
From this moment,

103
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,769
you won't say anything about that night.

104
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,320
No exceptions. Never.

105
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,700
Do you understand?

106
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,120
We were just wrapping up our DUI checkpoints.

107
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,909
So at first, I thought he was drunk driving.

108
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,669
He had a blank stare...

109
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,048
and seemed dangerous.

110
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:26,009
Were you the first to arrive at the scene?

111
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:27,590
The scene?

112
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,549
Yes, sir. I was the first to arrive.

113
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:35,558
Sorry. Could we not talk about how I threw up at the scene?

114
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,559
Hey.

115
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,059
Look at the camera, not me.

116
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,729
It's just embarrassing, that's all.

117
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,899
Seriously?

118
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,360
Cut the sideshow and state what you saw.

119
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,989
- I apologize. - In the back of the squad car,

120
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,028
he asked about the girl.

121
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,370
Be more specific.

122
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,870
He asked if the girl was dead.

123
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,580
Right.

124
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,999
He asked, "Is the girl dead?"

125
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,668
Right around now,

126
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,379
the police will be busy getting their stories straight.

127
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:06,418
The police come up with their version of events...

128
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:08,169
and we come up with ours.

129
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,428
The judge listens to both and selects which is more believable.

130
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:12,590
That's how a trial works.

131
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,058
So if you keep your mouth shut,

132
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:18,639
we'll be able to find out what story they're cooking up.

133
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
But...

134
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,149
shouldn't you know what really happened to me though?

135
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,990
You and your constant need for the truth.

136
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,070
Obsessing over that won't get you very far.

137
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,538
I already told you that the police...

138
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:38,289
is putting together a story of their own.

139
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,090
(Forensics)

140
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,009
- Sir, you're here. - Right.

141
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,139
I'm sure it all started at this table.

142
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,879
Remember Chief Park Sang Bum whom you met?

143
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,428
He went from beat cop and all the way...

144
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,299
to leading his own team.

145
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,019
Whether it's evidence or witnesses,

146
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,929
no matter how small the detail is,

147
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,100
he gathers information firsthand.

148
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:48,860
He didn't seem like a bad person.

149
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,490
Hyun Soo, you should know...

150
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:58,070
that there are no good or bad people here.

151
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,120
They live by the justice that they seem is fitting.

152
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:06,749
A cop foolishly seeking justice...

153
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,090
and always hoping for a happy ending?

154
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,169
They only exist in movies.

155
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,639
Besides, Chief Park?

156
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,259
Well, he's like...

157
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,059
a beast operating in silence.

158
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,440
A veteran.

159
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,899
He waits for the right timing instead of being too eager.

160
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,070
He even shows kindness at times.

161
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:37,240
The man waits for you to slip up.

162
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,870
I...

163
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,450
can't...

164
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't breathe.

165
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,250
Of course.

166
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,089
This is a new experience for you.

167
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,460
No, that's not it. I...

168
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:54,879
I have asthma, you see.

169
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,389
And once he finds your weakness,

170
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,179
he will pounce and bite!

171
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,600
He will cut you off at the jugular...

172
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,480
and gnaw away your soul.

173
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Huh?

174
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:34,169
Yes, hello.

175
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,919
No, I'm almost there.

176
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,628
I'm nearby, so wait for me.

177
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,759
Got it.

178
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:42,429
Hey, I'm done here.

179
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,309
What's going on?

180
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,058
I'm late for a hearing.

181
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,638
Judges hate tardiness,

182
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,309
and it's not how I should treat clients.

183
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,690
What about me then?

184
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,940
I'll be back once I'm done.

185
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,399
What should you do until I come back?

186
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,200
I'll keep my mouth shut.

187
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,450
Okay, good.

It is clear that the defendant caused bodily harm...

- which is why I sentence him to... - A lawyer shouldn't be late.

Don't be ridiculous. I'm right on time.

195
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,070
Put on a neck tie.

196
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:45,028
Forget it. I haven't worn one since middle school graduation.

197
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,279
- Here. - What the...

198
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:48,158
As if a neck tie suits what I'm wearing.

199
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,158
Put it on if you don't want to get fined.

200
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,159
Unbelievable.

201
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,509
Let me see.

202
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,049
That's not mine.

203
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,470
Is that so?

204
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,889
Hold on. What's your case number?

205
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:07,849
Seriously?

206
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,018

His lawyer Shin Joong Han is also present.

210

Hello?

212
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
This is Chief Park Sang Bum...

213
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:56,399
from Chungang Police Criminal Department.

214
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,648
The police?

215
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,649
I'm calling with information regarding Ms. Hong Guk Hwa.

216
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,149
Are you her father?

217
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,659
Just tell her I can't be reached.

218
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,700
Actually, we need identification.

219
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,869
Identification?

220
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,190

222
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,669
Ms. Hong doesn't seem to be your biological daughter.

223
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,680
May I ask the details of your relationship?

224
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,469
Guk Hwa's mother passed away two years ago.

225
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,640
She held out with stage-three cancer.

226
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,479
Our marriage was short,

227
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,559
so Guk Hwa and I are only family on paper.

228
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,980
The house is still a crime scene,

229
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,279
so you won't have access for a while.

230
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,990
I don't live there anyway, so it's fine.

231
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,159
I left the house after Guk Hwa's mom passed away.

232
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,740
You know, because of the awkwardness.

233
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,170
We need you to consent to the autopsy.

(Cho Kang Pil, Stepfather)

236
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,779
A neck tie hardly goes with this outfit.

237
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,818
That neck tie let you get off without a fine.

238
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,910
Otherwise, you would've gotten a fine of a few thousand dollars.

239
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,410
How many months?

240
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:15,619
I'll pay in full.

241
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,288
You get the ten percent regular customer discount.

242
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,210
So that brings the total to...

With an app, you might as well start a lawyer delivery business.

245
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,469
I thought I got a ten percent discount.

246
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,589
There's surtax to consider.

247
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,639
It's why I said you should pay cash.

248

You really are something, aren't you?

249
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,599
Well, one must make a living.

251
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,059
Sure.

252
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,940
Unbelievable.

253
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,910
What on earth did I just say?

254
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,880
Hey, you.

255
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,169
When you get caught after conning people,

256
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,589
it does fatten my wallet which I'm not complaining about.

257
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,259
But it's about time you step away from that life.

Tell me, Hyun Soo. This is a misunderstanding, right?

280
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:39,970

Yes, tell us.

282
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,519
I can't say I had nothing to do with it.

283
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:52,859
What about the knife?

284
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:56,319
They said you had the knife. It's not true, right?

285
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,160
It is true.

286
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:05,660
But I didn't kill her.

287

- My gosh. - But you see, this one...

291
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,759
Look at this spot right here.

292
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,229
I know. I have no idea what this is.

293

How do you do this though? It's pretty cool.

I'll do a good job.

But I must say, you're quite clumsy.

- Where's your phone? - Hand over the phone.

336
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,690
What a lousy day.

337
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,190
Why are you sticking your nose into everything?

338

What are you talking about?

339
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,029
Watch what you say.

340
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,779
Are you struggling these days?

341
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,910
You haven't told the prosecution that he should be indicted, right?

342
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:34,829
Because you have that icky feeling hanging over your head,

343
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,209
like when you forget to wipe your butt after pooping.

344
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,670
I'm already flushing the toilet paper down the toilet.

345

It's already over.

346

347
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:49,349
The way I see it, it's only starting now.

348
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:54,269
Don't be greedy.

349
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:57,518
I'll jump rope with Hyun Soo, so you hold the rope.

350
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,650
Do it with me. Why would you do it with Hyun Soo?

351
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,900
And look at yourself. You're retiring in three months.

352
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,950
Don't be so greedy,

353
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,619
or your rope will snap.

354
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:23,960
This coffee tastes awful.

355
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,390
Hey, Hyun Soo. What did I say?

356
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:36,769
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

357
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:39,190
But how? My parents came to see me.

358
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,309
I didn't say much though.

359
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,730
Everything you and your parents said was recorded.

360
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,449
If you said anything stupid...

361
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,160
I'm sure you did.

362
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,118
They'll use it as evidence,

363
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,740
and I'll have to beg the prosecutor to have a look at it.

364
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,659
Eventually, we'll only get to see the footage...

365
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,170
once your trial begins.

366
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:01,420
I said...

367
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,210
I didn't do it because it really wasn't me.

368
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:10,220
My mom was worried.

369
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,180
You're at it again.

370
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,059
Fine.

371
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:22,859
Then try putting yourself in the judge's shoes.

372
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,359
All right.

373
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,608
Your fingerprints were found all over the scene.

374
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:29,608
You had bloodstains all over your body...

375
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:31,700
and even had a bloody knife in your pocket.

376
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:34,079
Think about it.

377
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:37,409
Who do you think killed her?

378
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,868
The man who last saw her alive?

379
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:42,629
Or someone totally random...

380
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,710
who just happens to be a scumbag?

381
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:48,548
The "truth" you're telling...

382
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:52,219
won't help your situation at all.

383
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,008
You really need to tell yourself,

384
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:56,518
"Darn it. I shouldn't be doing this."

385
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,480
Remember that,

386
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,559
or for the rest of your life...

387
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,650
you're doomed. How many times must I tell you this?

also think that I killed her?

391
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,460
He won't confess?

392
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,119
With all this solid evidence?

393
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,210
What is the prosecutor saying?

394
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:29,589
I haven't forwarded the case yet.

395
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,930
I don't think there will be any problems.

Shall I just do it?

398
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:51,109
If we have his confession, it'll be a done deal.

399
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,579
That's what we'll do, then.

with lots of field experience.

405

You were the only one I could think of, so I told him about you.

00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:19,349
Just like that, we're back in the game.

502
00:36:53,889 --> 00:36:56,678
The warrant for the arrest of the suspect...

503
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:00,388
in the Chrysanthemum Murder Case will be validated today.

504
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:02,268
The suspect who now has...

505
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:04,098
an arrest warrant requested against him...

506
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:06,689
will be considered a defendant by the Seoul District Court.

507
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,820
Whether he'll be reprimanded will be decided today.

508
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,899
The suspect drove his father's taxi...

509
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,158
on the pretence of being in business.

510
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:16,238
He then accepted the female victim as a passenger...

511
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,909
and drove her home.

512
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,578
Once they were at her residence,

513
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:21,868
he raped and murdered her.

514
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:24,249
He was caught while driving away from the scene.

515
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,879
During the initial arrest, nearby the crime scene...

516
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,879
(The woman I used to love)

517
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,218
- Hello? What is it? - Why would I talk to Dad?

518
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:34,379
- You talk to him. - He said he'd buy it for you.

519
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,340
I wasn't the one who promised.

520
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:38,348
Whatever!

521
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:39,849
Don't buy it for me if you don't want to.

522
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:41,349
You haven't finished your meal.

523
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,730
Hae In!

524
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:44,480
Thanks for breakfast.

525
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,359
Did you hear that?

526
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,449
Was that about the violin she mentioned some time ago?

527
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,328
Buy it for her. It's not like it costs a fortune.

528
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:02,659
Besides, her dad's a lawyer.

529
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,630
You didn't send last month's child support.

530
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,039
Is that so?

531
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,300
Sorry about that. Things have been hectic lately.

532
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,968
I'll send it during the week.

533
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:17,260
Mr. Shin Joong Han, do you even know what grade...

534
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:20,428
your daughter is in?

535
00:38:20,429 --> 00:38:23,099
Of course. As if I wouldn't know.

536
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,519
Darn.

537
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,099
She's in elementary school.

538
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:31,780
She goes to middle school next year.

539
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,279
I'm up to my neck paying for her academy classes,

540
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
so send the money soon.

541
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:36,489
Okay, I got it. I will...

542
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:41,738
(Get off Work on Time)

543
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:43,369
Unbelievable.

544
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,989
I hope they fit.

545
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:22,158
What about my own clothes?

546
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,239
They're evidence.

547
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,339
(Detective)

548
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,169
Hyun Soo, don't worry too much. Hold on a second.

549
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,260
What is it?

550
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:42,428
What is he wearing?

551
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:44,138
(Detective)

552
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:46,559
You just had to put him in this, didn't you?

553
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,018
I get what you're after,

554
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,479
but at least give him something decent to wear.

555
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,439
Must you play dirty?

556
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,149
We made sure it was something decent.

557
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,569
Anyway, we don't have time for this.

558
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,649
Hey. Hyun Soo, listen.

559
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,779
Don't say anything until you're in court.

560
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,859
Aren't you coming with me?

561
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,658
I'll get there myself, so stay energized.

562
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:04,279
It'll be all right, okay?

563
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,538
- Over here! - Do you have anything to say?

564
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:08,499
- Why did you kill her? - Do you feel remorse?

565
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,038
- Please say a few words. - Over here!

566
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,749
- Wait. - Hold on.

567
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,669
- Any words? - How do you feel right now?

568
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,090
- Please say a few words. - How do you feel?

569
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,799
- Why did you do it? - Any words?

570
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,589
- Please say a few words. - Over here!

571
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,799
- Just a second. - Wait!

572
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,219
- How do you feel right now? - Why did you do it?

573
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,888
Do you admit to the charges?

574
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:29,678
Please say a few words!

575
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,230
Don't you have anything to say?

576
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:32,980
Please say a few words!

577
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,400
A few words will do.

578
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,030
Are you good?

579
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,570
Hey, sit back and be quiet.

580
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,159
Come on. Let's get moving!

581
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:50,909
I'll get going.

582
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,559
Mom, the police are here. What do we do?

583
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:10,639
(Police)

584
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:13,809
What is this about?

585
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,440
Here's a search and seizure warrant.

586
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,530
Excuse us then. Come on!

587
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,860
But...

588
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,820
Hurry on inside.

589
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:27,908
Each take a room...

590
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:29,119
and someone pack this dresser.

591
00:41:29,369 --> 00:41:30,369
Search the trash as well.

592
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:31,369
Yes, sir.

593
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,289
Hold on.

594
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,170
No, don't.

595
00:41:35,171 --> 00:41:38,249
- There's nothing there. - Collect prescription drugs...

596
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,339
and the hard drive from tablets, laptops, and desktops.

597
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,510
- Yes, sir. - Hey, that's mine!

598
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,638
Goodness. I apologize.

599
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,049
But that's mine!

600
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,638
How am I supposed to study?

601
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,639
Dad, tell them to stop!

602
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:30,969
(Yangjae)

603
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,130
(Way Out)

604
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:10,929
(Claims that he's innocent, Didn't try to destroy evidence)

605
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:26,239
(Only circumstantial evidence)

606
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:56,479
(Fingerprints on the glass and the liquor bottle)

607
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,189
The suspect and victim's prints and bloodstains were found...

608
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,900
all over the scene.

609
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,230
The suspect had a knife covered with the victim's blood.

610
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:08,320
And...

611
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:11,699
we're still waiting for the results from the NFS lab,

612
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:15,369
but drugs were detected in his urine.

613
00:44:15,949 --> 00:44:19,408
Immediately after the incident, he was seen fleeing in a taxi.

614
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:20,869
(Suspect Fleeing the Scene)

615
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,670
Witness 1.

616
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,169
Yoo Seung Hoon, a neighbour.

617
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:27,210
He saw them at around 11pm.

618
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,969
Witness 2 is Ha No Seok.

619
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:32,639
He witnessed Kim Hyun Soo fleeing Hong Guk Hwa's home.

620
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,469
Kim Hyun Soo denies killing her...

621
00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:38,519
but has admitted to everything else.

622
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:41,059
So we don't have his confession that he killed her.

623
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,779
This wound on the victim's hand...

624
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,820
proves that the two of them had a fight.

625
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:51,319
And there's this.

626
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,360
(Attempt to Destroy Evidence)

627
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,449
He attempted to destroy evidence.

628
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,159
I think we have more than enough to indict him.

629
00:44:58,699 --> 00:44:59,960
Are you sure?

630
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,209
I can't be more confident.

631
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,039
It took you three seconds to say that.

632
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,380
Is something bothering you?

633
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,550
Well...

634
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:14,889
Maybe the fact that Kim Hyun Soo...

635
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:17,889
is just an ordinary college student with no prior.

636
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:21,690
Come on.

637
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:25,559
No one is born a murderer.

638
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,769
My point exactly.

639
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:28,860
If I lose this case...

640
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,988
What would be the reason?

641
00:45:31,989 --> 00:45:33,409
That won't happen.

642
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,320
This is strange.

643
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:43,000
This is so unlike you.

644
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:45,210
What makes you so sure?

645
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,340
(Prosecutor An Tae Hee)

646
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,670
Come in.

647
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:09,860
My goodness.

648
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,030
Long time no see, Prosecutor An.

649
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:25,539
My gosh. Indeed, it's been so long, Mr. Shin.

650
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:29,749
My goodness. You should get going. I'll be in touch.

651
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,840
All right.

652
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:33,840
Bye.

653
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,678
So? How's your foot?

654
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:40,429
The same.

655
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,309
Do you know a good doctor?

656
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:45,939
Look at this. It's not getting better.

657
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,019
My gosh.

658
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:20,050
The review of the warrant...

659
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,679
isn't done to determine whether or not you're guilty.

660
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:26,018
Right now, all they have is circumstantial evidence,

661
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:27,638
which isn't enough.

662
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,979
So the prosecutor has to investigate this further,

663
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,518
and the court needs to decide whether or not...

664
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:34,190
they'll keep you detained.

665
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,739
This shouldn't happen,

666
00:47:37,739 --> 00:47:40,320
but even if they decide to issue an arrest warrant,

667
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,530
don't worry too much.

668
00:47:42,949 --> 00:47:44,329
It doesn't mean it's over.

669
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,090
Where did you get it?

670
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:01,760
This...

671
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,599
Detective Park Sang Bum gave me this.

672
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:07,769
Really?

673
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,269
That's odd. That's out of his character.

674
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:15,400
- Please get ready. - Sure.

675
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,980
All rise.

676
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,900
(Court)

677
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,989
Please be seated.

678
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:09,909
Case Number 2021HJ235935.

679
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,170
The accused is Kim Hyun Soo. We will begin now.

680
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,130
Stand up and bow.

681
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,089
The accused may remain silent...

682
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,259
and may refuse to answer questions.

683
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,218
Even if you refuse to answer a question,

684
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:25,719
it will not be used against you.

685
00:49:26,139 --> 00:49:27,679
Mr. Kim, you may be seated.

686
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,730
Let's hear from the prosecution first.

687
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:34,440
Well...

688
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:37,610
This is a serious case.

689
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:44,569
There are 117 pieces of evidence,

690
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:46,530
which prove that the accused is guilty of the murder.

691
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:49,788
However, Mr. Kim is still denying the murder.

692
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,368
He resisted arrest.

693
00:49:51,369 --> 00:49:54,460
He tampered with the crime scene and tried to destroy evidence.

694
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:58,089
Furthermore, this is a serious crime...

695
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,210
that can result in the heaviest penalty,

696
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,170
so we're concerned he'd try to flee.

697
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,719
As you know, this case is all over the news at the moment,

698
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:09,849
so we believe that he should be isolated.

699
00:50:09,969 --> 00:50:11,889
Ergo, we request that he be detained.

700
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:27,320
Mr. Kim.

701
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:29,449
Yes, Your Honour.

702
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:34,369
Did you kill Ms. Hong Guk Hwa?

703
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:49,599
No.

704
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:52,059
I did not.

705
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:54,389
I...

706
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,519
We had a few drinks together,

707
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,190
and I fell asleep. When I woke up,

708
00:51:03,989 --> 00:51:06,149
I found her like that.

709
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,949
So you do not admit to the charges.

710
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:13,289
Correct.

711
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:17,710
Counsel.

712
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:22,340
Mr. Kim's situation isn't looking good.

713
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,139
Right.

714
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,349
That may be the case now.

715
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,519
However, the supplementary investigation...

716
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:40,650
will prove that Mr. Kim is not guilty.

717
00:51:41,019 --> 00:51:44,650
I believe that he should be released...

718
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,859
so he can be fully prepared for his trial.

719
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,779
Mr. Kim truly hopes...

720
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,288
to prove his innocence through the trial,

721
00:51:53,289 --> 00:51:54,999
so I can assure you...

722
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,619
that the prosecution needn't be concerned...

723
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,210
that he'd flee.

724
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:01,750
I see.

725
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,710
I will review everything carefully.

726
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,380
Your Honour.

727
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:13,050
Mr. Kim has been living an exemplary life.

728
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,929
He is a college student with a clean record.

729
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,899
The prosecution believes he should be indicted...

730
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,110
based on circumstantial evidence and the witnesses' statements,

731
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,769
but not a single person...

732
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,238
actually witnessed the murder.

733
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:29,780
I trust...

734
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:32,320
that you will make a wise decision, Your Honour.

735
00:52:32,869 --> 00:52:33,949
Your Honour.

736
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,829
The victim of this case...

737
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:45,090
is an innocent woman,

738
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,670
and she was stabbed 13 times.

739
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:56,468
I'd like to once again emphasize...

740
00:52:56,469 --> 00:52:58,349
the severity and the brutality of the crime.

741
00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:00,059
Okay.

742
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,650
I understand both points of view.

743
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:05,360
That concludes the hearing for the warrant validation.

744
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,570
Mr. Shin?

745
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:20,289
Are you sure about this case?

746
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,039
It's getting a lot of attention.

747
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,500
Being a lawyer and all, I shouldn't back out.

748
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,840
I'm concerned, that's all.

749
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,130
I appreciate your concern, Your Honour.

750
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,339
All right. I'll look forward to it then.

751
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,349
Sure.

752
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:42,019
Hyun...

753
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:56,780
How was it today?

754
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:58,698
Give me the scoop.

755
00:53:58,699 --> 00:54:00,078
Mind your own business.

756
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,209
How on earth can I? Just tell me how it was.

757

Kang Da Kyung.

758
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:07,879
That article you wrote...

759
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,880
was the same as a guilty verdict.

760
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:14,050
As a reporter, don't you have...

761
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,719
a sense of responsibility or a guilty conscience?

762
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,638
I feel bad too,

763
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:22,019
but others would've written it if I hadn't.

764
00:54:23,309 --> 00:54:24,309
Look.

765
00:54:24,769 --> 00:54:26,649
A girl as pretty as a movie star...

766
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:28,018
had a one-night stand...

767
00:54:28,019 --> 00:54:29,900
and was stabbed 13 times.

768
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,940
- Of course people are all over it. - Stop that.

769
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:34,530
Look for yourself.

770
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:36,199
How did it go?

771
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:39,948
Did the defendant plead guilty?

772
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:41,500
What did he say?

773
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:43,828
- How did it go? - Can you say a few words?

774
00:54:43,829 --> 00:54:45,169
- What are your predictions? - How will it go?

775
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,379
- Thank you, all. - Please say a few words.

776
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,170
She's having a field day.

777
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,919
- Ms. An, wait! - Hold on.

778
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,550
Ms. An, just a second.

779
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:27,869
How... did it go?

780
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:58,488
It wasn't me.

781
00:55:58,489 --> 00:55:59,659
I didn't do it.

782
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:03,659
I really didn't do it.

783
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:06,159
I didn't do this.

784
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,889
Shoot, goal in!

785
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,389
- Goal in! - Goal in!
