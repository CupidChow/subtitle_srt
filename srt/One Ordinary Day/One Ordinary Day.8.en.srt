00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,758
I'm curious though.

(Episode 8: An Ending)

8
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,520
Do you really believe that I didn't kill her?

9
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,100
Hong Guk Hwa, I mean.

10
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,079
What if I did though?

11
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,799
I don't care to know whether or not you killed her.

12
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,969
What I do know...

13
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,640
is what you're like in here. Nothing more or less.

14
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,869
You are Ms. Hong's stepfather and the only person...

15
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,540
with the right to inherit her assets.

16
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,539
- Correct. - When did you receive...

17
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,749
Ms. Hong's postmortem report?

18
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,128
(Witness)

19
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,840
Two days after her death. The NFS sent it to me.

20
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,259
Then you made an insurance claim right away on the same day...

21
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:13,969
to get the payout.

22
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:16,389
I was in urgent need of money at the time.

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,310
I see. Immediately after her death,

24
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,978
you received an insurance payout of 700,000 dollars...

25
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:23,899
and took legal steps to inherit her assets and properties.

26
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,689
Her house is valued at five million dollars.

27
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,110
In less than five days after her death,

28
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,569
you put the house up for sale.

29
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,780
I understand what you're trying to get at,

30
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,449
but those who are alive must go on living.

31
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,250
Then,

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,879
when you heard that she had died,

33
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:50,009
were you sad? Or did your excitement outweigh it?

34
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,430
I'll be honest. There was a little bit of that,

35
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,639
but I'm not a total jerk.

36
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,280
On the day of the incident,

37
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,069
between 12 to 4am,

38
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,330
where were you? And what were you doing?

39
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:19,409
Do I have to answer this question?

40
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,620
Yes, I must hear your answer.

41
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,539
I was at a motel with my girlfriend.

42
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,419
I've already told the prosecutor.

43
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,089
Bring up the photo, please.

Hey, kiddo.

49
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,759
Look at his face. What a hot mess.

50
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,519
I see that you've become quite gutsy.

51
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:09,268
Must I look up at you?

52
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:10,610
Sit down, you little punk.

53
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,790
Leave something that you care about...

54
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,040
so I can save my face.

55
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,599
What do you want?

56
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,759
A hand or foot will do.

57
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,810
Your head will be even better.

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,160
You won't regret this, right?

59
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,589
I'll kindly disinfect this first.

60
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:52,709
What are you doing here?

61
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:56,250
What do you think?

62
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,379
Look what this punk did...

to my boy, Doo Sik.

64

65
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,980
What is this now? Aren't you embarrassed?

66
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,069
Hey, Song Baek Ho.

67
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,740
I get that you're a goon from who knows where,

68
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,329
but you'd better not cross the line.

69
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,930
Stay out of trouble.

70
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,730
Lie low and don't even let me hear you breathe.

71
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,779
This is ridiculous.

72
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:13,920
Kiddo.

73
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,459

As they say, whoever tied the knot must untie it.

77
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,679
From now on,

78
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:17,190
you'll have to watch your back.

79
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,230
Why?

80
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,980
That's just what thugs do.

81
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,950
They stab you in the back.

82
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:48,389
Counsel, you may examine the witness now.

83
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,639
Yes, Your Honour.

84
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,610
Mr. Kim.

85
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,398
Do you recognize the witness?

86
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,240
(Defendant)

87
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:13,700
What's the problem?

88
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:15,659
Then be on your way.

89
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,659
Yes.

90
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,749
We ran into him in front of her house that night.

91
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,500
Then by any chance,

92
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,009
is there anything you know about him?

93
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,758
No.

94
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,840
Mr. Yoo.

95
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,799
Why did you park in front of the victim's house that night?

96
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,139
Your place is over 1km away from her house,

97
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,309
and on top of that,

98
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:40,269
you had plenty of parking space right in front of your house.

99
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,229
(Witness)

100
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,519
I parked there to rest for a moment.

101
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,610
That's what I told the police.

102
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,449
You said you saw Mr. Kim and the victim...

103
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,789
at around 11pm that night.

104
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,959
But as you can see,

105
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,789
you didn't get home until about 12:20am,

106
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
so you had about an hour and 20 minutes.

107
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,549
What did you do during that time?

108
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,470
Nothing. I was just chilling in my car,

109
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,720
listening to music...

110
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:13,600
and playing some mobile games on my phone.

111
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,259
Is that so?

112
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,139
I see. But here is what's really strange.

113
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,649
This was two days before the incident.

114
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:24,610
Four days and even a week before her death,

115
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,110
you were lurking around her house.

116
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,240
Why were you there?

117
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,450
(Judge)

118
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,750
Okay. Let me ask you again.

119
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:43,789
During that 1 hour and 20 minutes...

120
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,460
on the day of her death,

121
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,169
what were you doing?

122
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,519
While stalking Ms. Hong,

123
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,099
you happened to see her going home with a guy.

124
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,559
Unable to control your anger,

125
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,570
you ended up killing her...

126
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,239
on the spur of the moment.

127
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,360
Objection, Your Honour.

128
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,869
Instead of focusing on proving Mr. Kim not guilty,

129
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,039
Counsel is trying to confuse the members of the jury...

130
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,579
by pinning the murder on the witness and making him look like a suspect.

131
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,459
(Judge)

132
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,840
I believe this argument is worth listening to.

133
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:31,799
Counsel, you may continue.

134
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,809
Mr. Yoo.

135
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,850
I need you to answer my question.

136
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:48,269
Darn it. This is so embarrassing.

137
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,440
Look.

138
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,990
To tell you the truth,

139
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,539
I wasn't interested in Hong Guk Hwa at all.

140
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,080
See that lady there? I liked Yoon Hyo Jung.

141
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,039
Sorry?

142
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,219
Besides, I was caught stalking her two weeks before that...

143
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,888
and was interrogated by the police.

144
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:22,179
As a result of it, I paid a fine.

145
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:29,109
(Defendant)

146
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,399
(Prosecution)

147
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,899
(Exhibit 3: Yoo Seung Hoon)

148
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:55,259
Mr. Yoo, have you been questioned by the police...

149
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,389
as a suspect in this murder case?

150
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,179
But I'm not a suspect.

151
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:02,889
I'm a witness.

152
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,350
Darn it.

153
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,970
Let's see.

154
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,679
Give me something.

155
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,970
Darn.

156
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:20,129
Go ahead.

157
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:22,549
I'm good.

158
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:30,750
If there are no more arguments to be made,

159
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,250
the prosecution will give a closing argument...

160
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,250
and request a sentence.

161
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,250
Counsel will also give a closing argument...

162
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,668
and the jury will decide on a verdict.

163
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:40,879
(Defendant)

164
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:44,379
Does the prosecution have any objections?

165
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
I do not, Your Honour.

166
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,308
Counsel?

167
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:51,179
(Defence)

168
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,899
I would like to summon a witness within precinct of court.

169
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,059
A witness within precinct of court.

170
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,649
Then he or she must be in the courtroom.

171
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,570
That's right.

172
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,409
Chief Park, how many years have you been a detective?

173
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,828
(Witness)

174
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,500
I've been in the Violent Crimes Unit for about 30 years.

175
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,880
The only suspect you looked into for this case...

176
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,589
was the defendant, right?

177
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,799
I see your intention.

178
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,670
Could you please...

179
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,220
answer my question?

180
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,089
That's right.

181
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,309
All the evidence pointed to the defendant.

182
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,150
The victim's roommate Yoon Hyo Jung.

183
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,939
A week before the incident, she left...

184
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,609
after arguing with the victim about her boyfriend.

185
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:48,028
Um Ki Jong provided drugs to the victim.

186
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:49,529
But neither of them were questioned.

187
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,239
The victim's stepfather Cho Kang Pil...

188
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,700
claimed a life insurance policy of 700,000 dollars...

189
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:56,789
and also received an inheritance of five million dollars.

190
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Meanwhile, delivery man Lee Chul Ho had similar priors,

191
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,709
knew the victim's residence, and had received...

192
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,130
a claim regarding a parcel.

193
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,508
He ran into them at the gas station...

194
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:07,629
and followed them to the Han River.

195
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,970
However, neither was investigated.

196
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,889
The same goes for Yoo Seung Hoon who stalked the victim's roommate.

197
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,180
Why not?

198
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,479
With heinous crimes such as this one...

199
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,519
where the victim was stabbed 13 times,

200
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,730
the investigation begins with those she knew...

201
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,400
or who had a personal grudge against her.

202
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,200
Is that not common sense?

203
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,250
A detective...

204
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:39,539
investigates his case by following the evidence.

205
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,539
And all the evidence in this murder case...

206
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,009
points to the defendant, Kim Hyun Soo.

207
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,130
Evidence.

208
00:18:49,589 --> 00:18:51,759
All you do is focus on the evidence.

209
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:53,349
Can you...

210
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:56,019
tell me what this is?

211
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,769
It's the evidence log.

212
00:18:59,349 --> 00:19:01,480
Normally, the evidence found at the scene...

213
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,359
should match the evidence listed on this sheet.

214
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:05,859
That's right.

215
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:12,529
That is the defendant's nebulizer. His asthma inhaler.

216
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,779
Do you recognize it?

217
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:18,788
- I do. - But it's weird though.

218
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:20,328
(Exhibit 9: Defendant's Inhaler)

219
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:23,670
There's a photo of an inhaler that was spotted on the scene,

220
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,299
but here...

221
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,588
(Evidence Log)

222
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:32,759
I'm curious as to why it is not on this list of evidence.

223
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,140
Why?

224
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:38,729
(Exhibit 9: Defendant's Inhaler)

225
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,730
Mr. Kim,

226
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:42,650
where did you get your inhaler that night?

227
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,579
While I was in lockup,

228
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,329
he gave it to me.

229
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
Chief Park, is this true?

230
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,380
Yes.

231
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,429
You gave him back...

232
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,180
the only evidence found at the scene that belonged to the defendant.

233
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,849
I honestly don't get why, so enlighten me.

234
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:27,818
It seemed like he was having a hard time.

235
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,278
If you were that worried, you should've gotten him medicine...

236
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,900
or sent him to a hospital.

237
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:35,200
A detective in violent crimes with 30 years under his belt.

238
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,200
You say you conduct investigations solely based on the evidence,

239
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,578
but not only did you remove...

240
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,210
this key piece of evidence from the scene,

241
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,169
but you also returned it to your one and only suspect.

242
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,539
How does that make sense?

243
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,258
I concluded that his inhaler...

244
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,049
was not a key piece of evidence in this case.

245
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:56,549
Also,

246
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,179
the police is bound by the law to protect suspects' rights...

247
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,180
That wasn't it.

248
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,190
It wasn't.

249
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:10,029
My client...

250
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,779
is an innocent-looking young man in his 20s.

251
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,319
A college student with no priors who struggles with asthma.

252
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:19,868
In the eyes of a veteran detective with 30 years of experience,

253
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:22,538
he did not fit the profile of a rape and murder suspect.

254
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:24,460
You removed this inhaler...

255
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,500
since it did not fit the picture you drew.

256
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
This is an illegal misconduct...

257
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,049
which deems this evidence inadmissible.

258
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:38,719
Chief Park, the lead detective on the case,

259
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,519
targeted my client as a suspect before investigating the evidence.

260
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,979
Any evidence that goes against his theory...

261
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,268
were ignored and disregarded.

262
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,269
The case was designed to target only my client.

263
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,190
It might not be a singular incident.

264
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,778
There may well be other evidence...

265
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,779
that were disregarded just like this inhaler.

266
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,450
As a member of the judicial community,

267
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,409
I am deeply worried about this type of habitual misconduct.

268
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,210
Since the prosecution...

269
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,419
moved to indict my client based on this evidence,

270
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,088
I must now doubt...

271
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:11,798
whether or not they also followed proper procedure.

272
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,880
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

273
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,220
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

274
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,549
Is there a reason...

275
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:23,769
for this trial to even continue?

276
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,519
That'll be all.

277
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:36,739
(Judge)

278
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,740
Now,

279
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:41,700
the prosecutor will give her final statement.

280
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,009
The police investigation...

281
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:03,390
was indeed insufficient.

282
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:07,480
I also admit that there were more suspects...

283
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:09,099
besides the defendant.

284
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,940
However, that does not mean...

285
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,690
we should overlook the facts of this case that were presented.

286
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,279
The fact that the victim was brutally murdered.

287
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,910
The fact that the defendant...

288
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,170
was at the scene when she died.

289
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:33,078
The fact that...

290
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,630
there is no evidence to suggest a third person at the house.

291
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,640
The fact that he was covered in her blood.

292
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,099
He did not call for help,

293
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,930
but decided to destroy evidence.

294
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,390
And most importantly,

295
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,940
after fleeing the scene,

296
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,359
a knife with her blood on it was found on his person.

297
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,910
It does not get any clearer than this.

298
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,079
So the prosecution...

299
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:15,130
will take the heinous nature of this crime into account...

300
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,669
and show no mercy to the defendant...

301
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,170
who claims his innocence and pretends not to remember.

302
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,930
We hereby request...

303
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,470
the death penalty.

304
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,268
(Defence)

305
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:35,359
(Judge)

306
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,980
Darn it.

307
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,170
Your ruling comes out tomorrow, right?

308
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,210
Yes.

309
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,430
This isn't the place for you.

310
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,390
I hope I never see you again.

311
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,309
The detective in charge of... No.

312
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,189
Chief Park Sang Bum, who spearheaded this investigation...

313
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,568
Um Ki Jong, Yoon Hyo Jung, Lee Chul Ho.

314
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,899
Even though there were a number of suspects...

315
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,699
Based on circumstantial evidence and speculations...

316
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,779
No, this won't do.

317
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,659
The Constitution of the Republic of Korea...

318
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,950
states that everyone is innocent until proven guilty.

319
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,578
Without conclusive evidence...

320
00:26:57,579 --> 00:26:59,999
Without irrefutable, definite evidence...

321
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,670
The prosecution must present irrefutable... Gosh.

322
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:07,920
Darn it.

323
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,420
Gosh, seriously...

324
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,839
Darn it.

325
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,549
Gosh.

326
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,980
Goodness.

327
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:47,519
My gosh.

328
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,200
Darn it.

329
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:18,430
(Supreme Court of Korea)

330
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,940
(Jury)

331
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:34,450
I look a mess today.

332
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,119
I thought long and hard whether it'd be okay for me...

333
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,289
to be here today, looking like this.

334
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:47,380
According to my doctor, this is triggered by extreme stress.

335
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,750
And it's true.

336
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:58,089
I've never worked on such a big case before.

337
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,390
You see, I am an attorney.

338
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:09,519
However, I do not belong here.

339
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,319
I'm a so-called third-rate lawyer...

340
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,700
who specializes in petty cases.

341
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,160
I handle...

342
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,579
over 365 cases in a year.

343
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,960
Over the course of my 20-year career as a lawyer,

344
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,299
I have dealt with thousands of criminals.

345
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,380
So I have...

346
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:40,009
gotten to a point where I can just tell...

347
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,179
whether someone's guilty the moment I see them.

348
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,689
(Defendant)

349
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,769
So what did I think...

350
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,400
the moment...

351
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,900
I first met Mr. Kim, who is sitting over there?

352
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,990
I took one look at him and could instinctively tell...

353
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,789
that he was innocent.

354
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:09,079
The kind eyes.

355
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,039
And the humble, polite demeanour.

356
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,799
A college student in his 20s,

357
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,880
who was busy studying, dating,

358
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:19,720
and looking for a job. Just an ordinary college student.

359
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,799
And an ordinary young man.

360
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:23,680
And this young man...

361
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,180
has been insisting that he is innocent...

362
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,980
since day one.

363
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:31,859
Of course,

364
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,400
I wouldn't say he is completely innocent.

365
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,068
He drove his father's taxi without permission...

366
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,660
to go meet up with his friends.

367
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:45,700
He took drugs given to him by a woman he had never met before.

368
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:48,868
And upon finding the victim dead, he fled the scene...

369
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:50,210
without even calling an ambulance.

370
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:53,130
Flustered, he even tampered with the evidence at scene,

371
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,509
then drove before the alcohol and drugs...

372
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,130
wore off.

373
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,180
These are the offences that Mr. Kim committed.

374
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,890
He did not do anything else.

375
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:12,650
And there is no evidence that he killed the victim, Ms. Hong.

376
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,819
The evidence that the prosecution has presented so far...

377
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,650
is all circumstantial and based on speculations.

378
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:22,950
The police detective who spearheaded the investigation...

379
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,699
removed a piece of evidence from the crime scene.

380
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,038
He did not question other suspects at all because he had Mr. Kim...

381
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:30,960
pinned down as the prime suspect from the get-go.

382
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,250
So as a result,

383
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:37,299
Mr. Kim fell victim to the police's targeted investigation...

384
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:40,880
conducted with a clear goal in mind.

385
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:44,470
He has lost his freedom,

386
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,509
and no one trusts him anymore.

387
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:49,599
Along with that, he has also lost hope.

388
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:54,230
However, there is one thing he hasn't lost and can still claim.

389
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,069
Be it a suspect, perpetrator, or a defendant.

390
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,410
No one should be presumed guilty...

391
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:06,779
until there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

392
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:09,410
That's right.

393
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,369
As stated in the Constitution of the Republic of Korea,

394
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:16,630
everyone shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

395
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,380
Unless the prosecution can present...

396
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,919
irrefutable, conclusive evidence...

397
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,640
in this courtroom that Mr. Kim indeed committed the murder,

398
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,509
he should be found...

399
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:33,559
not guilty.

400
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:38,230
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

401
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,900
That young man's future...

402
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,779
depends...

403
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:51,119
on your decision.

404
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,880
I rest my case.

405
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,739
The jury will now have a discussion.

406
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,489
The court will announce the verdict once a decision is reached.

407
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,340
(Please keep quiet.)

408
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,840
(Jury)

409
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,940
The jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict.

410
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,610
In a jury trial,

411
00:35:47,989 --> 00:35:50,280
a majority verdict is permitted...

412
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,119
when an unanimous verdict cannot be reached.

413
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,078
(Judge)

414
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,710
Four voted for guilty, and five voted for not guilty.

415
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,630
Hence, based on this,

416
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,760
the jury decided on a not guilty verdict.

417
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,889
However, the jury's decision...

418
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,639
is only taken into consideration.

419
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:18,730
The court decides whether or not the accused is guilty.

420
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:23,099
Mr. Kim.

421
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,780
If there is anything you'd like to say, please go ahead.

422
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,159
(Supreme Court of Korea)

423
00:36:56,929 --> 00:36:58,179
Do you still believe...

424
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,400
that I killed her?

425
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,730
Because...

426
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,110
I was with Guk Hwa that night?

427
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:20,829
When I think about Guk Hwa,

428
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,369
I do feel terrible.

429
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,090
But...

430
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,719
am I the killer?

431
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,519
I'm not sure.

432
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:05,250
Then I will now announce the court's decision.

433
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:09,750
The court...

434
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,260
has carefully reviewed the counsel's arguments...

435
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,179
regarding the lack of definite evidence,

436
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,549
the police's inadequate investigation,

437
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,349
and the evidence that could be deemed inadmissible.

438
00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:22,809
However, the court has concluded that the investigation...

439
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:25,599
and the indictment were sufficient and reasonable...

440
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
and that Mr. Kim is objectively guilty...

441
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,269
of the charges brought against him.

442
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,610
Ergo,

443
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,819
the court has concluded that Mr. Kim is guilty...

444
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,659
of most of the charges brought against him...

445
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:41,030
and that Mr. Kim is guilty...

446
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,829
of Ms. Hong Guk Hwa's murder.

447
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,999
Since he still insists that he does not remember anything...

448
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,420
and is showing no remorse,

449
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,840
the court hereby sentences him...

450
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,550
to life imprisonment.

451
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,780

so don't you worry.

455
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,869
Since the majority of the jury ruled in your favour,

456
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:13,869
an appeal...

457
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,369
could work.

458
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,210

459
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,929

Have a safe trip back.

462
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,480
What do you mean by that? Hyun Soo...

463
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,610
Hyun Soo!

468

without money, power, or connections.

469

It's a million miles away.

470
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:32,739
