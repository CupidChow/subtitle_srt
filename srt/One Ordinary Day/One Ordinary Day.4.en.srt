At least tell me the reason.

A polygraph?

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,389
Even if we request one right away,

20
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,889
we'll have to wait at least two weeks to get it done.

21

I can take care of that.

What do you say? I don't think anything bad will come out of it.

23
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,568
If Kim Hyun Soo refuses to take it,

24
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:27,149
it'll help us prove him guilty at the trial.

25
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,399
Even if the results say he's not lying,

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,240
it's not admissible as evidence.

27
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,990
If it says he's lying, it'll totally help us out.

28
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:37,659
That's true.

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,460

is the killer, right?

I lost my temper and hit her a couple of times.

59

Then this crazy witch lost her mind and lashed out at me.

60
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,629
So I gave her more beatings.

61
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,920
I'd had a drink or two, so I was a little drunk.

There's plenty of evidence,

71

but you say you don't remember a thing.

72

This must be awfully frustrating for you.

If you're indicted now, there is no hope for you.

You'll be charged with rape, special assault, and murder.

Such a brutal murder, but you show no remorse.

I guarantee you.

It'll be very hard for you to escape a life sentence.

Additional five years for assault causing bodily harm...

82
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,310
and the fact that she's a minor.

83

and the habeas corpus proceedings.

87
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,659
A half-year for the 1st trial, so that's 30,000 dollars.

88
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,828
But you'll be convicted without a doubt,

89
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:27,829
and the appeal proceedings will cost 50,000 dollars.

90
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,369
You're showing no remorse whatsoever, so this will end up...

in the Supreme Court.

92
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:33,999
Then I'll have to add another 100,000 dollars.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,588
And another 50,000 dollars to compensate the victim...

94

and settle the case...

95

How much is this? Round it up. Let's count the zeroes.

96
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,850
It comes to 183,000 dollars, plus tax.

97

Let's make it 200,000 dollars, to keep it simple.

98
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,639
- What? 200,000? - Yes, exactly 200,000 dollars.

Yes. See the bank account number?

Is there a trash can here?

109

Where? Is there no trash can here?

110

So? Are you going to take it on?

My goodness. Since when were you so picky?

114
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,700
I am picky.

115
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,080
There is a way.

116
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:54,960
What do you say? A polygraph test.

117
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,999
You're claiming that you don't remember anything,

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,629
but we find it hard to believe.

119

And it seems like you need something to back up your claim with.

120
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,299
You'll have a hard time in jail.

121

Rapists and murderers are treated the worst.

122
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,350
Polygraph evidence is not admissible in court.

123
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,480
But if it shows that what you're claiming is true,

124
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,610
you can use it to change public opinion.

125
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,529
Then you'll have an easier time in jail,

126
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,409
and it'll make your parents happy.

127

Go to the NFS and meet with Kim Hyun Soo.

Give warning with words he can't hold you to.

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
Yes, Ms. Park.

When it's released to her next of kin today,

169
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,559
she will be cremated without a funeral.

170
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,360
You haven't seen her since that night, right?

171
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,909
I could arrange for you to say goodbye.

Actually honey, that's not why I called.

177
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:50,878
Isn't it about time you stopped calling me "honey"?

178

It's been five years since the divorce.

179
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:56,090
What should I call you then? Darling?

180
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,679
Or maybe you'd prefer Doctor Hong Jung A.

181
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,850
Just tell me why you called, Lawyer Shin Joong Han.

182
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,558
Well, I'm actually outside the NFS.

183
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,599
What for?

184
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,769
As if you need to ask. I miss you, of course.

185

00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,509
Thank you.

192
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,178
You must be desperate to have called me.

193
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,389
There's no one else who can get me in this place.

194
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,689
- Let's go in for now. - Stop this.

195

- Well... - Stop.

196
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,019
Stop it!

197
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,919
You must know that there was an autopsy.

198
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:01,629
Her head, chest, and stomach.

199
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:06,679
She was opened up, and her organs were removed.

Thanks, honey.

230
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:25,048
Mr. Kim, you will be asked 11 questions...

231
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:27,798
and only six of them will be about the case.

232
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,338
Whether the test deems you lying or not...

233
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:32,338
depends on your mental state,

234
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,719
so it's most important to stay calm.

235
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
Do you understand?

236
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,230
Yes.

237
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,690
Okay?

238
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:55,579
For after the test.

239
00:19:58,369 --> 00:19:59,369
Right.

241
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:14,508
Place it in his line of sight.

242
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:17,890
At arm's length, most preferably.

243
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,980
It drives me crazier...

244
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,700
when I don't have my lighter, not when I run out of cigarettes.

Yes.

Did you rape Hong Guk Hwa, the victim?

253

No, I didn't.

254

Did you stab Hong Guk Hwa?

255

No, I didn't.

256
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:58,450

No.

258
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,210
How could I feel that way when I didn't kill her?

259
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,589
Please stick to yes or no.

260
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:14,839
No.

261
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,069
That night, you were drunk with a blood alcohol level of 0.12,

262
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:38,529
and you may have a tendency to violence you didn't know about.

263
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:41,619
So can you be sure you didn't kill her?

264
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:45,579
What?

265
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:48,289
Can you be sure...

266
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,579
that you didn't kill Hong Guk Hwa?

267
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,470
Yes.

268
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:03,220
Questions that imply he's guilty shouldn't be asked.

- Yes. - Unbelievable.

tell the examiner yourself.

refuse to take this test.

Did you rape Hong Guk Hwa, the victim?

Kim Hyun Soo is claiming his innocence...

446
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:45,308
and until that is proven,

447
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:47,178
he hopes to be on trial...

448
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:49,099
protected by the rights guaranteed by the constitution.

449
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,599
Let me tell you this.

450
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,609
The suspect is no flight risk,

451
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,149
has no priors,

452
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,689
and was a hard-working college student...

453
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,949
up until recent events took place.

454
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,328
However, he is now being forced to live among heinous criminals...

455
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:05,199
in a correctional facility...

456
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:08,829
when he has not been found guilty of this crime.

That is all.

462
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,670
The prosecution, would you like to add on to that?

463
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,420
Those bruises all over your body.

464
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,260
What caused them?

465
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:08,599
According to the correctional facility,

466
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,649
you suffered a beating...

467
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,570
while being arrested after you tried to leave without permission.

468
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,860
Is this true?

469
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,819
That's because one of my cellmates...

470
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,908
Are you stating...

471
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:27,369
that the correctional facility lied about what happened?

472
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:33,460
No, that is true but...

473
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,880
But I wasn't thinking straight at that moment.

474
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:42,300
Is that how you act when you're not thinking straight?

475
00:41:42,469 --> 00:41:45,679
No, of course not. I...

476
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:48,138
That was how you were when you killed Ms. Hong.

477
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,679
You were intoxicated from alcohol.

478
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:52,480
No... No.

479
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:56,610
Your Honour, the prosecution is blatantly leading the suspect.

480
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,480
Please refrain from it.

481
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,190
Yes, Your Honour.

482
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,199
Mr. Kim,

483
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:11,198
you also refused a lie detector test.

484
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,078
Yes, but that's...

485
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,079
Your Honour,

486
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,339
Mr. Kim has asthma...

487
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,420
and is medically unfit to go under a PDD test.

488
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,509
(Court)

489
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,679
Please continue.

490
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:31,010
Right this moment,

491
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:33,888
there are 117 exhibits in the evidence log...

492
00:42:33,889 --> 00:42:36,849
that can prove the suspect's crime...

493
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:38,309
and all of them...

494
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:41,400
point to Kim Hyun Soo as the suspect.

495
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,989
The defence is arguing...

496
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,489
that the suspect is no flight risk,

497
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,159
but he recently tried to leave prison without permission.

498
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:53,789

I am a judge whose priority is to serve the public,

will be beneficial toward social stability.

00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:38,509
but I am 100 percent sure that it'll come back positive.

667
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:40,379
(Advanced Correctional Practice)

668
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,760
The situation is bad. You know that better than anyone else does.

669
00:57:47,889 --> 00:57:49,099
Still...

670
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:53,940
I can't say I did something that I didn't do.

671
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:55,809
Hyun Soo.

672
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:59,570
Let me advise you as a legal expert.

673
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:03,239
It'll be very hard for you to escape a life sentence.

674
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,119
You could be sentenced to death.

675
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:15,750
Let's settle for ten years.

676
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:18,038
If you're a model inmate and stay on your best behaviour,

677
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:19,840
you'll be released 3 or 4 years early,

678
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,799
which means you can re-enter society...

679
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,469
when you're around 30.

680
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,639
Hyun Soo, it wasn't easy to strike a deal with the prosecution.

681
00:58:31,059 --> 00:58:34,519
And I truly believe that this is the best solution for you.

682
00:58:48,699 --> 00:58:51,949
One, two, three, four, five,

683
00:58:52,289 --> 00:58:53,709
six, seven, eight...

684
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:55,329
It'll be ten years.

685
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:58,920
No appeal, and he'll have to confess.

686
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,050
Hyun Soo will confess to the crime?

687
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,800
- Yes. - Seriously?

688
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,349
Yes.

689
00:59:11,309 --> 00:59:12,849
Hyun Soo will confess?

690
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:20,769
Hyun Soo.

691
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,780
Here.

692
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,118
You put in more.

693
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,238
You can't win me over with chump change. Take this back.

694
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:36,000
No, please think of it as a bonus.

695
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:40,920
All right, then.

696
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,670
When is it?

697
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:47,760
The hearing.

698
00:59:47,929 --> 00:59:50,138
(Corrections)

699
00:59:50,139 --> 00:59:52,559
- What was that? - Pass it over.

700
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:54,349
- Goodness. - Come on.

701
00:59:54,769 --> 00:59:56,939
- Hey. - Pass!

702
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,480
- Hurry! - Hey! Darn it.

703
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,610
Behind you.

704
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:06,150
- Hey, over here! - Good. Throw it.

705
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,949
Ten years?

706
01:00:14,289 --> 01:00:16,328
I really don't understand.

707
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:18,829
If Hong Guk Hwa is considered responsible in any way,

708
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:21,289
things will get very messy.

709
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,839
This way, we can close the case with Kim Hyun Soo's confession,

710
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,969
so it'll be simple and clean.

711
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:35,429
I am 100 percent certain that Kim Hyun Soo is the killer.

712
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:37,980
He deserves a life sentence at the very least.

713
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,150
I've made myself clear that I am strongly against this.

714
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:07,760
A plea bargain.

715
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:11,090
That's not offered to just anyone.

716
01:01:12,219 --> 01:01:15,010
Those are illegally traded...

717
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:17,679
when there's no definitive evidence or confession.

718
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:20,190
It's why turning it down...

719
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:23,980
will make the prosecution go for a heavier sentence.

720
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:26,650
Because you provoked them.

721
01:01:42,039 --> 01:01:43,829
Don't pass up on this opportunity.

722
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,300
Prepare for lights out!

723
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:07,320
(Live a Healthier Life)

(03-Lower 8)

725
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:48,940
Is there no other way?

726
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,900
Hyun Soo,

727
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,280
this is your best option. You know that.

728
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:57,570
Right.

729
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:01,828
Now that you've made up your mind,

730
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:03,619
let's end this smoothly.

731
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,550
We're done here!

732
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,300
Check on him and get confirmation.

733
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:20,139
Yes, Ms. Park.

734
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,480
Ms. Seo,

735
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:39,239
let me join you.

736
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:41,030
With what?

737
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,719
Ms. Park is right.

738
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:57,759
A sentence of ten years with model behaviour?

739
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,300
Three to four years will be shed off.

740
01:04:00,219 --> 01:04:01,599
You'll be out at around 30...

741
01:04:01,849 --> 01:04:03,269
and live a new life.

742
01:04:03,849 --> 01:04:05,429
It's a fantastic deal.

743
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:11,980
That's how any lawyer would assess this situation.

744
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,780
Gosh. The hardships...

745
01:04:16,949 --> 01:04:18,949
must make you want to give up.

746
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:23,739
But look at this.

747
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,210
Even atopic dermatitis haunts you all your life,

748
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:30,500
so being branded as an ex-con?

749
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,210
You'll never be free of that.

750
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:36,630
Never.

751
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:45,849
Then,

752
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:49,389
what would you do if you were in my place?

753
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:53,570
Me?

754
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,489
Well...

755
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:01,699
I'd ask myself...

756
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:05,289
if I killed her.

757
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,539
If I'm really the one who murdered Hong Guk Hwa.

758
01:05:24,139 --> 01:05:25,929
Before the trial begins,

759
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:28,428
I see we have something to address.

760
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:29,940
(Defendant)

761
01:05:30,139 --> 01:05:32,808
The defendant wishes to take this opportunity...

762
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:35,730
to confess to the crime in exchange for a plea deal.

763
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:37,780
Is this true?

764
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:43,239
Yes.

765
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:45,909
When making this decision,

766
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:48,999
were you pressured or were procedures improperly followed?

767
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,460
(Defendant)

768
01:05:51,579 --> 01:05:53,829
(Defence)

769
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,840
No.

770
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:00,670
Then we shall begin.

771
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,718
The defendant will rise.

772
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:04,468
Prosecution, proceed.

773
01:06:04,469 --> 01:06:08,598
(Court)

774
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:09,599
Mr. Kim.

775
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:15,230
Are you standing here today...

776
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,518
to confess to your crime...

777
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,899
and ask for leniency with your sentence?

778
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,948
As his legal representative,

779
01:06:21,949 --> 01:06:23,860
I will answer in his place.

780
01:06:24,409 --> 01:06:25,409
Yes.

781
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,408
Once you confess and plead guilty,

782
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:34,209
you lose your right to cross-examination...

783
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,339
and the summoning of witnesses on your behalf. Do you understand?

784
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,799
Yes. I explained to him at length,

785
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,420
and he understands.

786
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:44,929
Are you also aware that you lose the right to appeal?

787
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,260
Yes.

788
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:56,440
Then tell us.

789
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,440
What happened...

790
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:02,610
that night?

791
01:07:10,579 --> 01:07:11,579
That night,

792
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:15,749
the defendant left his house, took his father's taxi,

793
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,170
and drove to the house his friends were at.

794
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,839
He is uncertain of the time and location,

795
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,799
but when he was parked after getting lost on the road,

796
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,379
the victim got in the car.

797
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:26,799
He drove them to the Han River where they chatted.

798
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,218
After hitting it off, they went to her house to drink.

799
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:32,719
They played the knife game and had sexual intercourse.

800
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:53,119
Defendant?

801
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:56,039
Defendant!

802
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,000
Yes?

803
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,919
(Court)

804
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,969
I will ask the defendant one last time.

805
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,300
Did you...

806
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:12,429
kill Hong Guk Hwa?

807
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:22,859
No.

808
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,319
Hyun Soo, we had a deal. Come on.

809
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:35,328
Your Honour, it seems as though...

810
01:08:35,329 --> 01:08:38,038
that the defendant didn't quite understand you.

811
01:08:38,039 --> 01:08:40,420
Could you please repeat your question?

812
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:47,670
Defendant.

813
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:53,350
Did you kill Hong Guk Hwa?

814
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:55,600
(Defence)

815
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:29,220
No.

816
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:33,090
I didn't kill her.
