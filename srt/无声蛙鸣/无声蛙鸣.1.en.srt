- Ah, yes. Thank you very much.

- Great.
- Thank you.

185
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,766

- Did you try that restaurant?

186
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,809
Oh yeah! The food there was great.

187
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,370
- It really was. Yeah.
- I know, right?

188
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,248
Everyone goes to the one next to it,
but it's not the real deal. [laughs]

189
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,399
[guest 2] No wonder the food was good.

190
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,317
Can I call you a car?

191
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,902

I think you took a wrong turn somewhere.

226

I'll turn it around for you.

This place is even cleaner

It has a completely different vibe
from the cookie-cutter rentals in town.

347
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,593
Si-hyeon.

348
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,845
Ha Si-hyeon.

349
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,847
[Yeong-ha and Yong-chae laugh]

350
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,766
Time for dinner, Si-hyeon. Yeah?

351
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,310
Go to your mom, okay? Hmm? There we are.

352
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,562
[Yong-chae sighs, laughs]

353
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,022
Be careful! [groans]

354
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,361
[sighs] They got the weather wrong
on the broadcast.

355
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,238
Why don't you shower here?

356
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,364
Nah, nah.

357
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,952
I'll shower at home. [grunts, laughs]

358
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,870
[laughs]

359
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,043
[mysterious music playing]

360
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,509
[door closes]

361
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,309
LAKE VIEW MOTEL

362
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,519
[thunder rumbling]

363
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,117
[thunder rumbling]

364
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,809
[thunder rumbling]

365
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,781
Oh my gosh. Jeez.

366
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,492
Come on in.

367
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,954
[chuckles]

368
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,374
[guest wipes feet]

369
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,542
[Sang-jun sighs]

370
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,213
[Sang-jun] Wow!
It's really pouring out there. [laughs]

371
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,704
[guest] How much for one night?

372
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:54,052
A small is 30,000 won.
Large is 40. For one night, right?

373
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,178
Yeah.

374
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,141
[Sang-jun] Great.

375
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:12,153
[chuckles] A nice big suite.
You can watch the rain and relax.

376
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,324
I'd actually like a... second-floor suite.

377
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,249
[Sang-jun] Come in.

378
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,504
[sighs] It's a bit big
for one person, but...

379
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,630
[Sang-jun chuckles]

380
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,311
It's a great view of the lake.

381
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,983
No, that's okay. [chuckles]

382
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,236
If you like the room, stay here again.
I'll just leave the key right here.

383
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,405
Well, enjoy.

384
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,866
Uh, excuse me.

385
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,786
Is there a gas station near here?

386
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,789
It's a bit far,
but I'm sure they can deliver.

387
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,042
- Would you like that?
- No, that's okay.

388
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,271
Um, okay. Well, if you change your mind,
let me know. [chuckles]

389
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,963
You're very nice.

390
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,716
[chuckles] Good evening.

391
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,218
[mysterious music playing]

392
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,056
[chuckles]

393
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,153
[thunder rumbling]

394
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,501
[kettle whistling]

395
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,045
[footsteps approaching]

396
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,047
[door opens]

397
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,426
[Yong-chae groans]

398
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,805
It's been raining all day.

399
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,813
How's your guest?

400
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,066
[Yeong-ha] She'll call
if she needs something.

401
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,276
[Yong-chae] Young people these days,

402
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,946
they prefer
keeping to themselves on trips.

403
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,282
Those unmanned rentals
and motels are doing well.

404
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,539
Oh, the beer. [grunts]

405
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,668
[Yeong-ha slurping]

406
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,047
Here.

407
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,385
Thanks a lot.

408
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,137
You don't need to thank me.

409
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,140
[both slurp]

410
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,850
[Yong-chae sighs]

411
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,437
What does she do for work?

412
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,771
[sniffles] What?

413
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,066
I saw you talking to her for a bit.

414
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,528
I asked her about dinner.

415
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,992
I think she's in the arts.

416
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,453
Visual arts or music.

417
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,830
I'm good at sussing that out.

418
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,333
She has a similar vibe to your wife.

419
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,543
What are you saying?

420
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,880
I'm not sure if she's a single mother.

421
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,048
The boy said his father is away for work.

422
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,967
You're being such a nosey guy.

423
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,927
[laughs] Did you notice?

424
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,722
One look at this place, and she loved it.

425
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,640
It's a great place. Don't waste it.

426
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,309
I think it's perfect.

427
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:31,895
[Yeong-ha sniffles]

428
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,106
[inhales deeply]
I can't work on it on my own.

429
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,484
You think I don't?

430
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,152
[laughs, sniffles]

431
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,323
[Yong-chae sighs]

432
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,368
Your daughter? Coming this summer?

433
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,622
She said she's coming next week.

434
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,957
She's a good kid.

435
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,044
Look at my little stinkers! Never see me.

436
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,796
[both laugh]

437
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,130
[Yong-chae slurps]

438
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,466
In-laws, Yeong-ha? You and me?

439
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,051
[sighs]

440
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,886
Really, you and me?

441
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,346
[both laugh]

442
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,681
- Why not? Hmm?
- Don't be silly.

443
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,227
My second son Gyeong-mo is 30. In IT.

444
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,897
He's not that bad-looking.
And she'd gain an excellent father-in-law.

445
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,565
She's not marrying the father-in-law.

446
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,484
Look at the bigger picture.

447
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,486
Back in my day, I was very successful.

448
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,073
My kids only stay in touch
for all the money I've saved.

449
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,836
But I'd leave it all
to my daughter-in-law.

450
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,909
[Yeong-ha laughs]

451
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,536
Jeez. [chuckles]

452
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,038
- She's still too young.
- [laughs]

453
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,415
I'll see what she has to say.

454
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,459
I'm sure you will.

455
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,419
- Drink your beer.
- [laughs]

456
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,505
[both laugh]

457
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,091
[pensive music playing]

458
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,594
[Yong-chae] Tomorrow, I'll clean
this place up from top to bottom for you.

459
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,887
Including the pool!

460
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,974
[Yong-chae and Yeong-ha laugh]

461
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,518
[Yeong-ha] I wonder if the rain will stop.

462
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,603
[unsettling music playing]

463
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,785
[echoing water drip]

464
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,123
[groans]

465
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,001
[moans]

466
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,216
[moans]

467

[groans]

468
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,304
[sighs]

469
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,806
[tuts, sighs]

470
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,856
[groans]

471
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,025
- Hey.
- [Yong-chae groans]

472
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,819
- Sleep on the couch, yeah?
- [Yong-chae groans]

473
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,030

[Yeong-ha sighs]

478
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,186
[employee] Are these the ones
you were looking for?

479
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,232
- Thanks so much.
- [employee] You'll find more in aisle 8.

480
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,110
[indistinct chattering]

481
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,364
[phone buzzing]

482
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,701
Hey.

483
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,538
At the supermarket. [groans]

484
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,334
Next week? Of course you can.

485
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,543
No one's booked then.

486
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,590
Who are you bringing? A friend?

487
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,176
A man?

488
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,302
[sniffles]

489
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,721
Mm. Yeah, okay.

490
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,057
[disconnect tone]

491
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,977
A man? Jeez.

[Sang-jun groans]

496
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,420
- Hmm?
- Go home and rest.

497
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,504
Okay.

498
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,048
[Sang-jun moans]

499
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,634
Oh.

500
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,266
[indistinct chattering]

501
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,860
Ah! You're the newbie, huh?

502
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,530
Officer Yoon Bo-min reporting for, um...

503
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,136
- [officer 2] You gotta suck up a little.
- [officer 3] That's how you do it.

504
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,840
You have to keep being nice to them, yeah?

505
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,496
- Your cigarette, sir.
- Thank you.

506
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,708
[sighs]

507
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,351
- [officer 1] May I?
- [officer 2] Sure.

508
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,090
[Sang-jun groans] Nice and relaxing.

509
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,676
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

510
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,344
Can you make me some <i>ramyeon?</i>

511
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,846
If you pay for it, sir.

512
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,515
Ah, pay for it? Of course. Here.

513
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,104
Ugh, you...
I could knock you flat on your ass.

514
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,189
[chuckles]

515
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,776
Ah, this is nice.
