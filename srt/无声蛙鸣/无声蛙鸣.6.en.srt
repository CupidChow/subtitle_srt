00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,310
[woman 1] Thank you so much.

Was that your daughter?

191
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,661
Yeah.

192
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,541
That's nice that she calls.

193
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,087
My son... I wish he would call.

194
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,717
Are you not talking, or...

195
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,805
He's staying at his aunt's.

196
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,140
Well, for the time being, he is.

197
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,268
But I can't find her number anymore.

198
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,979

The other day...

202
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,364
a man, a psychopath, was there.

203
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,283
The other day?

204
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,958
Oh, about your son...

205
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,961
Uh, um, how old is he now?

206
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,632
He's 13 years old.

207
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,017
I run a motel as well, actually.

208
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,769
Oh yeah?

209
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,689
And, um...

210
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,109
a couple days ago...

211
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,029
a psychopath showed up there.

212
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,702
I haven't decided
what I'm going to do about it yet.

213
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,083
[Sang-jun] Don't trust anyone.

214
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,170
Be suspicious.

215
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,217
Pe... people aren't
gonna be there when it counts.

216
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,053
Like with Eun-gyeong and Gi-ho.

217
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,348
They probably won't give you
a second thought.

218
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,897
You wanna keep her safe, don't you?

219
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,191
Uh, I...

220
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,360

Do you want him dead?

224
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,260
That psychopath?

225
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,012
[Yeong-ha] What?

226
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,432
I'm not supposed to tell.

227
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,436
We're the same, though, so I gotta...

228
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,316
I know a man who can help you out.

229
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,860
Even if the psycho's in jail,

230
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,904
he can get him to come out and kill him

231
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,948
no matter where they are.

232
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,951
He said there's lots of ways to do it.

233
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,274
- What are you saying?
- "I'll kill him, Dad. I mean it."

234
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,039
- What?
- "I'm gonna kill Ji Hyang-cheol."

Look at what you did!
Look how upset she is, and I'm wrong?

You barge in here,
no explanation, and I'm wrong?

You can't be serious right now!

336

Oh, and this chair.

00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,057
He can sit right here, okay?

342
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,602

[Sang-jun] <i>Listen to your auntie.
Okay, buddy?</i>

544
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:24,946
<i>Mom and Dad are working.</i>

545
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,532
<i>But we'll get you soon, okay?</i>

546
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:30,702
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

547
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,080
<i>Once everything's taken care of,</i>

548
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,333
Dad's gonna...

549
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,756
I'm gonna...

550
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,318
[Sang-jun] You little shit! Come back!

551
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,063
- Where are you going, huh?
- Honey, honey!

552
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,553
[Sang-jun] Hey, Koo Gi-ho!

553
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,389
[crying]

554
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,434
[Sang-jun] <i>You're right!
All of it is on me!</i>

555
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,517
So where do you want me to start?
Should I say "sorry" for bringing us here?

556
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,898
Or even proposing to you,
what about that, huh?

557
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,817
I mean, can you tell me
where I made a mistake, huh?

558
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,235
[Eun-gyeong] Are you done?

559
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,615
[sobs]

560
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,622
I'm gonna...

561
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,045
take care of everything...

562
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,257
and get you, okay?

563
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,885
<i>So until then,</i>

564
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,721
<i>I need you to stay strong, buddy.</i>

565
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:35,266
<i>Your mom and dad miss you.
You know that, right?</i>

566
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:43,983
<i>Why do you sound...</i>

567
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,236
<i>why do you sound so down, champ?</i>

568
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,614
<i>Hey, what was that thing again?</i>

569
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:52,534
<i>Uh, that thing you wanted. The...</i>

570
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,703
<i>Oh, the game!</i>

571
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,415
<i>The game!</i> [sobs]

572
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,542
Of all the things...

573
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,045
[Sang-jun] <i>That... that game.</i>

574
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,881
<i>Dad's gonna get it for you.</i>

575
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,300
[Sang-jun sobs]

576
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:12,595
K... keep it a secret from Mom, okay?

577
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,765
[sobbing]

578
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,602
[Sang-jun crying]

579
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,235

[wistful music continues]

581

[music fades]

582
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,051
[Gi-ho] When I heard
that he was writing a memoir,

583
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,929
I got really pissed off.

584
00:57:57,265 --> 00:58:00,727
My mother... she's a victim of his too.

585
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:04,855
And my dad,

586
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,193
he's been stuck in that moment forever.

587
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:11,946
So that's when I decided.

588
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:16,326
<i>I went to see him and said,
"I'd like to publish your memoir."</i>

589
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,330
He gave me his ghostwriter's address, but...

590
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,751
[tender piano music playing]

591
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,461
...he was already dead when I...

592
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,090
Instead of calling it in, I...

593
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,304
I just grabbed
all of his letters and writings and left.

594
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,852
I just held up in this motel and...

595
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:45,980
read everything.

596
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:49,067
[sighs] Then I...

597
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,822
After reading the memoir, I felt weird.

598
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,408
It wasn't anger.

599
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,578
I don't know what I was feeling.

600
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,044
Ji Hyang-cheol was at peace

601
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,630
and was ready to leave behind
the shit he created.

602
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:13,799
I guess that

603
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,845
enough time had passed
that he could look back and reflect.

604
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,722
But I...

605
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,313
came out here with his letters, and...

606
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,364
I hadn't moved on at all.
That much was clear.

607
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,537
[tender piano music continues]

608
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,559
Give me those clothes.

609
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,062
Take a shower.

610
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,776
[tender piano music continues]

611
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,047
[music fades]

612
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,114
[Gi-ho] What are you doing?

613
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,868
You and me were drinking.

614
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,579
[uneasy music playing]

615
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,164
You had this planned, right?

616
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,209
You had an escape route.

617
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,462
You even have

618
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:16,964
an alibi.

619
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,842
What?

620
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,264
The empty cans in the sink.

621
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,851
We both got blackout drunk.

622
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,397
I came here to buy the motel off you.

623
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,900
I got your information from the realtor.

624
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,445
We met there,
came here, and started drinking.

625
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,657
We partied all night.

626
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,953
We woke up an hour ago.

627
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,958
Wait. I thought I was gonna get arrested.

628
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,635
Like I said, I'm not a cop.

629
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,346
But you never said that.
