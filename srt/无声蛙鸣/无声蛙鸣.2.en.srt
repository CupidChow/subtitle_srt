was just in my head.</i>

<i>Just</i>

373

[woman] Eun-gyeong,
can you get that delivery?

384

[Eun-gyeong] Say that again?

413
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,240
[Sang-jun] Let's close the motel.

[Sang-jun sighs]

415
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,749
It's been half a year already.

416

Let's just sell it and...

417
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,135
- [woman] What?
- [Sang-jun] Eun-gyeong.

418

- [Eun-gyeong sighs]

422

Gi-ho is gonna start junior high.
What are we supposed to do then, huh?

423
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,830
We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

424
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,695
I'm barely covering our expenses.

425
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,156
That's not even mentioning our debts.

426
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,243
Think we can get by
with what you're earning?

427
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,747
What? That hurt your pride?

428
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,292
- I threw mine away a long time ago.
- [sighs]

429
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,547
[Eun-gyeong] I always hear customers
whispering about me at the restaurant,

430
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,426
and I can say the same
about the other mothers at Gi-ho's school.

431
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,516
- Eun-gyeong.
- You think

432
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,478
that I've just been sitting here
waiting for you to sell the motel?

433
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,943
- Oh my. What do we do? What do we do?
- Shit!

434
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,153
[woman] Jong-du!

435
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,699
What did he even do, huh? Huh?

436
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,076
If he fucked up somehow, I'd get it.
I'd be all for it.

437
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,371
But seriously, why?
Does tearing him down make it easier, huh?

438
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,174
- Is that why you're...
- Back the fuck off!

439
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,168
Who the hell do you think you are, huh?
This is between me and her...

440

- [Jong-du] Stupid motherfucker!
- [grunts]

441
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,381
[woman] Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stop it! Don't! Quit it! I'm serious!

442
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,842
Stop it, you two!
If you don't, I'm gonna get mad!

- [Jong-du] You fucker.

446
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,724
- [Sang-jun] Oh, ma'am! Ma'am!
- Christ!

447
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,660
- [Sang-jun] Ma'am, are you okay?
- [woman moans]

448
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,604
- [Sang-jun] Jeez.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. It's fine.

449
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,439
Could you get any lower than this?

450
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:35,651
[woman] Sang-jun. Sang-jun.
Stop it, all right?

451
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:39,780
- Please stop. Sang-jun. Sang-jun!
- Shit.

452

- [woman] Sang-jun.
- [Sang-jun panting]

453
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,454
You're right! All of it is on me, huh?

454
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,456
So where do you want me to start, huh?

455
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,126
I should've seen that he was
a murderer that night, right?

456
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,880
No, actually, the whole motel
was a mistake from the start.

457
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,547
Wasn't it?

458
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,508
Should I say sorry for bringing us here?

459
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,428
Or even proposing to you.
What about that, huh?

460
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,806
I mean, can you tell me
where I made a mistake, huh?

461
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,727
[breathing heavily]

462
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,731
You're really something else, Eun-gyeong.

463
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,317
I'm in pain too.

464
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,653
I'm hurting here too.

465
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,156
It's not just you.
It's not just you! What?

466
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240

[officer 1] C'mon, Officer Yoon.

527
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,209
[realtor] Yeah, no one's expressed
an interest in buying it yet,

528
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,586
but we just gotta be patient.

529
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:32,216
I've been a realtor for a long time,
and if there's anything I've learned,

530
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,635
every place finds an owner.

531
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,261
Right.

532
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,014
[melancholy music playing]

533
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,976
[employee] Welcome.

534
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,979
- Welco...
- [guest 1] Oh, I'm starving.

535
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,192
[guest 2] Oh, that smells delicious.
That's Gi-ho's mom.

536
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,735
Did you hear about the motel?

537
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,072
- So this is where she's at now.
- [guest 1] I know, right? [laughs]

538
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,617
[task leader] Hey, new guy!

539
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,743
Yeah!

540
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,539
[exhales]

541
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,294
- [man] Careful. Got it?
- [Sang-jun] Yeah!

542
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,086
[man] Come on.

543
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,091
[forklift beeping]

544
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,721

546
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:24,852
[sighs]

547
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,606
[teacher] Then this changes, right?
Then what happens? It's a one, right?

548
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,233
Now, if we summarize this formula,

549
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:36,530
it's going to be x cubed y over xy...

550
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,823
[ticking echoes]

551
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,326
...then plus two x squared...

552
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,119
- [nervous breathing]
- [ticking echoes]

553
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,580
- [tense music playing]
- [students murmuring]

554
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,665
[teacher] Excuse me. What are you doing?

555
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,543
Okay, take a seat.

556
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,299
Okay, hey, hey! Pay attention!

557
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,053
[panting]

558
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,725
[tense music continues]

559
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,188

560
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:21,617
10502 KOO GI-HO

561
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,036

- [student 1] Wow, can't wait.

565
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,226
- Yeah, man.
- [student 3] That fuckin' rules.

566
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,353
Don't be late.

567
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,106
[student 1] Don't forget the booze.

568
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,692
[student 2 laughs]

569
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,154
- [panting]
- [tense music playing]

570
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,699
[bottles clinking]

571
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,376
[door slams]

572
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,380

574
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,971
[Bo-min sighs]

575
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,412
[door opens]

576
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,539
[Choi] We're back, Captain.

577
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,903
- Good work, guys.
- [Choi] Thanks for all your hard work.

578
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,502
Are you seriously knocked out, huh?

579
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,668
Go easy on him.
I think he had a pretty rough night.

580
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,758
- [Choi laughs]
- [woozily] How can I be of help?

581
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,886
[Choi] Can you please lock up the officer
sleeping at his desk?

582
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,013
Are you kidding me? Get up right now.

583
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,026
[groaning]

584
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,205

588
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,308
[man] <i>Hello, sir!</i>

589
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,645
Oh, hey. Almost here?

590
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,022
[daughter] <i>Hey, Dad.
We'll be there in about 30 minutes.</i>

591
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,692
[Yeong-ha] Sounds good. Looking forward
to seeing you and your parents, Ji-su.

592
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,862
Oh, for dinner.

593
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,949
Uh, should we do a barbecue or seafood?

594
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,385
- [Ji-su] <i>Either. They're not picky.</i>
- [daughter] <i>They're not?</i>

595
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,746
[Ji-su laughs] <i>And take it easy, sir.
I'll take care of everything.</i>

596
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,347
- Drive careful, then.
- [daughter] <i>Okay.</i>

597
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,415
Yeah.

[vehicle approaching]

607
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,499
Has it already been half an hour?

608
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,585
Wow, that was quick.

609
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,636
[engine idling]

H... how can I...

614
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,978
how can I assist you?
