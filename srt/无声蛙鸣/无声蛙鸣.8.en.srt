<i>I think she killed somebody.</i>

7
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,926
[Bo-min] You contacted Jeon Ui-seon
with Mr. Park's phone

8
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,846
and sent her a message
to get her to come. Am I correct?

9
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,105
You and the owner of the place
had some arguments, no?

10
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,901
So you changed up your plans.

11
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,032
Was assaulting and kidnapping his daughter
the end goal of that plan?

12
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,077
[sighs]

00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,301

I wonder who you killed.

16
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,227
I wonder where they are.

17
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,242
[Seong-a] What are you even talking about?

18
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,398
Shut your mouth.

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,195
I'd be out of a job
if this is all it took to put you away.

20
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,324
Even though you stabbed a man...

21
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,911
you were both hurt.

22
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,412
You'll claim self-defense.

23
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,582
You stole a cell phone

24
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,293
to lure a pregnant woman into the woods
and beat her.

25
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,212
She was pregnant?

26
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,634
You would've enjoyed it more
if you knew about it, huh?

27
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,803
[Seong-a chuckles]

28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,099
It was all just a coincidence, right?

[mysterious music playing]

30
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,352
Running when you saw police?

31
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,062
You were scared.

32
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,633
That's what you're gonna go with?

33
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,692
Why are you even holding me here?

34
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,945
I'm sure if you decide to keep quiet,

35
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,198
you'll get out
as soon as your attorney gets here.

36
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,699
Scot-free.

37
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,495
But if you did do something else
that was even worse,

38
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,664
I would keep your guard up.

39
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,000
[laughing]

40
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,462
Otherwise, it's just boring, isn't it?

41
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,382
[sighs] You're completely insane.

42
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,217
Wonder who you killed.

43
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,262
And where could you have put them?

44
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,640
Ah! The cornfield, right?

47
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,575
[lawyer] Not another word, Miss Yoo.

48
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,493
Get these cuffs off her.

49
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:28,124
Captain, I'll need a search party
at the cornfield immediately.

50

[chief] Everything's under control.
Right, good night, sir.

53
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,960
[disconnect tone]

54
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,921
Un-fucking-believable.

55
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,382
I've heard you've pulled
shit like this before, but...

56
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,259
I need a search team, sir.

57
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,468
[phone buzzing]

58
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,349
Are you kidding me right now?

59
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,226
I think that she killed somebody.

60
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,938
You're stepping way out of line.

61
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,315
If you're a chicken, I'll handle it.
Don't worry.

62
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,400
"Chicken"?

63
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,070
You little bitch.
What makes you think you have a lead?

66
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,801
Yoo Seong-a bought all this
at the supermarket yesterday.

67
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,179
Looks like she's trying
to get rid of a body to me,

68
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,390
and I heard she was burying something.

69
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,228
[unsettling music playing]

70
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,961
Okay, then.

71
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,592
But that's a different case, isn't it?

72
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,054
From the one
you brought her in for tonight, I mean.

73
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,809
Find the body that she buried first.

74
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,024
If we find nothing there,
I'll hand in my gun and badge.

75
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,907
Yeah, you should
because you jumped the gun on this.

76
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,492
But if we do find someone...

77
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,746
and we find evidence,

78
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,624
the person we had in custody
was the culprit.

79
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,504
And even though I had her
dead to rights, you let her go,

80
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,299
claiming that I jumped the gun
and made an illegal arrest.

81
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,094
That wouldn't bode well for you, huh?

82
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,556
Who'd turn in their badge then?

83
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,064
[door opens]

84
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,692
[man 1] She's here.

85
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,652
Captain.

88
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,965
Captain.

89
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,094
I, uh, just turned it in.

90
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,972
I brought in some more evidence
from the security camera.

91
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,099
I put my gloves on
before I handled the clothes.

92
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,561
So when I turned in the evidence,
it was still completely pristine.

93
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,897
I'm sure her lawyers are thrilled now.

94
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,025
- Sorry?
- Her ex-husband hit her the day before.

95
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,986
She was in the emergency room for it.

96
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,531
I'm gonna bet
that blood is probably her own.

97
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,952
Domestic abuse paired with
a history of mental illnesses...

98
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,997
She's got a real solid defense now.

99
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,672
- Wait, then, what... what?
- [engine starting]

100
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,091
Then what should...

101
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,930
[doctor] Her spleen ruptured,
so we performed emergency surgery.

102
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,432
The surgery went well.

103
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,101
She was unconscious
due to the drug in her system.

104
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,479
If we didn't catch it,
she would have gone into shock.

105
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,771
Did you say drug?

106
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,816
Yes, though she vomited
while she was still conscious.

107
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,570
I think she gave herself first aid
before losing consciousness.

108
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,614
And because of that, the baby survived.

109
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,532
I appreciate it.

110
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,867
Thank you.

111
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,717
[officer] What was the drug in her system?

112
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,333
[doctor] It's still inconclusive,
but we're waiting on results.

113
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,923
[Yeong-ha] She's asleep. Go on in.

just walk out of here.

Hey, Yeong-ha.

Have you never had your pipes freeze

Your name is Yeong-ha.

about all this stuff?

I'm so sick of the snow.

So how is it living back in the city
with Ui-seon?

Hmm, I'm not sure I like it.

443
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,849
- I'm just getting fat.

Anyway...

00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,063
Uh, there's just so much

446
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,273
to fix in here.

447

You have all the time in the world.

{\an8}Take it slow. There's no rush.

Like back then, you know?

450
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,407
No way. I called a contractor.

451
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,075
I'm not waiting.

452

My first station was right around here.

458
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,632
I was feeling a bit nostalgic.

459
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,552
I wanted to drive by the lake
and ended up lost.

460
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,388
Right.

461
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,267
Looks like you write.

462

I took a photo here too, actually.

463

Yeah.

470
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,572
It wasn't too hard
to figure out how it all went down,

471
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,741
the hospital visit...

472
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,330
I remember Park Jong-du and his mother
from over 20 years ago.

473
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,044
But not every secret has to be revealed.

474
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,296
They can just stay hidden.

475

at Mr. Jeon Yeong-ha's place,</i>

477

478
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,811
<i>Funny enough, a similar gun was used
to kill Ji Hyang-cheol,</i>

479

<i>but that trail went cold too.</i>

480
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,613
<i>And Yoo Seong-a's father,</i>

481
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,199
<i>who wanted the whole thing
to go away quietly,</i>

482
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:03,163
<i>even had his lawyer defend Jae-sik,
the man who killed his own daughter.</i>

483
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,916
As I'm sure you'd expect,
Director Yoo sent me.

484
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,549
[Bo-min] I suppose Mr. Jeon Yeong-ha,

485
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,552
who alone knows the whole truth,
is keeping it to himself

486
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,054
in order to protect someone.

487
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,149
Guess you haven't seen him
since then, have you?

488
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,742
Why are you letting this slide?

489
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,498
I don't wanna lose the killer

490
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,626
and then capture the frog.

491
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,340
Not my jurisdiction anyways.

00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,678
That's just like you.

[Gyeong-nam] One iced Americano,

taking a picture for us?

- [Gyeong-nam] Is this good?

509
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:44,259
[Yong-chae] It's doing much better
than the laundromat was.

It's like this was his true calling.

511

Look, he's big-time. Think he'll ditch us?

512
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,429
[Gyeong-nam] I'll bring you your drinks.
