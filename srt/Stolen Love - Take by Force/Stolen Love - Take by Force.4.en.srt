85

and she was lying
in his arms disheveled.

113
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,820

- gave her the divorce paper,
- No...

122
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,060
and her last wish

123
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,780
was that I could marry Yun.

124
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,100
If Yun really owes your family anything,

125
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
she has repaid it

126
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,860

127
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,420
Do you know

128
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,860
she was nearly sold to a brothel
because of

129
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,500
your family's embezzlement?

130
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,860
Xiao Chuyi,

131
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,820
you left right after you married her.

132
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,180
Why does she have to
waste her life on you?

133
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,260
If you still

134
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,980
care about her,

135
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,100
just stay away from her.

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,060

Lady Zhou has taken action

145
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,620
to transfer the scrolls
in the secret room.

146
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,500
Crown Prince and the Zhous

147
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,100
colluded to cause turmoil

148
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,340
and destroyed your family.

149
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,500
If we find

150
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,500
the sheepskin scroll
that proves their treason,

151
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,820
we'll defeat them,

152
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,260
and you'll get revenge.

153
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,220

154
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,620
for seven years.

155
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,780
But...

156
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,640
I understand.

157
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,660
Lu Yunxi is your wife.

158
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,500
She set fire to the ancestral hall.

159
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,020
I'll definitely protect her.

160
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,830
I'll order the Xiaojie Army
to go to the forest.

161
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,820
No need.

162
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,820
I can handle it myself.

163
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,780
Why are you here?

164
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,860
Mother won't come.

165
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,740
Sorry for letting you down.

166
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,860
Mother.

167
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,220
Xiao Chuyi works for Prince Su.

168
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,020
He must've set fire to the hall

169
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
for something else.

170
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,100
We're not

171
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,860
his enemy.

172
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,460
Don't try to slander others

173
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,700
to get away with this.

174
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,100
Mother, you can test him.

175
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,660
How?

176
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,420
You were lovers.

177
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,900
Why should I believe you?

178
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,460
Since he came back,

179
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,660
he's been bullying and insulting me.

180
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,740
I don't have any feelings
for him anymore.

181
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,660

182
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,740

183

Mother, I'm willing to do

185
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,140
anything

186
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,260

187
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,180
and the Zhou Family.

188
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:38,980
I only hope

189
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,300
you can allow

190
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,180
Che and I to join the family tree

191
