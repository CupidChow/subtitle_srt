=Episode 20=

11
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,720
Your Highness.

12
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,920
When my wife and I were leaving

13
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,240
the barrack,

14
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,200
I saw them take Lady Lin out

15
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,560
in plain clothes.

16
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,200
Lord Zhou, what do you mean?

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,650
The adulteration will be exposed.

18
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
Your Highness, you should

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,200
take action first.

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,880
Expose the people involved in the case
before Lady Lin does

21
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,360
and tell His Majesty
you've been investigating it

22
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,000
and trying to find the criminals.

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,460
In that case,

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,480
I'll suffer a great loss.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,240
I'll lose

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,000
nearly half of my people.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,440
If you don't do it now,

28
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,960
they'll get you into trouble.

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,240
You're the Crown Prince.

30
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,280
Many talents are dying to work for you.

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,920
In addition, your mother plays
a significant role.

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,840
She's helped me to negotiate with

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
the ministers.

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,880
Who can replace her?

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,360
Based on my seven years of observation,

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,480
my wife Lu Yunxi can do this job.

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,800
I know your wife is brave and smart,

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,920
but she's much more ambitious

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,840
than your mother.

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,760
Only losers have no ambitions.

41
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,240
Your Highness,

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,520
you care about the people,

43
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,320
and one day, you'll rule the country.

44
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,240
My wife's ambition

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,160
will help you take the throne
and implement your strategy.

46
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
Great.

47
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,280
With your help,

48
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,200
I'll certainly take the throne.

49
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,800
My wife and I
will try our best to assist you.

50
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,960
Then please write a memorial for me.

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,720
Yes, Your Highness.

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,720
(Yunxi will never do the dirty work
for His Highness,)

53
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,880
(and I can't force her.)

54
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,920
(His Highness
will eventually be my enemy.)

55
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,880
Don't be angry, My Lady.

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,440
Did our eye in the Eastern Palace
told you this?

57
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,840
I heard it clearly.

58
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,280
I wouldn't dare lie to you.

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,680
It seems Lady Lin is going to report me
to His Majesty.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,160
Find the soldier's secret lover.

61
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,000
She can help us.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,840
Aye.

63
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,260
(Baby girl, don't tell the truth.)

64
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
Dad...

65
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,600
Baby girl, don't tell the truth.

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,980
I've had a deal with the Crown Prince.

67
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,920
He'll report me,

68
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,760
and I'll take the blame.

69
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,120
It's my dad's handwriting.

70
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,810
I can't believe
they forced you to take the blame.

71
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,080
Mom, has it been 15 minutes?

72
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,800
You're absent-minded.

73
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,360
What are you thinking?

74
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,810
Sometimes, going smoothly is a bad sign.

75
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,600
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

76
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,240
Mom, what did you say?

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
What are you doing?

78
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,280
This is the Zhou's Mansion.

79
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,560
Nephew.

80
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,280
Why are you here?

81
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,570
Lady Lin escaped from the barrack.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,080
We've locked down the city.

83
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,640
We need to search every place

84
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,640
she could be hiding.

85
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,400
Suit yourself.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,520
(Xiao Chuyi's barrack is well guarded.)

87
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,120
(How did a woman manage to escape?)

88
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,080
Thanks, Bad...

89
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,440
Uncle, thank you for saving me.

90
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,920
When Nanny Li took me to the market,

91
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,880
I saw an auntie send flowers
to her soldier husband,

92
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,360
and he was very happy.

93
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
Xu Da,

94
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,720
let's go back.

95
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,880
General, what's wrong?

96
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,730
Do you know something?

97
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,320
Yun wanted to remind me

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,580
that there are rats in the barrack.

99
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,460
The old lady and her soldier husband

100
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,480
must be Lady Zhou's eyes.

101
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,720
If we want to find Lady Lin,

102
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,520
we must catch the rats first.

103
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,030
Your Highness!

104
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,040
Your Highness!

105
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,480
Your Highness!

106
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,720
This is an illicit affair,

107
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,880
but we've been together for three years,

108
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,160
and I really love you.

109
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,920
My family is in trouble.

110
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,440
Your Highness, please

111
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,880
save us.

112
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,400
Don't worry.

113
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,560
What a miserable couple.

114
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,880
You knew this!

115
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,600
In the capital, no one can hide
anything from me.

116
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,000
My Lady, please have mercy.

117
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,680
Your Highness, I'll never betray you.

118
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,880
However, if Xiao Chuyi knows about this,

119
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,760
what will he do?

120
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,840
My Lady, you...

121
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,600
I've set a trap

122
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,320
to make that vixen Lu Yunxi
lure Xiao Chuyi here.

123
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,850
This is

124
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,040
a great opportunity

125
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,300
for Prince Su.

126
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,990
I'm sure everyone will know

127
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,480
your love story.

128
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,960
If His Majesty finds out,

129
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,880
your position...

130
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,080
My Lady, please stop.

131
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,360
I made a mistake.

132
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,520
Your Highness!

133
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,720
It's okay to make mistakes,

134
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,520
but you can't
keep making the same mistakes.

135
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,520
My Lady, are you asking me to...?

136
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,680
Only dead people can't talk.

137
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,200
You...

138
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,130
Are you going to kill me?

139
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,240
Your Highness!

140
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Don't hesitate.

141
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,480
Xiao Chuyi is coming.

142
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,440
Over there.

143
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,320
Where is she?

144
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,480
Search it.

145
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,640
Come on.

146
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,840
- There!
- Over there!

147
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,160
My nephew is brilliant.

148
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,070
- He's quicker than I expected.
- Over there!

149
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,440
I've never asked you for anything!

150
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,280
Heaven and earth
can prove my love for you!

151
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,250
Your Highness, you can leave
after killing her.

152
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,610
I'll take care of the rest.

153
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,640
No!

154
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,080
Don't kill me!

155
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,080
Please!

156
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,360
Please don't kill me!

157
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,400
What are you waiting for?

158
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,320
- Don't do this!
- Go upstairs.

159
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,680
Don't kill me!

160
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,400
Your Highness, please don't!

161
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,320
Your Highness!

162
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,640
Your Highness!

163
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,400
You vicious old woman,

164
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,680
I won't go easy on you
even if I become a ghost...

165
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,840
Your Highness,

166
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,080
we're on the same boat again.

167
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,400
