On impulse?

123
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,640

129

that he stole my wife.

130
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,120

131
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
on the frontier

132
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,160

133
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,200
In the end,
I couldn't even protect my wife.

134
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,600
How am I supposed to be a real man?

135
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,600
Xiao Chuyi,

136
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,760

138
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,840
He has no such intention.

139

He's just too aggrieved.

140
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,200
Father,

141
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,320

Father, your health

144
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,000

145
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,080

146

Chuyi.

148

I had no such intention.

149
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,320

for deceiving me.

151

155
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,880

or agreed to divorce her.

Guards!

158
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,160

30 times with a stick!

160

175

Please give her back to me...

179
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,000
Mother,

180
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,840
General Xiao was hit 80 times
with a stick

181
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,320
and passed out.

182
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,440
Mother, don't worry.

183
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,440
I'll ask the imperial doctor
to check on him.

184
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,840
I heard

185
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,000
he wanted to give up all his merits

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,280
for Sister

187
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,320
and provoked His Majesty.

188
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,560
He was still begging His Majesty

189
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,840
to give Sister back to him
when they hit him.

190
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,080
No wonder

191
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,720
she's the most beautiful woman
in the capital.

192
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,960
Stay out of my sight, all of you.

193
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,480
Why are you still here?

194
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,200
Mother,

195
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,240
you asked my father

196
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,640
to work with the censors
to impeach Chuyi.

197
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,800
It really worked.

198
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,840
Your father and you

199
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,360
will be rewarded.

200
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,120
Hurry!

201
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,200
Prince Su has said

202
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,320
if anything happens to him,

203
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,240
he'll kill all of you!

204
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,200
Hurry!

205
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,560
The old wounds haven't healed.

206
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,600
Can he survive this?

207
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,080
He's had a fever for 12 hours.

208
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
I'm afraid he can't.

209
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,320
You're so careless.

210
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
The doctor said

211
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,920
the fever was caused by his rage.

212
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
You're the best doctor.

213
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,040
Just tell me the truth.

214
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
How's General Xiao?

215
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
I've used the most effective medicine.

216
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,960
If his high fever persists,

217
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,680
I won't be able to save him.
