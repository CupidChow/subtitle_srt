He's Crown Prince's man.

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
His Highness ordered me to pick him up.

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,360
Brother Su,

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
let's go.

20
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
The clothes...

21
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,640
You don't need to explain.

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,320
I trust you.

23
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,760
If you need me,

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,000
just ask.

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,360
I can't go home with you now.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,840
I need one day

27
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,200
to finish something.

28
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,120

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,680
(Loyal servant?)

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,440
(If I can't protect my family,)

31
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,840

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,480
I'm sorry

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,280
I wasn't there when you died!

38

Father!

39
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,760
Mother!

40
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,700
(Beloved Father, Beloved Mother)

41
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,880
General, can you stay with me
for one day?

42
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,040
I want to stay away from here
for one day.

43
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,080
I will heal your husband

44
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,000
before coming back to the prison.

45
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,000
I want to see the outside world.

46
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
One day?

47
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,800
Last night, you said

48
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,240
you'd leave with me.

49
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,600
It was expedient.

50
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,640
I just didn't want you to die
because of me.

51
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,320
If you didn't care,

52
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,600
why would you worry about me?

53
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,080
I brought Healing Powder.

54
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,120
- Use it...
- I've applied medicine.

55
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,720
It's not a bad thing
to be my weak cousin's wife.

56
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,960
He's got medicine.

57
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,960
Auntie.

58
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,960
Auntie.

59
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,920
I got you out of the prison,

60
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,440
and you visited your parents.

61
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,160
Where do you want to go?

62
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,920
On the way here,

63
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
I noticed
it's the Chinese Valentine's Day​​.

64
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,320
There must be lanterns and lion dances.

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,440
I've been in prison for too long.

66
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,680
Why don't you

67
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,560
take me to the capital
to watch the show?

68
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
Auntie, if you want it,

69
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
we'll help you.

70
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,080
Okay.

71
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,120
Okay.

72
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
General,

73
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,520
you're still poisoned.

74
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,800
Lady, look at this.

75
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,040
Sachet.

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,600
Check the sachets.

77
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,240
Sachet.

78
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,080
Mom, I want to see that.

79
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
Be careful.

80
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,100
Mom, it's cold.

81
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,080
Come back next time.

82
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,800
I don't need it.

83
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,320
There's another store.

84
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,570
Please pack these two.

85
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,560
Okay.

86
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,400

87
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,600

89

my cook made.

90
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,800
I'll pick her up to cook for you.

91
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,240
