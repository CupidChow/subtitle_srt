00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,610
With your order,

24
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,480
we'll kill that vile prince
with a thousand arrows.

25
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,200
Crown Prince is a suspicious

26
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
and cunning man.

27
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,320
You must be very cautious.

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,560
Without the tiger tally,

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,920
you mustn't take action.

30
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,800
Prince Su selected all of us,

31
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,440

33
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,800

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,200
Move.

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,440
Move.

40
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,800
Wait.

41
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,600
What are you doing?

42
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,680
My Lord, this...

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,040
The ceremony

44
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,920

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,120
If we miss the timing,

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,500
will you be responsible?

47
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,960
Move.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,480
(Xiao Chuyi, I knew you'd come.)

49
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,440

Tianyu's soldiers

54
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,760
shall return to the homeland

55
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,640
and be remembered.

56
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,880
Today,

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,720
I, the Crown Prince,

58
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,300
came here to pay homage to

59
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,400
all the soldiers.

60
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,480
Xiao Chu...

61
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,280
Scream.

62
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,720
Scream so that they can hear you.

63
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,640
Are you crazy?

64
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,760
Can't you see the situation clearly?

65
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,400
What situation?

66
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,840
Isn't it the situation where your master

67
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,560
the Crown Prince

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,520
pretends to mourn my dead brothers?

69
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,000
Or the situation

70
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,760
where the murderer

71
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,120
can insult

72
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,360
the victims as he wants?

73
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,640
Or should I put it as

74
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,280
a situation

75
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,600
where a traitor to the nation

76
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,200
wants to keep his position
by sacrificing my brothers' blood?

77
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,920
Chuyi,

78
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,280
please stop.

79
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,760
I have something more important to do.

80
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,160
What's so important?

81
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,280
Are you...?

82
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,600
You...

83
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,760
Chuyi!

84
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Pray for the protection of the spirits

85
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,080
and the prosperity of the nation.

86
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,000
Protect the Crown Prince!

87
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,080
How dare you assassinate me?
Do you know...?

88
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,920
Don't move!

89
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,840
General Xiao,

90
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,160
assassinating the Crown Prince
is a capital crime.

91
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,700
(In Memory of
the Warriors Died in Luoxia Ridge)

92
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,440
You didn't even kneel

93
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,400
to their souls.

94
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,280
Do you have a heart?

95
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,120
Kneel!

96
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,720
Brothers.

97
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,420
(In Memory of
the Warriors Died in Luoxia Ridge)

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,280
Look who's here.

99
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,400
The Crown Prince

100
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,720
is here to kowtow and apologize!

101
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
Kowtow!

102
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,800
I was confused

103
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,640
and made a mistake.

104
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,640
- General, mercy.
- Did I tell you to stop?

105
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,160
Kneel!

106
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,440
(Chuyi, you can't die.)

107
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,960
If you kill him,

108
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,460
I'll die in front of you!

109
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,640
Yun,

110
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,080
I know you want to save me.

111
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,160
If one of us has to die,

112
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,160
it has to be me.

113
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,200
Watch out!

114
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,000
Yun!

115
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,880
Yunxi!

116
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,680
Do you think I'm an idiot?

117
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,150
Tear Xiao Chuyi into pieces!

118
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,360
Aye!

119
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,680
Arrows!

120
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,880
Run!

121
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,080
Lu Yunxi, you really want to kill me.

122
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,600
General, we're here.

123
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,200
Who sent you?

124
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
We swore to fight and die with you.

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,840
Take her away.

126
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,960
Leave me here.

127
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,160
Take the prince and leave.

128
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,070
I have a plan.

129
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,850
How can I leave you?

130
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,120
Let's enter the temple.

131
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,560
Let's go.

132
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,480
Xu Da.

133
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,320
Guard the surrounding areas.

134
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Find a place to lock and

135
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
keep an eye on him.

136
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,250
Amitabha.

137
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,110
Abbot, sorry for this.

138
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,180
General, no apologies.

139
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,240
If I can survive,

140
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,280
I'll definitely repay you.

141
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,840
Abbot, please prepare
a guest room for us.

142
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,600
This way.

143
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
The Crown Prince
was kidnapped by criminals.

144
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,600
Now I'm your leader.

145
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,240
Everyone, find a way to break in

146
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,120
and rescue His Highness.

147
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,560
If we break in, will they hurt...?

148
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,680
- Break in!
- Aye!

149
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,560
(The city is shut down.)

150
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,120
(I'll be the one)

151
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,280
(who writes the story.)

152
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,360
(I hope you'll all die here,)

153
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
(as long as Yunxi is safe.)

154
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,800
Only I can unlock this.

155
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
If you use force,

156
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,960
the liquid inside

157
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,860
will melt the pills.

158
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,920
Xiao Chuyi,

159
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,590
why don't you kill me

160
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,410
and get the cure?

161
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,280
Xiao Chuyi,

162
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,360
do you dare?

163
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,240
If you kill me,

164
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
everyone here and their family
will be eliminated,

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,520
including Lu Yunxi.

166
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's wait and see.

167
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,730
When we go back,

168
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,600
I'll tell my father.

169
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,130
Go to hell!

170
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,560
That vicious woman!

171
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,240
I'll torture her to death!

172
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,930
How dare you do this to me?

173
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,440
Xiao Chuyi!

174
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,680
General,

175
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,760
they're trying to break in.

176
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,160
We can only guard it for one day.

177
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,520
Any mint leaf?

178
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,640
Find a way

179
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,440
to contact the soldiers Yun arranged.

180
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,600
Tomorrow morning,

181
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,360
we'll break out together.

182
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,800
Yun.

183
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,160
Don't move.

184
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,160
It's okay.

185
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,480
(It's the Hell Poison from Wujiang.)

186
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,000
(The shadow guard of the Crown Prince
is from Wujiang.)

187
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,240
You...

188
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,360
If we don't eliminate it,

189
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,640
it'll invade your organs via your blood,

190
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,160
and you'll die in extreme pain.

191
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,040
Hang in there.

192
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,920

♪Took vows as the wind passed by♪

194
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:59,200
♪Seems to have forgotten
the passing of time♪

♪Linger on the past, wish♪

196
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,760
If you can't bear the pain,

197
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,280
just bite me.

198
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,400
I can handle it.

199
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,800
Then let's make a deal.

200
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,000
Every time you scream,

201
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,280
I'll take off a piece of your clothes.

202
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,040
How can you tease me

203
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,760
at this point?

204
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,440
You know me.

205
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,320
I keep every promise I made.

206
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,620
♪But I still miss you
with tears in my eyes♪

207

♪Sow the seeds of love,

♪Move on, let go,
forget everything about you♪

210
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:08,840
♪Flowers fall on the road
where I fell in love with you♪

211
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,380
My Lord,

212
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,680
we've taken down the ambush

213
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,520
Lady Lu arranged.

214
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,840
Great.

215
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,750
What about the Cibei Temple?

216
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
We've been trying
but haven't made any progress.

217
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,120
Keep trying.

218
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,560
Leave them no time to rest.

219
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,410
Aye!

220
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,520
General.

221
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,040
The poison had infected your lungs,

222
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,920
and you absorbed
Lady Lu's poisonous blood.

223
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,960
Doctor Wu's medicine
doesn't work anymore.

224
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,520
What about the ambush?

225
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,460
They were intercepted by Zhou Yanyu.

226
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,020
Xu Da.

227
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,120
Tomorrow morning,

228
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,280
I'll break out with the Crown Prince

229
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,960
and kill him in public.

230
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,400
Protect Yun.

231
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,440
Ask her to surrender to Zhou Yanyu.

232
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,230
I'll take the blame

233
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,440
for killing the prince.

234
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,160
Yun will protect all of you.

235
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,000
General, no!

236
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,780
We can't watch you die!

237
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,120
I already died once.

238
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,280
If it wasn't for my love for her,

239
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,600
I wouldn't have survived.

240
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,280
Besides, I don't have much time left.

241
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,280
As a soldier,

242
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,360
I'd rather die with glory.

243
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,160
I can not only cure Che

244
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,480
but also avenge the brothers
died in Luoxia Ridge.

245
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,320
Any mint leaf?

246
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,410
