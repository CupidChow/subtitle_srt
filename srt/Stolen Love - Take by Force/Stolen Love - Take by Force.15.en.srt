11
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,880
Doctor Wu prepared
the herbal bath for you.

12
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,000
It's good for your health.

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,680
Now that you're awake,

14
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,440
I'll leave.

15
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,360
Yi.

16
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't come in!

17
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,640
I have to tell you this right now.

18
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,490
Get out!

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,480
I sent someone to investigate Lu Yunxi.

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,520
She was in exile with Zhou Yanyu
for four years.

21
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,520
After she came back,
she was very cautious,

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,590
but Lady Zhou never liked her.

23
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,600
However, since you came back,

24
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,160
she's been promoted.

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,600
Don't you think

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,800
Lady Zhou is using your love for her

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,120
to deal with you?

28
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,520
Father has always favored
civil official.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
If we can't get solid evidence,

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,840
Prince Su and you

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,160
will lose my father's trust.

32
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,080
Why are you coughing?

33
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,560
Is it because of

34
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
the old wound?

35
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,880
Yes, the wound still hurts.

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,840
Get out!

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,840
Well, rest well.

38
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,080
Her Highness said...

39
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,760
I can't believe
you're taking it seriously.

40
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,600
At least your wife-to-be

41
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,960
really cares about

42
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,320
and loves you.

43
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,760
That's true.

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,560
Her Highness is candid,

45
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,520
friendly, and adorable.

46
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,640
As your sister-in-law,

47
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,480
I hope

48
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,600
you can cherish this precious marriage.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
You're right.

50
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,240
You keep saying she's your wife.

51
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,760
But why are you ignoring her actions?

52
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,880
I'll support all her decisions

53
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,160
and actions.

54
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,000
Support?

55
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,000
Can you protect her?

56
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,480
What about you?

57
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,440
We lived in peace for seven years.

58
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,600
Since you came back,
you've been hurting her.

59
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,720
What else can you do?

60
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,400
You should stay away from her

61
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,600
instead of criticizing me.

62
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,960
Your Highness.

63
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,440
Mother.

64
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,640
His Highness asked me to tell you

65
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,040
he's not feeling well and can't go out.

66
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,960
If you have anything,

67
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,200
just tell me.

68
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,360
Yanyu.

69
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,880
You've been an impartial official.

70
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,040
I don't want you to get involved

71
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,320
because I want to protect you.

72
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,600
If His Highness is not feeling well,

73
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,760
I'll visit him in person.

74
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,000
Is His Highness
involved in the embezzlement?

75
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,800
Everyone knows

76
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,760
we helped His Highness

77
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,400
to become the Crown Prince,

78
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,320
and you're his teacher.

79
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,520
It's too late

80
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,640
to dissociate yourself.

81
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,280
His Majesty is investigating it

82
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,280
because he wants to give
the frontline soldiers an explanation

83
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,800
and warn the people
behind the adulteration

84
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,960
to set an example.

85
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,000
He won't punish the Zhou Family.

86
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,360
Mother,

87
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,400
just follow His Majesty's guidance

88
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,480
and find a scapegoat.

89
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
It's an important issue.

90
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,520
If we can't solve this,

91
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,720
our family will be in trouble.

92
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,160
Mother,

93
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,320
Father once told me it wasn't

94
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,240
our properties but our people

95
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,320
that made our family

96
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,680
thrive.

97
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,560
If I get His Majesty's full trust,

98
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,680
I'll be able to
protect you and our family.

99
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,240
My wife just took over the granary.

100
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,080
She's still new to this.

101
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,000
Mother, please help her out.

102
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,000
How dare he defy me

103
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,000
for Lu Yunxi?

104
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,720
You're all love-struck fools!

105
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,160
You want to control me.

106
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,400
Then don't blame me for having no mercy!

107
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,980
(Zhou's Mansion)

108
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,440
Mother, you've been ill for a few days.

109
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,720
Maybe I should ask Yanyu
to summon Doctor Chen.

110
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,230
It's because of my anxiety.

111
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,600
If you really care about me,

112
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,740
why don't you help me solve the problem?

113
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,720
Mother, please make it clear.

114
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,760
His Majesty wants
an explanation of the military rations.

115
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,680
Now that you're in charge of
the granary,

116
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,160
I'll leave it to you.

117
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,880
Lady Lin didn't want to cooperate.

118
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,920
I've made up my mind.

119
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,960
I'll give you all the account books.

120
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,340
(Zhou's Granary)

121
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
But Mother,

122
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,120
I just took over the granary.

123
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,880
I still have a lot to learn.

124
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,880
Just do whatever

125
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,520
you think it's right.

126
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,540
(Zhou's Granary)

127
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,930
(Zhou Family Ancestral Hall)
Lady Zhou.

128
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,800
(Seven Years Ago)
His Majesty favors our family more,

129
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,640
but why are they more powerful?

130
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,520
You don't know?

131
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,440
Their servants and followers
are everywhere,

132
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,360
which means

133
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,090
half of the ministers
are related to the Zhou Family.

134
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,920
And they have 72 rich merchants.

135
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,120
It's said

136
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,640
most of the military rations

137
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,220
are from the Zhou Family.

138
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,640
They're so powerful, right?

139
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,320
Of course.

140
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,720
Otherwise, why would my aunt

141
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,840
risk her life to become
the lady in charge?

142
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
But listen.

143
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,120
The Zhous store grains,

144
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
and I lead the army.

145
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,160
Their granaries serve me.

146
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,540
(Zhou's Granary)

147
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,080
(Accountant, Lin Hui)

148
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,840
Lady Lin signed all the papers.

149
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,880
She's so greedy.

150
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,200
Every grain transaction

151
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,600
must be approved by the lady in charge.

152
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,360
Lady Zhou is using this

153
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,200
to turn Lady Lin and me
against each other

154
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,400
and protect herself.

155
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,440
What should we do?

156
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,520
We'll use this opportunity

157
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,800
to take Lady Lin down first.

158
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,640
Cuixi,

159
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,960
guard the door.

160
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,920
Don't let anyone in.

161
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,680
(Even with the solid evidence
of the embezzlement,)

162
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,720
(I still can't take down Lady Zhou
and His Highness.)

163
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,960
(I have to become the lady in charge)

164
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,240
(and get the scroll in the secret room.)

165
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,340
(Proposal Letter)

166
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,520
What do you want? Who are you?

167
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,360
Move!

168
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,240
What are you doing?

169
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,000
Generals,

170
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,200
why did you

171
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,640
break in?

172
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,600
Her Highness ordered us

173
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
the search your room.

174
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,440
Go.

175
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,000
(They can take the account books,)

176
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
(but if they find
our marriage letters...)

177
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,360
Did Her Highness get jealous

178
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,120
because Xiao Chuyi

179
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,560
still loves me

180
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,720
and want to get revenge?

181
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,880
You don't deserve it.

182
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
If Her Highness wasn't jealous,

183
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,480
why would she want to search my place?

184
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,240
- Get off me!
- Answer me!

185
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,080
Get off me!

186
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
The evidence

187
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,640
is not in the room.

188
