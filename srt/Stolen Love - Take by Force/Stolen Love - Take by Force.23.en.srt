I'm Yun.

13
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,920
Yun.

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,720
But you've never allowed me
to call you Yun.

15
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,840
I can only call you Yunxi.

16
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,440
Yanyu.

17
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,200
But I like hearing you call me Yun.

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,440
Yun!

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Do you know how much I wish
I could call you Yun like he does?

20
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,520
You're my Yun.

21
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,680
Lord Zhou was drugged...

22
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,360
Don't worry.

23
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,920
I won't tell anyone.

24
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,400
It's you.

25
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,600
Where are you going?

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,200
Don't let me catch you.

27
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,840
Who catches whom?

28
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,800
Want me to catch you?

29
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,560
Whatever.

30
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,160
Then catch me.

31
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,640
Don't run!

32
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,160
Slow down.

33
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,800
General, you mentioned
the Cibei Temple yesterday.

34
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,000
I believe you know
I went to Luoxia Ridge seven years ago.

35
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,240
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

36
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,720
I don't need to hide it.

37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,840
When I heard about your death,

38
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,320
I was devastated.

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,640
However, my deepest fear

40
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,720
was my future.

41
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,080
Will I be alone

42
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,040
for the rest of my life?

43
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,240
Then how do you explain

44
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,640
why you brought the letters back?

45
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,400
Just a small favor.

46
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,680
I don't believe it.

47
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,120
I'm an orphan who was thrown into
the Orphan Cave by my parents.

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,720
I was born a heartless girl.

49
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
You saved me

50
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,240
and asked your mother to adopt me.

51
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,360
I had to act good

52
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,200
because I was afraid you'd dislike me.

53
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,560
If nothing happens,

54
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,920
I'll behave myself.

55
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,520
However, if anything happens,

56
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,800
I'll only protect

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,520
myself.

58
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't demean yourself.

59
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,520
You're not like that.

60
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,920
I know you're not a heartless person.

61
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,360
General.

62
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,400
The kind version of me

63
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,800
is what I want you to see.

64
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,680
Since you came back,

65
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,280
you've mentioned the crimes
the Zhous committed many times,

66
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,120
but I've never asked.

67
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,800
Don't you want to know why?

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,440
Lu Yunxi...

69
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,200
You knew it all along

70
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,920
that it was that vicious old woman

71
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,360
who destroyed my family.

72
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
The old general

73
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,840
was a brave warrior

74
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,760
who'd never surrender.

75
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,520
Why would he kill himself
for fear of punishment?

76
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,520
Yun.

77
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,200
Tell me.

78
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,080
Do you have a reason for doing this?

79
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,000
You've always wanted
to get revenge, right?

80
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,280
Tell me.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,080
Revenge?

82
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,000
I serve Lady Zhou every day.

83
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,480
If I wanted to get revenge,

84
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
I would've poisoned

85
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,360
or assassinated her

86
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,080
a long time ago.

87
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,920
Why would I wait until now?

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,840
Xiao Chuyi!

89
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,840
I just want to live.

90
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
I want to live

91
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
a peaceful and wealthy life.

92
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,520
You want to live

93
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,960
a peaceful

94
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,680
and wealthy life.

95
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,800
Okay, no problem.

96
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,560
I'll get revenge myself.

97
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,080
It has nothing to do with you.

98
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,240
I just want you to know

99
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
no matter what you do,

100
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
I'll protect you and Che.

101
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,560
Mom!

102
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,040
Young Lord Che, slow down.

103
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,240
Thanks, General.

104
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,720
(Chuyi.)

105
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,560
(We had such a peaceful night together.)

106
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,120
(It's worth it.)

107
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,200
(From now on,)

108
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,720
(I'll risk my life to get revenge.)

109
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,360
(If you knew this,)

110
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,840
(you'd definitely stop me.)

111
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,320
(I have no choice.)

112
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,600
My Lady, why are you here?

113
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,280
Where's Lady Zhou?

114
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,880
The lady in charge asked you over.

115
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,840
Who else

116
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,640
could it be?

117
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,640
My Lady, you're too impatient.

118
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,000
Lady Zhou is very healthy.

119
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,400
If Lady Zhou and His Majesty find out,

120
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,680
they'll punish you
for your disobedience.

121
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,040
Let's go. Stop wasting time.

122
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,280
On the 20th day of the last month

123
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,880
of the 20th Yong'an year.

124
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,960
Lord Zhou, do you remember that day?

125
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,160
Why did you go to the water dungeon?

126
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,440
Did Lord Jiang's wife catch a cold

127
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,000
on the Dragon Boat Festival
of the 25th Yong'an year?

128
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,480
What medicine did you give her?

129
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,800
How did you know?

130
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,520
Lu Yunxi, who are you?

131
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,880
My Lords, don't be nervous.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,640
If I'm a simple and silly girl,

133
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,240
will you trust me

134
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
to be a good lady in charge

135
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,280
of the family?

136
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,360
Indeed, Lady Zhou is old.

137
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,480
She shouldn't be bothered

138
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,040
by family issues.

139
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,080
Lady Lu, we're at your service.

140
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,560
Thank you,

141
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,400
My Lords.

142
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Goodbye, My Lady.

143
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,320
If she decides to expose it,

144
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,400
what should we do?

145
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,840
If she wants to replace Lady Zhou now,

146
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,360
she'll have to threaten more people.

147
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,480
She knows the secrets.

148
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,800
Many people will try to kill her.

149
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,840
We have to be careful of Xiao Chuyi.

150
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,640
Xiao Chuyi wants to protect her,
so what?

151
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,480
There are many

152
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,800
more powerful and vicious people.

153
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,240
If they take action,

154
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,760
Xiao Chuyi and Lady Lu will be doomed.

155
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,280
Lady Lu, is it too hasty

156
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,480
to take action now?

157
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,520
We can't wait.

158
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,120
It'll only get more dangerous.

159
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,840
I have to become the lady in charge

160
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,320
before the ancestral worship ceremony

161
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,200
on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

162
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,920
Cuixi, go back and wait for my message.

163
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,780
(Zhou's Mansion)

164
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,120
My Lady, I'll keep

165
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,320
that in mind.

166
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,720
When they reselect the lady in charge,

167
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,240
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

168
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,360
Please don't forget us when you succeed.

169
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,940
Thanks, My Lord.

170
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,900
When I assist Yanyu

171
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,100
in managing the family,

172
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,300
I won't forget what you've done for us.

173
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,260
Goodbye.

174
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,620
My Lord, I've arranged
everything as you told me.

175
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,900
This carriage will never reach
the capital.

176
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,820
Send a message to our soldiers
and the bandits around.

177
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,260
When they see the carriage,

178
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,340
they shall kill her

179
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,180
without mercy.

180
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,340
Aye.

181
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,260
Chuyi!

182

183
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,020
Don't be afraid.

184
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,580
You'll be alright.

185
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,660
Yun, Yun.

186
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,380
