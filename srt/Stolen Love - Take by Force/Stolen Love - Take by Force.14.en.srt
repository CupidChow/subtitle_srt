11
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,160
Your Highness,

12
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,640
someone saw General Xiao and Lu Yunxi
at the waterside pavilion.

13
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,480
They seemed quite close.

14
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,600
Yi.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
Let's thank my father

16
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,800
and get engaged.

17
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,120
Maybe next time.

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,560
I'm busy.

19
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,000
Are you injured?

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,680
Don't worry.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Maybe I got it on my sleeve

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,720
when I was training the soldiers.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,840
Yi.

24
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,960
I know you have feelings for her.

25
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,240
So what?

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,080
It doesn't matter.

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,480
It's His Majesty's decree.

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,240
Did I refuse?

29
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,760
I didn't.

30
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
I'll obey the order.

31
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,920
You're the Prince Consort,

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
but you've been quite close to her.

33
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
It'll not only give our rivals
an excuse to criticize

34
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
but affect the investigation.

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,360
You have to stay sober
and look at the bigger picture.

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,040
Yi, think it through.

37
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,040
I can tell right

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,080
from wrong.

39
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,600
It's raining.

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,360
Don't get cold.

41
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,080
I was thinking about the granary,

42
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,280
and I didn't notice

43
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,520
the rain.

44
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,960
You don't have to

45
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,480
lie to me.

46
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,160
It's been seven years.

47
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,040
We've been through a lot together.

48
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,480
You don't have to

49
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,040
be strong in front of me.

50
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,520
I was just thinking

51
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,160
that Sister wouldn't hand over
the account book.

52
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,120
I'll help you

53
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,800
- to persuade...
- Please don't.

54
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,280
We had a deal before getting married.

55
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
I can tell you

56
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,640
my strategy,

57
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
but you'll stay out of it.

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
Aunt!

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,880
Mother!

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
Mother!

61
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,200
Mother! Mother!

62
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,520
Mother!

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,560
Zhou Yanyu,

64
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,840
I'd marry anyone else except you.

65
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,880
As long as I'm still alive,

66
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,880
I'll avenge my family!

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,680
If you marry me,

68
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,480
you'll get into trouble.

69
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,960
I have a secret

70
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,520
that I've never told anyone before.

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,960
Lady Zhou

72
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,240
is not my mother.

73
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,760
She not only killed my mother

74
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,760
but wants to kill me.

75
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,400
Lord Zhou raised and taught me.

76
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,800
I'll eliminate the traitors,

77
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,080
even if my family has to fall.

78
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,720
We have

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
a shared purpose.

80
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,480
I've given my heart

81
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,600
to Chuyi in this life.

82
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,600
Even if he's dead,

83
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,880
I won't fall in love with anyone else.

84
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,520
Yunxi,

85
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
do you remember I once
fell into an icy pool?

86
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,720
My body was damaged.

87
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,240
I'll never be able to

88
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,320
have children.

89
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,320
So, from now on,

90
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,120
Xiao Chuyi's child will be my child.

91
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,600
If I don't treat his child well,

92
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,640
I'll be punished by God.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
There's another thing.

94
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,520
If you promise me this,

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,640
I'll marry you.

96
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,600
- I'll promise anything.
- I can tell you

97
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,520
my revenge plan,

98
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,680
but don't help me.

99
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't want to drag you down.

100
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,160
Yunxi.

101
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,240
You've had a really hard time.

102
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,000
As your husband,

103
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't let you go through this alone.

104
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,880
Yanyu.

105
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,400
You know me well.

106
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,040
I'll never back out,

107
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,840
whether it's avenging my family,

108
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,320
breaking up with Xiao Chuyi,

109
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,200
or

110
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,760
fulfilling my promise to you.

111
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,680
The granary

112
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
is the core
of the political in-fighting,

113
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,840
and it's dangerous.

114
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,560
Standing out at this point

115
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,000
is like dancing on a knife edge.

116
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,760
If you fall, you'll be cut into pieces.

117
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,920
I understand.

118
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,560
I've waited for seven years.

119
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,560
Now that we've made some progress,

120
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,680
I can't give up at this point.

121
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,560
However,

122
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,120
you know it's a political in-fighting,

123
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,560
so you should stay out of it.

124
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,160
You can't ruin the good reputation
you've earned all these years.

125
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,720
Yunxi,

126
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,440
don't feel sorry or guilty for me.

127
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,240
I'm willing to do

128
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,760
anything for you.

129
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
As the Grand Tutor,

130
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,600
I shouldn't favor one side
in the embezzlement case

131
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,800
and let His Majesty down.

132
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,240
I'm tired.

133
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,760
Let's go back.

134
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,560
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

135
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,840
Lu Yunxi,

136
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,360
it's only been a few days,

137
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,120
and you've earned everyone's favor.

138
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,920
You even want the account book.

139
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,200
Stop dreaming.

140
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,240
Sister.

141
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,200
Don't throw it!

142
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,960
Because of your pretty face,

143
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,440
both Xiao Chuyi and Brother
have been defending you.

144
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,240
Che is a good boy.

145
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,360
You don't deserve to be his mother.

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,320
You have everything.

147
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
Why are you still
trying to steal my position?

148
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,320
Sister.

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,840
Do you know why

150
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,160
Yanru doesn't want to come home?

151
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,320
He doesn't care about money or fame.

152
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,240
He wants to be free.

153
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,040
However, Mother
has been strict with him.

154
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,160
She had high expectations

155
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,240
and forced him to take exams

156
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,520
and manage the family.

157
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,680
He's sick of Mother

158
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,520
and her loyal daughter-in-law.

159
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,880
Sister.

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,400
He told you

161
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,560
he'd take you away, didn't he?

162
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,980
If you want it,

163
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,380
(Zhou's Granary)

164
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,080
you'll have a husband and children

165
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,440
who love you.

166
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,480
Three Character Classic?

167
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,560
It's too late.

168
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,120
Besides,

169
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,640
who are you to judge my decisions?

170
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,920
You...

171
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,720
A shameless woman who got married twice

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,080
should drown in the pool!

173
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,200
She caught a cold in the water dungeon,

174
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,880
and she was shocked
and inhaled water today.

175
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,160
The cold must be expelled from her body.

176
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,120
I'll get some medicine.

177
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,720
Thanks.

178
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,840
Yunxi.

179
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,440
I just saved your life.

180
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,560
Why are you so eager to get rid of me?

181
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,400
General, I'll never forget

182
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,160
what you did.

183
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,840
Never mind.

184
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,920
Doctor Wu prepared
the herbal bath for you.

185
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,040
It's good for your health.

186
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,640
Now that you're awake,

187
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
I'll leave.

188
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,400
Yi.

189
