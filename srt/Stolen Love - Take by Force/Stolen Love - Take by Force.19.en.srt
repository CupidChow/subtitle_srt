(Zhou's Mansion)

12
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,800
Be careful.

13
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,440
Come on.

14
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,760
Dad!

15
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,610
Summon the doctor now.

16
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,170
- Hurry.
- Aye.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
Is your forehead okay?

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,700
I'm fine.

19
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,180
(Zhou's Mansion)

20
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Just a small gift.

21
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,440
Cousin, thank you for saving my son.

22
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,340
The wine and food on the carriage

23
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,720
are for the soldiers.

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,520
Leave the wine and food

25
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
and take the rest back.

26
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,330
This...

27
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,880
You don't need to thank me for saving

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,320
Yun's son.

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,440
And you don't need to come in person.

30
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,480
General, as a Rank-1 official,

31
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,760
you must know the etiquette.

32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,800
I'm busy with work.

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,880
No time for you.

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,680
Please go back.

35
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,320
General.

36
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,840
I want to see Lady Lin.

37
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,120
Only you.

38
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,360
Is Che okay?

39
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,760
He's good in the day,

40
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,960
but he has nightmares at night.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,880
Like mother, like son.

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,720
He's brave.

43
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,080
How about you?

44
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,200
General, thanks for your concern.

45
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,480
I'm doing fine.

46
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,880
Che is safe and sound.

47
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,160
He asked me to give you this.

48
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
Lu Yunxi.

49
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,920
I underestimated you.

50
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,080
But don't think

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,800
you've won.

52
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,000
When I get out,

53
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,760
I'll still compete with you
for the position

54
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
and Che.

55
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,280
Lord Lin was suspended

56
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,520
for kidnapping Che,

57
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,080
and Mother claimed to be ill.

58
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,480
At this point,

59
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,480
only I can save you.

60
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,400
What do you want?

61
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
Do you want me
to testify against Mother?

62
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,120
Do you think Prince Su and Xiao Chuyi

63
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,560
made the embezzlement

64
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,960
such a big deal for us?

65
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,840
In their eyes,

66
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,560
we're not even in the game.

67
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,200
But the Crown Prince

68
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,720
will eventually take the throne, right?

69
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,000
Seven years ago,

70
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,320
Xiao Chuyi nearly died in Luoxia Ridge,

71
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,080
and Prince Su lost his best soldiers.

72
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,560
They've planned for this

73
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,480
for a long time.

74
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,680
The Crown Prince is in trouble.

75
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,440
Do you think he can save you?

76
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,560
Mother has always been very cautious.

77
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,080
It seems I've been in charge,

78
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,680
but she's the real boss.

79
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,160
Sister, you're very smart.

80
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,680
You must've got

81
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,080
something on her over the years.

82
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,440
Yanyu said

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,560
His Majesty asked about this.

84
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,960
As humble servants,

85
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,680
we can't afford to offend the emperor.

86
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Why don't you

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,160
find a way out
before His Majesty executes you?

88
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,480
Sister, think about it.

89
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,280
We're running

90
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,480
out of time.

91
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,760
Liuyun said

92
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,800
she found the connection
between the embezzlement case

93
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,120
and the adulteration in Luoxia Ridge.

94
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,200
In Luoxia Ridge,

95
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,760
the Zhous and the Crown Prince

96
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,280
leaked our information to the enemy,

97
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
and our main forces were surrounded.

98
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,240
Moreover, they mixed
the military rations with sand

99
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,800
to starve the frontline soldiers.

100
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,840
They really played nasty tricks

101
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,000
to deal with us.

102
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
Now that we've got the solid evidence,

103
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,120
we can report it to His Majesty

104
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,840
and ask him to investigate
the Luoxia Ridge case.

105
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,520
If Lady Lin takes all the blame,

106
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,160
I'm afraid they'll get away with it.

107
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,200
So, I allowed Yun

108
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,360
to talk to Lady Lin.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,560
You're way out of line!

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,160
She wants to defeat Lady Lin

111
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,400
and become the lady in charge.

112
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,240
I trust her.

113
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,480
I don't believe she's heartless.

114
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,920
She'll pay Lady Lin and me back
for saving Che.

115
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,880
- My Prince!
- You...

116
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,480
General.

117
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,800
Lady Lin wants to see Lady Zhou.

118
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,640
Mother, I'm your son's wife.

119
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,760
Please save me!

120
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,240
Maybe I'm useless,

121
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,560
but I knew

122
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,440
you put me in charge

123
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,320
so that the Zhou Family and you

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,680
can get away with it.

125
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,920
However, I still did as you told me.

126
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,560
I tried to make you the lady in charge,

127
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,840
but you were so useless

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,560
that you couldn't even defeat
a woman who remarried.

129
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
Are you going to abandon me?

130
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
If you take the blame,

131
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,320
I'll have mercy on your family,

132
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,840
and your father will live a long life.

133
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,960
After everything we've done,

134
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,920
is this what we get?

135
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,560
You worked for me

136
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,960
for money and power.

137
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,640
Otherwise, a useless man
like your father

138
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,720
would never be the Grand Censor.

139
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,200
I don't want to end up like this.

140
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,960
There's another way.

141
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,200
What is it?

142
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,800
Seven years ago, I framed my brother

143
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
to protect myself.

144
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
Are you asking me
to blame it on my father?

145
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,360
If you're willing to do it,

146
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,560
I'll definitely help you.

147
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,560
If I frame my closest family,

148
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,320
I'll be a monster.

149
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,520
Think about it.

150
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll do it.

151
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,520
I'll report it to His Majesty.

152
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,600
I won't let that vicious old woman
get away with it.

153
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,720
Yanyu.

154
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,200
Let's go home.

155
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,710
Okay.

156
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,640
Go.

157
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,880
Go.

158
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,080
Cousin, what's the matter?

159
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,360
Cousin,

160
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,720
I need to talk to Yunxi.

161
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,400
Please give us some space.

162
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,720
Yun,

163
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,710
you turned Lady Lin against Lady Zhou...

164
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,840
General, you got me wrong.

165
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,840
I'm doing this for myself.

166
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,160
It's not about you.

167
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,920
Okay.

168
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,880
Let's focus on you.

169
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,560
The embezzlement case
will be closed soon,

170
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,320
and they'll suffer great loss.

171
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,720
We'll use this opportunity

172
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,080
to get rid of them for good.

173
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,680
I hope you can
see the situation clearly.

174
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,120
Don't worry.

175
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,160
I'm not asking you to come back to me.

176
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,720
I just don't want you
to be ruined by the Zhous.

177
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,120
You can't remain unscathed
after they fall.

178
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,880
General, thanks for your concern.

179
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,720
However,

180
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,920
I want to go through it with the Zhous.

181
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,080
With my mother-in-law's ability

182
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,080
and the Zhous' power,

183
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,280
maybe we'll have

184
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,480
the last laugh.

185
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,280
Yun,

186
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,800
stop pretending.

187
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,480
General, what do you mean?

188
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,440
You've planned for this

189
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
for a long time.

190
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,520
You even challenged
that vicious old woman.

191
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,520
Why didn't you kill Lady Lin?

192
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
You can replace Aunt after she's dead.

193
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm afraid

194
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,520
you want more than the position.

195
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm right.

196
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,240
You're

197
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,640
half right.

198
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,040
General,

199
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
you know how to lead soldiers

200
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
and win a war,

201
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,720
but you know nothing

202
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,560
about family.

203
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,040
Even if Lady Lin falls,

204
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,000
Mother can cultivate another Lady Lin,

205
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,320
but I don't want to waste

206
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,920
another seven years.

207
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,280
I can lock you up with her

208
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,880
right now.

209
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,000
General,

210
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
you still can't move on.

211
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,800
General, if you stop persuading me
to leave the Zhou Family,

212
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,520
I'll serve you well.

213
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,760
What's wrong?

214
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,640
Are you scared?

215
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,600
Enough.

216
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,040
It's enough!

217
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,440
Take care of yourself.

218
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,960
Thanks, General.
