Manager Qi!

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,800
Do you really think

17
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,720
your death can save your family?

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,720
They'll eliminate every one of you.

00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,800

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,000
Thank god, she's fine.

21
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Yes.

22
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
She's so lucky.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,800
I'll cooperate with the investigation.

24
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,000
Take her back!

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,840
Aye.

26
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Go.

27
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
My Lady!

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,360
I'm so useless.

29
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,440
I couldn't use my death

30
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,960
to frame Xiao Chuyi

31
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,400
and stop their investigation.

32
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,480
You couldn't die,

33
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,440
or you wouldn't dare to die?

34
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,680
I deserve to die!

35
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
I'll hit my head and die in the barrack

36
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,680
in exchange for Lady Lu.

37
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,640
You failed once.

38
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,920
Doing it again will seem deliberate.

39
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,280
She wants to take the blame,

40
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,600
so let her do it.

41
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,960
Unlike Xiao Chuyi,
Princess Liuyun won't have mercy.

42
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,400
Eat it!

43
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,840
Our soldiers are fighting the enemy and

whereas you're enjoying
delicious delicacies

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,360
and embezzling the military rations!

47
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,000
Try it!

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,600
Is that edible?

49
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,880
(He nearly died for the country,)

50
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,320
(and this is the food he ate.)

51
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,720
(I'll make Lady Zhou pay for this.)

52
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,880
Get up.

53
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,920
General Xiao,

54
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,600
you're breaking the rule.

55
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,600
You can't get her to talk.

56
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,000
She was imprisoned before.

57
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,880
Xu Da.

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,040
Let me

59
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,840
interrogate Lady Lu.

60
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,400
Chuyi.

61
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,240
You're way out of line.

62
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,440
I hate the Zhous more than you do.

63
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,280
My aunt is the culprit

64
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,040
behind my family's deaths.

65
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,240
To help the Crown Prince
to take the throne,

66
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,800
she even framed my father
for embezzlement,

67
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,520
and I lost my parents.

68
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,360
One day, I'll let them know

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,720
what it's like to lose their family.

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,760
Then

71
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,680
answer me.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,440
Why are you still helping her?

73
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,820
If it wasn't for her,

74
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,160
the embezzlement case
would've been closed.

75
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,900
We were so impatient

76
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,360
that we nearly fell into their trap.

00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,600

The Zhous and the Crown Prince knew

109
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,880
we were investigating the case,

110
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,040
and they let you take the blame.

You're overthinking it.

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,400
I got married twice,

118
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,640
and I managed to get the position.

119
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,240
I'm not the girl I used to be.

120
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,440
General, maybe you've seen
a lot of blood in battle.

121
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,640
However, in the capital,

122
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,560
there's no blood
when someone is murdered.

123
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,800
When the Xiao Family collapsed,

124
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,520
I remarried Zhou Yanyu.

125
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,440
If the Zhou Family falls,

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,960
I'll definitely find a way to survive.

127
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,800
I don't need your concern.

128
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
Your Highness,

129
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,440
my wife just took over the granary.

130
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Sorry for the trouble.

131
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,360
However, the case has nothing to do
with my wife or my family.

132
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,440
His Majesty said

133
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,840
I could take her home.

134
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,360
She's not here.

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,920

00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
you can take her home.

141
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,040
Liuyun reported the case to my father.

142
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
Father loves her,

143
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,360
and Xiao Chuyi has the army.

144
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,680
Father has ordered them

145
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,880
to investigate this.

146
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,600
I have an idea.

147
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,400
Maybe we can distract Her Highness

148
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,690
and make them panic.

149
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,920
My Lord, you're my teacher.

150
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,000
However, when I prevailed,

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you chose to stay out of it.

152
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,080
Why do you want to help me now?

153
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,400
I want to use your power

154
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,600
to get rid of Xiao Chuyi.

155
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,120

the emperor

157
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,360
hereby decrees

158
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,440
that Grand General Xiao Chuyi
has made great contributions

159
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,840
and stayed loyal to the throne.

160
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,400
He is truly a pillar of the nation.

161
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,360
My daughter

162
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,480
Princess Liuyun is gentle,

beautiful, and capable.

164
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,800
Therefore, Xiao Chuyi

165
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,160
and...

166
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,440
and Princess Liuyun shall get married

167
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,560

grow old together,

00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,300
General, what's

177
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,880
the matter?

178
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,600
Are you sure

179
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,520
you don't want to give up the granary?

180
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,000
General, Her Highness and you
are a perfect match.

181
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,880
I'm sure you'll find the truth

182
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,880
and clear the Zhou Family's name.

183
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,440
My family has been raising grains
for the court

184
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,840
for more than ten years.

185
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,720
We're framed by others,

186
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,760
but heaven and earth

187
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,600
know we're innocent.

188
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,680
Heaven and earth, well said.

189
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
I'll find out if they're innocent.

190
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,800
However, I'm worried
that you're blinded by your vanity

191
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,000
and can't see the bigger picture

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,640
or tell right from wrong.

193
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,960
The Zhous and I

194
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,160
are on the same side.

195
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,120
The Zhous are innocent,

196
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,440
and I can see it clearly.

197
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,560
General, you don't need
to worry about me.

198
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,720
The leading bird

199
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,360
is prone to arrow wounds.

200
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,680
The leading dragon

201
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,120
is prone to thunderstruck.

202
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,560
You want to stand up for them,

203
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,920
but I don't want
to hurt innocent people.

204
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,480
General, what are you doing?

205
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,560
This is inappropriate.

206
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,360
Her Highness and you

207
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,360
are engaged.

208
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,880
You're right.

209
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,720
Now that I'm about to be
the Prince Consort,

210
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,520
I'll take Her Highness's side.

211
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
Her Highness won't go easy

212
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,440
on the criminals
of the embezzlement case.

213
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,360
If you don't turn back,

214
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,000
don't blame us

215
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,240
for hurting you

216
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,280
