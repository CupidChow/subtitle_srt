13

we used a method.

Keep the body sweating

Yun,

80
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,280
the arrangement of 300 archers
is a brilliant idea.

81
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,320
I've contacted them.

82
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,320
Tomorrow morning,

83
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,440
they'll attack Zhou Yanyu
from the middle,

84
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,640
and we'll break out.

85
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,720
As long as you have a plan.

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,520
- But...
- Don't worry.

87
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,640
When we get out,

88
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,680
you'll take Che away.

89
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,320
Go to Luoxia Ridge.

90
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,040
I prepared a house there

91
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,760
with your favorite rice cake store
beside the door.

92
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,560
What about you?

93
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,440
I'll be there too.

94
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,640
I selected all the people there.

95
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,120
They'll recognize you,

96
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
because your portrait

97
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,080
is hanging in the study.

98
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,920

99
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,360

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,020
(Xiao)

104
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,560
Yun,

105
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,200
the arrangement of 300 archers
is a brilliant idea.

106
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,520
(Chuyi lied to me.)

107
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,840
(The archers were taken down.)

108
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,360
(It's the enemy.)

109
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,640
Give the tiger tally to Prince Su.

110
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,760
I prepared a house there

111
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,080
with your favorite rice cake store
beside the door.

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
They'll recognize you,

113
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,960
because your portrait
is hanging in the study.

114
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,680
Yun,

115
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,640
I love you.

116
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,560
Please live for me.

117
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,400
Where are Xiao Chuyi
and the Crown Prince?

118
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,040
Do you really want him to die?

119
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,600
Old pal.

120
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,400
If there's another life,

121
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,600
I'll repay you.

122
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,120

123
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
General.

124
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,240
Where's the prince?

125
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,640
Lady Lu and General Xu...

126
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,920
Yunxi,

127
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,200
what are you doing?

128
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,560
Where's Xiao Chuyi?

129
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,040
Here's my order!

130
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,240
Yesterday,

131
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,960
I chanted sutras
and prayed for the soldiers

132
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,680
with Abbot in the Cibei Temple.

133
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,720
Nothing happened.

134
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,560
Let's go back to the palace.

135
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,160
I can release you.

136
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,160
But you can't arrest us

137
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,320
or take revenge on Xiao Chuyi.

138
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,680
Otherwise,

139
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,480
I'll hand the scroll to His Majesty.

140
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Don't forget,

141
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,880
only I can save your son.

142
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,120
I know his father's heart blood

143
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,160
can also save him.

144
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,760
To save my son,

145
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,360
I can kill you

146
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,320
as well as Zhou Yanyu.

147
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,960
I can't believe you love him this much.

148
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,640
You're both crazy!

149
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,800
As long as Xiao Chuyi is alive,

150
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,280
I'm willing to help you
take down Prince Su.

151
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,320
Let me talk to General Xiao.

152
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
You go first.

153
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,800
I'll catch up.

154
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,880
Yun.

155
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,120
I know you wanted to save me,

156
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,040
but you don't have to do this
to yourself.

157
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,960
Do you have to follow the prince?

158
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,400
I will get the cure.

159
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,600
Chuyi.

160
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,240
I'm tired.

161
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,080
I've thought a lot about it.

162
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,880
In the past seven years,

163
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
I've done enough for the Zhous.

164
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,840
Lady Zhou had a stroke
and can never leave her bed.

165
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,080
I think I've avenged Mother.

166
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,200
I want to live a peaceful life.

167
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,520
Isn't it great to be

168
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
the lady in charge?

169
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,880
What about me?

170
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,520
Since you came back,

171
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,360
our entanglements

172
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,480
have put us in danger
again and again,

173
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,440
and even Che was involved.

174
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,080
Seven years ago,

175
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,400
we were everything to each other.

176
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,400
I used to think

177
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,000
maybe we could go back in time.

178
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,640
However, I've realized

179
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
I was wrong.

180
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,040
For me, Che

181
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,640
is more important now.

182
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,000
I won't let anything
happen to him again.

183
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,640
Go.

184
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,720
We have to kill Lu Yunxi.

185
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,160
If we break the promise,

186
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,240
Lu Yunxi will go all out against us.

187
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,200
Therefore, we have to do it secretly

188
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,800
without any traces.

189
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,040
Lu and Xiao can't find out it's me.

190
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,040
Lord Zhou will figure it out eventually.

191
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,960
Your Highness, you know his attitude.

192
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,880
By the time he finds out,

193
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,240
I'll have already succeeded.

194
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,400
He won't betray me for a dead woman.

195
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,600
I get it.

196
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,240
What should I do?

197
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,200
How's Wujiang going?

198
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,400
We've slaughtered
