- Over there!
- Where is she?

12
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,120
Search.

13
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,240
Turn around.

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,640
Before my daughter-in-law died,

15
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,080
she said she betrayed our family

16
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,200
and let me down.

17
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,760
She colluded with

18
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,080
rich merchants
to embezzle military rations

19
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,120
in the name of the Zhou Family.

20
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,860
She was too ashamed to stay alive.

21
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,200
I was too old

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,960
to stop her.

23
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,640
Aunt, I'm so impressed.

24
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,160
Nephew, I'm impressed too.

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,920
Lady Lu will submit

26
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,520
the account books of Lady Lin
to the relevant authorities.

27
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,300
(In Memory of
the Warriors Died in Luoxia Ridge)

28
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,560
I was too careless.

29
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,240
We took down

30
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,560
a few merchants and officials
involved in the embezzlement.

31
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,400
But the Zhous and the Crown Prince
got away with it.

32
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,280
Brothers in Luoxia Ridge,

33
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,360
please give me a few more days.

34
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,760
I swear, I'll bring the traitors

35
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,800
to justice.

36
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,600
Amitabha.

37
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,240
Almsgiver Xiao, it's been a long time.

38
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,960
How have you been?

39
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,200
Abbot, how have you been?

40
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,520
Thank you for holding

41
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,080
the salvation ceremony
for my brothers back then

42
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,240
and bringing their family letters back

43
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,960
so that they could rest in peace.

44
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,160
I wouldn't dare take the credit.

45
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,040
The family letters were brought back
by a female almsgiver.

46
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,820
A female almsgiver?

47
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,160
Did Young Lord Xiao die here?

48
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Amitabha.

49
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,280
I've been here for 10 days,

50
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,840
and you're the only one
who came here to pay respects.

51
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,140
Almsgiver, where did you come from?

52
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,560
The capital.

53
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,760
Almsgiver, can you do me

54
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,080
a favor?

55
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,120
Master, go ahead.

56
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,440
I need to

57
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,680
chant and pray here
for 49 days to comfort

58
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,560
the lost souls.

59
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,760
These are the family letters
written by the warriors.

60
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,360
Almsgiver, can you take them back
to the Cibei Temple in the capital?

61
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,600
Master, I won't let you down.

62
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,000
Yun...

63
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,680
General!

64
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,640
The Ministry of Justice
arrested Lord Lu,

65
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,400
saying she's suspected of
assisting Lady Lin.

66
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
The Ministry of Justice?

67
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,360
They work for the vicious old woman.

68
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,320
She went to the court

69
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,280
right after the arrest.

70
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
In the 20th year
of the reign of Emperor Yong'an,

71
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,520
Queen Yi'an ordered me
to poison Chen Zhaoyi.

72
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,600
That summer,

73
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,680
a plague broke out at the Censorate,

74
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,120
and 29 people died.

75
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,520
It was His Highness
who ordered me to poison them.

76
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,680
Auntie,

77
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,600
do you know

78
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,400
how to take Lady Zhou down?

79
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,880
In the 30th year
of the reign of Emperor Yong'an,

80
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,560
Lady Zhou ordered me to poison
her brother Xiao Hu

81
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,120
and fake his suicide.

82
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:10,060
(Poisoned the imperial minister.)

83
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,520
(Chuyi,)

84
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,160
(the enemy is much more cunning
than we expected.)

85
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,200
(Hope we can be a couple
in the next life.)

86
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,980
(Long-lasting Prosperity)

87
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,240
Your Majesty!

88
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,160
I didn't manage the family well.

89
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,040
Yanru's wife made a huge mistake,

90
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,000
and Yanyu's wife was tempted

91
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,670
to assist her.

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,880
I'm so ashamed!

93
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,200
Your Majesty,

94
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,080
please withdraw the title of
Rank-2 Honorary Lady!

95
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,280
My Lady.

96
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,960
I think it's enough.

97
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,120
Don't go too far.

98
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,040
You don't understand.

99
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,920
Now that Lu Yunxi is in jail,

100
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,880
I have to convince His Majesty

101
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,400
that I want to cut ties with her.

102
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
How about the Ministry of Justice?

103
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,560
The minister said

104
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,080
although Lady Lu is just a suspect,

105
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,960
she'll be imprisoned and tortured

106
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,480
for a few days.

107
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,480
Good.

108
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,280
Luckily, my nephew is not around.

109
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
My Lady,

110
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,560
you're pretending it again
in front of His Majesty.

111
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,800
Is she still kneeling?

112
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,120
She's so old.

113
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,160
People might think I'm punishing her.

114
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,960
Tell her to go back.

115
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,880
Aye.

116
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,800
Your Majesty.

117
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
The embezzlement case

118
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,800
is solved,

119
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,500
and my aunt is not involved.

120
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,840
However, she's the lady in charge
who's should be

121
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,760
responsible.

122
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,760
If we let her go like this,

123
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,240
she'll feel so guilty.

124
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,360
It's inappropriate.

125
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,840
She's my teacher's wife.

126
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,240
I can't punish her
for some questionable findings.

127
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,880
I have an idea.

128
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,640
You're so eager

129
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,360
to punish others.

130
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,120
What about you?

131
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,400
I knew it was inappropriate
to kidnap the Grand Censor

132
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,080
in public. I should be punished.

133
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,360
However, I hope my aunt and I
can be punished together.

134
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,520
Your Majesty, please.

135
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,640
Okay.

136
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,200
Thanks, Your Majesty.

137
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,160
I'll accept the punishment.

138
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,240
Wait a minute.

139
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
Lately, Liuyun has been arresting
the merchants involved in the case.

140
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,680
When she's back,

141
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,240
we'll prepare for the wedding.

142
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,480
His Majesty has known your regrets

143
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,400
and ordered you to go back

144
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,440
and reflect on yourself
in the ancestral hall.

145
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,800
Thanks, Your Majesty!

146
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,680
I'll definitely reflect on myself

147
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,730
and manage the family well

148
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,080
to repay your kindness!

149
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,180
By the way,

150
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,030
General Xiao will be punished
for kidnapped the Grand Censor.

151
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,960
His Majesty ordered him
to reflect on himself with you.

152
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,580
(Xiao Hu Committed Suicide
in the Prison)

153
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,000
His Majesty ordered us to release you.

154
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,560
Did His Majesty know this?

155
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,480
General Xiao pleaded for mercy.

156
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,840
He's in charge of the embezzlement case.

157
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,560
He found out
that you didn't assist Lady Lin.

158
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,720
It was him.

159
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,980
(Zhou's Mansion)

160
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,280
Aunt.

161
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,800
It's not time yet.

162
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,640
General said

163
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,960
she should take it seriously.

164
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,880
The seniors should set an example.

165
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,120
She can't eat this.

166
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,080
General,

167
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,440
after reading
all kinds of medical books,

168
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,480
I made...

169
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,040
General, why is your pulse so unstable?

170
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,400
Doctor Wu,

171
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,120
did you find the cure?

172
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,920
I found a case where the patient
had very similar symptoms.

173
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,370
I made some pills.

174
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,360
Take the medicine every day,

175
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,320
and maybe you'll get better.

176
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,040
General, did it work?

177
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,880
If it works,

178
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,640
I'll make more pills.
