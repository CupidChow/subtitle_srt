saved me many times.

can't save him.

124
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,040
Answer me.

125
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,680
Is fighting poison with poison

126
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,560
the only method?

127
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,640

130
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,800
Unfortunately,

131
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
she was sentenced to death
many years ago.

If you want the cure,

145

(The Golden Mean)
to see him.

148
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,400
My Lord,

149
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,720
the traitors of the Xiaojie Army
broke into the prison

150
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,160
and kidnapped Lady Lu last night.

151
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,240
My Lord, calm down.

152
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,000
General Xiao saved her

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,920
and sent her back.

154
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,440
He also reported to His Majesty

155
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,040
that he replaced the drug she gave him
and pretended

156
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
to be poisoned

157
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,440
to lure the traitors.

158
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,740
His Majesty has ordered them
to release her.

159

Long live the emperor.

160
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,120
His Majesty knew
you knelt for an entire day and

161
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,160
didn't eat anything,

162
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,600
so he allowed you
to go home by carriage.

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,640
That's very kind of His Majesty.

164
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,520

165
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840

Is the Grand Tutor
asking me for a favor?

171
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,920
It's about Yunxi.

172
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,560
I have no choice.

173
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,400
What happened to her?

174
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,040
Cousin, haven't you noticed

175
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,920
