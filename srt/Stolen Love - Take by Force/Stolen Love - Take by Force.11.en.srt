Don't worry.

Close your eyes.

25
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,680
Don't be afraid.

26
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,120
Let's go.

27
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,860
(I'm gone. Don't worry.)

28
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,680
I know where she is.

29
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,920

Who is she?

33
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Do you remember Mother
used to sweep the tomb

34
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,840
of her best friend Aunt Chang?

35
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Wasn't she beheaded
for poisoning the emperor?

36
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,880
I found out by chance

37
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,760
that someone replaced her
with a condemned prisoner

38
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,520
and imprisoned her to force her

39
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,880
to provide poison formula.

40
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,280
She refused to do it,

41
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,200
so they locked her in the water dungeon.

42
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,840
Auntie.

43
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,300
(Beloved Father Chang Shan,
Beloved Mother Ding Yun)

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,520

Auntie!

46

Auntie!

47
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,240
My skills are as good as before,

48
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,640
but my body

49
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,560
is old.

50
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,360
I couldn't

51
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
dodge the attack.

52
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Let's see a doctor.

53
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,800
Brat,

54
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,760
I missed the chance
to heal myself on purpose.

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
I didn't intend

56
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,160
to go back alive.

57
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,880
It's my fault.

58
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,360
I was sentenced to death,

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,840
and your mother sold everything
to see me off.

60
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,360
Before I die,

61
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,600
I saw my best friend's son,

62
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,800
visited my parents,

63
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,640
and enjoyed the view outside.

64
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,960
It's all worth it.

65
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,920
No.

66
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,120
Auntie.

67
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,520
There's got to be a way.

68
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,760
We managed to get you out,

69
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,520
and we'll find a way to save you.

70
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,160
Stop wasting time.

71
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,000
I need to tell Yunxi

72
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,240
something important.

73
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,240
Brat,

74
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,720
leave us alone.

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
You tried

76
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,720
to ask me many times.

77
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,360
Now

78
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,320
we're alone.

79
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,080
Just ask me.

80
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,560
Auntie.

81
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,160
Xiao Chuyi's aunt

82
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,640
is my enemy.

83
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,200
Do you have any evidence?

84
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,480
Xiao Wan'er?

85
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,640
Yes.

86
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,840
Do you remember

87
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,400
Lord Zhou's maid
who died of obstructed labor?

88
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,840
She was the first person I killed.

89
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,520
Xiao Wan'er

90
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,840
threatened me with my parents' lives

91
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,600
to make poison

92
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,640
that could make her look
as if she died of obstructed labor.

93
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,960
I still remember

94
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,600
the baby had a crescent birthmark

95
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,080
on the arm.

96
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
Auntie,

97
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,280
do you know

98
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,840
how to take Lady Zhou down?

99
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,640
Come closer.

100
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,160
I'll tell you.

101
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,200
It turns out it was you
who asked me over.

102
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,240
Your Highness.

103
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,240
I've been waiting for this.

104
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Your Highness, I want

105
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,680
to make a deal with you.

106
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,080
Chuyi!

107
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,760
I hope

108
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,120
I'll never be reborn

109
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,400

112
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
I asked Aunt Chang to cure you

113
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,760
because I wanted
to repay you and Aunt Xiao

114
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,440
for saving my life.

115
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,560
He was right.

116
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,000
You're going back.

117
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
