General Xiao!

11
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,640
I'm remarried.

12
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,240
Your intrusion

13
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,720
is impolite!

General Xiao?

17
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,640
Yun,

18
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,720
do you know what I've been through

19
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,520
over the past seven years?

20
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
You broke our promise first.

21
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,200
You promised to come back,

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,360
but I only heard

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,920
you were dead.

24
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,400
Yunxi.

25
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,200
Did you fall asleep?

26
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,900
(Zhou Yanyu,
the Grand Tutor of the Crown Prince)

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,640
Yunxi,

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,600
are you okay?

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,120
Tell him to go away.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,320
He's my husband.

31
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
I'm your husband!

32
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,480
Yunxi,

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,360
I'm coming in.

34
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,360
Yunxi,

35
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,440
are you sick?

36
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,920
Why are you coughing?

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,360
Stay back.

38
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,440
I think I caught a cold.

39
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
You're weak.

40
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,880
You'll be infected.

41
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,920
I'll call Doctor Chen.

42
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,040
No need.

43
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,160
Don't let Mother know.

44
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,760
I just need to have some sleep.

45
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,800
You don't need

46
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,480
to greet my mother tomorrow.

47
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
I'll talk to her.

48
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,960
Yanyu.

49
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm tired.

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
Okay.

51
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,040
Rest early.

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,960
Cuixi is so careless.

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,200
She forgot to close the window.

54
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,920
By the way,

55
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,200
I hired a tutor to teach Che the basics.

56
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,520
He's only five years old,

57
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,680
but he's shown exceptional talent.

58
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
It's very kind of you.

59
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,280
Che is our son.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,040
Of course I care about him.

61
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,160
Rest early.

62
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,880
Lu Yunxi...

63
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,440
Before I came here,
I was hoping for the best.

64
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,200
It seems I underestimated you.

65
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,760
Did you have a crush on my weak cousin
a long time ago?

66
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,840
You were so eager to give him a child

67
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,400
less than a month
after you heard about my death.

68
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,080
Xiao Chuyi.

69
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,560
You can insult me,

70
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,200
but Che is innocent.

71
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,120
Why is he better than me?

72
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,520
Is it because he has a stronger body

73
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,240
that can please you more than I do?

74
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,240
Or is it because his family

75
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,960
can make you wealthy?

76
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,440
You're the valiant Grand General now.

77
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,040
Many rich and powerful people

78
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,320
want you to marry their daughters.

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,720
And I'm

80
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,880
someone else's wife.

81
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,600
Grand General,

82
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,720
please behave yourself.

83
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,720
Behave myself?

84
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,000
Lu Yunxi...

85
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,360
Do you really think I would touch you?

86
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,540
=Stolen Love=

87
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,540
=Episode 1=

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,760
By the grace of heaven,

89
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,120
the emperor hereby decrees

90
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
that Xiao Chuyi, General of the Cavalry,

91
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,920
with his loyalty and bravery,

92
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
defeated the enemy,
recovered the lost territories...

93
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,400
His Majesty bestowed so many rewards

94
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,040
and allowed you to ride a horse
in the palace

95
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,930
with armor on.

96
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,400
That's the highest honor.

97
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
Protected the people,

98
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,560
and brought glory to the nation.

99
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,680
He is promoted to Rank-1 Grand General

100
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,800
and appointed Class-1 Bravery Duke.

101
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,080
End of the decree.

102
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,560
Chuyi,

103
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,440
kneel to accept this,

104
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,000
or people will criticize you.

105
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,200
General!

106
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,050
My Lord!

107
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,520
Drawing weapons

108
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
in the palace is a capital offense.

109
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,480
Long live the emperor.

110
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
Seven years.

111
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,680
It's been seven years,

112
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,160
and you've become
the Grand Tutor of the Crown Prince.

113
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,960
You're so successful.

114
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,400
However, Cousin, we need

115
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,440
to sort a few things out.

116
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,080
How has

117
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,640
my wife been

118
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
at your mansion?

119
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,000
Does this belong to you?

120
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,920
Chuyi,

121
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,400
the past is in the past.

122
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,000
I hope

123
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,520
you can stay away from my wife.

124
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
Cousin, you've always liked
stealing my lines.

125
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,480
Now you're the Grand Tutor,

126
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,880
but you haven't changed at all.

127
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,880
I'll take back

128
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,960
everything I've lost.

129
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,680
Let's go.

130
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,800
Tomorrow, my mother will be granted
the title of Rank-2 Honorary Lady.

131
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,720
General, please come.

132
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,940
Mother,

133
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,020
seven years ago,

134
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,700
less than ten days after Xiao Chuyi died
in the battle at Luoxia Ridge,

135
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,340
(Xiao Wan'er, Lady in Charge)
his family was arrested for embezzlement.

136
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,620
His uncle committed suicide,
and his aunt died

137
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,100
(Lady Lin, Second Son's Wife)
in a fire.

138
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,150
Lu Yunxi remarried Yanyu

139
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,700
right after they died.

140
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,660
It turns out Xiao Chuyi didn't die

141
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,140
but returned in triumph.

142
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,420
He's a vengeful

143
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,940
living devil.

144
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,100
Will we be in trouble?

145
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,820
Lu Yunxi is such a vixen.

146
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
They even said Yanyu
was so obsessed with

147
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,460
the most beautiful woman
in Tianyun Kingdom

148
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,660
that he had to marry her.

149
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,660
Mother,

150
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,300
you should've stopped him.

151
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,660
Yanyu has been frail since he was born.

152
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,580
He has to take medicine every day.

153
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,260
When he heard about Xiao Chuyi's death,

154
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,020
he was eager to marry her

155
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,460
because he was worried
that Lu Yunxi would be exiled.

156
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,820
Luckily, Lu Yunxi and her son
are not in the family tree.

157
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,220
We can keep Che

158
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,980
and kick her out.

159
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,940
It's not too late.

160
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,540
You're so stupid.

161
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,260
Xiao Chuyi just returned.

162
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,620
If people find out

163
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,900
about this,

164
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,660
Yanyu's reputation will be ruined.

165
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,860
Greetings,

166
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,420
Mother.

167
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,500
It's been seven years
since you came here,

168
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,780
but you only have one child,

169
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,500
and Yanyu still refuses
to take a concubine.

170
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,500
Like I said,

171
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,340
he should've married
someone more capable.

172
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,500
I've put up with you for seven years.

173
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,180
If you can't bear more children
for our family,

174
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,100
I won't have mercy on you.

175
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,740
Tomorrow, Mother will be granted
the title of Rank-2 Honorary Lady.

176
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,900
Yunxi, the ceremony mustn't be delayed.

177
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,100
Please take the clothes back
and finish it.

178
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,340
I got it.

179
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,660
(Cuixi, Maid)

180
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,660
Yunxi,

181
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,060
Cuixi's needlework is as good as yours.

182
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,180
She can help you.

183
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,460
Mother won't find out.

184
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,980
I tried to persuade her,

185
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,620
but she wouldn't let me help her.

186
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,940
Mother has always wanted to be
Rank-2 Honorary Lady.

187
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,780
As the heir's wife,

188
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,980
I should make the official robe for her.

189
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,180
Give me some time.

190
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,220
I'll ask His Majesty
to grant you a title.

191
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,300
It's late.

192
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,460
You should go to sleep.

193
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,860
You need to go to the court tomorrow.

194
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,420
I'll finish it quickly.

195
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,980
My Lady,

196
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,700
since you came here,

197
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,420
you've been a good wife

198
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,140
and daughter-in-law.

199
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,220
Everyone in the capital

200
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,060
knows about this.

201
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,100
Besides,

202
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,980
you never stopped him
from taking a concubine.

203
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,180
- It was he...
- Cuixi.

204
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,220
I just don't think it's worth it.

205
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,060
Lady Zhou didn't blame Lady Lin

206
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,140
for having no children,

207
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,660
but she wouldn't let Che and you
join the family tree.

208
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,300
My Lady,

209
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,580
General Xiao is back.

210
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,820
Why don't we talk to him?

211
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,740
Nonsense.

212
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,020
(Chuyi,)

213
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,220
(I thought you were dead.)

214
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,260
(Now we're only separated.)

215
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,020
(I should be content.)

216
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,260
(Lu Yunxi,)

217
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,020
(you can't lose control.)

218
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,540
(Zhou's Mansion)
The emperor

219
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,140
hereby decrees

220
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,460
that Lady Zhou

221
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,940
has been kind

222
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,380
and diligent

223
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,380
and made the Zhou Family thrive.

224
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,940
Given her

225
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,500
great contributions,

226
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,020
she is appointed Rank-2 Honorary Lady

227
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,540
with glory.

228
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,060
End of the decree.

229
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,900
Long live the emperor.

230
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,740
