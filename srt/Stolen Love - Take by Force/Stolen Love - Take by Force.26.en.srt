11
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm an idiot!

12
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,040
I've stayed with General Xiao.

13
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,520
How come I've never noticed that?

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,600
Vice General, don't blame yourself.

15
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,440
I've been in the army for many years

16
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,520
and often checked General Xiao's pulse,

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,960
but I thought it was just unstable.

18
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,120
If it wasn't for Court Lady Chang, I...

19
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,160
I don't believe it!

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,360
There must be a cure!

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,320
There are so many doctors.

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,680
I must find the cure,

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
whatever it takes!

24
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Xu Da...

25
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,960
General.

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,440
Why are you crying?

27
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,200
It's not a big deal.

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,960
Doctor Wu will treat me.

29
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,240
And I'll get well soon.

30
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
No one

31
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,160
can know this.

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,560
Prince Su,

33
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,800
Liuyun,

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,040
don't tell them.

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,640
Understand?

36
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,860
(Three Days Later)

37
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,240
Master, look.
I've brought good stuff here.

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,840
Master, does it hurt?

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,880
I'm a soldier.

40
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,960
It's normal to get injured.

41
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,240
Don't worry.

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,200
Master, look, what is it?

43
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,680
A chestnut cake.

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,160
Back then, every time I got injured
and came back,

45
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,680
someone would buy this for me.

46
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,400
Did your mom ask you to buy this?

47
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,560
I bought it for you, Master.

48
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,680
It's my favorite snack,

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,120
but Mom doesn't want me
to eat too much.

50
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,880
I can only eat it when I'm ill.

51
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,920
It makes me happy.

52
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,840
Master, it's delicious.

53
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,040
Master, please try it.

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,200
Hey.

55
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,200
Master, what do you think of
my sword skills?

56
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,880
It's improved a lot.

57
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,240
After all, you're my disciple.

58
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
I'm the disciple
of the Rank-1 Grand General

59
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,840
who defeated the enemy,

60
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,040
reclaimed the lost land,

61
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,760
and brought peace to...

62
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Enough.

63
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,960
You're so sweet.

64
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
Just like your mom.

65
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,280
Yun.

66
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,120
Let's have a son, okay?

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,480
I'll teach him all my martial arts.

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,640
If one day, I'm gone,

69
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,040
he'll protect you for me.

70
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,080
We just got married.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,760
It can't be that soon.

72
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,480
Then

73
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,760
I have to work harder.

74
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,920
Master, what's wrong?

75
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,480
Nothing.

76
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,080
I was just thinking

77
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,520
if I had a child,

78
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,040
he'd be at your age,

79
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,920
maybe a year older than you.

80
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,880
Master,

81
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,480
maybe I'm young,

82
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,320
but I'm taller than many classmates.

83
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,960
Nanny often told me
I looked older than my peers,

84
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,840
and I looked like six years old

85
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,520
instead of five years old.

86
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,360
Che,

87
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,480
tell me,

88
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,240
what day is your birthday?

89
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,000
The 9th day of the 5th month
of the 31st Yong'an year.

90
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,800
Three months after they got the news
that I was dead.

91
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,100
(Zhou's Mansion)

92
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,480
Yanyu...

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,600
Lately, I've been having
morning sickness.

94
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,640
I couldn't eat,

95
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,400
and I missed you,

96
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,280
so I came here to see you.

97
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,520
My Lady, Lord Zhou,

98
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,560
congratulations,

99
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,240
the lady

100
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,320
is pregnant.

101
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,520
My body was damaged by the cold.

102
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll never be able to

103
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,280
have children.

104
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,680
My Lord,

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
My Lady,

106
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,200
I know

107
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,120
I can't stay here.

108
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,720
I only hope
you can keep the baby.

109
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,600
I don't want him to

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
wander around

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,600
like I do.

112
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,360
My Lady, please be careful.

113
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,240
Get up.

114
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,120
Come on.

115
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,160
Mother,

116
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm not feeling well.

117
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,040
I have to go.

118
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,120
Lady Yun's issue

119
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,560
is up to you.

120
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,240
Don't worry.

121
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,240
I won't let you down.

122
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,240
(Yunxi,)

123
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,920
(it's not that easy to be)

124
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,640
(the lady in charge.)

125
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,280
Yunxi!

126
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,720
Yunxi!

127
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,160
Listen to me.

128
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,000
Yunxi!

129
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,240
Yunxi!

130
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,080
I was drinking in Zhaixing Tower
the other day,

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,120
and somehow I got drunk.

132
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,320
I don't know why Lady Yun was there.

133
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,080
I don't care what happened.

134
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,160
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,400
I lied to you and Aunt.

136
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm capable of having children.

137
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,960
I just wanted to reassure Aunt

138
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,360
so that she could let me
take care of you.

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,640
You don't need to apologize.

140
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
You wanted to protect us.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,240
What makes me feel sad

142
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
is that we've wasted
so many years of your life.

143
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,960
You still don't have children.

144
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,360
Che is my child.

145
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
Since we got married,

146
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,760
I've treated him like my own son.

147
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,560
But we're not a real couple,

148
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,200
and Che...

149
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,480
In my heart,

150
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,600
you are my real wife.

151
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,360
I need to calm down.

152
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,200
Soldiers.

153
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,200
We're honored to have Grand Tutor

154
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,160
to answer your questions.

155
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,080
If there's anything you want to know,

156
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,920
just ask him.

157
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,160
Stay hungry,

158
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,640
stay foolish,

159
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,440
and you'll be a good learner.

160
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,440
- This...
- My Lord.

161
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,560
We're just a bunch of coarse soldiers.

162
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,040
How can we understand
your obscure words?

163
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,440
Can you tell us something interesting?

164
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
Exactly.

165
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,520
Something interesting.

166
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,920
My Lord,

167
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,960
I don't understand this sentence.

168
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,120
Could you please enlighten me?

169
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,760
I wouldn't dare
steal the fragrant jade and touch it,

170
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,280
but I couldn't stop staring at it.

171
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,720
My Lord, what does it mean?

172
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,460
(The Analects)

173
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,880
It's so rude!

174
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,960
My Lord,

175
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,760
I'm staying foolish, right?

176
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,080
If you don't understand,

177
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,680
I can explain...

178
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,520
Shut up!

179
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,000
"Steal the fragrant jade"

180
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,840
refers to love affairs.

181
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,040
I'm wondering if we can use this

182
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,560
to describe the love affair

183
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
between you and the dance girl.

184
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
My Lord, don't you agree?

185
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,160
Enough.

186
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,240
After all, we're in the barrack.

187
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,000
Stop laughing,

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,680
or I'll drag you out and beat you.

189
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,680
My Lord,

190
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,680
as you can see,

191
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,160
we're coarse soldiers

192
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,560
who like to listen to

193
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,160
some interesting folk stories.

194
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,800
Please don't blame us.

195
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,200
My Lord, don't go.

196
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,240
Tell us more.

197
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,120
He's leaving.

198
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,080
Exactly.

199
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
Yes.

200
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,140
(Zhou's Mansion)

201
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,000
My Lady,

202
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,960
Lady Zhou asked me
to stay in Lord Zhou's study

203
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,480
and take care of him

204
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,720
when he's working at night.

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,840
I...

206
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,040
Lady Zhou told you to stay.

207
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,440
Then stay here and take care of him.

208
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,480
Tomorrow, I'll discuss with Mother

209
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,400
about letting you join the family.

210
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,440
The color of the quilt is too bright.

211
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,400
Lord Zhou doesn't like it.

212
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,160
Ask them to change it.

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,000
Aye.

214
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,280
Thanks, My Lady.

215
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,680
Who let you in?

216
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,760
Lady Lu told me to stay.

217
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,520
She asked me to take care of you.

218
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,360
Stop!

219
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,440
(Yunxi,)

220
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,520
(if I let her stay,)

221
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,960
(will you get jealous?)

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,960
Do you want to stay?

223
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,400
I want to serve you, My Lord.

224
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,240
If you like kneeling,

225
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,840
kneel

226
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,040
until dawn.

227
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,440
Well,

228
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,480
you can't?

229
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,400
I'll do it.

230
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,960
My Lady,

231
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,440
everyone in the capital
knows about this.

232
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Have we gone too far?

233
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,680
After all, Lady Yun is a dance girl.

234
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,800
How can she replace Lu Yunxi?

235
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,920
Tell the servants privately

236
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,600
that something's wrong
with Young Lord Che's birthday.

237
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,600
Perhaps he's not Yanyu's son.

238
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,840
My Lady, it's a big deal.

239
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,320
If people find out,

240
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,440
our reputation will be ruined.

241
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,720
Reputation?

242
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,800
Only Lu Yunxi's reputation
will be ruined.

243
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,720
It has nothing to do with our family.

244
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,480
Lady Yun is not that simple.

245
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,360
No matter who Che's father is,

246
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,960
I'll use Lady Yun
to get rid of Lu Yunxi.

247
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,380
(Zhou's Mansion)

248
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,080
Yunxi.

249
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,280
Yunxi,

250
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,880
this tree was planted
on our wedding day,

251
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
embodying a good marriage

252
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,320
and a happy family.

253
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,080
Don't worry.

254
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,560
I'll tell her to leave.

255
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,840
Yanyu.

256
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,640
I was going to tell Mother

257
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,200
that you should take her as a concubine.

258
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
You don't mind?

259
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,160
I'm glad that you can

260
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,320
have a child.

261
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,040
I'll treat the child well

262
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,320
like you did to Che.

263
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,000
After the worship ceremony,

264
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,720
if you want to marry her,

265
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,480
I'll leave with Che.

266
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,000
You don't care at all?

267
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,000
It's been seven years.

268
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,040
I thought you'd understand
my love for you.

269
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,240
However,

270
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,320
you've never loved me.

271
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,080
It's my fault.

272
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,720
I thought

273
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,960
we were helping each other.

274
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,040
If I had known this,

275
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,680
I wouldn't have married you.

276
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,960
Yunxi!

277
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,440
My Lord, My Lady!

278
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,320
Lady Zhou took Che away!

279
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,520
She told you to come!

280
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,280
Mother!

281
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,000
- Che!
- Mom! Dad!

282
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,680
Guards.

283
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,000
Take Young Lord Che to the backroom.

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,840
How dare you?

285
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,720
Cuixi!

286
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,800
Mother,

287
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,120
what are you doing?

288
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,000
