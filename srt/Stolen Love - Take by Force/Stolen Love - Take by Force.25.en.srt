General

12
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,920
we saw Grand Tutor yesterday.

13
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,840
It seems he was abducted.

14
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
What did you say?

15
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,640
Abducted.

16
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,920
- General!
- My Lady!

17
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,720
You just recovered from the fever.

18
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,920
General,

19
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,560
Yanyu is just

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,840
a weak scholar.

21
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,240
I'm afraid he can't handle it.

22
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,040
General, please save him.

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,880
I was seriously injured and nearly died

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,240
because of you.

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,720
Now you're begging me to save him.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,640
Have you ever thought about me?

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,360
General, I'll never forget

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,640
what you've done for me.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,840
I'll certainly pay you back.

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,760
However, Yanyu is my husband.

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,080
I have to save him.

32
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
If you don't help me,

33
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,240
I'll save him myself.

34
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,720
You're so in love with each other.

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,400
If I save him,

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,120
what will you give me in return?

37
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,640
Whatever you need.

38
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,160
Xu Da.

39
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,440
Help her save her husband.

40
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,960
Are we going back?

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,480
I'm not feeling well.

42
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,120
I'll stay here tonight.

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,280
Brother, let's go.

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,120
Aye.

45
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,920
We were exhausted last night

46
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,480
because of that woman.

47
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,840
Your family should pay us

48
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,240
some silver as compensation.

49
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,440
Do you know who I am?

50
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,520
You kidnapped an imperial official!

51
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
We're all desperadoes

52
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,320
who have killed many people.

53
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,880
When our boss is back,

54
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,320
you'll be over.

55
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,800
Yanyu!

56
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,560
Yunxi,

57
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,880
are you okay?

58
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,040
I'm fine.

59
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
But you...

60
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,880
Did they hurt you?

61
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,440
It's okay.

62
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,720
Just some scratches.

63
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,200
I can handle it.

64
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,920
I got you into this.

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,720
My Lord,

66
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,480
the room is ready.

67
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,760
Please take a rest.

68
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,960
My Lady,

69
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,920
he's waiting for you.

70
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,000
Yunxi,

71
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,480
what's going on?

72
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,080
Go to rest.

73
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,320
I have to put an end to this.

74
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,240
I'll wait for you.

75
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,240
I'll keep my promise.

76
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
General, what do you want?

77
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,200
Sit down and have a drink.

78
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,840
Since I came back,

79
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,600
we haven't talked calmly.

80
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,680
What do you want to talk about?

81
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,000
I can save Zhou Yanyu,

82
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,840
so I can also kill him.

83
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,080
We're in the middle of nowhere.

84
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,680
No one will know

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,280
whether it's me or the cruel bandits.

86
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,120
Yun.

87
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,080
If you don't tell me your true feelings,

88
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,920
I'll go crazy for you one more time.

89
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,080
You don't believe

90
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,760
that I no longer love you,

91
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,960
or you don't think
you can keep the promise?

92
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,360
When I become the lady in charge,

93
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,520
I'll work with the Crown Prince.

94
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,520
You can neither give up on revenge

95
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,800
nor betray Prince Su.

96
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,960
In that case, you'll have to kill me.

97
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,800
Are you saying that all of this
is just my fantasy?

98
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,640
But why would you approach
the powerful people in the capital

99
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,120
and come here to visit the Zhous?

100
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,280
I want to prepare a gift for you.

101
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
When I become the lady in charge,

102
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,920
you can kill my mother-in-law.

103
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,000
What do you mean?

104
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,760
General, aren't you always wondering

105
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,280
why I can't wait until she dies?

106
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,280
Because I want to use her

107
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,120
to make you stop hating the Zhou Family

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,040
so that Yanyu, Che, and I

109
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
can live a peaceful life.

110
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,720
I'll ask you one last question.

111
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,120
Do you love Zhou Yanyu?

112
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
Do you love him more than me?

113
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,800
So, what bothers you

114
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,640
is that I fell in love with
someone else.

115
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,040
My relationship with him

116
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,360
is not just about love.

117
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
We've been together for seven years.

118
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,000
It's not as passionate

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,680
as our poppy love,

120
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,200
but he understands me

121
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,040
and helps me...

122
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,920
Enough!

123
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,960
I'll be the lady in charge,

124
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,800
and you'll be the Prince Consort.

125
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,960
We'll be

126
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,880
even.

127
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
General, isn't it great?

128
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,200
Great.

129
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
So great.

130
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,880
Since you want us to be even,

131
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,240
