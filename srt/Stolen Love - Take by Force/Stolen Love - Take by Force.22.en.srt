00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,280
General, thank you for saving me.

12
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,420
I made a slingshot for you

13
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,640
in return.

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
Thank you for this.

15
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,640
However, does your mom know
you're here?

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,920
Che!

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,840
It's getting late.

18
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,440
Why are you running around?

19
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,920
Mom, I won't get lost again.

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,400
I promise, I'll never leave
the Zhou's Mansion

21
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,800
without your permission.

22
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,360
I was freaked out.

23
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,880
Che.

24
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you want to learn martial arts?

25
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,440
Yes!

26
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,600
General, stop kidding.

27
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,960
Che is too young.

28
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,800
He'll learn it when he's older.

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,880
Mom, I'm old enough to learn it.

30
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
Let's go back.

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,800
Yunxi, why are you so nervous?

32
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,840
Are you afraid that I might

33
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,160
find your secret?

34
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,760
General, I don't understand.

35
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,440
I went to an ancient temple,

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,640
and the abbot told me

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,040
seven years ago, the family letters...

38
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,440
Mom, please allow me
to learn martial arts.

39
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,600
I want to protect you.

40
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,920
Che.

41
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,560
How about this?

42
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,920
If you can snatch this slingshot

43
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,520
from your mom's hand,

44
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,520
I'll take it as a yes.

Xiao Chuyi.

46
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,040
If you don't want him to get it,

47
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,440
just don't give it to him.

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,600
In this way, he won't be disappointed.

49
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,640

50
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,640
Mom, I'm coming.

51
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,400
It's not that easy.

52
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,360

I'll discuss it with your dad later.

67
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,400
Dad!

68
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,800
Dad, Uncle wanted
to teach me martial arts.

69
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
Do you agree?

70
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,360
Che, it's getting late.

71
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,640
I'll think about it

72
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,960
and answer you tomorrow, okay?

73
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,480
(Yun,)

74
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,560

78
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,480
Che,

79
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,600
stop doing this,

80
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,440
or I'll get angry.

81
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,640
Mom,

82
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,280
why don't Dad and you want me
to learn martial arts from Uncle?

83
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,600
He saved

84
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,920
both of us.

85
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,760
Are you that eager to learn it?

86
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,320
Then from now on,

87
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,880
you can't slack off anymore.

88
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,540
Dad, is that a yes?

89
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,320
Yes.

90
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,040
- Yanyu...
- Great! Thanks, Dad!

91
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,760
It's good that Che likes Chuyi.

92
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,720
He's lucky to learn

93
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,440
martial arts from Chuyi.

94
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,320
Thanks, Dad.

95
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,280
Thanks, Mom.

96
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,120
I'll tell Master.

97
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,640
Why did you change your mind?

98
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,520
I thought about it all night.

99
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,520
Maybe they can't be father and son,

100
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,280
but if they are master and disciple,

101
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,920
our wish will be fulfilled,

102
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,000
right?

103
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,480
Thank you,

104
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,920
Yanyu.

105
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
We're married.

106
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,280
Don't be too polite.

107
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,720
We suffered a great loss
due to the embezzlement case.

108
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
We're losing.

109
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Lord Zhou, do you know
how to turn the table?

110
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,960
Good move.

111
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,000
I was about to win.

112
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,680
Your Highness, maybe
I was showing weakness

113
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
to win the game.

114
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,640
Showing weakness?

115
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,560
Prince Su will definitely humiliate me.

116
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,880
Your Highness, do you know

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,040
how Sun Bin managed to kill Pang Juan?

118
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,720
Keep showing weakness

119
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,480
and strike the fatal blow

120
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,160
when the enemy is numb

121
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,200
and off-guard.

122
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,600
Exactly.

123
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,800
We don't need to be afraid of him.

124
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,160
However,

125
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,600
it's difficult to deal with
Grand General Xiao Chuyi.

126
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,400
If we're not 100 percent sure
that we can defeat him,

127
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,680
we shouldn't provoke him.

128
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,800
If we can't get rid of him for good,

129
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,440
he'll come back and destroy us.

130
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,240
I got it.

131
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,060
(Apprenticeship Letter)

132
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,980

133
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,120
Master, please drink the tea.

134
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,720
The Xiao Family has cultivated
numerous generals for generations.

135
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,600
We pass on martial arts

136
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,640
and stay loyal to the country.

137
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,920
Zhou Che,

138
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
if you want to be my disciple,

139
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,720
you must remember my family motto.

140
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,760
Be an upright person

141
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,960
who brings justice to the world.

142
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,480
Be a fearless person

143
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,440
who has no regrets.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,400
Master, I'll keep that in mind.

145
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,960
My father gave me this

146
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,720
when I went to the frontier
seven years ago.

147
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,480
I've fought the enemy with this.

148
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,360
Now,

149
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,800
I'm giving it to you.

150
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,840
Thanks, Master.

151
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,600
I want to be a big hero

152
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,040
like you.

153
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,000
Che.

154
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,720
I'm not a hero.

155
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Remember,

156
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,680
a hero must

157
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,080
defend the country

158
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,640
and protect his loved ones.

159
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,120
I got it.

160
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,760
A warrior must be strong.

161
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,400
Starting tomorrow,

162
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,720
we'll climb Xishan Mountain.

163
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,680
Well,

164
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
do you have a problem?

165
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,920
Regulate your breathing.

166
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,160
Che!

167
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,120
General,

168
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,640
I've prepared some fruits.

169
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,560
You can take a break.

170
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,880
Master, try it.

171
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,080
You forgot your mom

172
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,160
after having a master.

173
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,120
Usually, you'd give it to Lady Lu first.

174
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,560
I love both of them.

175
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,440
You're good at flattering.

176
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,680
Try it.

177
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,920
It's good.

178
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,200
Master, what wish did you write?

179
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,240
I hope you can grow up quickly

180
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,680
and be my successor.

181
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,160
You're lying.

182
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,280
I saw my mom's name.

183
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,720
It's obvious that I hope everyone
can be safe.

184
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,840
What did you write? Let me see.

185
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,720
(No Study)
Please don't!

186
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,560
Master, study is so boring.

187
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,720
I get sleepy
as soon as I enter the classroom.

188
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
No wonder you're my disciple.

189
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,280
I was also like this back in the day.

190
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,720
I didn't want to study at all.

191
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,920
General.

192
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,080
However, you need to learn
some important knowledge.

193
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,960
It'll help you become a good general.

194
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,320
(No Study)
Mom,

195
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,720
let's release the sky lantern together.

196
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,040
(Health and Happiness)
One, two, three.

197
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,860
(Thinking of You, Yunxi)

198
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,440
Mom, Master,

199
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,360
the lantern is so high.

200
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,600
So high.

201
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,420
(Thinking of You, Yunxi)

202
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,560
Yunxi,

203
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
can you notice me

204
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,160
for once?

205
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,520
Get out.

206
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,080
Aye.

207
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Yunxi...

208
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,640
