The essays of the three examinees

13
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,160
are equally outstanding.

14
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,120
Lord Zhou, which one
do you think is the best?

15
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,160
I'll make him the top scholar.

16
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,800
Lord Zhou.

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,160
Your Majesty,

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
I think the best one is...

19
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,360
Your Majesty.

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,120
Did you find the criminal?

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,200
We've found out who did it.

22
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,360
It's...

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,200
Who is it?

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,120
Grand Tutor's wife.

25
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,560
It's impossible!

26
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,440
We've known each other since childhood.

27
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,760
She's kind and obedient.

28
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,920
She couldn't have done it.

29
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,760
If I didn't know,

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,720
why would I summon you
early in the morning?

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,040
Didn't you claim to be a loyal man

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,240
who's never involved in the infight
between the princes?

33
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,720
(The Golden Mean)
If your wife is involved,

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
how can you lead the civil officials

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,920
and pin down the military generals
such as Xiao Chuyi?

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,200
Thank you for your concern.

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,640
However, my wife is just a woman.

38
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,320
Could you please let me go back
and talk to her?

39
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,160
Why don't you understand?

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
Xiao Chuyi is the leader
of the generals.

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,480
If I don't punish the poisoner,

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,040
the soldiers on the frontier
will be disappointed.

43
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,880
Your Majesty, please think twice.

44
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,280
Lord Zhou,

45
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,240
grade the papers in the study

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,880
in the next few days.

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,720
Do not go home.

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,000
Your Majesty!

49
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,700
(Prisoner)

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,800
Tell me!

51
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,800
Where's the cure?

52
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,920
Lady Lu,

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,680
I'm just following the order.

54
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Tell us the truth.

55
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,720
It's good for all of us.

56
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,080
She's the Grand Tutor's wife,

57
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,040
and His Majesty
didn't ask us to kill her.

58
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
If she dies,

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,080
we'll be punished.

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,680
Is that all you've got?

61
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,440
Paper suffocation?

62
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,160
Water dungeon?

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
Bring it on.

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,200
Water dungeon?

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,520
Lady Lu has soft skin.

66
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,880
Lock her in the water dungeon
for a few days.

67
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,680
When her skin is ulcerated

68
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,520
and bitten by leeches,

69
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,800
she'll tell the truth.

70
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,760
- General.
- Xu Da.

71
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,480
General.

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,200
Come on.

73
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
Chuyi,

74
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,800
you acted on your own again.

75
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,760
We agreed to pretend to be poisoned

76
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,040
to lure the Crown Prince's eyes
in the army.

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Why did you risk your life?

78
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,480
I knew His Majesty would send
the best doctor here,

79
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,880
and he'd find out.

80
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Besides, I wanted to know

81
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,160
if she would...

82
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,480
- General!
- Chuyi!

83
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,600
Stop thinking about her!

84
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,560
She poisoned you

85
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,400
and took the blame!

86
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,250
Xu Da!

87
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,200
What happened to her?

88
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,160
What happened to her?

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,720
She's in prison.

90
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
Xu Da.

91
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,920
Get my clothes.

92
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,640
I need to see His Majesty.

93
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,680
General!

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,720
You should worry about yourself.

95
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,080
She did it

96
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,740
because she knew
Lady Zhou would protect her!

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,680
Chuyi, we've planned this
for a long time,

98
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,120
and you're seriously injured.

99
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,560
We can't give up.

100
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,640
Wait for another day.

101
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,240
When we find the traitors,

102
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
I'll definitely get her out.

103
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,320
Brother,

104
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,120
let's talk to His Majesty.

105
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,480
Right now.

106
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,680
Chuyi!

107
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,200
We were so close to success.

108
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,160
The woman of Wujiang died,

109
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,980
and we'd get away with it.

110
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,960
However,

111
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,520
Lu Yunxi ruined my plan.

112
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,400
I remember she was once thrown into
the Orphan Cave filled with dead bodies

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,480
and survived for over a month
by eating cockroaches.

114
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,720
She came here

115
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,640
right after the Xiaos were eliminated

116
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,800
and married your son.

117
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,000
Do you really think such a tough girl

118
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,880
would die for your family?

119
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,240
I don't know

120
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,120
whether she wants to protect us

121
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
or destroy us.

122
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,200
We can't keep her.

123
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,080
I'll send someone

124
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,320
to kill her in the prison.

125
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,280
Why don't we

126
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,280
kill two birds with one stone?

127
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,960
Xiao Chuyi should also die.

128
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,480
Let me take care of this.

129
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,640
Great carbonized hair!

130
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,280
If I can make poison

131
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,160
with red arsenic,

132
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,360
white arsenic,

133
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,760
and this...

134
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,560
Why aren't you scared of me?

135
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,600
General Xiao ordered me

136
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
to protect you, My Lady.

137
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,640
(Xiaojie Army?)

138
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,720
Yun!

139
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,080
General.

140
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,200
Come on.

141
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,880
How dare you hit me?

142
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,840
General,

143
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,240
they took the bait.

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,960
We're at your disposal.

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
We've waited for a long time.

146
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,760
Don't worry, we'll kill all the traitors.

147
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,040
Have they taken action?

148
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,040
Most soldiers of Xiaojie Army
haven't moved,

149
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,400
but six traitors headed towards
the west of the city.

150
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,920
The west of the city?

151
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,320
They're going to the prison.

152
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,000
Prison?

153
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,560
They're going to hurt Lady Lu.

154
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,480
Help me put my armor on.

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,160
You're poisoned.

156
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,400
I'm the boss here.

157
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Are you going alone?

158
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,040
They're very strong.

159
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,760
You can't defeat them at this point.

160
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
If everyone goes,

161
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,120
they'll go crazy,

162
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,040
and Yun will be in danger.

163
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,480
Xu Da, listen.

164
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,640
This is

165
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
the top secret.

166
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,080
Don't tell anyone.

167
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,120
Aye!

168
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,000
Go!

169
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,680
Go!

170
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,280
You're so pretty. No wonder
Xiao Chuyi is obsessed with you.

171
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,000
If you died like this,

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,280
it would be such a pity.

173
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,680
His Highness ordered us

174
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,400
to kill this woman after rescuing her

175
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,880
in the name of Xiao Chuyi.

176
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,760
Brother Xiao.

177
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,840
Well, you know

178
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
we're brothers.

179
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,560
How dare you hurt

180
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,360
my woman?

181
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,120
You're not poisoned?

182
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,680
You set us up!

183
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,960
Xiaojie Army has the best soldiers

184
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,600
who fought against Wujiang with me
for many years.

185
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,000
We've seen all kinds of poison.

186
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,280
I can't believe you fell for

187
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,600
the Crown Prince's words.

188
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,480
Idiots.

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,880
I came here alone

190
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,280
because I still remember the days
when we fought the enemy together.

191
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,640
Stop now,

192
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,800
or I won't go easy on you.

193
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,040
Brother,

194
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,920
the Crown Prince promised to make me

195
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,400
the Grand General after we kill you,

196
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,360
and we'll all be promoted.

197
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,160
Don't blame us

198
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,680
for pursuing wealth and honor.

199
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,960
One last chance.

200
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,160
Have mercy!

201
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,800
Get lost!

202
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,560
Let's go!

203
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,880
Sorry, Yun.

204
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,720
I'm late.

205
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
You must be scared.

206
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,560
I'll cut off...

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll cut off their arms and legs.

208
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,380
General.

209
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,640
Let's get out of here.

210
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,120
Yun,

211
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,480
you go first.

212
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,400
- Don't worry.
- You saved me.

213
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,160
I can't leave you behind.

214
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's go.

215
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,720
Come on.

216
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,200
Captain Wang, what's wrong?

217
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,200
We've followed General Xiao
for many years.

218
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,680
His silver spear

219
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
can easily cut someone in half.

220
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,040
However, the wound was quite small.

221
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,600
He fooled us! Go!

222
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,760
Yun,

223
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,230
listen to me,

224
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,530
- Search there!
- leave me alone.

225
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,380
Aye!

226
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,480
Go forward.

227
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,040
Search!

228
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,960
- Tell Xu Da...
- Be quiet!

229
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,760
Over there.

230
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,640
He's injured. He must be around.

231
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,920
- Let's go!
- Aye!

232
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,360
Hang in there.

233
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,880
They must be around.

234
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,040
They haven't gone far.

235
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,760
- Go!
- Aye!

236
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,080
Let's go.

237
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,360
Be quiet.
