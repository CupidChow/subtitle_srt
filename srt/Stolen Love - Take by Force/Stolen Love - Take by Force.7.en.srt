Mother, please punish me.

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,760
Aye.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,800
Mother, this screen was a gift from you.

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,240
I'm sorry

22
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,480
that I let you down.

23
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,040
Yanru seldom comes home,

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,800
and Sister is still young.
We must do something.

25
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,200
Could you

26
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,360
ask Sister to stay with Yanru?

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,520
Mind your own business.

28
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,680
You've had medicine
but still can't get pregnant.

29
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,960
You did well

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,800
last time.

31
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,320
Now that we know why he moved in,

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,640
we can't let him harm our family.

33
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,520
Find a way

34
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,880
to apply this medicine to his wound.

35
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,840
What's this?

36
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,760
It's the Weakening Powder.

37
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,480
It won't kill him,

38
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,760
but he'll never be able to lead the army

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,120
or fight the enemy.

40
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,080
Mother, I was careless

41
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,160
and offended him.

42
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,800
Why would he use
the medicine I give him?

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,360
Just figure it out.

44
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,000
If you can't solve this,

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,480
how are you going to be

46
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,480
a good wife and lady in charge?

47
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,520
If you fail,

48
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,280
I'll hand over the position

49
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,520
to Lady Lin.

50
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
Think about it.

51
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,400
Xiao Chuyi, you...

52
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,800
What are you doing?

53
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,680
What are you doing?

54
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,440
This old woman is so vicious.

55
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,680
She wants to make me
more useless than my cousin.

56
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
Xiao Chuyi, what are you doing?

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
Didn't she ask you to ruin me?

58
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,240
What are you waiting for?

59
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,720
You heard it.

60
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,000
What's the point?

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
Use it.

62
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
Don't you want to use me
as a stepping stone?

63
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,840
You've married the heir.

64
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,560
You can't hand over the position
to Lady Lin who's been bullying you.

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,880
Zhou Yanyu can't help you.

66
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,840
But I can.

67
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,640
- Come on.
- Xiao Chuyi!

68
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,600

71
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,840
would you do it?

72
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,480
You chose the Zhou Family.

73
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,480
One of us must die, right?

74
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,800
I don't want you to die.

75
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,600
I should've died seven years ago.

76
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,040
What are you waiting for?

77
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,500
Come on!

78
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
Come on.

79
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,200
If you refuse to do it,

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,880
it'll prove that you still love me.

81
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,880

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,240
He's a bad guy.

139
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,080
I don't want to call him Uncle.

140
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,960

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,440

your father's life

148
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,560
someone poisoned
General Xiao last night.

149
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,640
His Majesty ordered me
to investigate this

150
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,440
and find the person who did this.

151
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,960
Your Highness,

152
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,560
he was poisoned at our mansion,

153
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,320
so we must find out

154
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,120
whether it's our family

155
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,960
or

156
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,560
someone who wanted to frame us.

157
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,840
She's poisoned.

158
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,800
Poisoned?

00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,110
Women of Tianyun
don't pierce their ears here.

160
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,010
She's from Wujiang.

161
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,960
General Xiao eliminated Wujiang.

162
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,480
They came here for revenge.

163
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,160
Our family is innocent.

164
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,080
Xu Da,

165
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,760
find out who took her here.

166
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,600
- Search the mansion!
- No need.

167
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,720
I know who poisoned Grand General.

168
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,880
I did it.

169
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,720
I'm willing to be punished by law.

170
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,640
Your Highness,

171
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,920
my daughter-in-law is afraid of blood.

172
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,560
She's still young.

173
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,480
Take her to her room.

174
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,680
Lady Lu,

175
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,160
do you know murdering an official
is a capital offense?

176
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,880
Besides, you were once married.

177
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,080
Why would you do this?

178
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,400
Everyone knows

179
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,800
General Xiao has given me a hard time

180
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,080
since he came back.

181
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,240
He even forced me to sleep with him.

182
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,800
As a mother,

183
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,760
how can I endure this?

184
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,040
Lu Yunxi,

185
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,720
are you aware of the consequences?

186
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,880
It has nothing to do with them.

187
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,000
It's between Xiao Chuyi and me.

188
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,840
I'm not a good wife.

189
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,960
Mother,

190
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,000
please take care of Che.

191
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,480
Take her back.

192
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,720
Wait.

193
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,960
Your Highness,

194
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,480
my daughter-in-law did this.

195
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
However, my family

196
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,320
has served three dynasties

197
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,520
as officials.

198
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,480
We shall set a great example.

199
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Hand her over
to the Ministry of Justice.

200
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
Lady Zhou,

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,520
if people know about this,

202
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,560
your family will face criticism.

203
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,920
How about this?

204
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,280
I'll interrogate her myself.

205
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,400
Do you agree?

206
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,040
Your Highness,

207
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,600
that's very kind of you.

208
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,200
However, my family

209
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,360
committed a felony.

210
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,200
If we don't punish her severely,

211
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,040
we'll become

212
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,120
the joke of the country.

213
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,960
Your Highness, please don't stop me.

214
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,080
Mother, the officers from
the Ministry of Justice have arrived.

215
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,120
Your Highness,

216
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,040
what should I tell General
when he wakes up?

217
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,360
She poisoned him for the Zhous.

218
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,400
He has to move on.
