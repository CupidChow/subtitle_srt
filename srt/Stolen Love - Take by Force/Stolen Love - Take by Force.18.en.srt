Then Lord Lin,

12
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm afraid you have to suffer.

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,720
If I die,

14
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,120
you'll never see that kid again.

15
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,800
He passed out already?

16
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,560
Wake him up and go on.

17
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,520
Xiao Chuyi!

18
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
What are you doing?

19
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,680
If he dies...

20
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,520
You...

21
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,320
How can we find Che?

22
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,400
Yun, why are you here?

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,480
It's too dirty. Go back.

24
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,800
I promised you

25
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,120
to save Che.

26
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,920
You can't intimidate him like this.

27
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,720
I'll talk to Lady Lin.

28
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,680
You vicious woman.

29
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,280
How dare you visit me?

30
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
You should be locked here.

31
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,720
Che is missing

32
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,560
and in danger.

33
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,120
Only you can save him.

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,600
My father kidnapped Che?

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,120
In this world,

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,600
only my father

37
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,280
will protect

38
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,720
and love me forever.

39
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,680
Vicious woman.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
You did this to me.

41
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Why should I help you?

42
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,800
I know you hate me,

43
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,440
but you really care about Che.

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,080
I know you stopped me

45
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,400
from joining the family tree

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,240
because of Che.

47
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
Yes.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,320
I want you to die so that

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,040
Yanyu can have another wife
and another son,

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,560
and I'll get Che's custody.

51
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,480
Everyone

52
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,480
in the Zhou's Mansion

53
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,040
is heartless and vicious.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,200
Only Che

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,480
can make me smile sincerely.

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,240
Is Zhou Yanru back?

57
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,280
I took the blame for the Zhous,

58
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
and he still wouldn't
come back to see me?

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,400
Why?

60
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,840
Why doesn't he
want to have a child with me?

61
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,600
I know you're upset.

62
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,600
If you help me,

63
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,840
I'll do anything for you.

64
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,320
Okay.

65
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,480
Then kneel down

66
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,400
and kowtow to me 100 times.

67
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,440
Maybe I'll help you

68
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,880
when I'm satisfied.

69
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Lady Lu said

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,440
no matter what happens,

71
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,840
you must stay calm.

72
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,080
Enough.

73
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,200
Remember,

74
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,480
I'm doing this

75
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
for Che.

76
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,040
I'll definitely pay you back.

77
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,000
Dad!

78
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,040
Dad!

79
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,800
Dad...

80
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,320
Who did this to you?

81
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,880
Baby girl.

82
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
I'll

83
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,120
get you out of here.

84
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,360
Dad.

85
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,640
You...

86
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,400
The child is innocent.

87
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,960
Just tell them where he is.

88
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,280
Xiao Chuyi never lies.

89
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,120
I'm afraid that he'll kill you.

90
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Zhou Che

91
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,880
is our leverage.

92
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,600
We can't let him go.

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,160
I hid him in a place

94
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,040
that Lu Yunxi can never find.

95
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Where is it?

96
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,240
Even if she finds him,

97
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,640
she'll suffer!

98
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,600
She hurt my daughter.

99
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,760
I must make her pay the price!

100
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,160
I'll suffer...

101
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,080
A place I can never find.

102
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,160
Orphan Cave.

103
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,000
Don't be scared. I'll look for him.

104
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,200
I'll go with you.

105
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,960
Go.

106
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
Yun!

107
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,360
Yun!

108
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,400
I have to go inside.

109
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,880
Che is waiting for me!

110
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,920
Yun!

111
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,000
If Che sees you like this,
he'll be so sad.

112
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,640
I saved you back then,

113
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,320
and I'll save him too.

114
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,040
Wait here.

115
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,880
(Che.)

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,720
(It's my fault.)

117
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
Che!

118
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Che, it's me.

119
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,120
Ghost! Go away!

120
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,120
Che.

121
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,560
Don't be afraid.

122
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,240

- It's me.

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,570
♪Only to call your name again♪

194
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,280
♪For it's the only thing♪

195
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,580
♪I'll never forget♪

196
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,820
♪Till the day that I die♪
