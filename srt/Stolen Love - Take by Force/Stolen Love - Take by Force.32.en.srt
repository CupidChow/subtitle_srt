=Episode 32=

11
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,720
My Lady, you've waited for this
for seven years,

12
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,040
and your dream has come true.

13
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,240
Why are you so upset?

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,760
I've put the scroll back

15
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,720
as you told me.

16
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Your Highness, please keep your promise

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,440
and cure my son.

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,110
The poison was made by

19
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,960
an alchemist by accident
when he was refining pills for Father.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,960
It was made from 108 poisonous insects
including bees and spiders.

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,920
Only I have the cure.

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,680
He needs to take one pill every week.

23
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,720
He'll fully recover

24
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
in seven weeks.

25
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,800
Why is there only one pill?

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,680
Come here to take one pill every week.

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,600
If you help me

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,560
take down Prince Su and Xiao Chuyi
before that day,

29
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
I'll give you the rest.

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,360
If you fail,

31
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,720
you'll never get the last pill.

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,080
My Lady, I'll be honest with you.

33
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,200
The pills are placed

34
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,920
in the jade lock.

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,080
It's a unique lock

36
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,000
that only I can open.

37
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,960
If someone uses force,

38
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,320
the pills will be ruined.

39
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,400
You're smart.

40
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,320
Don't hurt your son.

41
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,920
From now on,

42
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,440
I'm at your service.

43
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,200
I'm so sorry.

44
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,040
I can't cure him.

45
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,200
The kind and capable Lady Lu

46
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,600
has become the lady in charge
of the Zhou Family.

47
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,360
She shall manage the family
together with her husband Zhou Yanyu.

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,960
Yunxi,

49
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,560
I'm glad you're back.

50
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Greetings, My Lord.

51
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,240
Yunxi.

52
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,840
Don't do this.

53
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,840
I know you're upset.

54
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,120
You got me wrong.

55
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,040
I'll do anything

56
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,920
for Che, even if I have to

57
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,720
die for him.

58
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,680
We've been together for seven years.
You know me.

59
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,960
Mother, Chuyi, and Che

60
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,160
are my everything.

61
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,680
Whoever hurts them

62
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,580
is my enemy.

63
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
Yunxi.

64
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,240
What do you mean?

65
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,600
Do you think

66
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,720
I asked the Crown Prince
to poisoned Che?

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,280
Didn't you?

68
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,400
You poisoned Che!

69
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,680
My Lord, thank you for
the idea of the explosives.

70
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,320
I remember you once told me

71
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,720
one should always have a backup plan.

72
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,880
I did it only to prepare
for the worst scenarios.

73
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,880
Now it has worked.

74
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,240
The lives of Che and Lady Lu
are in my hands.

75
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,240
What can Xiao Chuyi do?

76
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,760
Your Highness, you not only want
to use her to get rid of Xiao Chuyi

77
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,240
but also want to control me, right?

78
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,440
I have no such intention.

79
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,800
However, I hope you can move on.

80
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,080
Only in this way

81
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,160
can you become the pillar of the nation
that I've expected you to be.

82
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,720
You won't believe

83
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,070
anything I say right now.

84
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,800
Yunxi!

85
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,950
Maybe I can't get the cure for Che,

86
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,080
but I promise, the Zhou Family is yours,

87
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,920
and no one can take it away from you.

88
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,640
Lu Yunxi.

89
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,620
Does she think she's really succeeded?

90
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,360
When Yanru comes back

91
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,240
and marries another woman,

92
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,120
I'll select a new lady in charge,

93
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,320
and the family will still be mine.

94
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,760
In that case,

95
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,960
everyone will have to beg me for mercy.

96
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,120
Where's Yanru?

97
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,600
Brother was attacked on the way.

98
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,440
By the time I arrived,

99
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,080
he had died.

100
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,760
His coffin will arrive tomorrow.

101
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,400
My condolences, Mother.

102
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,960
Who would dare to attack our carriage?

103
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
It was you.

104
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,640
It was you!

105
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,880
It was you!

106
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,720
You killed Yanru!

107
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,040
You killed my mother,

108
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,400
and this is your retribution.

109
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,600
We're even.

110
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,600
My Lady!

111
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,560
Did Lu Yunxi tell you this?

112
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
You've favored Brother

113
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,320
since we were born.

114
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,280
I studied hard to make you happy,

115
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,680
but you only treated me worse.

116
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,280
You even asked someone
to push me into the cold pool.

117
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
Unfortunately,

118
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,080
Yunxi saved me.

119
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,960
You thought I passed out
and wanted to poison me.

120
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
At that moment,

121
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,360
I realized I was just a maid's child.

122
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
I...

123
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,720
I...

124
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,920
I can't believe I raised a viper!

125
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,680
But Yanru

126
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,560
never wanted to hurt you!

127
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,440
How could you do that?

128
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,760
My Lady!

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,040
Mother.

130
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,400
We both know

131
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,040
why you suddenly asked Yanru

132
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,960
to come back.

133
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,120
Now that he's dead,

134
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,240
I, a maid's son,
is the only heir of the Zhou Family.

135
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,520
And my wife

136
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,040
is the only person qualified
to be the lady in charge.

137
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,120
You...

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,840
My Lady!

139
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,960
My Lady!

140
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,440
My Lady!

141
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,440
My Lady!

142
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,200
My Lady!

143
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,760
My Lady!

144
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,340
(Defense Map)

145
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,000
Some soldiers in the barrack
will make a scene because of food.

146
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,920
They're all Xiao Chuyi's brothers
who fought the enemy with him.

147
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,760
Ask him to send troops there.

148
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,480
Troop movements are a big deal.

149
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,960
How can I manage to do that?

150
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,720
His stamp is in the tent.

151
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,680
You'll stamp this order

152
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,760
while he's sleeping.

153
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,530
Someone will take care of the rest.

154
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,620
(Movement Order)

155
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
How's Che?

156
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,640
Still exhausted and weak.

157
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,400
His chest often hurts.

158
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,040
What did that nasty Crown Prince

159
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,640
ask you to do this time?

160
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,020
(Movement Order)

161
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,360
He wants you to move your troops
to solve a conflict.

162
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,000
If you do it,

163
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,760
His Majesty will definitely
take back your army,

164
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,000
and the prince
will take over the Xiaojie Army.

165
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,640
I should've killed him.

166
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,200
Don't be too impulsive.

167
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,000
I shouldn't have told you
what he's done.

168
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,720
Didn't we have a deal?

169
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,360
I'll stall for time,

170
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,520
and Prince Su and you will take him down.

171
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,720
In that case, we can force him
to give us the cure.

172
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,080
Yun,

173
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,920
promise me,

174
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,120
don't hide anything from me.

175
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,760
You've wasted seven years

176
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,120
for me and my family.

177
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,440
I can't let you deal with them alone.

178
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,720
As for my army,

179
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,680
His Majesty still needs me
to defend our borders.

180
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
I can endure the punishment.

181
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,680
I have an idea.

182
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,400
If you stamp the order,

183
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,040
it'll prove that you move the troops
without permission.

184
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,280
Trust me.

185
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,560
I'll borrow the tiger tally
for four hours.

186
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,560
General.

187
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,880
Trespassing on the Eastern Palace
is a felony.

188
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,280
Shut up.

189
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,000
That nasty man wants to weaken my power.

190
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,400
It's the perfect opportunity.

191
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,580
I've sent Xiao Chuyi's troops

192
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,520
to assist the rogue soldiers.

193
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,900
I heard about it.

194
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,160
Why didn't you give the order
to my contact person?

195
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,680
I didn't find the stamp,

196
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,680
so I stole the tiger tally
when he was sleeping

197
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,440
and moved his troops.

198
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,240
You stole the tiger tally?

199
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,080
