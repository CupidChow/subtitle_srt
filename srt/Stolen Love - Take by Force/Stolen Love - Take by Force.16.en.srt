instead of marrying Hexi's prince
like my sister,

11
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
so you agreed to marry me.

12
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
You helped me.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,960
Now I'm helping you to move on.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,520
After all, she's the Grand Tutor's wife.

15
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,240
How can you search her bedroom

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,280
like this?

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,720
Why are you always hesitating
when investigating cases?

18
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,360
Get off me!

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,880

Get off me!

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,320
What are you doing?

25
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,720
Idiots!

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,660
I asked you to search her room

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,960
instead of being hooligans!

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,240
- She hampered us...
- Get out!

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,760
General, for the sake of our history,

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,720
please stop.

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,760
Please

32
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,440
stop thinking about revenge.

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
Even if you succeed,

34
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,920
will everything go back to normal?

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,120
Will your parents come back to life?

36
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,600
What about the victims
of the Zhou Family?

37
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,520
Why do I have to care about them?

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,360
Then...

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,840
My mother,

40
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,280
the woman who gave you a family name

41
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,760
and a home,

42
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,680
deserved to be killed by the Zhous?

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,600
I'll pay back what I owe her

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,240
in the next life.

45
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,760
Yunxi,

46
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,520
it's my fault.

47
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,240
Your Highness,
we're in different positions.

48
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,360
You don't need to apologize.

49
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,520
Come on. Let's eat.

50
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,240
There are more thrilling things.

51
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,960
In Wujiang,

52
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,990
Yi led 8000 best soldiers all the way

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,120
to the court,

54
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,760
and my troops

55
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,640
avoided their blockades,

56
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640
delivered the grains and supplies,

57
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,320
captured the king of Wujiang alive, and

58
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,760
avenged the brothers who died in battle.

59
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,040
Yunxi?

60
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,480
You're overthinking it.

61
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,040
Overthinking it?

62
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,200
General Xiao saved you,

63
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
and you saved him.

64
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,640
You've been through

65
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,160
life and death together

66
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,760
all these years.

67
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,920
Your connection

68
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,840
is much stronger
than what we had back then.

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,880
Yunxi.

70
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,560
If you know what's good for him,

71
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,520
I'll be frank with you.

72
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,680
The Crown Prince
has held grudges against Yi.

73
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,800
If he takes the throne,

74
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,720
he'll have mercy on Prince Su

75
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,600
for the sake of brotherhood.

76
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,560
However, Yi is an outsider.

77
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,200
I can protect him.

78
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,200
I can take him away from here,

79
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,000
and my brother won't hurt him.

80
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,520
Your Highness, you're right.

81
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,840
You're a noble

82
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,760

83
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,520

86
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,640
I'm really grateful to have joined

Well,

106
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,560
a leaf fell on her head,

107
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,680
and I was helping her.

108
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,280
Che, I bought a burr puzzle for you.

109
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,080
Go back to your room.

110
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,680
No, I want to go to Aunt's room.

Aunt,

112
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680
do you have chestnut cakes?

113
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,160
The kitchen has made a lot of cakes.

114
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,400
Come back in an hour.

115
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,760
Come on.

116
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,120
Only two cakes today.

117
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,680
Can't I have one more cake?

118
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,120
Half a cake.

119
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
No more negotiations.

120
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,280
Aunt, you're the best.

121
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,000

122
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,640

- Put me down!

Bad Uncle,

128
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,720
you bullied my mom first.

129
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
Give me five years,

130
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,960
and I'll definitely beat you.

131
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,120
Five years?

132
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,600
I'll be 10 years old then.

133
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,440
I'll be taller

134
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,600
and stronger than you.

have infected your organs.

137
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,000
It's killing you.

138
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,360
How many years do I have?

139
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,720
Less than five years.

140
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,200
Okay.

141
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,840
It's a deal.

142
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
I'll wait for five years.

143
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,920
Don't forget

144
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
to keep your promise

145
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,480
and protect your mother.

146
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,320
Of course.

Brat,

151
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,000
do you know
where I can find more burr puzzles?

152
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,240
My mom put some in my room.

153
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,360
Show me.

154
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,800
Okay.

155
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,000
Let's go.

156
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,320
Brat,

157
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,360
here you are.

158
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,980
This is outrageous.

159
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,320
I can't believe they embezzled
nearly a million dan grains.

160
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,040
That's the rations for the frontline
soldiers for nearly a season.

161
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,120
If I didn't see the account books
of Zhou's Granary

162
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,440
and the merchants,

163
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,000
I wouldn't believe it.

164
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,060
(Lin Hui)

165
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,440
I'll arrest the merchants and Lady Lin.

166
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,480
Don't alert them.

167
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,680
Let me check the accounts.

168
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,880
We still can't eradicate

169
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,600
the Zhous with the evidence.

170
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,080
When we had no evidence,

171
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,200
you were so anxious.

172
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,400
Now we've got it,

173
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,960
but you're so hesitant.

174
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,920
What are you

175
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
worried about?

176
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,600
We have to take them down

177
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
once and for all.

178
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,600
Okay.

179
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
I'll dig into it.

180
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,240
Yi,

181
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,080
I got involved
in the political in-fighting

182
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,720
to investigate this case
for the frontline soldiers.

183
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,960
If your past relationship

184
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,680
affects your judgement,

185
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,960
I'll never forgive you

186
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,280
or have mercy on Lady Lu.

188
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,040

189
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,320
how can you stay calm?

190
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,360
After Lady Lin was arrested,

191
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,680
Lord Lin wanted to impeach you.

192
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,520
If His Majesty says no,

193
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
he'll kill himself!

194
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,240
His Majesty ordered them
to shut down all our stores!

195
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,320
We're innocent!

196
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,720
I'm innocent!

197
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,080
What's going on?

198
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,000
Why did you arrest the merchants?

199
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,160
Xiao Chuyi!

200
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,000
Why didn't you tell me
you got solid evidence?

201
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,320
Something's wrong with it.

202
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,360
It came out of nowhere.

203
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,880
If it's a trap,

204
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,240
we'll be doomed.

205
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,960
Brother,

206
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,160
I've interrogated all the merchants.

207
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,600
Lady Lin is the contact person.

208
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,320
We can't wait.

209
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,800
I'll convict Lady Lin now.

210
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,960
Didn't I tell you

211
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,000
not to alert them?

212
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,160
You're being too cautious.

213
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,120
It's not like you.

214
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,760
Besides, we're not arresting Lu Yunxi.

215
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
This is very important.

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,200
Let's forget about the Zhous.

217
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,800
Will Grand Censor Lin Cheng,

218
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,920
Lady Lin's father,

219
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,440
go easy on us?

220
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,120
Why are you

221
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,400
afraid of them?

222
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
We're abiding by the law.

223
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,320
The first person they'll deal with

224
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,360
is Lu Yunxi,
the person who leaked the books.

225
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,040
No more words.

226
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,560
I know

227
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,400
you love Lu Yunxi,

228
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,320
and I promised

229
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,800
to protect her.

230
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,000
However, can't you see what's going on?

231
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,200
Liuyun and you are engaged.

232
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,040
Your Highness, please stop.

233
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,840
You know I won't let the soldiers down.

234
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,040
After all, Lu Yunxi is my woman.

235
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,000
Even if she has to die,

236
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,760
only I can be the executioner.
