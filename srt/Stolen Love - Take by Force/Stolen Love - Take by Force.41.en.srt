They're my family!

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,880
I tortured Lady Zhou and killed

Don't blame these evil deeds on Yun!

28
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,040
You're always like this.

29
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,000
You pretend to be weak
to make her care about you.

30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,400
You appear to be a gentleman,

31
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,080

you're a cunning hypocrite.
