I've never divorced her.

32
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,200
We've been married for seven years.

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,680

your mom signed the divorce paper

ask my mother to sign the divorce paper

53
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,000
and let her die alone

54

but you can't take my family away

63
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,640
without my permission.

64
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,120
Our family has served three dynasties

65
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
as high officials.

66
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,640
This is kidnapping.

67
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,920
You'll lose not only your title

68
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,560

77
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,920
