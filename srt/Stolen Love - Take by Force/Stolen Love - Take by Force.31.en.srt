Yi, when we set off,

12
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,240
she'll have become the lady in charge.

13
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,040
What are you worried about?

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,400
We can set off

after Brother gets the scroll.

16
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,640
But the Crown Prince said

17
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,240
Father ordered us to escort

18
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,960
the supplies out of the capital today.

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,440
Crown Prince?

20
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm afraid he'll take action tonight.

21
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,400
Liuyun, I made a promise,

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,400
and I'll do it.

23
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,870
However, I'm really worried that

24
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,240
Brother can't deal with it alone.

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,800
When this is over,

26
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,240
I'll come back immediately.

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
It was Prince Su
who asked me to take you away.

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,160
They've turned against each other.

29
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,200
If there's no evidence,
and we're not involved,

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,560
he'll have a way out.

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,680
Your Highness.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,840
Take it.

33
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,680
Xiao Chuyi, our marriage is canceled.

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,320
You can leave.

35
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,720

36
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,960
Go!

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Your Highness,

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,680
why did you let the Prince Consort go?

39
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,640
I thought Lu Yunxi
only wanted money and fame.

40
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,480
However,

41
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,280
she's waited for seven years

42
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,600
only to avenge the Xiaos.

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,280
Such a wonderful woman

44
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,960
deserves the best man in the world.

45
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,640
These explosives

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
can ruin the entire ancestral hall.

47
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,480
My Lady, have you made up your mind?

48
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,600
Brother.

49
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,360
If you ignite the explosives,

50
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,160
you'll die here too.

51
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,400
Brother.

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,560
If Father sees the scroll,

53
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,480
I'll be a traitor to the nation

54
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,440
and live in hell!

55
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,480
Now that all of you
can go to hell with me,

56
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,520
I'd like a quick death.

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,480
My Lady, if you put the scroll back,

58
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,040
I can pretend that nothing has happened,

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,640
and all of you can enjoy money and power

60
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,200
