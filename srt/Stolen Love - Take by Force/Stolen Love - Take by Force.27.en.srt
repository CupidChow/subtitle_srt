00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,720
Blood test!

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,440
Mother,

13
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,600
you can't do this.

14
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,080
Even if

15
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,400
it proves that Che is my son,

16
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,000
people will have doubts
about his identity.

17
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,640
How is he supposed to face others?

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,560
There are many rumors about you.

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,400
The identity of our future heir
cannot be questioned.

20
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,320
I don't want him to face criticism
for the rest of his life.

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,000
By doing this,
I can shut their mouth forever.

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,480
Mother.

23
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,160
Che likes you so much,

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,560
and he's old enough
to tell right from wrong.

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,000
Mother,

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,680
are you really going to make him
hold a grudge against you?

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,200
As long as it can prove Che's innocence,

28
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,660
I'll take all the blame,

29
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,000
even if he hates me.

30
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,200
(Lady Zhou has prepared for this.)

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,600
(She's determined to kick me out today.)

32
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,600
(I'm afraid whether Yanyu
is Che's father or not,)

33
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,080
(the test result will be negative.)

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,920
Servant!

35
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,520
Guards!

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,560
Take her down!

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
- Aye!
- Aye!

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,280
My Lady!

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,440
- My Lady!
- Mom!

40
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,240
Xiao Chuyi?

41
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,400
Aunt, what's going on?

42
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,920
You told me to do a blood test.

43
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,120
The test hasn't finished,

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,960
and you've started to punish her.

45
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,720
Did you assume that Che

46
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,520
was my child?

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,400
Nonsense.

48
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,620
Chuyi,

49
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,160
you're being disobedient again.

50
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,280
General,

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,920
it's our family issue.

52
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,480
Please leave.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,560
Why are you so nervous?

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,720
You're wrong about that.

55
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,680
Aunt invited here,

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
which means it not only involves
the Zhou Family

57
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,120
but also the Xiao Family.

58
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,040
May I ask you a question?

59
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,000
If Che was really my child,

60
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,760
what would you do?

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,160
Chuyi.

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,080
Your parents are gone.

63
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,360
If he was your child,

64
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,240
I'd uphold justice

65
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,360
and give Che back to you.

66
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,000
- No!
- Great.

67
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,920
However, I have another question.

68
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,560
If Che wasn't my child,

69
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,360
you're going to be

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,560
accused of slandering the Grand General.

71
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,960
As you know,

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,160
Liuyun has always been a candid person

73
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,880
who hates it when people spread rumors
and distort the facts.

74
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,480
When she's back,

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,720
she won't go easy on you.

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,960
Don't worry.

77
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,040
For the reputation of our family,

78
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,880
I'm willing to apologize
to Her Highness.

79
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,040
(Yun is so nervous.)

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
(Is Che really my child?)

81
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,680
Let's do the test.

82
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,040
Wait.

83
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,720
If we want to prove it to everyone,

84
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,000
we should do it fairly.

85
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,560
Ask them to prepare

86
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,080
brand new tools.

87
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,680
Yanyu.

88
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,720
After all, it's not something
we should be proud of.

89
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,600
You don't have to do this.

90
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,040
It's about Yunxi's reputation,

91
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,800
so it's the most important thing to me.

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,840
We'll not only do the test

93
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,040
but do it right.

94
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,640
It's okay.

95
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,520
Che,

96
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,480
I need to prick your finger
to take your blood.

97
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,800
Are you scared?

98
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,920
I'm a real man.

99
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
I'm not scared.

100
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,800
Mom, blood fusion.

101
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,000
Mother,

102
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,680
look carefully.

103
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,720
Useless servants, look carefully.

104
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,760
If you dare to spread rumors again,

105
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,160
I'll kill you!

106
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,160
- Aye.
- Aye.

107
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,520
Let's go.

108
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,160
We didn't teach them well.

109
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Sorry to have bothered you.

110
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,920
It won't happen again.

111
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,760
Yunxi,

112
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,800
let's go.

113
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,080
I've changed the formula three times,

114
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,880
but I still can't eliminate the poison
inside General Xiao's body.

115
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,280
There are many great folk doctors.

116
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,600
General,

117
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,800
we should post a notice
as soon as possible.

118
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,560
Doctor Wu.

119
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,040
Can a blood test

120
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,320
really confirm people's kinship?

121
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,560
I've done a lot of research on that.

122
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,640
Wait a minute.

123
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,120
This...

124
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,200
Well,

125
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,760
there are many kinds of powers

126
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,760
to make blood merge or not merge.

127
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,800
General,

128
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,960
our men are ready.

129
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,760
We can go to the Cibei Temple now.

130
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Xu Da.

131
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,480
Confirm another thing for me.

132
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,840
Find the midwife who delivered Che.

133
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,680
Aye.

134
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,000
My Lord,

135
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
(Zhou's Mansion)
Lady Lu and the midwife are close,

136
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,800
and we gave her a lot of silver.

137
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,720
She's been good all these years.

138
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,160
As long as she's alive,
she'll be a threat.

139
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,120
Xiao Chuyi can never find out
the real identity of Che.

140
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Get rid of her.

141
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,840
Whoever stops us from being together

142
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,640
must die.

143
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,720
(Real Identity?)

144
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,080
(Is Zhou Che really Xiao Chuyi's son?)

145
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,880
Who's there?

146
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,440
My Lord, it's from Lady Yun.

147
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,520
Get rid of the midwife.

148
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,550
- Hurry!
- Aye!

149
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,280
My Lady,

150
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,040
we've prepared the tribute.

151
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,960
The coachman is waiting
at the corner gate.

152
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,760
It's about to rain.

153
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,640
Are you sure you want to go out?

154
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,400
Take care of Che.

155
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,820
Luoxia Ridge

156
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,760
Abbot.

157
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,960
I know this is a sacred place

158
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,480
that shouldn't be involved in
worldly affairs.

159
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,680
However, can you

160
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,840
do me a favor?

161
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,120
I know you've hosted
many worship ceremonies for the Zhous.

162
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
On the worship day,

163
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,480
I want my people to attend it.

164
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,960
Amitabha.

165
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,240
Almsgiver Xiao, now that you've asked,

166
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,480
I'll help you.

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
I hope you're doing this

168
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,120
for the greater good.

169
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,760
Thanks, Abbot.

170
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,260
Please don't tell anyone.

171
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,700
By the way, Almsgiver Xiao,

172
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,800
Almsgiver Lu, who kept
the family letters for the soldiers,

173
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,120
is praying in the side hall.

174
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,320
Why don't you thank her in person?

175
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,760
Thanks, Abbot.

176
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,960
I'll thank her right now.

177
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,180
(Tablet of the Honorable Lady Lu)

178
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming up.

179
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,760
I can't visit you on that day,

180
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,440
because it's

181
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,720
the ancestral worship ceremony.

182
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
I'll officially

183
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,200
become the lady in charge.

184
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,320
And I'll avenge

185
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
you,

186
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,200
Chuyi,

187
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
and our family.

188
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,680
This journey has been tough

189
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,000
and dangerous.

190
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,440
No matter what happens,

191
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,440
I only hope Chuyi and Che

192
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,440
can live a happy

193
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,120
and peaceful life.

194
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,640
I'll endure

195
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,880
all the suffering alone.

197
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,660
(Tablet of the Honorable Lady Lu)

198
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,960
When we did the test,

199
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,880
why were you so nervous?

200
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,440
What were you afraid of?

201
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,320
I was worried it might ruin
Che and Yanyu's reputation.

202
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,760
What about my mother's tablet?

203
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Abbot told you

204
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,240
you've visited her

205
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,200
on every Mid-Autumn Festival

206
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,040
and Tomb Sweeping Day

207
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,640
over the past seven years.

208
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm ashamed

209
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,680
and don't want to affect Che.

210
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,760
I'm here to pray.

211
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,880
Yun.

212
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,720
Che was born on the last month

213
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,640
of the 30th Yong'an year,

214
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,600
