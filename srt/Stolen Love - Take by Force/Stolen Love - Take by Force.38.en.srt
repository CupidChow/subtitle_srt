I'm so cold...

13
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,040
You were sweating just now.

How's everything going?

17
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,510
The prince is missing.

18
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,760
They shut down the city

19
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,800
and are looking for him.

20
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,680
Did you see Lord Zhou?

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,080
He told you to wait.

22
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,600
He said he'd save Che

23
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,680
when it's time.

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,280

25
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,150
Hot. So hot...

So hot?

27
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,800
Xiao Chuyi.

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,680
The golden sword breaker
represents His Majesty.

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,880
- You came back.
- Zhou Yanyu!

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,760
You don't deserve to be a father!

31
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,260
Che hasn't healed.

32
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,160
Why did you report the prince?

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,680
I'll take your heart blood to save Che!

34
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,440
No matter how much blood you get,
you won't be able to save him.

35
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,880
If my blood

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,160
could save Che,

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,280
why would I wait until now?

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,280
What did you say?

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,040
Xiao Chuyi,

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,240
you're an idiot!

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,440
Why can't Yun get over you?

42
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,400
Kill him after he takes

43
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,880
the heart blood.

44
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,520
Cuixi,

45
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,480

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
Okay.

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,960
Mom.

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
Hot...

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,720
So hot...

50
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,280
My Lady,

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,880
I saw General Xiao entered the study
to talk to Lord Zhou.

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,450
These years, you've suffered too much.

53
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,360
Chuyi!

54
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Listen,

55
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,480
Che has nothing to do with you.

56
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,000
Chuyi! Chuyi!

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,160
Open the door! Chuyi!

58
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,640
Yun.

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,650
All these years,

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,840
you've done enough for Che.

61
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,280
Please let me, his father,

62
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,160
do something for him.

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,320
Chuyi! Chuyi, don't!

64
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,040
No, Chuyi!

65
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,680

66
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,560

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,700
