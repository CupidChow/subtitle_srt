Mother!

00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm willing to quit my job

15
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,680
and assist Yanru.

Mother, please have mercy on her!

17
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,480
His Majesty made you the Grand Tutor,

18
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,160
and both His Highness
and His Majesty trust you.

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,800
You defied the court
and betrayed our family.

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,120
I won't allow her to ruin you!

21
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,480
Take her away!

22
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,680
How dare you?

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,120
Mother, if you insist,

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,840
I'll have to cut my flesh!

25
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,400
What's all the fuss about?

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

27
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,520
Sorry, I didn't know you were back.

28
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,680
Aunt, you're too polite.

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,360
I was busy arresting some merchants
involved in the case.

30
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,080
Now that it's finished,

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,560
I'm here to visit you.

32
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,720
Why are you punishing her

33
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,920
like this?

34
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,200
Your Highness, she committed adultery!

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,320
How dare you?

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,400
You said she committed adultery.

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,360
Who's the other side?

38
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Is it my fiance Xiao Chuyi?

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,720
Are you humiliating the royal family?

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,440
Your Highness, mercy.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,660
Allow me...

42
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,400
I don't want to waste time on you.

43
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,400
You can kill her.

44
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,370
However, if I become
the joke of the city,

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,920
no matter how powerful you are,

46
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,520
I'll eliminate all of you.

47
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,800
Lady Lu and the Prince Consort...

48
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,560
Nothing happened.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Release her!

50
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,640
Yunxi.

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Your Highness,
thank you for saving my life.

52
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,600
No need.

53
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,720
You should thank

54
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,560
your ex-husband.

55
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,980
You risked your life for her again.

56
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,520
Lady Zhou is so vicious.

57
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,680
Yun is in trouble.

58
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Only you can save her.

59
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,080
You want to eliminate the Zhou Family.

60
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,410
If she becomes the lady in charge,

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,040
you'll never get back together.

62
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,160
Why are you helping her?

63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,720
She's always wanted to be
the lady in charge.

64
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,640
I don't want it,

65
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,400
but I can't watch her fail
because of me.

66
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

67
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,280
I'll do it,

68
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,120
but you must promise me one thing.

69
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,960
When Lu Yunxi
becomes the lady in charge,

70
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,280
you'll leave the capital with me.

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,880
I can't.

72
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,200
I haven't got revenge on the Zhous
and the Crown Prince.

73
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,610
I can't leave at this crucial time.

74
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,400
You said you'd help me
avoid the royal marriage.

75
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,600
If you die,

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,120
I'll have to marry the retard
from Chen Kingdom!

77
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,600
Are you going to break your promise?

78
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,240
It's not up to you.

79
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
If you reject me,

80
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,400
I won't save her.

81
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,720
Liuyun.

82
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
Never mind.

83
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,050
I promise you

84
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,920
if you save Yun,

85
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll do anything for you.

88
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,720
Ancestors, please enjoy the tribute
and bless our family.

89
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,680
May our family

90
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
rise and thrive.

Ancestors, please enjoy the tribute

92
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,960
and bless our family.

May our family

94
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,920
rise and thrive.

95
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,880
My Lady, please wait a minute.

96
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,320
Since all our family are here,

97
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,400
I want to have a discussion with you.

98
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,520
Go ahead.

99
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,160
Lord Zhou has gained a foothold
in the court,

100
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,840
but you're still managing
the family affairs on your own.

101
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,620
Many people have complained about this.

102
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,080
Yanyu is busy with work.

103
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,720
As his mother,

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,590
I'm obliged to relieve his burden.

105
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,360
Every mother loves their children.

106
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,440
I understand.

107
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,200
However, things shouldn't
get out of control,

108
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,720
or it'll be a disaster.

109
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,320
Why don't you hand over
the family business to Lady Lu

110
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,720
so that you can live a peaceful life
in your later years?

111
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,440
Yanyu,

112
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,400
what's your opinion?

113
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,560
It's our duty

114
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,280
to relieve your burden.

115
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,100
Wish Lady Zhou happiness

116
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,000
and longevity.

117
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,520
Wish Lady Zhou happiness

118
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,320
and longevity.

119
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,320
I've really underestimated you.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,600
When did you steal my power?

121
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,410
Mother,

122
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,320
thank you for your trust.

123
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,640
- You...
- As the lady in charge,

124
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,800
I must make contributions

125
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,640
so as to repay your kindness

126
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,320
and make our family thrive.

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,560
Good.

128
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,160
Wonderful!

129
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
In that case,

130
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
please leave us alone.

131
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,450
I have something to hand over
to the new lady in charge.

132
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,360
Look carefully.

133
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,400
I won't do it again.

134
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,560
Aren't you afraid
that I'll kill you here?

135
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,720
Mother, if you kill me,

136
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,840
how are you going to
explain it to them,

137
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,920
and what will people say about this,

138
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,160
about you and our family?

139
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,640
Don't think you can
control the Zhou family

140
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,280
with these lickspittles' support.

141
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,880
As long as I'm alive.

142
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,440
I'll always be in charge of
our family business.

143
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,280
What are you doing?

144
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,960
Control the family

145
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,280
and obtain the treasures? So what?

146
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,910
I only want the scroll.

147
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,120
The rest of them

148
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,560
will be your grave goods.

149
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,040
My Lady! My Lady!

150
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,720

(Zhou Family Ancestral Hall)

152
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,880
Lu Yunxi,

153
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,720
you betrayed us.

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,650
You promised to keep the secret

155
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,760
when you got the position.

156
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,760
How can you betray us

157
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,080
now?

158
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,400
Are you going to destroy all of us?

159
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,000
- Exactly!
- Yes!

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,680
God knows everything.

161
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,520
Your hands have been stained with blood.

162
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,280
You've committed so many crimes.

163
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,560
Shouldn't you pay the price?

164
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,040
Lu Yunxi,

165
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,160
you've been here for seven years,

166
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,160
and the only thing
you've ever wanted is revenge.

167
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,720
Idiots!

168
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,280
How dare you betray me?
Go to hell!

169
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,920
The Zhou Family
can't protect you anymore.

170
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,400
Even His Highness can't save you!

171
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,040
You...

172
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,680
Do you know what she's holding?

173
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,160
It's the alliance letter
between the Crown Prince and Wujiang.

174
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,760
The Crown Prince is a traitor?
Impossible.

175
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,040
How's that possible?

176
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,720
Seven years ago,

177
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,880
Prince Su led 30 thousand great soldiers
to attack Wujiang,

178
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,560
but they were ambushed
by 100 thousand soldiers

179
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,280
and trapped in Luoxia Ridge.

180
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,200
How... How's that possible?

181
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,320
I can't believe it.

182
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,800
Everyone thought Prince Su
fell for their trap,

183
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,400
but it was the Crown Prince
who leaked our information to Wujiang

184
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,600
and formed an alliance with them.

185
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
How did she know?

186
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,840
Witnessed by blood,

187
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,440
I'll form an eternal alliance
with Wujiang.

188
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,440
When I take the throne,

189
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,840
I'll give Wujiang thousands of
acres of land as rewards.

190
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,900
(Xiao Wan'er)

191
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,840
Wait.

192
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,980
(Prince Luesha of Wujiang)

193
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,840
Your Highness, My Lady, don't worry.

194
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,960
Prince Su and Xiao Chuyi

195
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,250
will no longer exist in this world

196
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,760
after the battle of Luoxia Ridge.

197
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,140
(Defense Map)

198
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Let's go.

199
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Your Highness.

200
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
It can't be placed
in the Eastern Palace.

201
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,520
Keep it in your secret room.

202
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,040
Okay.

203
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,960
This...

204
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,280
How's that possible?

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,400
Treason

206
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,840
and murder.

207
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,550
That the Crown Prince you chose

208
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,120
and the Zhou Family you count on!

209
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,600
It's impossible.

210
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,880
My Lady!

211
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,680
- My Lady!
- My Lady!

212
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,200
I'm going to die anyway.

213
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll kill you!

214
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,040
General Xiao ordered me
to protect Lady Lu!

215
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,360
No wonder Chuyi loves you so much.

216
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
Lu Yunxi.

217
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,400
Give me the scroll.

218
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,440
I'll report it to my father
and investigate it.

219
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,960
The Xiaos never embezzled
the military rations.

220
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,680
Your Highness, please report it
to His Majesty

221
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,480
and clear their names.

222
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,240
I promise you

223
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,320
I'll bring justice to you,

224
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,840
the Xiaos, and the world.

225
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,780
