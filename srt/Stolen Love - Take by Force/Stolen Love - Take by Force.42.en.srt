It's over, Yun.

18
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

19
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,600
It's over.

20
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,600
Let's see a doctor.

21
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's pick Che up.

22
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,400
Che is just up ahead.

23
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,280

I can't keep my promise.

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,960
Chuyi.

29
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,480
It's okay.

30
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,640
Hang in there.

31
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,280

Chuyi!

34
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,760
We only need the cure.

35
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,560
I'll look for it.

36
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,760
Let's look for it.

37
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
You'll get better.

38
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,560

Chuyi,

we'll be reunited very soon.

46
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,600
Let's get out of here.

47
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,960
Let's go to a peaceful place

48
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,400
where no one knows us.

49
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,920
Chuyi,

50
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,160
I want to eat rick cakes.

Speaking of General Xiao,

73
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,420
his wife Lu Yunxi

74
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,700
finally reunited with him
after seven years.

75
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,060
How could she

76
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,980
watch him die of poison?

77
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,390
So, she took General Xiao

78
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,180
to look for the cure.

79
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,780
The childhood sweethearts

80
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,740
have shared
the same promises and dreams.

81
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,180
The groom fought in the frontier,

82
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,990
and the lady remarried her enemy
with regrets.

83
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,140
The general eliminated the enemy,

84
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,820
and the lady could only

85
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,870
blame god.

86
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,660
Nonsense!

87
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,580
Arrogant Quack, how dare you?

88
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,220
Old man,

89
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,500
how dare you talk nonsense

90
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,700
and distort the facts?

91
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,700
Why don't you tell
the audience your story

92
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,780
and let them be the judges?

93
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,820
When I was traveling around,

94
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,740
I saw a couple by the river.

95
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,860
The general didn't die,

96
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,620
and the lady had no regrets.

97
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,940
They have a son and a daughter,

98
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,660
but they're living a secluded

99
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,820
but carefree life.

100
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,140
Che, be careful.

101
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,980
Mom.

102
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,260
Slow down.

103
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,460
Since Wujiang surrendered to us,

104
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,270
my brother has visited
many doctors in Wujiang.

105
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,810
I'm afraid there's

106
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,980
no cure for you.

107
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,580
- But...
- But what?

108
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,260
You've tried all the herbs in the world

109
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,460
and found they can only
relieve the pain,

110
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,340
and my death is just
a matter of time, right?

111
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,900
I'll keep looking for the cure.

112
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,820
No need, Liuyun.

113
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,060
This is amazing,

114
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,500
isn't it?

115
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,100
Be careful, Che!

116
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,060
Mom.

117
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,860
You're standing so far.

118
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,420
Perhaps because of that,

119
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,820
the rest days of my life

120
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,660
