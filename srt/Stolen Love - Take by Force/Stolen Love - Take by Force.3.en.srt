Go.

(Zhou's Mansion)

12
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,040
Mother...

13
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,160
On your knees!

14
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,960
Shame on you.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,200
You've ruined

16
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,280
our family's century-old reputation!

17
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
Mother!

18
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,760
Yanyu, Mother was so worried about you.

19
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,280
How could you go to the barrack alone?

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,600
Are you okay?

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
Mother,

22
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,960
I took Yunxi to the barrack

23
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,560
to congratulate General Xiao.

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,080
She's not feeling well.

25
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,840
She can't serve you tonight.

26
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,480
I'll take her back to rest.

27
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,600
Summon Doctor Chen

28
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,120
to heal Yanyu.

29
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,960
Yes, Mother.

30
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,560
Please go.

31
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,880
Thanks, General.

32
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,720
(Mother,)

33
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,880
(he's back.)

34
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,160
(Did you see that?)

35
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,320
(He's doing well.)

36
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,400
(Unfortunately, I can't be by his side.)

37
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,720
But I will protect him.

38
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,040
No one can

39
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,480
bully,

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,400
insult,

41
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,560
or hurt him.

42
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,720
I'll help him succeed.

43
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,000
Everyone will respect him.

=Episode 3=

46
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,960
(Zhou's Mansion)
We ruined the Xiao Family.

47
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
Now that Xiao Chuyi

48
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,920
works for Prince Su,

49
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,280
I have to stop him.

50
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,840
I wanted to provoke him

51
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,400
and make him attack us at the ceremony.

52
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,840
If he lost control,

53
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,880
the emperor who came here in disguise

54
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,600
would definitely punish him,

55
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,640
and Prince Su

56
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,880
would be doomed.

57
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,280
Unfortunately,

58
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,560
Yunxi endured humiliation

59
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,960
to protect the Zhou Family

60
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,160
and ruined your plan.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
I will punish her!

62
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,720
Don't rush.

63
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,960
We can keep her for now.

64
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,320
Maybe she can be useful.

65
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
My Lady.

66
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,720
Xiao's Mansion needs repairs.

67
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,840
You're the only family

68
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,720
General Xiao has.

69
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,600
We can only count on you.

70
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,800
As it should be.

71
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,240
Nephew, now you're back.

72
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,600
How can you not live

73
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
in your family's mansion?

74
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,520
Honorary Lady,

75
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,040
you're

76
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,520
so kind and tolerant.

77
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,480
The west wing

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
is pretty nice.

79
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,160
Let's move in.

80
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Wait.

81
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,400
The west wing

82
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,800
is for my youngest son.

83
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,840
That's even better.

84
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
It must be much better than before,

85
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,080
and people will say you treat me well.

86
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,600
Mother,

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
where is Yanru going to live
when he comes back?

88
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,080
By the way,

89
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,040
my cousin seldom comes home.

90
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,720
And you're always alone.

91
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,040
You... You're so nasty!

92
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,200
You definitely have a lot of time.

93
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,800
Why don't you help me
repair the phoenix coronet?

94
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,640
Me?

95
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,080
Don't hand it over to others.

96
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,560
If there are any flaws,

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,560
my swords won't have mercy.

98
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,920
Mother!

99
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,200
Come on. Hurry up.

100
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,480
You're too slow.

101
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
Hurry.

102
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,700
Cousin, you just moved in.

103
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,800
You must need a lot of things,

104
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,120
so I've prepared some for you.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,240
Rumor has it

106
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,560
that Yunxi and you went to the barrack

107
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,280
to congratulate me on the promotion.

108
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,720
Why didn't I know about this?

109
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,160
Cousin,

110
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,720
you're so forgetful.

111
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,440
Well, rumor has it

112
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,440
that I had

113
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,600
so much fun with your wife

114
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,640
last night.

115
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,680
And

116
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,760
I do know a little about this.

117
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,800
It's just a rumor.

118
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,320
No wonder you're the Grand Tutor.

119
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
You're as tolerant as

120
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,960
your family.

121
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,080
You can keep me

122
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,680
and

123
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,200
my wife.

124
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,960
By the way,

125
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,000
do you want another child?

126
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,880
Maybe she's already pregnant.

127
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,040
Xiao Chuyi,

128
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,720
do you think you can separate us?

129
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,800
I'm glad

130
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,840
you came back alive.

131
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,520
Because one can never

132
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,000
get over a dead lover.

133
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,840
You know Yun well.

134
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,320
She'd rather die than do something

135
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
against her will.

136
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,560
Ever since she married me,

137
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,600
she's forgotten about you.

138
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,600
All that's left

139
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,040
is just the fragment
of the happy memories.

140
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,680
If you treat her like this,

141
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,080
she'll only hate you more.

142
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,200
It's been seven years.

143
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,080
We love each other,

144
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,680
and we have a son.

145
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
You're the only one

146
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,280
who still clings to the past.

147
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,460
(Pavilion Above the Clouds)

148
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,300
General,

149
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,020
Lady Zhou values her reputation.

150
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,780
After what you've done,

151
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,380
she's still not going to let Lady Lu go.

152
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,660
Lady Lin wanted to kick Lady Lu out,

153
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,860
but Lady Zhou scolded her.

154
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,660
Sister, why are you still working
at this hour?

155
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,380
Mother only told you to sweep the floor.

156
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,340
Are you playing the victim

157
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,540
so that

158
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,580
the monster can see this?

159
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,780
It's my honor to sweep the floor

160
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,300
for our ancestors.

161
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,540
I'm willing to stay here till dawn

162
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,820
to pray for

163
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,260
their protection for Che.

164
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,620
Mother doesn't allow you
to enter the ancestral hall.

165
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,780
Are you sure you're okay with that?

166
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,820
Or

167
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,900
do you feel guilty

168
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,140
because you had Che
when you went south with Yanyu?

169
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,220
The birthday of Che...

170
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,500
I got pregnant

171
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,980
half a year after I married Yanyu.

172
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,900
I didn't know you had doubts.

173
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,820
However,

174
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,620
it's about the family reputation.

175
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,620
Why don't we ask Mother to find out

176
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,780
who's been spreading the rumors?

177
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,620
You...

178
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,260
Sister,

179
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,980
I'm so sorry.

180
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,020
I've been doing needlework all day.

181
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,100
My head is so...

182
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,900
Who?

183
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,030
How dare you?

184
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,700
No matter how lowly she is,

185
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,060
she used to be
a member of the Xiao Family.

186
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,660
You don't deserve to insult her.

187
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,100
Let's go.

188
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,740
My Lady!

189
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,060
Hurry!

190
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,340
Chuyi!

191
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,260
Greetings, General.

192
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,650
Lu Yunxi.

193
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,780
This is the family
you've tried so hard to join.

194
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,940
Look at that.

195
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,500
It's been seven years,

196
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,620
and you can't even
enter the ancestral hall.

197
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,660
Xiao Chuyi!

198
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,620
What are you doing?

199
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,620
Xiao Chuyi,

200
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,300
I can't go in now.

201
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,500
Who says you can't?

202
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,660
You...

203
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,700
Xiao Chuyi!

204
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,380
Get off me!

205
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,580
(Zhou Family Ancestral Hall)

206
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,620
Xiao Chuyi!

207
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,620
Xiao Chuyi!

208
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,300
Get off me! Xiao Chuyi!

209
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,660
Lu Yunxi.

210
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,980
Why do you have to humiliate yourself
for the Zhou Family?

211
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,740
Is Zhou Yanyu really better than me?

212
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,700
They're a family
of scholars and officials.

213
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,900
Yanyu is the Grand Tutor

214
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,340
who's favored by the emperor

215
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,740
and respected by the ministers.

216
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,820
How can your mere merits
compare to that?

217
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,860
Mere merits?

218
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,220
I've risked my life for the country
for seven years.

219
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,460
Am I really that unworthy in your eyes?

220
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,700
It's just a temporary success.

221
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,540
In His Majesty's eyes,

222
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,500
you're just another pet.

223
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,380
No matter how powerful you are,

224
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,260
if you choose the wrong side,

225
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,420
you'll be beheaded, and

226
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,500
your family will be ruined.

227
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,740
Your father

228
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,940
is the perfect example.

229
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,140
Lu Yunxi!

230
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,380
Oh, no.

231
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,020
You're not as good as him.

232
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,100
At least he remained powerful
for 30 years.

233
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,260
Now you're working for Prince Su,

234
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,980
and when the Crown Prince
takes the throne,

235
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,060
all your merits,

236
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,500
soldiers,

237
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,900
and glories

238
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,940
will lead you to death.

239
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,300
You've dragged me down once.

240
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,660
It won't happen again.

241
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,700
Only the Zhous,

242
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,060
only Zhou Yanyu

243
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,260
can protect me

244
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,820
for the rest of my life.
