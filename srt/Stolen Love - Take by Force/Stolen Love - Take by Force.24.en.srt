Hold onto me.

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,680
Xiao Chuyi.

Chuyi!

22
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,920
If you don't care,

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,160
why are you so anxious?

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,360
Thank god, you're okay.

25
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,880
Get up.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,880
Are you okay?

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,560
I'm fine.

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,200
Stop lying!

29
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,360
Are you okay?

30
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,240
Did you get hurt?

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,320
Your stomach must've been injured.

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,720
We need to see a doctor.

33
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,600
But they've set up an ambush

34
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,120
in this area.

35
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
I'm afraid they'll surround us

36
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,920
before we find a doctor.

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,760
I've been here before.

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,080
Follow me.

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,120
Be careful.

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,920
Be careful.

41
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,280
Doctor, please come in.

42
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,840
Cousin, the doctor is here.

43
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,920
Auntie Zheng,

44
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,240
I've never seen them before.

45
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,160
I'm Auntie Zheng's remote relative

46
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,480
from the village in the west.

47
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,120
We went to the mountains
to collect herbs,

48
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,600
but my brother slipped

49
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,840
and fell from the cliff.

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,400
It occurred to me

51
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
that Auntie Zheng lived here.

52
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,880
That's right.

53
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,880
There are many rare herbs on the cliff,

54
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,600
but life is more valuable.

55
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,240
Fortunately, he's strong.

56
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,240
Take some medicine

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,320
to eliminate the stagnant blood
in the stomach.

58
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,200
Thanks, doctor.

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,280
Remember, he has to rest for a few days.

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,040
Doctor, come with me.

61
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,880
Okay.

62
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,760
Auntie Zheng.

63
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,360
Please prepare the medicine.

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,520
Okay.

65
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,640
Hey, please don't.

66
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,400
My Lady, you've helped us a lot.

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
You saved Dalang's life.

68
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,200
It's not a big deal.

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,440
We'll stay here for the night.

70
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,800
I'm afraid we'll bother you.

71
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,160
Please

72
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,760
take the money.

73
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,680
This...

74
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,320
Okay.

75
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,040
Rest early.

76
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,360
I'll leave the room.

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,240
General, you should rest.

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,560
Why are you staring at me?

79
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
When did I become your brother?

80
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,680
Shouldn't I be your husband?

81
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,560
You...

82
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,880
Open the door!

83
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,480
Open the door!

84
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,760
- Open the door!
- Coming!

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,880
San...

86
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,760
Brother, should we search her house?

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,440
San,

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,000
you know my family's situation.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,520
Dalang has been ill for a long time.

90
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,120
His pneumonia

91
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,840
has cost all their money.

92
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,480
They have nothing to offer

93
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,560
except for this family mansion.

94
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,920
We should hurry up to catch that woman

95
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,680
and let the Zhous reward us.

96
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,840
That's the priority.

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,200
We're leaving.

98
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
Let's go.

99
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,520
I can't believe the bandits
work for them.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
Yun,

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,960
why is your body so hot?

102
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,960
Maybe it was caused by the shock.

103
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,040
It's okay.

104
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,800
Wait here.

105
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,040
I'll call the doctor.

106
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,880
No.

107
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,080
We're just common people now.

108
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,320
If we call a doctor for a small disease,

109
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,840
they'll definitely suspect us.

110
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,200
Okay.

111
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,720
Then lie down.

112
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,620
I'll get some water.

113
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,320
Yun.

114
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
You visited a lot of powerful people
in the capital

115
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,920
and went to the Zhou's Village

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,440
to meet the family head.

117
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,080
What do you want?

118
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,440
Did you follow me?

119
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,360
I sent shadow guards to protect you,

120
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,040
but I was still worried.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,560
Fortunately, I came here today.

122
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,880
Otherwise...

123
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,840
You're overthinking it.

124
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,040
I just want to become familiar with them

125
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,200
and get prepared for
becoming the lady in charge.

126
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,440
If you only wanted to get to know them,

127
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,120
why would they hurt you?

128
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,040
General, don't you think

129
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,180
you're going too far?

130
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,400
It's my family matter.

131
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,800
They want to hurt you,

132
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,000
and it's my business.

133
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,400
Does it hurt?

134
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,840
It's getting late.

135
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,000
I need to rest.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,880
Okay.

137
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,400
I'll get some water.

138
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,120
(Chuyi,)

139
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,600
(I hope you'll never find out
what I'm doing)

140
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
(and live a carefree life.)

141
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,600
Where is my wife?

142
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,400
I...

143
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,880
I don't know.

144
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,720
It's midnight.

145
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,360
Yunxi never stays out overnight.

146
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,520
She must be in danger.

147
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,440
If you really care about her,

148
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,040
you should tell me the truth.

149
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
No!

150
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,320
Chuyi!

151
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,800
So cold...

152
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,560
So cold...

153
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,120
Cold...

154
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,680
It's okay. I'm here.

155
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,640
Blood...

156
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,040
So much blood...

157
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,240
So much blood...

158
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,080
So much blood...

159
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,120
- It's okay.
- Blood...

160
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,800
Yun, you're having a nightmare.

161
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,400
No...

162
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,040
No...

163
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm here.

164
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,360
I'm here.

165
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,600
It's okay. I'm here.

166
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,840
Don't...

167
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,600
Don't leave me.

168
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,400
Chuyi!

169
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,860
Wake up!

170
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,760
Wake up!

171
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
Don't leave me!

172
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,840
I'll never leave you.

173
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,680
No...

174
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,160
No...

175
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm here.
