yet you came back to the capital,

67
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,640
and many people have seen you.

68
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,000
The Crown Prince
will definitely slander you.

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,000
No.

71
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,160
It's my family issue.

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,000
You're just an outsider.

73
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,200
I thought you'd be safe

74
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,240
after I left the capital.

75
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,320
It turns out

76
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,720
someone doesn't want me to leave.

77
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,120
Then you shouldn't have come back.

a father to his disciples.

79
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,440
Please let me do this

80
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,640
for you.

81
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,400
Otherwise, I can't focus on the war.

82

83
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,200
no matter where he is and

84
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
what he's going through,

85
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,840
as long as he's not around you,

86
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,600
you'll never feel safe.

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,600
Chuyi.

88
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,880
I also want to feel safe.

89
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,960
I know I can't persuade you,

90
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,440
but if

91
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,840
you don't want me to die with regrets,

92
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,040
please go back and wait for my message.

93
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,600
It's not that simple.

94
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,840
I'm afraid they have another plan.

95
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,800
Let's wait until

96
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,240
I get the cure from him tonight.

97
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,400
Okay.

98
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,760
I'll wait until midnight.

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,360
Lord Zhou, you foresaw everything.

100
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,600
I thought Xiao Chuyi couldn't make it.

101
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,440
When I was about to kill
the Crown Prince's man

102
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,400
and save Lady Lu,

103
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
he arrived.

104
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,880
Did he come back alone?

105
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,400
Not even with his henchman.

106
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,120
Take the Crown Prince's token
and order

107
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,680
the soldiers of Wujiang
to enter the city.

108
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,840
(Order)
Don't miss the chance.

109
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
I'll shut down the city,

110
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,040
and Xiao Chuyi will never get out.

111
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,440
We'll kill him

112
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,560
before they're back.

113
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,840
How should we close the gate?

114
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,400
The Crown Prince

115
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,840
should pay the price.

116
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,300
(Zhou's Mansion)

117
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,920
Che!

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,280
Where did you take Che?

119
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,520
What do you want?

120
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,240
I need something from you.

121
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,760
When I get it,

122
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,040
you'll see Che.

123
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,000
If the Crown Prince knows
I took the scroll out,

124
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,520
he'll stop giving me the cure.

125
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,760
Yunxi,

126
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,360
I'll never hurt you

127
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,520
or Che.

128
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,880
I'll do what Xiao Chuyi can't do.

129
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,920
I'll save Che.

130
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,960
Wait for me.

131
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,640
Chuyi.

132
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
I'll escort you.

133
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,800
You must leave now.

134
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,920
Huai County's revolt

135
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
is not real.

136
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,080
They did it

137
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,680
to lure you back to the capital

138
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,960
when your army is miles away.

139
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,320
Please listen to me.

140
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,310
Leave now!

141
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,270
If I leave,

142
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,480
they'll definitely hurt Yun.

143
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,240
Your Highness,

144
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,400
Zhou Yanyu went to the court,

145
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,920
and he was granted
a golden sword breaker.

146
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,880
They heard His Majesty called
the prince a nasty man

147
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,720
and wanted to ruin him.

148
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,760
Here's my order.

149
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,840
Find the Crown Prince.

150
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,680
Aye.

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,880
Brother, go back to your mansion.

152
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't let your people get involved.

153
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,240
The prince is going to fall.

154
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,280
You must stay calm at this point.

155
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,920
Chuyi.

156
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,040
Seven years ago,

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,880
you posed as me
to distract their main force.

158
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,640
I won't abandon you this time.

159
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,960
If I leave now,

160
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,440
I'll become a shameless deserter!

161
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,280
Brother!

162
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,800
You're going to take the throne.

163
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,120
You can't make mistakes.

164
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,680
If anything happens,

165
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,600
all our efforts will be in vain.

166
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,360
Who will avenge the brothers

167
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,600
died in Luoxia Ridge?

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,870
Chuyi...

169
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,720
- Guards!
- Aye!

170
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,570
- Take him back!
- Aye!

171
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,600
No. Chuyi!

172
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,800
Zhou Yanyu!

173
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,840
Are you going to rebel?

174
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,200
I've given the scroll to His Majesty.

175
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,640
You're the traitor now.

176
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,320
His Majesty granted me

177
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,600
the golden sword breaker.

178
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
It'll knock the evil ruler

179
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,160
and nasty officials.

180
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,680
If the Crown Prince surrenders,

181
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,040
he shall meet His Highness.

182
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,600
If he resists,

183
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,960
I'll lead the forbidden guards

184
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,040
to kill the traitor.

185
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,280
What?

186
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,200
Nasty dog!

187
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,320
You're my shadow guard!

188
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,440
Kill him now!

189
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,780
I forgot to tell you.

190
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,720
This is Prince Luesha from Wujiang.

191
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,760
Your Highness.

192
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,480
We are the ones who helped you

193
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,040
form an alliance with Wujiang.

194
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,040
It turns out you're the mastermind.

195
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,680
A clean hand wants no washing.

196
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,800
If you didn't want
to betray the country,

197
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,000
how could I have tempted you?

198
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,080
I need to see Father.

199
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,120
I need to see Father!

200
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
I need to see Father!

201
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,960
I need...

202
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,560
Crown Prince has escaped.

203
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,480
Shut down the city

204
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,760
and search every corner.

205
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,360
Tonight,

206
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,440
let's finish what should've been done
seven years ago.

207
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,940
(Seven Years Ago, Border)
We're at war,

208
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,680
and you risked your life to come.

209
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,080
What do you want?

210
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,440
Prince Su took his best soldiers
to attack Luoxia Ridge,

211
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,720
and you kept losing.

212
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,320
The border of Wujiang will soon fall,

213
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:01,280
and

214
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,320
Tianyun's army will break in
through Luoxia Ridge.

215
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,320
My father and I are ready to die.

216
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,490
What if

217
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,200
you can get Prince Su's Defense Map?

218
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
If we have it,

219
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,000
Father can not only defend Luoxia Ridge

220
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
but eliminate all of them.

221
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,160
Recently,

222
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,840
our Crown Prince

223
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,760
ordered my mother to
discuss with your father about alliance.

224
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,040
And you can

225
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,080
ask for this thing at the meeting.

226
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,960
The Zhous have served three emperors,

227
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,920
and you're the top scholar

228
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,280
who works for Hanlin Academy.

229
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,120
You have a bright future.

230
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,800
Why would you help me?

231
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,320
My cousin Xiao Chuyi
is Prince Su's soldier.

232
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,240
I want him to die.
