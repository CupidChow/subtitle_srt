=Episode 36=

11
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,920
I summoned you here late at night

12
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,040
because I got an urgent message

13
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,480
that the remnants of Wujiang
rose again in Huai County

14
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,040
and killed the magistrate's
entire family.

15
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
10 thousand soldiers

16
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,800
are heading towards the prefecture.

17
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,920
After General Xiao and I
broke their capital,

18
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,360
they had to sign the city agreement.

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,640
They shouldn't be able to
fight against us.

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,400
I'm afraid

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,360
something else is behind the scenes.

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,400
I don't understand military,

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,850
but I know Wujiang is surrounded
by mountains and hills,

24
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,040
featuring complex landscapes,

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,580
high humidity,

26
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,540
and severe climate.

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,120
I think

28
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,040
a group of disobedient desperados

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,360
want to use the landscape
to fight against us.

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
If we don't stop them now,

31
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
it'll be

32
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,560
a disaster.

33
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,420
I suggest...

34
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,280
I suggest...

35
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,240
Hand over the army back to Xiao Chuyi.

36
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,840
Order him to suppress the rebellion.

37
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,440
Is Xiao Chuyi the only general we have?

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,840
Of course not,

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,600
but Xiao Chuyi

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,200
can intimidate the enemy.

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,280
They fear him.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,160
If he goes to the frontier,

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,600
we'll be more likely to win

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,720
and lose fewer soldiers.

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,040
Father,

46
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,920
I also suggest

47
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,440
that we use Xiao Chuyi.

48
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,620
(Military Report)

49
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,280
Forget it.

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Write a decree.

51
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,700
(Qingzhou Border)

52
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,880
Chuyi.

53
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,240
As for the assassination,

54
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
I know

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,320
there's nothing I can do
to make up for it.

56
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,920
But I need to tell you

57
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,200
that the Crown Prince
recommended you

58
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,400
with no good intentions.

59
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,920
If I stay in the capital,

60
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,160
he'll only give Yun a hard time.

61
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,720
If you feel guilty,

62
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,520
please take care of her.

63
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,770

71
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,600
Take care of yourself.

72
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,920
General, don't worry.

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,720
As long as I'm the lady in charge,

74
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,000
the Crown Prince won't hurt me.

75
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,840
Well then.

77
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,310

Greetings, Father.

92
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,200
What's the matter?

93
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,600
I want to relieve your burden.

Relieve my burden?

What burden?

96
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,840
Wujiang's invasion.

97
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,780
I have a plan

98
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
that can help you conquer Wujiang

99
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,880
and eliminate the threat.

100
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,200
Father, do you remember

101
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,240
the Defender General of Wujiang
in the prison camp,

102
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,560
who was captured by Xiao Chuyi?

103
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,400
He's so stubborn.

104
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,480
I gave him a chance to surrender,

105
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,280
but he'd rather die.

106
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,720
So ungrateful.

107
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,840
Lately, I found out he has a weakness.

108
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,280
If he's willing to surrender,

109
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
our army will be invincible

110
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,560
and eliminate Wujiang,

111
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,920
and we won't need
to rely on Xiao Chuyi alone.

112
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,440
His weakness is that

113
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,480
he likes women,

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,560
beautiful women.

115
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,440
I thought you'd impress me.

116
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,040
Badger game?

117
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,380
It's easy.

118
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,120
I wish it was that simple,

119
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,120
but it's hard to find

120
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,280
the perfect beauty

121
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,080
that can get him with one shot

122
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,760
while he's off-guard.

123
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,320
If she fails

124
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,040
and makes him suspect us,

125
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,480
he'll never surrender.

126
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,360
That's right.

127
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,580
There are countless beauties in Wujiang.

128
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,880
The general must've seen
all kinds of women.

129
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,920
A normal beauty can't take him down.

130
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,640
Father, you're right.

131
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,080
In the badger game,

132
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,880
the beauty has to be

133
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,800
not only pretty but unique.

134
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,960
She shall be restrained, natural,

135
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,000
eloquent,

136
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,240
thoughtful, and sympathetic.

137
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,440
She must be superior to
the arrogant general

138
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,920
so that he'll be willing

139
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,360
to surrender.

140
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
That's all nonsense.

141
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,480
How can we find such a woman?

142
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,560
Father, mercy.

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,320
We have a perfect choice.

144
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,160
Who?

145
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,720
The Grand Tutor's wife,

146
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,040
Lady in Charge of the Zhou Family,
Lu Yunxi.

147
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,080
First, Lu Yunxi is Lord Zhou's wife.

148
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,480
Besides, don't you know
her relationship with Xiao Chuyi?

149
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,960
If I force the woman he loves

150
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,440
to seduce the enemy,

151
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,960
he'll definitely betray us.

152
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,970
Father, don't worry.

153
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,440
As long as we have Lu Yunxi,

154
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,960
Xiao Chuyi will never rebel.

155
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,670
Besides,

156
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,520
the lady in charge can always

157
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,720
look at the bigger picture.

158
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,840
She won't tell anyone,

159
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,880
and Xiao Chuyi will not betray us.

160
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,960
If we manage to get the general to talk,

161
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,320
Xiao Chuyi will be even stronger

162
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,860
and make remarkable contributions.

163
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,880
Then will Lu Yunxi

164
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,240
agree to this?

165
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,720
We need a suitable person
to persuade her.

166
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,200
I...

167
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,360
Tell me.

168
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,040
Your third son,

169
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,480
Xiao Chuyi's brother,

170
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,230
Prince Su.

171
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,320
First, he's a prince who

172
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,920
has to defend the country.

173
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,240
Second,

174
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,960
he knows Lu Yunxi well.

175
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
She'll listen to him.

176
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,640
Your Majesty,

177
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,440
for the frontline soldiers,

178
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,680
for the people's livelihoods.

179
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,760
Okay.

180
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,940
(Chuyi, Safe Return)

181
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,560
(Mother, may your soul bless Chuyi
and ensure his safe return.)

182
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,280
Are you praying for Chuyi?

183
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,880
Your Highness.

184
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,920
We're alone tonight.

185
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,340
Don't be polite.

186
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,800
Your Highness, what do you need?

187
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,140
(Secret Decree)

188
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,470
Why did His Majesty suddenly order me
to persuade the general of Wujiang?

189
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,240
I don't think

190
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,840
it was my father's idea.

191
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,640
It must be my brother's plan.

192
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,400
My brother was born
in the deep area of the palace,

193
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,140
raised by women,

194
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,840
and befriended by eunuchs.

195
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,120
He only learned how to play dirty

196
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,040
instead of stabilizing the country.

197
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,560
If it was him,

198
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,440
he'd set up five people.

199
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,360
Me, Chuyi,

200
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,200
Grand Tutor,

201
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
you,

202
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,800
and the Defender General of Wujiang.

203
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,640
His Majesty has made a decree.

204
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
I have no choice

205
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,480
but to do this.

206
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,780
Yunxi,

207
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,400
a carriage is ready outside the city.

208
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,200
After we failed
to assassinate the Crown Prince,

209
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,840
Chuyi ignored me for many days.

210
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,680
As his brother,

211
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,160
I can't hurt him again.

212
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,800
Please go.

213
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,240
Thanks, Your Highness.

214
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
However, he still has Che.

215
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,760
Even if there's only a slight chance,

216
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,560
I'll have to save my son.

217
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,160
Don't worry about Chuyi.

218
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,200
I'll solve the urgent crisis
for the court.

219
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,160
I won't make any trouble.

220
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,520
- You...
- I've made up my mind.

221
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,520
Your Highness, don't worry.

222
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,920
I have a plan.

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,720
Emperor Yong'an still remembers me?

224
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
I've waited for so long.

225
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,520
It turns out he still has a conscience.

226
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Do you remember

227
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,840
Lady Xia Bing?

228
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,360
You know Bing?

229
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,380
(The emperor ordered Lady Lu
to persuade the general of Wujiang.)

230
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,160
Xu Da, listen,

231
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,080
tell our soldiers

232
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,160
to march at full speed.

233
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,240
Obey, or die.

234
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,360
Aye.

235
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,400
I need to go back.

236
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,880
I'll keep up with you later.

237
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,480
Wait a minute.

238
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,880
If our eyes send a message,

239
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,960
report it to me.

240
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,520
- Go!
- Go!

241
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,400
- Go!

242
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,440
- Go!

243
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,400
Seven years ago,

244
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,920
I saw Lady Xia selling wine

245
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,840
at the post station in Luoxia Ridge.

246
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,480
Three years ago,

247
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,520
I went there again

248
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,240
and had some chats with her.

249
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,680
Then I found out

250
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,320
she's been waiting for

251
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,720
someone she might never see again.

252
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,120
As women,

253
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,800
we don't understand wars and revenge,

254
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,800
but we know what it's like

255
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,800
to miss someone.

256
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,920
Yesterday, I sent someone to find her.

257
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,920
General, if you surrender,

258
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,560
I believe

259
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,840
you'll reunite with her soon.

260
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,120
My Lady, you're truly
a remarkable woman.

261
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,160
Your words have touched
the deepest part of me.

262
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,800
From now on,
I'll do anything for Tianyun.

263
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,720
With your help,

264
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,920
I believe the people of both nations
will enjoy peace and happiness.

265
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,360
My Lady.

266
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,360
You must know

267
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,400
Xiao Chuyi and I have been
rivals for many years.

268
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,080
Since you're his woman,

269
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,520
I won't let you go easily tonight.
