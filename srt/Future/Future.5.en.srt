(Episode 5)

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,720
[Never have to think]

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,760
[Never have to worry]

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,680
[Everything I do is up to me]

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,420
[My heart never has to think about anyone]

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,820
[But when I met you]

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,780
[You make me confused]

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,040
[Why am I feeling nervous]

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,620
[What happen to me?]

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,440
[Maybe it's intimacy or faith..]

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,220
[that make my heart shake]

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:11,580
[My heart beats faster especially when our eyes meet]

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,040
[I'm falling hard for you]

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,860
[Never been like this before]

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,220
[Really falling for you]

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,180
[It's all because of you]

21
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,240
[It's all because of you]

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,240
Where is Ana?

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,500
Dunno. I've been waiting for ages.

24
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,360
Finally, you came!

25
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,420
Hey.

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,620
Ana.

27
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,180
What's wrong?

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,040
Who is it? Who wronged you?

29
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,840
It's Fuse's mother.

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,520
She came.

31
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,200
What makes you cry?

32
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,500
She doesn't like me.

33
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:39,740
I'm worried that I'll have
to break up with him.

34
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,460
It's alright.

35
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,660
You're good.

36
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,580
Hey.

37
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,700
Don't be afraid.

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,760
What did Fuse say?

39
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,360
He said he loves me.

40
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,160
He won't break up.

41
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,800
Um, see?

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,580
Just believe in him.

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,840
I'm scared...

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,100
I'm scared of his mom. Can I call her that?

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,100
I'm afraid that

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,820
if I can't be with him,

47
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,580
I won't be able to live.

48
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,080
Hm.

49
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,880
I feel you.

50
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,440
But as Polla said,

51
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,680
you need to believe in Fuse.

52
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm afraid of breaking up with him.

53
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,860
You love him so much, Ana.

54
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,380
It's killing you.

55
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,500
I...

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,240
He is my strength.

57
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,380
Um.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,340
Keep fighting.

59
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,700
Hang in there.

60
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:20,396
Fuse will take care of it.

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,080
His mom just dislikes you.

62
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,040
Use cooking skills to win her heart.

63
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,960
Oh, you don't have that.

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Polla!

65
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:36,564
It's the truth!

66
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,480
Well, forget it.

67
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,132
Fuse is head over heels for you.

68
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:42,920
Um.

69
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,240
Don't worry too much.

70
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,000
Right?

71
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,340
If you love him,

72
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,340
do what he says.

73
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,100
Hm.

74
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,440
He said go study.

75
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,000
Then stop overthinking and go study.

76
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,280
Trust your man and you'll be successful.

77
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,740
Um!

78
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,780
Let's go to class.

79
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,700
Studying is very important

80
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,220
since it's our future.

81
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,740
Let's go!

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,380
But I'm worried about Fuse.

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,700
Hm.

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,180
He's also worried about you.

85
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,780
But what you can do
now is to make him relax.

86
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,540
Don't make him worry.

87
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,340
- Yeah, let's go to study.
- Um.

88
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,040
Let him handle his mom.

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,820
I totally agree.

90
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,040
Don't think too much.

91
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,680
What should I do?

92
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,840
Just do nothing.

93
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,060
I'm not breaking up.

94
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,680
Fuse!

95
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,720
Mom.

96
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,420
I first thought I was
just infatuated with him.

97
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,300
But now I still can't bear
staying away from him.

98
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
I'm very happy to be by his side.

99
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,460
I can't break up.

100
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,900
But he's a man!

101
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,000
Do you really think you
can be with him forever?

102
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,500
I've been with him all this time,
and there hasn't been a problem yet.

103
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,320
But... if you have problems
with him being a man,

104
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,120
I don't know what to say.

105
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,900
I'm the one who's with him.

106
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,780
Fuse.

107
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,780
Don't you think about your dad and mom?

108
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,980
I'm sorry... for disappointing you guys.

109
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,260
And I'm sorry that...

110
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,500
I can't have a child.

111
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:21,940
Fuse!

112
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
If you talk like this,

113
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,920
Do you intend to spend the
rest of your days with him?

114
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,080
As of now, the answer is "yes".

115
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,060
I know we can't predict the future.

116
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,980
But...

117
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,320
I want Ana... to be my future.

118
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,440
I know it's hard to accept,

119
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:03,296
but please don't stop me.

120
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,520
Fuse, I know I can't stop you.

121
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,020
But how about dad? He's furious.

122
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,580
And I came here because he told me to.

123
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,880
Think about it yourself.

124
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,180
So... you've accepted us?

125
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,740
That's not it.

126
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:24,744
I just can't stop you.

127
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,240
Mom.

128
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,340
Ana is really cute.

129
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,320
I want you to see that side of him.

130
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,100
Hm.

131
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:41,349
Do you normally live like this?

132
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,940
Yeah, but...

133
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,800
I stay in his room more.

134
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,760
Be careful, okay?

135
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,680
I know.

136
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:57,004
Did you only come here to see me?

137
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,320
Yes.

138
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,200
It's because we can't
contact you at all.

139
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,720
No calls or communication.

140
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,835
Your dad is very angry and worried,

141
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,400
so he sent me here.

142
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,440
Are you going back right away?

143
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,760
Nah, not yet.

144
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,320
I'll attend my friend's daughter's
wedding in the evening.

145
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,700
Oh.

146
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,160
Take care, Fuse.

147
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,000
Mom and dad are so worried about you.

148
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,600
As for why we don't
want you to be with him?

149
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,580
It's because we're afraid
that you won't get along well.

150
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,740
There, there.

151
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,600
I love you guys.

152
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,300
Hm.

153
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,680
We love you, too.

154
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,840
Um.

155
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,760
This year, a lot of top
players are on the list.

156
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,760
- Yeah.
- Have you recruited anyone?

157
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,680
I'm trying!

158
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
We're running out of time.

159
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,700
You can play?

160
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,200
Look at your clothes, Kamphan.

161
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,060
- What are you thinking?
- I'm kidding.

162
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,100
You need to hurry.

163
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,560
I know, that's what I'm doing.

164
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,860
Hey!

165
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,920
Thanks for coming!

166
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,820
You're right on time!

167
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,760
So you can play, right? I'm
going to send the list of players.

168
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,760
Well,

169
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,280
unfortunately, I can't.

170
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,720
Why?!

171
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,740
I just talked to mom about Ana.

172
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,040
So what?

173
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,420
So...

174
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,560
did you quarrel with her?

175
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,200
Um... it's not like that.

176
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,500
But.

177
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,500
She just objected.

178
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,180
She saw us in bed this morning.

179
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,180
Hm.

180
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:47,805
So she asked you to break up?

181
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,320
Not to that extent.
She just doesn't support it.

182
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,660
What did Ana say?

183
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,360
I sent him to class this morning.

184
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:02,620
Uh-huh.

185
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,180
He briefly met her.

186
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,840
But it looks like he cried.

187
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,400
So you're not okay right now?

188
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Of course!

189
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,080
I feel like dying.

190
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,140
Fine, I'll be the player myself.

191
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,280
You are the most ready, bro.

192
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,640
Damn!

193
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:26,164
Are you going to sit here or go find Ana?

194
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,360
I'll stay here.

195
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,160
Ana is still studying.

196
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,380
Kamphan, you stay with him.

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,760
About the match, I'll
try asking someone else.

198
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,100
- Gotcha.
- Let's go. It's about time.

199
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,960
I knew you'd have to do it.

200
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,320
Keep fighting!

201
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,560
- Do I really need to play?
- You're all dressed up!

202
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,820
Why didn't you tell me?

203
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:04,036
It's too sudden.

204
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:06,754
My mom went back just now.

205
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,510
Er.

206
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:10,666
And Mark also got sick.

207
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,690
Find a lover if you're lonely.

208
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,890
What if I find one and his mom
dislikes me? That's not okay.

209
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,410
Hey.

210
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,950
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,830
Er, I'm not upset.

212
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,570
I'm just thinking about what he feels.

213
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,890
What is he thinking?

214
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,010
Er, well.

215
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,750
You're both in love

216
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,830
and he's strong.

217
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,330
I can't see a way out.

218
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,410
His parents are not satisfied with me.

219
00:12:59,050 --> 00:12:59,870
And my parents...

220
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,050
It's okay. Take it easy.

221
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,810
I understand.

222
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,950
Let me rest.

223
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,130
Fuse.

224
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,570
Ana.

225
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,730
Err... we...

226
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,090
I'm going back to grab my
things, can I have the key?

227
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:27,362
I'll take you there.

228
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,030
- Hey, I have to go.
- Er.

229
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:32,890
Ana!

230
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,750
Ana.

231
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,850
Ana.

232
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:41,910
Ana.

233
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,870
Ana!

234
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,630
There's nothing between us!

235
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,670
I have no feelings for him.

236
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,370
He is just a friend who
tried to console me.

237
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,870
I know. I understand.

238
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,910
I'm just thinking why
that person wasn't me.

239
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,750
When you're not feeling well,

240
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,810
why does another person take that place?

241
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,630
Why do you think like that?

242
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,490
I was studying when you talked to your mom.

243
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,906
And I'm not with you when you feel uneasy.

244
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,110
You make me happy, Fuse.

245
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,830
But I might not be your happiness.

246
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,470
What does that mean?

247
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,330
Are you looking down on my feelings and your love?

248
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,630
I think...

249
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,010
Is my love not enough?

250
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,310
Or are your feelings fading away?

251
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,170
No!

252
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,630
Can you give me some time?

253
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,950
Time for what?!

254
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,530
Maybe your mom was right.

255
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,390
You're like this because you
spent too much time with me.

256
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,110
You never give others a chance.

257
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,370
If you try to be with someone else,

258
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,450
things might get better.

259
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:26,730
Ana!

260
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,590
You're too attached to me.

261
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,670
You told me that...

262
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,170
You've never taken anyone seriously.

263
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,490
I'm the first.

264
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,910
If I let you be with
someone better than me,

265
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:43,211
or if you follow what your mom wants,

266
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,950
Things might... be better.

267
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,450
And I'll just be another
person in your life.

268
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,310
So you really want to break up?

269
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,030
It's not that I want to.

270
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,090
I just want you to think it over.

271
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,710
Did you think it through?

272
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,810
Telling me this,

273
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,030
are you entirely certain?

274
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,030
I'm asking if you thought it through!

275
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,590
Um.

276
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,630
Here is the key and the key card.

277
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,610
Get whatever you need.

278
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,070
Come back whenever you want.

279
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,170
I'll wait.

280
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,390
Ana.

281
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,150
Mom.

282
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,130
Did he upset you again?

283
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,350
I asked him to break up myself.

284
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,910
It hurts.

285
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,610
Why did you do that if it hurts?

286
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,634
I'm uncertain.

287
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,750
I'm not sure... if I can be his happiness.

288
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,350
I'm his first boyfriend.

289
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,890
So I think...

290
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,810
He might find someone better?

291
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,450
Why do you think that way?

292
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,790
Don't you love each other?

293
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,650
Mom and dad don't like him.

294
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,290
And his parents also don't support us.

295
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,550
If I retreat,

296
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,290
and let him go without me,

297
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,899
it might be better, mom.

298
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,850
Is it really better?

299
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,330
Listen to me, Ana.

300
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,670
If you think retreating is the best option, do it.

301
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,550
Act like usual and be strong.

302
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,710
See which one is better, between
when you have him and don't have him.

303
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,350
I love him so much, mom.

304
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:10,150
How many days do you need
for healing this time, hm?

305
00:19:13,334 --> 00:19:17,434
Don't count. I'm not even sure if I can get over him.

306
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:27,070
Don't you want time to rethink?

307
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:33,470
You came to me to
rethink, not to be sad.

308
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,430
Right?

309
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,450
I just miss him.

310
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,650
I understand you, Ana.

311
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,270
If you miss him, then go back to him.

312
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,830
We don't understand
why you stay away from him.

313
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,750
Why bother asking about him if you don't like him?

314
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,270
Who told you I don't?

315
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,450
I'll tell you something.

316
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:12,710
Your dad told me Fuse is
good-looking and looks reliable.

317
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:15,086
Ana.

318
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,750
If you can't stand it, just go back to him.

319
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:26,730
Yes.

320
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,950
Can I hug you?

321
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,610
I know you're hurt.

322
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,370
How are you?

323
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,250
I saw that you left early.

324
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,170
He said he had a headache, didn't he?

325
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,130
Do you feel better?

326
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:42,670
Are you alright?

327
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:43,590
Umm.

328
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,350
Well...

329
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,090
How about Fuse?

330
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,550
I asked for a break.

331
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,310
Huh!?

332
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,670
Why?

333
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,030
Are you gonna break up?

334
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,610
How come?

335
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,610
And you said it yourself?

336
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,278
Since when?

337
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,030
Damn.

338
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,310
Don't tell me that...

339
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,450
the day that you seemed depressed

340
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,750
it wasn't from a headache.

341
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,230
Umm.

342
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,390
What happened?

343
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,190
Or you can't tell us?

344
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,790
Even though we seem
to be joking around,

345
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,310
we're your friends.

346
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:44,750
Did you forget?

347
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,750
No, I didn't.

348
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,110
I was uncomfortable back then.

349
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,590
And I was terrified.

350
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:54,570
So I said it.

351
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,110
I don't get you.

352
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,030
I'm not on your side this time.

353
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,010
Polla?

354
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,630
I really mean that.

355
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,570
You say you love him.

356
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,570
And then you asked for a break.

357
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,390
Are you insane?

358
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,094
I understand you.

359
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,070
Umm.

360
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,330
Since you've already said it,

361
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,090
just wait and see

362
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,490
how it will be.

363
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,490
Umm.

364
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,090
OK.

365
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,430
There's nothing we can do.

366
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,430
How are you?

367
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,430
You want to see if you can live without him.

368
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,330
How are you right now?

369
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,710
I miss him a lot.

370
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:49,770
See!

371
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,070
We still don't know what Fuse thinks.

372
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:00,570
Will he miss Ana
like Ana misses him?

373
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,010
Or maybe...

374
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,290
Ana is just his first love,
like he's always been scared of.

375
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:10,870
My dad said

376
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,870
if we really love each other,

377
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,390
we'll find a way to be together again.

378
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,050
OK.

379
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:19,710
So,

380
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,990
Please prove your love.

381
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,990
And I hope you really love each other.

382
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,910
Don't let me know that

383
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,650
somebody has taken him away.

384
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,910
If it's like that

385
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,910
that means they don't
really love each other.

386
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,070
If it's like that

387
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,730
that means he just has
a deep bond with me.

388
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:47,510
I'm just the first one who
teach him what love is.

389
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,510
It can't be that way.

390
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,510
You have to take him back.

391
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,170
And make him love you again.

392
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,330
It's not that easy.

393
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,170
There are many things
that affected my decision

394
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,430
such as

395
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,430
his parents,

396
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,670
my family issues.

397
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,150
I can't say anything about this.

398
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,270
So.

399
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,270
That means you're single.

400
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,530
But we haven't broken up.

401
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,250
Hey, don't be possessive.

402
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,010
You asked for a break

403
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,910
that means he can see someone new.

404
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,490
But.

405
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,250
I'm still his.

406
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,250
So.

407
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,410
If your heart still belongs to him,

408
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:38,970
let's go to the club.

409
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,730
You like to ask for trouble, huh?

410
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,730
Look at your friend.

411
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,330
Is he going to be OK?

412
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,630
I'm OK.

413
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,770
Same place, 9 PM.

414
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,270
Let's go.

415
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:00,750
I'll go too.

416
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,690
Hey, here you are.

417
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:07,330
Drink it.

418
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,630
Why we have to drink
when we're heart broken?

419
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,470
Don't say that you're heart broken.

420
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,250
You broke his heart.

421
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,250
Yes.

422
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,930
My little Fuse.

423
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,770
He wouldn't have ended up
like this if he had been with me.

424
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:37,970
Umm.

425
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,850
- If he had been with a girl, he would be.
- Shut up!

426
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,970
And drink that glass.

427
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,570
Keep drinking.

428
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,050
Here's the deal.

429
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,050
If anyone talks about this,

430
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,050
you have to drink the whole bottle.

431
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,610
Good.

432
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,410
OK?

433
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,270
Deal. Cheers.

434
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:04,430
It's empty.

435
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,050
Look over there.

436
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,470
Also empty.

437
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,430
I'll order more.

438
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,850
I'll come with you.

439
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,730
I wanna see some hot guys.

440
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,490
Take me with you.

441
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,010
Take me with you.

442
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,630
Let's see some hot guys.

443
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,650
Let's find some hot guys.

444
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,330
Are you drunk?

445
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:49,390
Top!

446
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,030
I saw that your friends aren't here,

447
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:54,894
can I sit here?

448
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,550
If you'll start a fight,

449
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,990
I won't talk to you.

450
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:15,270
Well...

451
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,330
Where's Fuse?

452
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,350
He's always stuck to you.

453
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,590
How can he not be here?

454
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,530
Well...

455
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,710
We must have our personal time.

456
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,170
Are you alright?

457
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,990
Even though we used to fight,

458
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:47,165
we can still be friends.

459
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,310
I can be friend with you.

460
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,510
It would be nice if you're not
taking this friendship too far.

461
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,030
I know.

462
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,450
You have a boyfriend.

463
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:58,970
I won't interfere.

464
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,150
But...

465
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,150
if you broke up with him, then I might.

466
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,290
I think

467
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,830
you'd better not be
interested in my relationship.

468
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,910
I have to go to toilet.

469
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,310
Let me help.

470
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:31,950
Cheers! Yeah.

471
00:29:41,194 --> 00:29:41,614
Fuse.

472
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,710
Kamphan saw that you got dumped.

473
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,390
He's so upset.

474
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,410
What happened? Can you tell us?

475
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,630
I don't want to talk about it now.

476
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,230
If you don't tell,

477
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,230
we won't be able to help you.

478
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:02,910
Just tell us.

479
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:04,750
At least,

480
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,990
we're here to listen.

481
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:07,910
Yes.

482
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:13,790
Well...

483
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,410
He thinks that.

484
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,970
I don't really love him.

485
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,050
Damn it.

486
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,170
I feel sorry for you bro.

487
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,410
Err... wait.

488
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,770
Hold on.

489
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,930
Ana dumped Fuse, not you.

490
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,390
A tee!

491
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,630
I feel sorry for my bro!

492
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,930
Calm down.

493
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,350
Where the hell is Ana?

494
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,110
I'll beat him.

495
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,410
Calm down, take a seat.

496
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,470
Aren't you mad?

497
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,670
I'm mad!

498
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,410
I've passed that point already.

499
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,970
Hey Fuse, try to think about the good side.

500
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,210
Maybe this is good for you.

501
00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:24,362
You get to think it over like he said.

502
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,650
And you can open up
to new opportunities.

503
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,570
Yeah, Fuse.

504
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,510
You said Ana said you're too attached to him

505
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,730
because he's your first love, right?

506
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,070
Well, I'll help you
find a second one.

507
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,190
Let's go bro.

508
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,670
Let's go.

509
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,670
Leave him alone.

510
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,710
Hey, calm down.

511
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:50,810
Come on.

512
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,890
When will Vee and Mark arrive?

513
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,810
They have to be in the lab all night.

514
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,370
Then who's gonna stop them?

515
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,890
Don't stop me.

516
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,890
I'll teach Fuse about love.

517
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,090
Fuse, come on.

518
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,710
You don't have any love
experiences to teach others.

519
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:11,770
Well.

520
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,570
That's right.

521
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,650
I have to say it every time.

522
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,246
Excuse me.

523
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,270
Can I have a toast with Fuse?

524
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,030
I'm in a relationship.

525
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,230
I know.

526
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,690
Just a toast.

527
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:42,174
I've been your fan for a long time.

528
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,510
Please.

529
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,850
By the way, who did you come with?
Have you got a table?

530
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:51,530
I came here with my friends.

531
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,530
But they've gone to dance floor.

532
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,110
OK.

533
00:32:58,441 --> 00:32:59,181
Is your name Jam?

534
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,390
Such a cute name.

535
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:08,430
Actually my name is Jom-Jam,
but you can call me Jam.

536
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,790
I've been following Fuse
since the Faculty's star contest.

537
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,090
You were so cool.

538
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,090
Thank you.

539
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,030
If you're really in Fuse's fan club,

540
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,410
you have to drink this glass.

541
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:25,870
Sure.

542
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,090
I don't feel well.

543
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,490
I have to go to the toilet.

544
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,190
Here you go.

545
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,350
This way.

546
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,530
Ouch.

547
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,890
Fuse, you go to the toilet with her.

548
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,530
You said you wanna pee, right?

549
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,750
When!?

550
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,990
Or you will let Jam go alone?

551
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,290
Yeah, you should take her to the toilet.

552
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:18,990
Come on.

553
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,010
Alright.

554
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,170
Let's go, I'll take you to the toilet.

555
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,690
Yes.

556
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,610
Here you go.

557
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,170
Are you forcing him too?

558
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:35,146
She's a girl.

559
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,110
Let's have a toast.

560
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:38,690
Cheers.

561
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,750
Let's enjoy.

562
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,170
Be careful.

563
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,130
Fuse.

564
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:57,610
Ana.

565
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,550
You said he didn't come.

566
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,810
What are you doing?

567
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,170
You're with Ana, aren't you?

568
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,230
You should ask him.

569
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:34,990
Ana.

570
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,130
If you're not OK,

571
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,450
you can stay with me tonight.

572
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,170
You can go.

573
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,370
I'll wait for Fuse.

574
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:01,610
But...

575
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,250
don't you see he's
with another girl?

576
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,530
It's our problem.

577
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,530
Let's me handle this by myself.

578
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,210
Aren't you going with that guy?

579
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,490
No.

580
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,310
Why?

581
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:04,212
Aren't you going with her?

582
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,090
There's nothing between me and her.

583
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,630
And never will be.

584
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,410
I was just taking her to the toilet.

585
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,470
Just that.

586
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:18,111
Really?

587
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:19,826
Why?

588
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,430
Why are you crying?

589
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:57,930
I miss you.

590
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,010
Stop crying.

591
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,790
I'm sorry.

592
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,850
Then stop crying.

593
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,110
I hate when you cry.

594
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,310
I don't like your tears.

595
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,890
Please stop crying.

596
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,270
I'm sorry.

597
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,650
I might not behave well.

598
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,370
I might make you feel upset.

599
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,470
But I can't stop loving you.

600
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,430
Please stop crying.

601
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,770
I can't stop loving you too.

602
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,390
I've been thinking.

603
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:16,350
Um hmm?

604
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,730
Why do we need to take a break?

605
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,950
Why do we need time?

606
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,810
Why do we need to see someone new?

607
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,110
When we still love each other.

608
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:38,790
Did you know?

609
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,290
Even though there are pretty girls

610
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,450
and cute girls,

611
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,610
I can't love them.

612
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,790
Because my heart

613
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,290
belongs to you.

614
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,610
I'm sorry.

615
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,610
I really am.

616
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,990
Come back to me.

617
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,990
Come back and love me.

618
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,990
I do love you.

619
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,550
I always do.

620
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,390
I always love you too.

621
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,150
What took him so long?

622
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,150
Umm.

623
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,890
Hey, did you take Jam back home?

624
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,370
Who's Jam?

625
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,090
That girl you took to the toilet.

626
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,870
How's it?

627
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,110
Ana.

628
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,370
What's going on?

629
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:57,130
As I said,

630
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,490
I'm serious with Ana.

631
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,550
You guys like to pair me with others.

632
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,550
Well.

633
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,550
Just trying.

634
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:19,479
I've tried.

635
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,630
I've tried before I met Ana.

636
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,970
I won't do it again.

637
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,530
Do you get it?

638
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,170
Yes, I do.

639
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,130
What's going on here?

640
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,570
You fought and then made up?

641
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:48,950
If you're not happy when you fight,
then you'd better love each other instead.

642
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,470
The fight doesn't have to be long.

643
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,230
I don't know.

644
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,070
I'll blame Ana anyway.

645
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,670
Why?

646
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:14,010
Future series event.

647
00:42:14,377 --> 00:42:16,852
You can participate by posting
a tweet of your favorite scene

648
00:42:16,877 --> 00:42:21,110
and add the series'
hashtag of that week via Twitter.

649
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:23,322
Every week, the staff's
favorite tweet will be

650
00:42:23,355 --> 00:42:26,910
rewarded with a novel
signed by Boom and Bigboom.

651
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,290
(Next Episode) You said his
parents don't accept, didn't you?

652
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,070
I love him, dad.

653
00:42:34,494 --> 00:42:35,754
No matter what you are,

654
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,590
you're my son.

655
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:48,830
We don't accept our kids
and make them sad, or...

656
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,730
We accept them, and they're happy.

657
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,610
What are we gonna do?
