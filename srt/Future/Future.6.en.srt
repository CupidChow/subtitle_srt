(Future)
(Episode 6)

6
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,510
What does that mean?

7
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:48,509
You fought but we didn't know about it

8
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,510
and now you've made up.

9
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,785
If you're angry with
someone else, it's not good.

10
00:01:56,176 --> 00:01:57,364
Love is a choice.

11
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,582
You don't have to argue forever.

12
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,580
I don't know.

13
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:07,634
Anyway, I'm going to complain you.

14
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,055
Why are you doing that?

15
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,220
You are...

16
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,051
You..

17
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:17,069
You left my friend.

18
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,060
I am so sorry.

19
00:02:22,653 --> 00:02:25,078
Do you think I'll just
forgive you like that?

20
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:27,314
Just...

21
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:29,524
I already forgave him.

22
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,629
When you are sad like a sick dog.

23
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:36,844
When I was looking after you.

24
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:39,202
Why do you forgive him here and now?

25
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:42,893
Listen to me now.

26
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,720
I forgive him.

27
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:51,355
Are you sure?

28
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:53,293
Yes...

29
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:55,197
don't be upset with...

30
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:56,867
Yes...

31
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:01,754
so...

32
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,994
let you tell him that.

33
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,379
He is here

34
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,047
that I...

35
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:10,039
I never liked you

36
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,752
because you are not my type

37
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:15,462
however, I am very cute.

38
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:18,031
..I seriously chose...

39
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:19,597
Huh!

40
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:20,956
Calm down, Calm down

41
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:22,950
That's enough for right
now, leave him alone.

42
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:24,950
Right, Future can you get up?

43
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:26,829
Yes, you can do it.

44
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:30,820
Do you get it?

45
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:33,201
Let's enjoy ourselves.

46
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:36,106
Cheers!!

47
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:38,820
Ana Cheers!

48
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:41,176
Ana used Future's glass for drinking.

49
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:15,768
When I am without you.

50
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:18,191
I cry every night.

51
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Sorry...

52
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:31,078
Umm..

53
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:34,648
Tell me about Top.

54
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:38,829
I went with Paula..

55
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,168
Arr..I forgot my friend.

56
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:45,223
Paula will sleep there.

57
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:47,220
And will come back home in the morning.

58
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:50,302
But I need to know about Top right now.

59
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:53,601
We just said hi.

60
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:56,948
I told him that I did not break up with you

61
00:04:57,741 --> 00:04:59,141
you just didn't
come with me tonight

62
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:01,360
It has nothing to do with it.

63
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:03,995
Can you forgive me please?

64
00:05:09,429 --> 00:05:10,691
I forgive you,

65
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:15,014
but please don't do that again.

66
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:17,346
I can't...

67
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:21,103
So many things happened that day.

68
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:23,345
And... you...

69
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,272
so, my parents didn't like it...

70
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:28,925
but I really like you

71
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:32,920
even though our parents
don't like it, I love you still.

72
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:35,839
Don't break up with me so easily.

73
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
I can't do it.

74
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,813
I don't know what I was thinking then.

75
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:43,005
I just thought I can't have you.

76
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,487
If your parents want you to get
someone who is better than me.

77
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:50,795
I can't do anything.

78
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,714
Do you know.

79
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:55,213
I can do only this.

80
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:57,565
You are better than me

81
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:01,308
don't compare yourself with others.

82
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:04,930
I never compare with
others and I won't do that.

83
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:08,373
I always support you even I have issues
with my mother.

84
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,600
If you do it again.

85
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:13,085
I will be angry with you.

86
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:15,414
I know...

87
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:17,542
you said... you already forgave me.

88
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,446
I was crying so much

89
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,970
my tears filled my
room so many times...

90
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:27,749
You talk too much.

91
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:39,256
I'll do everything to make you happy...

92
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:42,911
but don't make me sad again.

93
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:45,915
I'm begging you.

94
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:49,727
I love you.

95
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:52,071
I won't do it again

96
00:06:53,256 --> 00:06:54,669
I'll make you happy.

97
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:57,300
Every day, I'll love you more.

98
00:06:58,348 --> 00:06:59,348
I promise...

99
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:08,964
Let's do it together.

100
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:11,189
Yes..

101
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,350
Fuse..

102
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:05,852
Your dad is calling.

103
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:09,524
Can you take it...

104
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:13,475
It's your dad.

105
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:20,811
If you don't want
to do, don't do it.

106
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:22,367
If I talk to him, we'll fight.

107
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:30,233
So?

108
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:31,582
Did he take it?

109
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
No...

110
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:33,528
Give it to me

111
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:34,811
I need to do it.

112
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:50,774
Hello.

113
00:08:51,383 --> 00:08:52,383
Who's this?

114
00:08:53,288 --> 00:08:54,422
I am...

115
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:55,447
I am Ana.

116
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:56,816
Boyfriend to...

117
00:08:56,855 --> 00:08:59,163
You're the boyfriend of my crazy son.

118
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,604
Where is he? Why isn't he talking to me?

119
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:03,179
It's morning already.

120
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:05,621
Do you stay together?

121
00:09:10,652 --> 00:09:11,652
Did Mom not tell you?

122
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:14,871
If you don't allow us to
be together, don't call.

123
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:17,535
How dare you!

124
00:09:17,822 --> 00:09:19,521
I am your father.

125
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,592
Yes, you are my dad

126
00:09:20,784 --> 00:09:22,492
you always support me

127
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:24,707
but now, you won’t.

128
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:27,013
How can you two be together?

129
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:30,277
Why?

130
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:33,145
Don't tell me to break up!

131
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,704
We just made up.

132
00:09:35,712 --> 00:09:38,813
I won't stand for this.

133
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,861
How can you do this?

134
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:41,963
How can you do this?!

135
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,342
I can do it just like you did it with Mom.

136
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:47,765
But you're a boy.

137
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,807
Yes, I like boys.

138
00:09:57,204 --> 00:09:58,218
And why you call me?

139
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:00,790
Just to wake me up and curse me out?

140
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:04,006
You don't want to keep in
contact with your parents.

141
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:05,881
You don't answer
my calls or messages.

142
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:07,957
Others never seem to know where you are.

143
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,210
Are you worried?

144
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:14,180
Yes, I am.

145
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:18,323
Our house is finished, and we have
housewarming ceremony in few days.

146
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:20,320
You have to join us.

147
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:21,947
Okay, I will

148
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:24,987
but I will take Ana
to come with me.

149
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:28,748
Okay, If you want.

150
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,187
You can bring all your friends if you want!

151
00:10:37,997 --> 00:10:39,560
Calm down, darling

152
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:40,982
Our son is still so young.

153
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,788
He asked you to go home, right?

154
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,387
Yes...

155
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:56,074
on Saturday.

156
00:10:57,443 --> 00:10:59,118
We have a housewarming
ceremony on Sunday

157
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:02,004
well...

158
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,367
Can you go with me?

159
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:12,187
Come to my house.

160
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:39,917
What's this email...

161
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:40,987
Can you check this?

162
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:42,425
Let me see...

163
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:44,603
Oh.

164
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:46,735
The doctor to take this case

165
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:48,524
Yes..

166
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:51,812
When we take our son, we will meet him.

167
00:11:54,698 --> 00:11:58,070
We have no time to do it because
you should get back to work.

168
00:11:58,425 --> 00:12:02,710
It's okay, you help me think of
this. I'm worried about our son.

169
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,191
Okay, I'll do it.

170
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:12,566
Who's calling you?

171
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:13,841
Who?

172
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:15,385
You take it.

173
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,550
This is the doctor.

174
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:23,947
Hello, I am a dentist.

175
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:27,769
Oh, the dentist.

176
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:29,942
Yes.

177
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:31,933
Ummmm.

178
00:12:31,997 --> 00:12:34,551
Can I talk with you
about something private?

179
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:43,527
What are you reading?

180
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,893
Well, It's about soil.

181
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:49,271
How about you?

182
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:50,727
What are you doing?

183
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:54,218
Taking a questionnaire,
do you want to help?

184
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:03,381
Come with me!

185
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:08,474
Guys! Do you see my eyes?

186
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:10,470
Yes, I do.

187
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,277
Hello senior.

188
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:16,659
What's up, friends?

189
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:19,264
You are late.

190
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,259
Can you see my mouth?

191
00:13:21,284 --> 00:13:23,284
Yes, I do

192
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:25,878
Hey guys, enough.

193
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:35,808
Is there anything that
we still don't know?

194
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,131
We should be saying that to you!

195
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:40,130
Always leaving me,

196
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,109
On that day, you were crying so hard.

197
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,391
But now, you look super happy.

198
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:47,914
How do you make up, how did you do it?

199
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:49,910
Tell me!

200
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:53,834
OK,

201
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:55,830
you didn't know about us.

202
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:57,505
I should know!!

203
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:00,807
I will be leaving you sad.

204
00:14:01,351 --> 00:14:03,122
You didn't look after him.

205
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:04,986
You complained about him

206
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:06,714
Forget it.

207
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:11,760
Don't tell me that you made
and you're together again?

208
00:14:12,104 --> 00:14:15,918
I have no plans to be single.

209
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,644
Well, I think we did not break up.

210
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:22,797
What! and you...

211
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:24,333
You decided...

212
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,329
Just like my friend told me,

213
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,742
to try things with other girls?

214
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:32,689
I...

215
00:14:33,004 --> 00:14:34,465
did try it.

216
00:14:35,644 --> 00:14:36,801
He did.

217
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:38,310
Who is she?

218
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,310
Ana, tell me.

219
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,436
Why, It's none of your business.

220
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:45,430
I'll hit her.

221
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:48,314
Please calm down.

222
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:50,315
Well...

223
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:54,307
All you need to know is.

224
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:56,300
I'm only dating Ana.

225
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:57,671
And...

226
00:14:57,672 --> 00:14:59,670
I love Ana so much.

227
00:15:00,182 --> 00:15:01,402
You!!

228
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:02,427
What!

229
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,089
The person I was hoping to be my husband.

230
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,930
Just said he's in love with
someone else in front of me.

231
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:12,191
He is so mean to me

232
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,927
But the other person he loves,

233
00:15:15,225 --> 00:15:17,450
is your friend! Me!

234
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:19,669
I don't want to be your friend now.

235
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,347
You need me only when you are sad.

236
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:25,340
That's right.

237
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:27,766
I am so sorry for this.

238
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:31,015
To put you in a messy situation.

239
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,453
But I am really thankful for you guys.

240
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,678
For supporting Ana back then.

241
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,529
Ohhhh, my love

242
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,923
so kind.

243
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:49,218
Okay, I accept that.

244
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:51,668
I'm not mad at you.

245
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,225
Stop the nonsense.

246
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:58,684
I promise I won't do it again

247
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:00,556
You mean...

248
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:02,550
You won't argue anymore?

249
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,135
When it comes to arguing,

250
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:07,130
I can't commit to it.

251
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:09,544
But I'll communicate everything.

252
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:12,161
I'll love him more every day.

253
00:16:14,701 --> 00:16:15,347
So..

254
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:17,529
When you break up with him.

255
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,530
Promise me that you'll date me.

256
00:16:19,785 --> 00:16:20,730
No.

257
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:21,686
You don't want to promise me.

258
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:22,686
No more break ups.

259
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,139
I'm headed to class.

260
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:29,255
Okay.

261
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:30,775
So...

262
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,132
After class I'll take you

263
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:33,520
OK.

264
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,317
When I'm done with class, I will call you

265
00:16:39,905 --> 00:16:44,352
and, you don't worry about Kumphan

266
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:52,274
Actually, Kumphan is cute less than you

267
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,181
That's why I will like him.

268
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:59,292
If he hears that you will get hit.

269
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:00,858
If I get hurt,

270
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:02,735
you should kiss me.

271
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:04,308
Kiss for what?

272
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:06,576
A kiss to heal me.

273
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,110
Where do we learn that
kisses turn into healing?

274
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:14,858
I've been studying for a year
and I haven't learned that.

275
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,587
If Fuse did it to me I could
deal with never having teeth.

276
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:31,992
So, I should go to class

277
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:34,901
Bye

278
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:45,753
They are so sweet.

279
00:17:45,754 --> 00:17:47,749
It's cute

280
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,750
I need a tooth extraction.

281
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,770
Hey friend.

282
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,554
Long time no see.

283
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:30,072
I think I will take you from
the Faculty of Dentistry.

284
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:32,286
It's lucky to see you here.

285
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:35,081
Do you have something from me?

286
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,114
Yes.

287
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:38,862
You should guard
our Faculty flag.

288
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:39,809
Faculty flag.

289
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:40,843
Yes

290
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:43,350
Sports day!

291
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:48,369
You still remember
the competition.

292
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:53,847
You just joined two times,
the first day and the last day.

293
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,895
Enough to blame me.

294
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:58,954
OK, you prepare for
guard duty for the faculty flag.

295
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:00,109
Wearing the university uniform

296
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,109
Yeah.

297
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,110
Well, didn't I join the
football competition?

298
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:06,830
Vee, don't say anything!

299
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:09,166
They almost got the trophy.

300
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:11,615
Did we win?

301
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:15,728
We lost.

302
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:18,277
Everyone is in love, no
one wants to practice.

303
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,190
We already failed.

304
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:20,893
Failed.

305
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:21,560
Yes

306
00:19:21,865 --> 00:19:24,265
Your friends, Vee and
Nuea, they were falling

307
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,689
in love, never saw
them at the football field.

308
00:19:27,227 --> 00:19:28,203
How could we win?

309
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:30,199
You didn't come.

310
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
So.

311
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:34,498
Wan did get angry with us.

312
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:36,752
That's a guy

313
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:39,514
he is like you.

314
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,816
He fell in love with a swimmer.

315
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:46,693
That's so awful.

316
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,293
You too!

317
00:19:51,286 --> 00:19:54,079
So, I need call to Ana first.

318
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,837
Oh no, that's terrible.

319
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:08,729
Hello, Ana.

320
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:12,609
Yes, Ana.

321
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,604
Well, after class today,
I need to guard the faculty flag.

322
00:20:21,784 --> 00:20:23,046
I'll call you later.

323
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:27,015
Don’t worry about the
annoying sounds around me.

324
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:32,250
Bye, I'll call you

325
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:39,803
So messed up.

326
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:45,212
This way is so dark, be careful.

327
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:49,151
Do I be careful because of
the dark or because of you?

328
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,107
Because it's dark.

329
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:53,100
Don't worry about me

330
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:57,400
How sweet, you don't need
to remember us anymore.

331
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,021
Don't be jealous of us.

332
00:21:00,046 --> 00:21:03,237
I can't quit the class when I'm
admitted to the Faculty of Medicine.

333
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:04,966
Bar, it's too much

334
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:11,832
Don't walk like this, a car is coming.

335
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:14,378
Why can you do it?

336
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:16,778
We are couples.

337
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:18,799
What!

338
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,378
Well, we are couples so we
can walk close together.

339
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:27,221
This guy is really mean.

340
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:30,138
That's why he can control Fuse

341
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:32,374
I am Ana's controller.

342
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,369
Super boy.

343
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,370
He was leaving you.

344
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:39,693
Don't remind me of that.

345
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:43,539
I should say thanks to Kamphan.

346
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:45,449
Why would you want to do that?

347
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,800
You said thanks to my friends

348
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,434
Don't worry it's nothing.

349
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:53,420
It's just drinks

350
00:21:53,421 --> 00:21:55,420
Don't start now.

351
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:57,427
Your bills did not pay now.

352
00:21:58,647 --> 00:21:59,647
Did not pay.

353
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:04,157
Yes, we are done fighting.

354
00:22:04,527 --> 00:22:07,237
And, we are really closer.

355
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:10,630
You say you love him again.

356
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,773
I need to talk to Tee to
collect the steels to sell.

357
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,614
To keep the money to
make a marriage proposal.

358
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:18,502
Hurry up

359
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,354
It'll make it hard for you to
make a marriage proposal.

360
00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:23,985
It's really hard.

361
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,661
Paula spoils us so
your price is so expensive.

362
00:22:28,704 --> 00:22:29,704
Is it right?

363
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:33,628
Don't pay anything, I am yours now.

364
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,569
Don't say it like that.

365
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:37,190
P'Ana

366
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:38,278
Humm

367
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:39,612
give me your hand.

368
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:48,899
If you say things like this,
I should make you mine.

369
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:55,037
Let me see.

370
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:57,030
And another one.

371
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:00,195
This

372
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:02,653
you have a new one.

373
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,181
You have to stay mine.

374
00:23:18,055 --> 00:23:19,249
I respect you

375
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,999
I can't fight for it too.

376
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,825
Oho it's too much

377
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,458
it's too much.

378
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:30,041
I love him so much I have to lock him down.

379
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:35,304
I need to leave this place now.

380
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:37,300
Come with me Bar

381
00:24:18,615 --> 00:24:19,695
Do you make up with him?

382
00:24:20,449 --> 00:24:23,357
Oh yes.

383
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:26,539
You told me this week
you will not come clinic.

384
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:28,684
Where are you going?

385
00:24:28,864 --> 00:24:33,022
I have plans to go to Fuse's house.

386
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:38,847
Didn't you tell me that
his parents don't like it.

387
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:41,660
Dad, don't worry about it.

388
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:43,680
Your son is very cool

389
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:48,053
Keep your word and don't
make me see you cry.

390
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:52,861
Dad, I really love him.

391
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,658
Yeah you love him

392
00:24:56,765 --> 00:24:58,616
but you are skipping
your job to be with him.

393
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:00,611
How's about

394
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,655
didn't meet me for greeting.

395
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,969
He was ever come.

396
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:06,706
That's time I can't keep it

397
00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:09,320
Oh.

398
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:12,233
Do you need me to bring him
to you officially?

399
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:13,310
Yes

400
00:25:14,037 --> 00:25:16,684
but you told me you don't like him.

401
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:26,769
I saw you cried so hard and have big
smile for him. I think I can't hate him.

402
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:28,867
Are you serious?

403
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:34,720
Yes, I am. I did not say I hate him

404
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:37,597
I'm just watching you
and I'm not going to stop you.

405
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:41,575
I need you to accept us.

406
00:25:45,054 --> 00:25:46,054
Ana

407
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:47,282
listen to me.

408
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:48,329
Yes.

409
00:25:48,438 --> 00:25:53,074
I always support whatever you are,
you are my son.

410
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,997
I can accept everything about you.

411
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,555
When you have someone
I just taking a look at him

412
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:03,548
what do you think?

413
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:06,787
Dad, you are so worried about me.

414
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,330
My dad is super cute

415
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:11,329
okay.

416
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:17,587
I can't be cuter than your guy.

417
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:21,098
You always compliment him

418
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:23,807
he is cute, he is nice

419
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:25,799
dad

420
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:47,642
Are you tired from work?

421
00:26:48,831 --> 00:26:49,831
Fuse.

422
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:51,741
This is your dad?

423
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:53,649
Yes. but...

424
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:56,429
My mom and dad taking me home.

425
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:58,949
Hello Mom and Dad.

426
00:27:01,281 --> 00:27:02,343
Are you finished?

427
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,688
If you are done, get ready.

428
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:06,941
Mom,

429
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,738
He just finished

430
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:10,239
he did not take a rest.

431
00:27:10,661 --> 00:27:11,765
Fuse.

432
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:14,997
I'm ready to go.

433
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,920
Actually.

434
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:19,817
Does your dad work here?

435
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,511
That's right

436
00:27:22,636 --> 00:27:24,777
This is my dad's clinic.

437
00:27:26,236 --> 00:27:27,981
So, you should tell you dad

438
00:27:28,753 --> 00:27:30,436
you're going with us.

439
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,430
Don't worry about that.

440
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:35,913
My son already told me.

441
00:27:37,349 --> 00:27:38,580
Yes, Dentist

442
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:42,217
so,

443
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:44,772
how do you know that his dad is a dentist?

444
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:45,997
Oh.

445
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,313
Here is a garage shop, right?

446
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:57,366
This dentist treats your dad's teeth.

447
00:27:57,815 --> 00:27:58,815
Do you know each other?

448
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:01,319
We are just

449
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,789
dentist and
patient, It's nothing special

450
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:04,931
and..

451
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:06,433
Actually,

452
00:28:07,057 --> 00:28:10,729
I am the dad of the person who cried
for so many days because of your son.

453
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:12,343
I see.

454
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,544
I got some news.

455
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:18,730
My son got broken up with by your son.

456
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:20,729
Mom, We are fine

457
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:23,186
well, well

458
00:28:23,276 --> 00:28:24,618
so, you made up!

459
00:28:25,092 --> 00:28:26,405
I hope you all

460
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:28,261
support this love.

461
00:28:29,939 --> 00:28:32,415
If I was against it, I wouldn't be here.

462
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,439
Don't say that, dad

463
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,322
What about you?

464
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:39,968
What do you think about my son?

465
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,089
He is so young.

466
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,789
I'm not sure he's serious about my son.

467
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:48,343
And,

468
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,516
he just made my son cry.

469
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:54,525
But my son

470
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:56,831
he really loves your son

471
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:00,617
that's why he can put up with it.

472
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:05,598
If my son

473
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:07,938
don't love your son too much.

474
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:10,767
I wouldn't be here

475
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:12,759
Enough, dad.

476
00:29:13,348 --> 00:29:17,246
If we don't hurry, we
will miss the flights.

477
00:29:17,271 --> 00:29:19,269
Flight?

478
00:29:20,612 --> 00:29:21,953
My hometown is Chiang Mai.

479
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:24,626
Chiang Mai?

480
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:25,713
Ana

481
00:29:26,627 --> 00:29:27,987
Are you going to visit Chiang Mai?

482
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,679
You just told me going to Fuse's house

483
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,360
You did not tell
where Fuse's house is.

484
00:29:34,277 --> 00:29:38,157
Did you tell them about our place?

485
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,374
I needed to surprise him.

486
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:46,683
Fuse, you really are just like kids.

487
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:51,365
OK, Do you want to go?
Now we are almost late

488
00:29:51,786 --> 00:29:52,805
Come with me, Ana.

489
00:29:56,282 --> 00:29:57,282
Dad

490
00:29:57,565 --> 00:30:00,254
Please look after my son as well.

491
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:02,058
Don't worry

492
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:03,920
I will take care of him very well

493
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:06,977
let's go

494
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:09,443
do you have any things?

495
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:12,910
Give me a minute to pack up.

496
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:16,219
We don't have time, you
can use Fuse's things.

497
00:30:16,378 --> 00:30:19,451
I already booked the tickets for everyone.

498
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:21,968
You already have the tickets...

499
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:23,418
that's right.

500
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:27,380
I booked four seats
after you called that day.

501
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:33,325
About our appointment
I will update you later.

502
00:30:34,328 --> 00:30:35,279
Yes, sir

503
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,554
we can afford to come,
You find date and tell me.

504
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:44,048
Ana

505
00:30:44,314 --> 00:30:45,309
when you are there

506
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,538
don't make them worry about you.

507
00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:48,460
Yes.

508
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:50,459
Do you understand.

509
00:30:51,494 --> 00:30:56,159
We are happy to take care of him very well.

510
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,608
Let's go

511
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:07,856
The dentist...

512
00:31:07,857 --> 00:31:09,849
My parent...

513
00:31:10,857 --> 00:31:11,857
don't talk about it.

514
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:14,194
Kids will be kids.

515
00:31:16,387 --> 00:31:17,229
But

516
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,229
I will be looking after Ana very well.

517
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,301
Now, you dare to argue me.

518
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:27,111
Do you think that your parents are ok it,
you will do anything?

519
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:28,854
Dad.

520
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:39,837
So, take care of him just like you told me.

521
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:42,320
Absolutely yes!

522
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,775
Let's go Ana.

523
00:31:53,237 --> 00:31:53,849
Goodbye

524
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:54,935
Goodbye.

525
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:56,464
Have a save flight.

526
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:57,809
Yes

527
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:00,314
go.

528
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:12,867
About your appointment,
I will send it to you

529
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:14,873
thank you so much.

530
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,932
This is not main reason that you
made an appointment to talk with us.

531
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,378
Hello

532
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,455
this is my wife.

533
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,346
Hello everyone

534
00:32:29,618 --> 00:32:33,504
we are not strangers,
I can take it easy for a talk.

535
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:34,957
Of course.

536
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:38,132
I am a very easy person.

537
00:32:39,706 --> 00:32:43,296
We need to talk about

538
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,011
our sons.

539
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,079
I disagree

540
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:56,082
He cannot accept this
relationship, we need time

541
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,187
Actually,

542
00:32:59,689 --> 00:33:00,848
I disagree too.

543
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:04,698
My son has to entrusted
his life to your son

544
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:06,279
you!

545
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:09,013
He is very childish and immature,

546
00:33:10,314 --> 00:33:12,054
making my son cry.

547
00:33:12,547 --> 00:33:13,547
And

548
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:15,916
He looks like his father

549
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:17,749
Is that so?

550
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:21,735
Your son made my son cry too.

551
00:33:22,452 --> 00:33:23,762
I think they're just kids.

552
00:33:23,763 --> 00:33:25,759
But he is to you like a child.

553
00:33:26,168 --> 00:33:28,174
At that moment, he was about to die.

554
00:33:30,454 --> 00:33:33,840
If he hurt too much you
are still against them.

555
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:38,655
Do you know mothers feel?

556
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:42,251
I'm never against my son

557
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:45,483
Sometimes we should do.

558
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:48,589
I need to be against it but..

559
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:51,114
My son got hurt because of this

560
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:52,937
we are trying to get it.

561
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,948
If we are against our sons

562
00:33:55,973 --> 00:33:57,973
our sons get hurt.

563
00:33:58,384 --> 00:33:59,525
If we accept them

564
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:01,814
our sons are happy

565
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,538
Which do we choose?

566
00:34:05,473 --> 00:34:06,811
You know the answer.

567
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:15,029
If we need to be against them we should
tell them that we always care for them.

568
00:34:15,214 --> 00:34:18,838
When they are happy or not

569
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,285
we are always beside them

570
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:22,789
we will be the best supporters.

571
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:26,431
I won't be against them

572
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:31,061
we always spoil them all the time.

573
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:36,531
I support him since he was born

574
00:34:37,463 --> 00:34:38,463
that is.

575
00:34:38,814 --> 00:34:41,565
I won't interrupt his life

576
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:43,193
but his father...

577
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:45,189
he needs time.

578
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,863
It won't take long, right?

579
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:56,546
At first, I was worried about them.

580
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,794
If they don't work we
still take care our sons

581
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,997
because they are our sons, our loves.

582
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:05,971
They were born because of us.

583
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:11,203
My son really love your son

584
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:15,154
that's why I have to support them

585
00:35:17,005 --> 00:35:18,309
On my point.

586
00:35:19,107 --> 00:35:20,426
Your son's happiness is..

587
00:35:20,963 --> 00:35:22,020
My son.

588
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:26,944
Ana's parents tell the truth.

589
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:30,863
I got it

590
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:36,008
when my house is
finished I will take

591
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,098
What's his name?

592
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,878
Ana is meaning the future

593
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:43,522
That's right, when my house done.

594
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:46,482
I will take The FUTURE to visit there

595
00:35:47,076 --> 00:35:48,443
Go to your home?

596
00:35:49,412 --> 00:35:50,895
Or will you let me propose to them

597
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:55,088
my son took your
son to live together.

598
00:35:55,923 --> 00:36:00,778
We'll let you talk to your son

599
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:03,858
you are really worried about them.

600
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,128
Because your son worries about his father.

601
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:11,221
Ana told me that Fuse thinks
his father did not love him

602
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,349
So crazy!

603
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,343
Wait.

604
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,389
After this we're going
to rush to finish the house

605
00:36:17,774 --> 00:36:20,439
and I will call you to visit our house.

606
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:23,600
Are you finish yet?

607
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:25,529
Do you have another appointment?

608
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,988
Let's have dinner together.

609
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:29,762
No problem, I'll hurry back
and rush our house.

610
00:36:30,347 --> 00:36:33,117
See you later

611
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,113
He is very worried for his child.

612
00:36:45,221 --> 00:36:47,354
I am very worried about my son too.

613
00:36:47,808 --> 00:36:50,566
But my son love his son, you know it

614
00:36:51,131 --> 00:36:53,794
his son loves our son also

615
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,831
Let's have dinner together.

616
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:00,750
I'll take this to you

617
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,658
Your house is very big

618
00:37:12,101 --> 00:37:13,621
This house is bigger
than the last one.

619
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,398
I know.

620
00:37:15,682 --> 00:37:17,536
I didn't think it would be this big.

621
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,673
I already told you

622
00:37:20,193 --> 00:37:22,201
it can take 10 people.

623
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:24,313
It's done

624
00:37:24,581 --> 00:37:25,781
let's get inside the new house

625
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:35,451
The pool was Mom's idea, right?

626
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,266
We should save money.

627
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:40,261
Don't complain about your mom.

628
00:37:40,262 --> 00:37:42,262
I have money

629
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,772
It's OK.

630
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,279
Let's go inside.

631
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,243
And, you will rest in same
room or separate rooms.

632
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:49,443
Same room for us.

633
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,770
Are mom and dad not
staying in the same room?

634
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,407
Sometimes, I do

635
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:57,498
your dad built many rooms

636
00:37:57,732 --> 00:37:59,668
I haven't slept in many rooms yet.

637
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,590
Let's go inside

638
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:03,255
Yes.

639
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,532
I already selected the room for you

640
00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:09,129
It has really good air conditioning.

641
00:38:22,293 --> 00:38:23,293
You can ask me.

642
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:25,797
I don't want to ask.

643
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:28,419
If I wonder I will.

644
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:33,053
My dad is the owner of a resort here

645
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:35,543
and a tea farm at Chiang Rai.

646
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:38,199
My mom has nothing to do,

647
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:39,541
the rich women

648
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:44,609
When you talked about your
mom your face is so messy.

649
00:38:46,084 --> 00:38:47,084
Let me think.

650
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:50,427
She thinks my dad loves her so much.

651
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,754
I really know

652
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,194
Why is mom worried about us?

653
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:02,474
Why?

654
00:39:05,502 --> 00:39:06,502
I...

655
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:08,938
they do everything for you

656
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:12,017
maybe, they need you to have a
family to take care their business.

657
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,475
I don't want it

658
00:39:15,996 --> 00:39:17,446
how about your business?

659
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:19,720
I...

660
00:39:21,668 --> 00:39:22,747
I will give it to you.

661
00:39:23,255 --> 00:39:24,471
Are you crazy?

662
00:39:31,483 --> 00:39:32,483
I am sleepy.

663
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:35,019
Do you want to sleep with me.

664
00:39:36,561 --> 00:39:37,739
No way

665
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:40,568
yes...

666
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:44,791
No way, go to bed first.

667
00:40:20,362 --> 00:40:21,362
Do you like it?

668
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,770
Yes.

669
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,192
I didn't think I'd come and see it.

670
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,970
It's like traveling.

671
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:35,234
I am happy to have you here.

672
00:40:36,861 --> 00:40:37,861
Umm...

673
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,332
So, I am here with you
and your parents, I really like that.

674
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:45,640
It's like they already accepted us.

675
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:50,292
I love you.

676
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,929
My parents will love you too.

677
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,560
Fuse

678
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:02,887
Yes.

679
00:41:06,854 --> 00:41:08,307
I am really happy.

680
00:41:09,351 --> 00:41:10,351
Yes, I know.

681
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,702
I am happy too.

682
00:41:19,973 --> 00:41:20,973
Thank you.

683
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,406
Thank you for being together.

684
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,356
Even if it's not necessary at all.

685
00:41:28,624 --> 00:41:30,159
I should thank you.

686
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,831
Thank you for you inviting me to know you.
