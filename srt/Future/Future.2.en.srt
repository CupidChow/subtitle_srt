(Episode 2)

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,380
[Never have to think]

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,420
[Never have to worry]

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,340
[Everything I do is up to me]

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,080
[My heart never has to think about anyone]

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,480
[But when I met you]

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,440
[You make me confused]

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,700
[Why am I feeling nervous]

17
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:14,305
[What happened to me?]

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,100
[Maybe it's intimacy or faith..]

19
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,855
[that makes my heart shakes]

20
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:32,240
[My heart beats faster
especially when our eyes meet]

21
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,700
[I'm falling hard for you]

22
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,520
[Never been like this before]

23
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,880
[Really falling for you]

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,840
[It's all because of you]

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,900
[It's all because of you]

26
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,920
I can't stand this, my
heart is beating too fast.

27
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:23,988
(You're a dentist, not a
Cardiothoracic surgeon!)

28
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,560
I'll always comment "I hate
you" under your posts forever.

29
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,340
You became a hardship
in his life. @Future Forfun.

30
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,900
Grand opening? @Future Forfun.

31
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,560
Tell Ana to open his heart first.

32
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,080
It has been opened for a long time.

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,280
I hate youuu!

34
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,140
What is this? When did they start the first move?

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,160
They must have already
done the final stage. @Yiwaa.

36
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,500
That's not it, Polla.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,300
Ah?

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,380
Bar? Why did he call me?

39
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,320
Hello, what's up?

40
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,060
Hello, Fuse. What are you doing?

41
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,616
You picked up my call so late.

42
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,680
What the hell? Is Doc
refusing to play with you?

43
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,360
Don't bring that up. What are you doing?

44
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,040
You're strange.

45
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,280
Don't ask that if you're not my wife.
I'm getting goosebumps

46
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,800
I'm your brother, bastard!

47
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,960
But if you don't want to be Ana's brother,

48
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,680
You have to come to our regular bar right now.

49
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,500
Ha?

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,420
Are you coming?

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,420
Of course! Wait for me!

52
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,740
Is it not enough?

53
00:03:57,848 --> 00:03:58,948
It's fine.

54
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,940
A handsome man looks good in everything.

55
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,580
Let's go!

56
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,840
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

57
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,240
- Heyy.
- Bottoms up!

58
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,860
Aw?

59
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,260
Hey, Fuse! Wanna sit here?

60
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,260
It's alright. I'll sit here.

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
Fuse, it's good you came.

62
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,740
Tell us how you flirt
with him, would ya?

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,180
- Um.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
Agreed.

65
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,120
Should I make a video and
post it in public to let you share it?

66
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,600
That's great!

67
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,900
- You're so easy to please.
- Good idea! - What's wrong with you?

68
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,720
Can you sit down? You're blocking the view.

69
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:57,667
If you want to look at it that bad,
why don't you get on stage then?

70
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,680
Yeah. Just go.

71
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,260
Oh? Ah! Aren't I also your friend, Ana?

72
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,920
Hoho. Yeah, you're just his friend. Hahaha.

73
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
Er.

74
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,740
Please have a seat, Fuse.

75
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,600
How did you get here?

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,256
Why didn't you tell me that you'll be here?

77
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,120
I didn't intend to.

78
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,720
Polla tricked me into coming.

79
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,420
You should have told me, though.

80
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,620
How many glasses have you drunk?

81
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,820
I just arrived.

82
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,800
Can I sulk?

83
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,940
Huh? What the f*ck?
Why would you sulk at him?

84
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,700
- Right?
- What's your relationship with him?

85
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,100
It's just... I am Ana's.

86
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,340
Woahhhh.

87
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,953
You throw your friends away
as soon as your man comes!

88
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,900
- Fuse. - I can't compete with you.
- So true!

89
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,760
Since when are you mine?

90
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,820
Well, since the first time we met.

91
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,680
Woahhh.

92
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,880
Ha! You've got it all!

93
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,040
Have you asked him if he wants you? Huh?

94
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,860
Why? Trying to look cool?

95
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,020
Don't be mad at your friends!

96
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,840
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,080
I shouldn't tell him that Ana is here.

98
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,780
Hahaha, I totally agree.

99
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,500
Woah, you're good at drinking, Ana.

100
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
Is that so?

101
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,540
You guys are much better.

102
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,700
You're joking. But it's good like this...

103
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,240
because Fuse is loser.

104
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,060
Yeah a loser! What a loser!

105
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,300
He's a loser!

106
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,720
I wanna see you drunk.

107
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,460
I wanna see it too.

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,860
I better not get drunk.

109
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,460
Don't let him. It'll trouble us.

110
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,960
Right? He never survives through it.

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,840
You're exaggerating, Gun.

112
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,040
I've only been to Bar's room once.

113
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,940
And it's been a long time.

114
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,300
Haa!

115
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,220
But you came to my room an infinite number of times.

116
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
You also came just the last 2 weeks.

117
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,360
Can you shut up?

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You talk too much!

119
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,780
- Do you get drunk often?
- Well...

120
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,800
yes, it was before I met you.

121
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,108
Hey, I heard it unintentionally...

122
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,860
Isn't that the pick-up line I used with him?

123
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,800
Ayyy.

124
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:28,215
I'm the one who made a move.

125
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,120
Ha? Really?

126
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,560
- What?
- Hm??

127
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,400
What is it this time? Woahh.

128
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,000
Are you envious since you can't hug him like that?

129
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,540
What? Who's envious?

130
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,820
Not me.

131
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,360
Oh. Your voice is higher than normal.

132
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,580
You guys are like kids.

133
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,060
Look at my friends.

134
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,880
Not a single one is normal.

135
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,280
So, you're normal?

136
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,440
Well, if you don't count the fact that I like you too much...

137
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,740
then I'm normal.

138
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,900
Woah. Hmm.

139
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,640
Will you get drunk today?

140
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,960
Hmm, I want to...

141
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,340
if you give me a ride.

142
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,380
Ha!

143
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,400
Can you keep go slower, Fuse?

144
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
Why did you say that loud?

145
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,520
Because I'm afraid you won't hear me!

146
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,520
- It's not that loud.
- Can you hear me?

147
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,780
So why did you have to scold him?

148
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,320
Look at him!

149
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,780
He always kills the mood.

150
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
That's enough.

151
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,100
Here, do you want some?

152
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,160
I'm already drunk just by staying with you.

153
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,860
I'd like to see you drunk, Fuse.

154
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,580
Hey! You shouldn't ask for trouble.

155
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,760
Exactly!

156
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,380
Is it that hard to deal
with him when he's drunk?

157
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,340
Oh.

158
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,380
He'll turn into a pervert!

159
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Tee!

160
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,160
He even kissed the door in my room!

161
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,640
Really?

162
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,460
Haha.

163
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,020
What's more is...

164
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,020
ever since that he knew he's handsome...

165
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,820
he likes to hug everyone!

166
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,861
I thought he had a free
hug campaign last week.

167
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:17,560
Hahaha.

168
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,260
Stop!!

169
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,260
It's that bad?

170
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,220
Well, I'm not like that anymore.

171
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,800
We should let Ana scold him.

172
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,420
See? You're drunk, Fuse.

173
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,680
The f*ck?? I haven't had even a sip!

174
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,740
- You're holding his hand!
- I can see it!

175
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:41,748
What are you trying to do?

176
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Um.

177
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,720
Fine, I'm drunk!

178
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,320
I'm so drunk.

179
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,980
Too sweet.

180
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Fuse, sit properly.

181
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,340
Take it.

182
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,820
Your glass is empty. Shall I fill it up?

183
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,740
Yes, please.

184
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,100
I'm not blushing.

185
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,020
- Here you are.
- Um.

186
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,380
Thank you.

187
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,480
Then... Cheers?

188
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
Sure.

189
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Hey!

190
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,120
Why did you do it with just the 2 of you?

191
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,580
Let's do it together!

192
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,840
Cheers!

193
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,820
I can't see it.

194
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
Can I have that?

195
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,260
That's my glass!

196
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,100
Another one!

197
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,360
(Next Break)
May I help you?

198
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,160
I can't believe you're really with him.

199
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Um.

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,860
Cheers!

201
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,460
Hey, I'll go to that table

202
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,460
I'll be right back.

203
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,100
Isn't it your ex's table?

204
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,900
Yeah.

205
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,700
Are you alright?

206
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
I'm fine.

207
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,960
You'd better take care of Fuse.

208
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,180
Gotta go.

209
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,580
Hey! Polla stop!

210
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
No!

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Enough

212
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,420
Ana.

213
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,940
Just one more shot.

214
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
No.

215
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,580
Let's go home.

216
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Fuse.

217
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,040
Are you alright?

218
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,100
Ana is kind.

219
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,540
But I'm still afraid of him.

220
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,820
Fuse.

221
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,540
Let me help.

222
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Stop!

223
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,040
Don't tell me what to do.

224
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,940
Is your name Ana?

225
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,060
No.

226
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,440
See! You aren't Ana.

227
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
That's right.

228
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,420
Let him be bro.

229
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,420
He'll struggle, Ana

230
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
Ana.

231
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,200
Are you alright?

232
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,780
If not, I can take him home.

233
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,780
No!

234
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,180
I...

235
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,560
I'll go home with Ana.

236
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,560
You go with me.

237
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Alright?

238
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,340
Please take care of him.

239
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,340
Kamphan!

240
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,660
You should worry about yourself

241
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,740
I'm fine, see?

242
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,840
Win!

243
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,080
Get up.

244
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Win, wake up

245
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
I gotta go.

246
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,980
Alright, good bye.

247
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,500
Please take good care of him.

248
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,060
So, the rest of us, let's finish this.

249
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,060
Win, wake up.

250
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,200
Get up.

251
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Cheers.

252
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,400
Bottom up!

253
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,380
I forgot one thing.

254
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,360
What?

255
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,680
I forgot to tell Ana to be careful.

256
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,280
Ana.

257
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
What?

258
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Hold on a second.

259
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Where's the car?

260
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
I...

261
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,680
I'm so tipsy.

262
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,140
Stand here.

263
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,120
Hold on.

264
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,960
Nooo

265
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,360
Ana.

266
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,780
Let's play together.

267
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,540
I need to find the car key.

268
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,780
Fuse, calm down.

269
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,320
Stand here.

270
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Let me help.

271
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Top?

272
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,060
I can't believe you're dating this man.

273
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
Thank you.

274
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Are you alright?

275
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,300
Umm

276
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
I gotta go.

277
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,780
I'll help bring him to the car.

278
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Hey!

279
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,480
Oh, it's fine, I can go by myself.

280
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,580
Are you afraid he'll get mad at me?

281
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
Let's go.

282
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,000
Ok, let's go.

283
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,000
Go.

284
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Hello dear.

285
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,600
Ok.

286
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,060
See you tonight.

287
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,260
Who is he?

288
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
I used to date him.

289
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,580
I'm just a guy who's dating you too.

290
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,560
There's nothing between me and him.

291
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,420
Ok.

292
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,040
When you drive out from the bar.

293
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Go this way.

294
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,340
And then turn left.

295
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,340
Turn right, and...

296
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,960
There's nothing between me and him.

297
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
Umm.

298
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
I know.

299
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
Can you step back?

300
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Why?

301
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,020
I want to kiss you.

302
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,400
Because you're drunk?

303
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:49,768
With others, yes.

304
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,960
But with you, it's because I like you.

305
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,140
Especially when you
look at me like that.

306
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,460
I want to kiss you even more.

307
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,380
Enough.

308
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,800
You're so drunk.

309
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,380
I don't like him.

310
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
Who? Top?

311
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
Yes.

312
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Do you know him?

313
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,880
No.

314
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,380
But he likes you.

315
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,560
Not anymore.

316
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,820
I won't share you with anyone.

317
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,560
Are you sober now?

318
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,820
What can I do.

319
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,960
To prove that I'm sober?

320
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
Well...

321
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,380
Tell me how to get to your place.

322
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Your room?

323
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,840
Fuse's room.

324
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,180
I don't know.

325
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,920
I'm still drunk.

326
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Fuse.

327
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,700
I'll give you a ride home.

328
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
Let's go to your place.

329
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,520
Can't you remember your way back?

330
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,520
I don't remember.

331
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,980
Ana.

332
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,660
Hmm?

333
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,540
It's already 9 AM.

334
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Really?

335
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,280
If you doing this,

336
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:45,327
Next time, I won't let you go.

337
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Do what?

338
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,900
Everyone wakes up like this.

339
00:21:17,012 --> 00:21:18,012
It's Polla.

340
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
Why is she calling?

341
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,220
Hello?

342
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,740
What's up bitch?

343
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,380
Why are you talking
to me so politely?

344
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,480
Last night, you left me with those guys

345
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,580
I came back they said you left with my boyfriend already.

346
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,360
How could you leave me?

347
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,940
They forced me to drink

348
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,100
I don't know why I woke up at Yiwha's room.

349
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,220
Er... Polla.

350
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,220
What's wrong with her?

351
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,020
Hello?

352
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
Fuse!

353
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,580
How can you answer Ana's phone?

354
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
What did you do to him?

355
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,740
Shouldn't taking Ana be
charged as child abduction?

356
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,720
I didn't do anything.

357
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
I just...

358
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,400
Slept next to him.

359
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,040
Bullshit.

360
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,460
That's a bullshit story.

361
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,280
I saw you made out with him before leaving?

362
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,120
And now you're saying
you just slept next to him?

363
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,640
You should ask Bar to
teach you how to lie first.

364
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Who's calling?

365
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,140
It's Polla.

366
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,380
Oh..I forgot about Polla.

367
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,940
Hello?

368
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,460
I thought you would realize
when you're graduate.

369
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,240
For leaving me with those guys.

370
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,820
And these guys wouldn't let me go.

371
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,680
They took me to drink at their place.

372
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And I don't have a car

373
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,700
I can't find my key.

374
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,640
It's me who took you to see Fuse.

375
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,180
It's me who suggested Fuse to you.

376
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,560
It's all me.

377
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Polla?

378
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
I'm sorry.

379
00:23:16,068 --> 00:23:17,128
Are you alright?

380
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,660
No

381
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,320
I'm so wasted

382
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
I just woke up.

383
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,380
So I called you

384
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,460
I'm afraid you would take
Fuse to do nasty things.

385
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,620
Polla

386
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,380
I didn't do anything.

387
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,380
Really?

388
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Yeah.

389
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,240
Did you guys hug?

390
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,700
Yes.

391
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,960
Did you kiss?

392
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,740
Did you guys kiss?

393
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,540
Has Fuse got soft lips?

394
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,820
Fuse.

395
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,680
Your voice's so sexy.

396
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,140
Tell Polla.

397
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,460
That we kissed.

398
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Enough.

399
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,140
I gotta go.

400
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
You want to stop?

401
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Yeah.

402
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,700
Call Polla back.

403
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
Tell her that...

404
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,580
My lips's very soft.

405
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Fuse.

406
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,000
Only lips?

407
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,896
(Next Break)
If you don't want to be serious with me,

408
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,440
Then we shouldn't be together.

409
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Top.

410
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:00,552
Top.

411
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,220
- Top.
- Huh?

412
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,100
Do you want to eat at my house today?

413
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,920
Woahh.

414
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,640
Your house?

415
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,220
Um!

416
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,240
My parents want to meet you.

417
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,860
Woah.

418
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:35,792
Meet your parents? I'm... scared.

419
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,100
What are you afraid of?
My mom and dad aren't scary.

420
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,120
You know what?

421
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,120
I'll definitely go next time.

422
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,920
Today I...

423
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,820
already promised to
hang out with my friends.

424
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,000
Um. That's fine.

425
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,500
So cute! Who's The Lucky Guy?

426
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,520
I'm yours and you're mine, Top.

427
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Um.

428
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,520
Then, let's meet again when we're back.

429
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,220
- Hm?
- Um!

430
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,960
- Come back quickly.
- Roger that.

431
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,260
That's right.

432
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
I think...

433
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,280
Ana will invite me to his house again.

434
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,030
Then just get it over with!

435
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,500
Hey, it's not that easy!

436
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,600
I haven't even met his parents yet.

437
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
I think...

438
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,340
it's too much.

439
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,900
So why did you ask
him out in the first place?

440
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,720
Wasn't it you who told me no one
had ever been with Ana?

441
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,740
So...

442
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,840
I was just saying that.

443
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,340
Then, you don't even like him?

444
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,940
I do.

445
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,460
But... you know?

446
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,440
I'm not ready... to be
in a serious relationship.

447
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,160
If you don't want it, then
we don't have to be together.

448
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
Ana.

449
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,360
If you don't want it,
we can call it quits, Top.

450
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,705
Ana, let me explain...

451
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:44,740
Why did you ask me
out if you aren't serious?

452
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,390
Please calm down, Ana. Listen to me.

453
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,640
I heard it all, Top.

454
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,560
Do you have anything else to say?

455
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,170
I think you should go back.

456
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,510
Brag about it all you want.

457
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,190
But don't ever come back again.

458
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,670
Ana, I really like you.

459
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,230
It's not enough for you to
take us seriously. though.

460
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,830
- But I do like you...
- But I want a serious relationship!

461
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,010
If you're not ready
for this, stop liking me!

462
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,540
Ana, you're awake?

463
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,540
Hm, yeah.

464
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,600
Where did you go?

465
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,100
I... went out to buy food.

466
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,580
You didn't even take your phone.

467
00:32:06,108 --> 00:32:08,908
Why? Are you worried about me?

468
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:13,782
I woke up to your notifications.

469
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:21,628
It's my friends. I forgot to turn it off.

470
00:32:21,752 --> 00:32:23,812
Anyway... are you hungry?

471
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,980
Hm? Are you?

472
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,160
Well, a little bit.

473
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,240
I wanna eat Congee with pork.

474
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,020
Don't cling to me like this.

475
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,020
Or else you won't get to eat food.

476
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,740
So... what will I get?

477
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,740
Ana!

478
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,480
Haa.

479
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,960
Help me get up.

480
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,660
So clingy. Come on up.

481
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Um.

482
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,180
Let's go.

483
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,920
Do you treat everyone this well?

484
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,260
I'm only like this with you.

485
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,920
- Fuse.
- Huh?

486
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,260
I want our relationship to last long.

487
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:41,280
If that's what you want,
let me be your last.

488
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,420
So... how about you, Fuse?

489
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,880
Ana, haven't you realized yet?

490
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,640
That I...

491
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,480
can't go anywhere else.

492
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:58,255
Because I fell head over heels for you.

493
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,540
My mind and body belongs to you
since the first time our eyes met.

494
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,500
You're exaggerating!

495
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,160
- Why do you like hitting me?
- Because you like to be dramatic!

496
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:17,871
It's exactly what I feel.

497
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,020
Even if it isn't all of my feelings
and may sound exaggerated...

498
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,100
But I want to tell you that...

499
00:34:26,752 --> 00:34:32,252
I'm willing to be yours
with all my heart and soul.

500
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
Sweet talk.

501
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,680
Eat.

502
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,340
- Can I get your attention?
- Hm?

503
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,900
Are you full?

504
00:35:10,324 --> 00:35:11,464
Look at this comment.

505
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,740
I'm just lying here, staring at his face.

506
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,500
You're terrible!

507
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,680
His caption is pure bullshit.

508
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,280
You've already staying over?
Fuse, you're such a pushover!

509
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,180
I just dropped him off.

510
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,520
Even those who can't read Thai
understand that it's bullshit.

511
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:44,840
I'll sell scrap metal for the dowry.
My baby crossed one too many lines!

512
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,000
I'll prepare a lawyer for child rape charges.

513
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,160
A minor?

514
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Yeah.

515
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,060
Didn't you say you're all grown up?

516
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,560
Yes, I'm almost 20.

517
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,660
You're still not 20?

518
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,700
- Well, I'll turn 20 tomorrow.
- Ha?

519
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:09,067
Tomorrow is my birthday.

520
00:36:11,624 --> 00:36:13,784
You told me too late.
There won't be a gift for you.

521
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,160
Being able to be your boyfriend...

522
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,720
is all I want.

523
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,580
And... you already are.

524
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,740
Yes, I'm your boyfriend.

525
00:36:50,972 --> 00:36:51,972
Let's eat.

526
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,200
Uh, I plan to work again tomorrow.

527
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,340
So, you're going alone?

528
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,920
No.

529
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,460
Who's going with you? Polla?

530
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,160
Not her.

531
00:37:15,598 --> 00:37:19,040
Who is going with you then? Hm?

532
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,660
Umm... I'm going with you, Fuse.

533
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,220
- You're so good at teasing me!
- Don't pinch my cheek!

534
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,740
- There's almost no cheek to pinch.
- Don't do it then.

535
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,520
Then...

536
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,380
Can I do this instead?

537
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,740
(Next Break)
Do you want anything else?

538
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,660
- Oh! I'll have 1 Anakho...
- 2 Green tea smoothies, please.

539
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:29,280
I'll have 1 Green tea cake,
1 Chocolate cake and 2 Green tea smoothies.

540
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,780
Do you want anything else?

541
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:40,160
- Oh! I'll have 1 Anakho...
- 2 Green tea smoothies, please.

542
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,280
Why? I'm just going to order what I want.

543
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,980
Enough! Just sit still or I'll deal with you.

544
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,360
You don't need to stop me.

545
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,280
Who on earth orders like that?

546
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Why?

547
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,700
Is it that rare?

548
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,460
Indeed it is.

549
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,700
Hm?

550
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,800
I'm gonna read.

551
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,840
Umm... Ana?

552
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,060
Huh?

553
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,820
We've finally got a chance to eat out together.

554
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,820
Shall we take some photos?

555
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,760
Um, sure.

556
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,000
- I'll take a selfie?
- Uh-huh.

557
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:41,980
Hey, Fuse!

558
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,320
- What's up?
- What the hell?

559
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,820
What are you guys doing here?

560
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,680
- Isn't it common to eat cake in a cake shop?
- Um.

561
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,240
So, you brought him here?

562
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,636
If you celebrate it like this,
how about the cake I'm going to buy for him?

563
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,580
Oh, we're not going to celebrate it right now.

564
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,220
I'm here to read books.

565
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,520
Ah, reading.

566
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,480
Don't tell me...

567
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,800
You came to me because of...

568
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,460
my birthday?

569
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,100
Um!

570
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,131
Then, where's the other one?

571
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,480
Oh, he's booking a bar.

572
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,320
Booking a bar...

573
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,500
- for my birthday?
- Of course!

574
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,940
He even dragged us over to help.

575
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,900
You kept me in the dark.

576
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,778
Hm, you've never been to a
place like this since I've known you.

577
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:31,520
Exactly.

578
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,100
Or... is it because you took him here, Ana?

579
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,624
Oh, I initially want to study.

580
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,820
- I always study around here.
- Hmm.

581
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,640
So you don't intend to eat cake?

582
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,400
Yeah, you aren't enchanted by this naughty boy, right?

583
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,460
Um, don't fall for him too hard.

584
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,120
He's already so proud of himself.

585
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,740
- Naughty?
- Um.

586
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,920
- I'm naughty?
- You're not aware of it?

587
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Ha?

588
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,160
Which part of me is naughty?

589
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,220
Woah, you're chaotic, naughty,
dumb, and narcissistic!

590
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
That's right.

591
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,060
Nonsense! I'm not naughty!

592
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,940
Right?

593
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
You are.

594
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,180
Hey! Whose side are you on?!

595
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
I'm sick of your love.

596
00:41:21,571 --> 00:41:24,371
Well, I'm sorry for
having a boyfriend then.

597
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Err.

598
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,240
So now your friends
are no longer important?

599
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
- Um.
- True.

600
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,800
You've already eat cake with him. I
guess we don't need to buy a cake anymore.

601
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,960
Fine. You buy it for me.

602
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,420
We actually wanna surprise you tonight.

603
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,280
But you surprised us
by eating it here first.

604
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,000
And... are you coming with us?

605
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,680
Er...

606
00:41:56,352 --> 00:41:59,532
Oh, you can go with
them, I'll go back by myself.

607
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,200
But I...

608
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,940
Alright, you stay here.

609
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,020
- Just don't forget our party tonight.
- Um.

610
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,520
Let's put it like that.

611
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,640
Um, you have to come no matter what.

612
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,060
Which cake do you prefer? Green tea or Strawberry?

613
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,080
Whatever.

614
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,820
Just order what you like.

615
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,820
Okay, so...

616
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,320
- Can I have Red Velvet?
- Um.

617
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,240
Then it's settled. We're going to buy it first.

618
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,980
- See you later.
- See ya.

619
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,980
- Good bye, Ana.
- Bye.

620
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,420
Ah, Fuse?

621
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,660
Huh?

622
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,740
You can go with them right now.

623
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,260
Actually,

624
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,300
I wanna go, but...

625
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,560
I want to be with you more.

626
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,640
You aren't going to have a fight with them
because of me, are you?

627
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,260
I think they understand.

628
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,260
Are you sure?

629
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,980
Yes. Continue reading.

630
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,580
Um.

631
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,420
Is our cake done?

632
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,400
I don't know.

633
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,100
Don't get too drunk. Take care.

634
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,520
Do you want me to pick you up?
Or are you going to sleep over?

635
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:04,280
Future series event.

636
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,638

637
00:44:06,662 --> 00:44:10,960
your favorite scene and add the
series' hashtag of that week via Twitter.

638
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,811

rewarded with a novel
signed by Boom and Bigboom.

640
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,740
(Next Episode)
When do we call it "love"?

641
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,860
How could someone be in a
relationship if they don't love each other?

642
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,400
You made the first move...

643
00:44:25,675 --> 00:44:27,255
Or he made a first move?

644
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,980
Have I ever made a move?

645
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,720
I made the first move. I really like him.

646
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,900
A young boy like him...

647
00:44:35,895 --> 00:44:37,155
Can't make you stand any longer than this.

648
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,180
- What's wrong about being younger?
- Fuse.

649
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,180
- How old are you?
- Fuse.
