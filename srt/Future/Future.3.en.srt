00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,780
[Never have to think]

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,820
[Never have to worry]

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,740
[Everything I do is up to me]

9
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:37,505
[My heart never has to think about anyone]

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,880
[But when I met you]

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,840
[You make me confused]

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,100
[Why am I feeling nervous]

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,680
[What happened to me?]

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,500
[Maybe it's intimacy or faith..]

15
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:03,287
[that makes my heart shake]

16
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,640
[My heart beats faster
especially when our eyes meet]

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,100
[I'm falling hard for you]

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,920
[Never been like this before]

19
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,280
[Really falling for you]

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,240
[It's all because of you]

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,300
[It's all because of you]

22
00:01:44,770 --> 00:02:00,450
*Singing Happy Birthday*

23
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,570
- Yeahh.
- I wish you all the best!

24
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,310
- Yeah!
- Hooray!

25
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,210
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

26
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,870
- Cheers to the birthday boy!
- Woo!

27
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:21,670
Bottoms up!

28
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,070
Yay!

29
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,050
Are you good? You got it!

30
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,670
- Ana!
- Hello, Ana.

31
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,270
- Hello.
- Fuse, your boyfriend came to find you!

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,270
Ana!

33
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,190
Why are you so drunk?

34
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,130
They're teaming up against me.

35
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:46,095
Woahh, say, didn't
you drink it all yourself?

36
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:49,221
- Didn't you say he liked it when you're drunk?
- Yeah

37
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,750
Because... I'm lovely.

38
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,270
- Bruh.
- Bleh.

39
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,270
- Am I right?
- Um.

40
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,830
Don't mind him, Ana. Let's eat cake.

41
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,790
By the way, are Vee and Mark not coming?

42
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,150
Hm?

43
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,310
Don't mention those two.

44
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,010
Just focus on me.

45
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,330
That Mark!

46
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,990
- He forgot his friends!
- Yes! - Agreed!

47
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,190
But Ana...

48
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,530
- never forgets me.
- Bruhhh.

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,710
Is that true?

50
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,810
Ha, you're really too much.

51
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,910
Acting as if you've never had a boyfriend.

52
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:37,670
Right?

53
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,850
That's because I never have one!

54
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,890
You have a point.

55
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,870
You sure talk big.
Can you stop bragging for a moment?

56
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,570
Why?

57
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,370
You can do it too if you have a boyfriend.

58
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:53,310
Or can you not show off
because you don't have one?

59
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,260
You, don't, have, a, boyfriend.

60
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,620
He was just saying that no one wants you.

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,680
- Calm down.
- Ana!

62
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,880
What? Now you're hiding?

63
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,980
Let him sit properly, Fuse!

64
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,600
I'm going home with Ana!

65
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,360
Ha?

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,300
Isn't that for when
the party is over?

67
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,740
Why? He came to find you,
so you want to leave right away?

68
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,340
- Uh!
- Hey, you're the birthday boy, you know?

69
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,640
Let's stay for a while.

70
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,480
Really? But I want to leave already.

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,100
Argh! Stop making me jealous!

72
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,180
By the way, Ana's aura
really shines so bright.

73
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,320
Kamphan is already that white.

74
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,180
But you don't match up at all.

75
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,020
That's true.

76
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,540
- You won't admit defeat easily, right?
- I'm defeated.

77
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,440
This man...

78
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,780
is the best!

79
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,940
So dramatic.

80
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,120
Hmm, Ana?

81
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:02,108
Can you take me to the bathroom?

82
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,389
Huh?

83
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,037
Take me to the bathroom.

84
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:06,819
Huh??

85
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,200
Take me to the bathroom, please!

86
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,072
What is it? Is something wrong
with you that you can't find the way?

87
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,660
Shut up! I'm just afraid to get lost.

88
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:17,195
Woahh.

89
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,220
You dare tell me to shut up?

90
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,220
- Uh.
- Are you all high and mighty now, huh?

91
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,480
We should just fight him.

92
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,240
I'm not.

93
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,340
So I need Ana to take me there.

94
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,860
Argh.

95
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,000
Come on. It's just a
bathroom. I can take you there.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,020
Hm!

97
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,600
Hey, Fuse.

98
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,060
You've just been together for only a
few days, why did you become like this?

99
00:05:39,315 --> 00:05:41,515
You also followed Gun since the first day!

100
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,060
Oh, he's right.

101
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,540
You really like to talk back!

102
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,960
How could Ana handle him?

103
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,200
Calm down!

104
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,560
Ah.

105
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,800
Even if he doesn't want it,
my heart is completely his.

106
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,680
Ah.

107
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,300
Fine, let's get going!

108
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,040
Um.

109
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:58,720
Let's go.

110
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,160
I'll go to the bathroom with him.

111
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,280
Please do.

112
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,340
Baby Fuse.

113
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,760
This way!

114
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,160
He's so clingy.

115
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,620
We have to wait for him.

116
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,260
- Is he alright?
- Come on, cheers!

117
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,020
Be careful.

118
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,900
Are you alright?

119
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,080
Ah.

120
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,240
Much better.

121
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,900
I'm not drunk.

122
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,180
You are.

123
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,580
I'm not anymore.

124
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,160
See? You're absolutely drunk!

125
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,960
No, I'm getting better.

126
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,580
I'm Ana's good boy.

127
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,540
So this is "not drunk"?

128
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,540
You didn't text me back.

129
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,740
Do you know how worried I was?

130
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,260
I know.

131
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,460
I know you're worried about me.

132
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,460
Ana.

133
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,400
I didn't go anywhere.

134
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,220
Don't worry.

135
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,980
Let's get back to the table
and go home right away.

136
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,820
Shall we?

137
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,160
Look at you.

138
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,400
You're so drunk that you need some sleep.

139
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,620
- Walk slowly.
- Ana, don't stagger.

140
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,400
Why don't you get out?

141
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,940
I'm going with Ana.

142
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,920
Are you a pushover?
You've already live with him?

143
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,640
I've been with him for a while, Tee.

144
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,340
That's hurt!

145
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,820
I was right. You really enjoy hurting me!

146
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,700
Your friend's got a boyfriend,
so try to stay by yourself, okay?

147
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,220
Fine!

148
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,960
You should go back to your room sometimes.

149
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Don't burden him by staying too long.

150
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,300
Go back safely.

151
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,060
You're not drunk anymore, are you?

152
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,780
Yes, I am.

153
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,420
Ana.

154
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,240
Yes?

155
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,420
Please take care of him for me.

156
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,160
If he troubles you,

157
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,920
kick him right back to me.

158
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,260
Ana won't be too harsh on me, right?

159
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,260
Am I right?

160
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,580
Don't worry.

161
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,580
I can take care of my boyfriend.

162
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,480
Okay, I'm leaving then.

163
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,480
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

164
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,620
Ana.

165
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,620
Can you say happy birthday to me?

166
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,900
Happy birthday.

167
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,020
Hm.

168
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,820
I'm on cloud nine.

169
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,820
I'm so happy that...

170
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,700
- my heart could explode.
- Woah, is that so?

171
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,840
Um.

172
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,820
Can you please stop making
me fall in love with you?

173
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,160
If you're really in love with me,

174
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
can I ask for something?

175
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,840
What is it?

176
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,980
Please don't caress anybody
cheeks like that again.

177
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,560
Ana.

178
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,140
I'm jealous of you and Kamphan.

179
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,680
I didn't know that you'd take it seriously.

180
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,060
Seeing my lover close to
someone as cute as that...

181
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,620
Who could stop overthinking?

182
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,800
We're best friends.

183
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,620
So it's normal for some skinship.

184
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,580
I didn't know it would make you overthink.

185
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,720
Now you know.

186
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,660
You're this jealous...

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,540
does that mean you also love me?

188
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,040
Silly boy.

189
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,480
Take a nap.

190
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:36,760
Hey.

191
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,220
Do you think Mark
has faded from us...

192
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,340
Since he's been
in a relationship?

193
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,700
How?

194
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,700
Normally...

195
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,240
He's a quiet person.

196
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,200
But we used to see him every day.

197
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,580
Woah, bro.

198
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,120
Do you miss your friend?

199
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,380
You miss your boy, don't you?

200
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,100
Ummmm.

201
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm quite lonely.

202
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,780
I feel like...

203
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,340
My friend has been stolen.

204
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,020
Vee is the one who stole him.

205
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,700
That's why I'm
trying to understand.

206
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,380
Bro.

207
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,460
When we grow up,

208
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,240
We will be in relationships.

209
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
We can't be with friends forever.

210
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,020
Soon you'll be in a relationship too.

211
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,180
But...

212
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,980
I can't picture myself
being in a relationship.

213
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,100
Me too.

214
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,700
But...

215
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,520
We can still have friend time
while in a relationship, can't we?

216
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,680
Yes, we can.

217
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:00,492
But Mark doesn't know
how to manage his time.

218
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,600
Unlike me.

219
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,820
What will you do?

220
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,340
If I'm in a relationship,

221
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,540
I'll not leave my friends alone.

222
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,580
Really?

223
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,480
For real.

224
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,620
If I'm in a relationship,

225
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,100
I won't let Kamphan feel lonely.

226
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,500
Or be alone.

227
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,120
Alright.

228
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,800
Enough.

229
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:38,800
Hey.

230
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,340
Hmm?

231
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,000
If you're in a relationship,

232
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,060
I have to be the first one you tell.

233
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,560
Of course.

234
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
I don't feel so great...

235
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,700
that I wasn't the first one
who knew Mark was in a relationship.

236
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,500
I feel you.

237
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:06,523
I felt bad too.

238
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,900
But right now...

239
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,000
No one cares whether I'm in a relationship or not.

240
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,340
Because they think we're in a relationship.

241
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,300
But I don't want to be in a relationship with you.

242
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,880
Me either.

243
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,160
Wait!

244
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,340
Let's be in a relationship
at the same time.

245
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,800
So, neither of us feel left out.

246
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,340
That's right.

247
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,100
Good idea.

248
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,620
Because if one of us is in a relationship,

249
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,260
We would feel lonely.

250
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,960
So..

251
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,960
Let's be in a relationship
in the same time.

252
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,440
Sure.

253
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,420
Let's make a promise.

254
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,060
Why do we have to act like kids?

255
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,720
It's a symbol of promise.

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,080
Bring your little finger up.

257
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,740
Nahhh.

258
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,320
It's a very childish thing.

259
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,120
I'm being serious.

260
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,240
And you should too.

261
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,540
Ok.

262
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,200
Ok, I'm being serious.

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,520
I won't be in a
relationship before you.

264
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Good job bro.

265
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,600
Stop it.

266
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,340
Why?

267
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,700
Don't you have work to do?

268
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,460
See!

269
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,040
You forgot it already.

270
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,465
Aren't you ever bored?

271
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,280
Waiting for Ana every day.

272
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,680
It's exciting though.

273
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,680
I get to see him every day.

274
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,680
But it isn't enough.

275
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,300
That's weird.

276
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,940
You fall for him really hard.

277
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,240
By the way,

278
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,460
When do we call it "love"?

279
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,180
How could someone be in a relationship...

280
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,780
if they don't love each other?

281
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,400
Don't be naive.

282
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,580
Look at your friend.

283
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,580
They haven't loved each other yet.

284
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,820
Haven't been in a relationship.

285
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,620
Haven't had any status.

286
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,380
But they f*cked.

287
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,560
Don't talk about Mark.

288
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,720
But he seems close with Vee, recently.

289
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,820
And you're close with Bar.

290
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,820
Yes.

291
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,827
Alright.

292
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,100
Can you answer me?

293
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,320
I don't know.

294
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,500
But your feelings will tell you.

295
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,980
I don't get it.

296
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,096
Can we be in a relationship
if we don't love each other?

297
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,380
Because I like him.

298
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,800
I want him to be my boyfriend.

299
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,900
I want to be with him.

300
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,700
I want him to only have.

301
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,160
I don't want him with others.

302
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,560
Isn't that called "love"?

303
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,560
I guess this is love.

304
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
You should try to find yourself a lover.

305
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,320
Ok.

306
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,080
You're patronizing me now?

307
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,880
We used to be close.

308
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,040
Damn you.

309
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,340
Stop it.

310
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,244
I'm afraid Ana will get jealous.

311
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,740
Alright.

312
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,980
I won't bother you anymore.

313
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,640
He's mad at you.

314
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,080
I didn't want him to be mad at me.

315
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,640
I didn't mean that, I'm sorry.

316
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,900
I'm not mad at you.

317
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,340
Bro.

318
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,740
My name is not Bro.

319
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,600
Kamphan!

320
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,940
My name is not Kamphan also.

321
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,400
You're my Kamphan.

322
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,920
What?

323
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,620
You're bothering me.

324
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,880
Ana will be mad at you.

325
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,400
Go see your boyfriend.

326
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,220
You have to stop
being mad at me first.

327
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,860
I'm not your boyfriend.

328
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,720
I'm not mad.

329
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,760
Friends can be mad at each other too.

330
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,400
It often happens to you.

331
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,360
If you won't stop, I'll actually be mad.

332
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,300
Are you going to see Ana right now?

333
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,760
I have to go that way too.

334
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,580
Are you leaving?

335
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,520
I'll drop you off.

336
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,400
You all go.

337
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,880
Will you go too?

338
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,160
I don't have a boyfriend.

339
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,920
I'll go home and have
dinner with my parents.

340
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,900
- Where are you going?
- Bye.

341
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,860
He's funny.

342
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,500
He's not funny.

343
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,280
He's crazy.

344
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,560
What's wrong with him?

345
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,440
Yeah.

346
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,020
What's wrong with him?

347
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,140
Um.

348
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,560
Your drink is good, though.

349
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:33,932
Have you finished?

350
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,500
Not yet.

351
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,100
Someone is waiting for you.

352
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,820
Since 3 PM.

353
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,400
Really?

354
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,220
I won't let you go out today.

355
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,840
We're going to have
dinner with your mom.

356
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,080
Alright.

357
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,780
Hello.

358
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:08,860
Dad.

359
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,900
How long have you waited?

360
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,900
Not long.

361
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,840
I've just arrived.

362
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,080
Since 3 PM?

363
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,420
Well, I finished my work early.

364
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,420
And I didn't want to be with them.

365
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,560
Mark is always with Vee.

366
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,380
Kan has already followed Bar.

367
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,220
Kamphan left after finishing his work.

368
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:36,640
Today I got left out.

369
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,200
I only have you.

370
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,180
You didn't you leave your friends, right?

371
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,820
Nonsense. How could I leave my friends?

372
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,260
Today I have to have dinner with my dad.

373
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,700
Oh, then I'll wait at my room.

374
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,400
Why don't you come with us?

375
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Is it alright, dad?

376
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,000
Just call me Doctor.

377
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,860
We'd better go.

378
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,180
Your mom's been waiting.

379
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,200
Will you join us?

380
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,080
Well, er...

381
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,540
I...

382
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,640
Will you come or not?

383
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,860
Er... yes, I will.

384
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,960
I can drive you.

385
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,400
Your dad is so fierce.

386
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,000
I want to have salad, please.

387
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,800
Ok.

388
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,760
Ana.

389
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,260
Won't you say anything?

390
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,260
Er...

391
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,980
His name is Fuse, a second
year engineering student.

392
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,060
Second year?

393
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,200
Hello.

394
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,920
Yes, I'm a sophomore.

395
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,860
Engineering student, right?

396
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,620
How did you know each other?

397
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,400
I thought he's your friend.

398
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,740
Ana's boyfriend.

399
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
Boyfriend?

400
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,280
Yes, er...

401
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,820
We've just gotten together.

402
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,660
So I haven't said anything yet.

403
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,640
How did you guys meet?

404
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:22,335
You made the first move,

405
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,160
Or he made the first move?

406
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,560
Well, mom...

407
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,360
Have I ever made a move?

408
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,060
Er... I made a first move.

409
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:35,071
I really like him.

410
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,320
When did you plan to tell me?

411
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:41,636
Or he'll be like the previous ones.

412
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,100
Huh?

413
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,540
I definitely won't break Ana's heart.

414
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,100
Good.

415
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,100
Will you sleep at home tonight?

416
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,200
And tomorrow is Sunday.

417
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,500
Will you go to temple with me?

418
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,040
Well...

419
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,720
Tomorrow I have to bring my books first.

420
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,300
And then I'll join you.

421
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,000
Fuse, you can visit Ana at our house.

422
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,040
Really?

423
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,480
Yes.

424
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,440
Thank you.

425
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,100
Let's eat.

426
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,980
Hello?

427
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,160
Madam.

428
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,320
What's up, handsome?

429
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,840
Why did it take you so
long to response me?

430
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,020
My ear's burning from waiting too long.

431
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,880
You're exaggerating.

432
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,760
Whose son is this? Why did you call me so early?

433
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,800
Have you gotten up early, these day?

434
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,320
Yes, normally I get up early to wake my lover up.

435
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,820
But today my lover isn't here.

436
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,220
So, I can't sleep.

437
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,740
Hmm? Have you gotten a girlfriend?

438
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,240
Kinda

439
00:24:39,265 --> 00:24:40,143
(*Fuse is still afraid to tell his
mom so he uses "she/her" pronouns)

440
00:24:40,183 --> 00:24:42,420
I'm in a relationship.
And I love her so much.

441
00:24:42,445 --> 00:24:43,487
(*Fuse is still afraid to tell his
mom so he uses "she/her" pronouns)

442
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,780
So, you called me just to brag about it?

443
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,980
Or you have any problems?

444
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,160
Actually...

445
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,160
Yes.

446
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,420
It seems like...

447
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,180
Her dad doesn't like me.

448
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,560
Wait!

449
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,540
Did you meet her parents?

450
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,580
Who are them?

451
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,120
Why you haven't told me about it?

452
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,960
You don't follow me on Facebook, do you?

453
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,420
I'm open about it.

454
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,140
Such a hot boy.

455
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,240
Why would I have to follow
a silly guy like you?

456
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,880
You checked in at
a club every night.

457
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,280
I've un-followed you long time ago.

458
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,080
I don't go to the club anymore.

459
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,611
Are you serious in this relationship?

460
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,580
Because you've met
her parents already.

461
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,680
I guess...

462
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,460
I'm serious.

463
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,980
I met them by accident.

464
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,200
I had waited for her.

465
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,500
And then,

466
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:01,652
I accidentally met her dad.

467
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,200
So, her dad asked me
to join them for dinner.

468
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,880
Her dad is so fierce, mom.

469
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,920
And it seems like her
dad doesn't like me.

470
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,040
I was so nervous while having dinner.

471
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,660
But it was good that I had her beside me.

472
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,700
I felt a little better.

473
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,240
Alright.

474
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,840
And then what?

475
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:34,360
You already felt better because of
your girlfriend, why did you call me?

476
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,800
Well...

477
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,167
She's more mature than me.

478
00:26:43,308 --> 00:26:44,828
And she's been hurt many times.

479
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:47,447
So, her dad worries about it.

480
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,380
But I want to show her.

481
00:26:56,564 --> 00:26:58,344
And I told her yesterday.

482
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm afraid she won't
believe me because I'm younger.

483
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,240
I don't have anyone to talk to.

484
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:11,817
Talking to you is better than talking to my friends.

485
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,620
Do you love her that much?

486
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,620
Whose daughter is this?

487
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,120
Is she pretty?

488
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,760
Is she good?

489
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,560
How can she make my son worry this much?

490
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,580
My boy is good.

491
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,460
How can she make you less confident?

492
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,940
Tell me about it, so I can plan
with your dad on what to do.

493
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,820
I don't know how much I love her.

494
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,200
But I'm happy when I'm with her.

495
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,800
I'm happy when I see her smile.

496
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,800
She has such a beautiful smile.

497
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,200
And such a beautiful eyes.

498
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,420
I want to use them instead of sugar.

499
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,720
Even though I thought I'm handsome.

500
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,100
I still think I'm not good enough for her.

501
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,540
You can think about it.

502
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,540
Ok, If she's that pretty.

503
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,280
Should I prepare her crown?

504
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,740
No need.

505
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,720
Actually... he's a boy.

506
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,620
Fuse.

507
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,600
Mom, my lover is a boy.

508
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,420
Hello, mom?

509
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,500
Mom?

510
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:52,840
Yes?

511
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,380
Do you really like him that much?

512
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,880
You can't stop it, can you?

513
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,480
It's love.

514
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,280
I already told your dad.

515
00:29:02,528 --> 00:29:04,728
To be honest, we're not happy about it.

516
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,760
Mom.

517
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,320
I have no one.

518
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,380
Seems like his dad doesn't like me.

519
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,060
But mom.

520
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,400
I really like him.

521
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,400
Fuse.

522
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,140
You're only 20 years old.

523
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,640
You still have a chance to meet lots of people.

524
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,860
I understand.

525
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,060
That the world is open about this.

526
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,700
Love can't be controlled.

527
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,340
Do you actually trust him?

528
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,980
Today you said you love him so much.

529
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,500
Next month, you might tell me you break up.

530
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,700
You have to be sure.

531
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,880
I love him.

532
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,880
I don't know how long it'll last.

533
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,880
But right now, I love him.

534
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,720
And I'm pretty sure.

535
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,720
That he'll be in my future.

536
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,720
Well...

537
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,920
Does he think like you?

538
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,780
Has he ever told you?

539
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:10,720
Does he ever think of you like you do?

540
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,280
I have to go.

541
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:18,680
Fuse.

542
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,960
Ana.

543
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,540
I miss you so much.

544
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,260
Do you miss me that much?

545
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,540
You said you'll be with your parents, didn't you?

546
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,900
I made an excuse that I'll study with Guy.

547
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,860
Have you eaten anything?

548
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,020
Not yet.

549
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,580
My mom made this.

550
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,980
Your mom made this for me?

551
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,080
She made it for me but I'll give it to you.

552
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,700
Thank you.

553
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,740
I've just told my mom.

554
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,920
What did your mom say?

555
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,500
Well...

556
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,960
She doesn't think that...

557
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,752
We can actually love each other.

558
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,480
It's ok.

559
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,760
Admitting that her son likes boy...

560
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,420
Might be hard for her.

561
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,160
I won't leave you.

562
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,520
Ok.

563
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,580
My parents will like you.

564
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,540
And soon your parents will understand us.

565
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,240
Alright.

566
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,520
I'm still confused.

567
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:07,920
Here.

568
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,780
You see this one, right?

569
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,980
- Yes.
- And this one.

570
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
They are...

571
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,100
Ana.

572
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,480
Huh?

573
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,480
You guys are too close.

574
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,800
I'm jealous.

575
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,120
Oh, you're being over dramatic.

576
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,160
We're friends.

577
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,520
It's me, Guy.

578
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,720
Ana's friend.

579
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,340
Yes.

580
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,380
I know.

581
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,520
But I'm jealous.

582
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,320
Alright.

583
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,260
Let's start again.

584
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,080
You teach me.

585
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,080
Guy.

586
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,260
You sit here.

587
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,120
No.

588
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,340
Fuse is jealous.

589
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,340
I'm starting to be jealous
because you're there.

590
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:54,715
To be honest,

591
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,500
If it's like this, you don't have to teach me.

592
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,060
You're the one who
offered me tutoring.

593
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,320
And then being over dramatic.

594
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,080
Please calm down.

595
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,460
Let's do this.

596
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,640
I'll buy you guys a snack.

597
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,440
What would you like?

598
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,900
Er... I'd like cheese pie.

599
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,340
Damn you.

600
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,340
Sure.

601
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,740
I'll be right back.

602
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,100
Ok.

603
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Let's continue.

604
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,580
What are you confused about?

605
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,580
I'm still don't get it.

606
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,300
Here.

607
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,300
How's it relate to this?

608
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,620
This one...

609
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,680
- And this one.
- Ana.

610
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,560
Top?

611
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,680
Recently, you've been hard to find.

612
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,040
I want to see you but I can't.

613
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,240
Doesn't that engineering
guy take you travelling?

614
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,260
I'm good staying in my room.

615
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,260
Here's cheese pie for Guy.

616
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,940
This one is cream cake.

617
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,120
Ana.

618
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,420
When will you break up with him?

619
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,360
Top!

620
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,540
If you intended to mess with me,
you don't have to greet me first.

621
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,520
I didn't come here to make trouble.

622
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,300
I'm just asking.

623
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,740
By the way,

624
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,540
He should have
reached your limit by now.

625
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,540
Another thing is...

626
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,980
A young boy like him...

627
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,360
Must be getting on
your nerves by now.

628
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,940
What's wrong about being younger?

629
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,640
Fuse.

630
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,140
How old are you?

631
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Fuse, calm down.

632
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,820
I'm older than you.

633
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:45,827
I know Ana first.

634
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,320
And I get to... first.

635
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,440
Hey!

636
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,100
Fuse.

637
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,840
Hey, stop it.

638
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,220
Please go.

639
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,740
It's true that I heard you're rude.

640
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,740
Let's get the f*ck out of here.

641
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,260
Fuse.

642
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:00,880
Come on!

643
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,320
Fuse.

644
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:08,860
Ana.

645
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,420
If you miss me,

646
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,200
You can visit me any time.

647
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,660
Even if you're with him.

648
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,120
What the fuck!

649
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,040
Fuse, please!

650
00:35:22,395 --> 00:35:23,175
Where are you going?

651
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,460
You think you're good, don't you?

652
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,060
Fuse!

653
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,380
Please stop.

654
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,440
Sit down.

655
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,380
Sit down.

656
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,440
Let him sit down.

657
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:43,540
Let's eat cake.

658
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,160
Eat first.

659
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:49,275
It might calm you down.

660
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,740
Are you alright?

661
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,880
No, I'm not!

662
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,140
Hey, be nice.

663
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,380
If I meet him, I'll deal with him.

664
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,620
Don't be impulsive.

665
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,520
His Facebook is "Top Ten".

666
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,460
Okay, I'll go first.

667
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,920
Calm down. It's good he didn't have a fight.

668
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,760
He insulted my bro!

669
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,240
Leave it. We should spare him one time.

670
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,720
I'm so frustrated that I don't wanna talk to Ana.

671
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,780
If you don't want to talk to me, you can leave.

672
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,880
Then I have to excuse myself.

673
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,940
Follow him.

674
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,180
He said he doesn't want to talk to me.

675
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,980
It's because he's upset.

676
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,840
I can tell just by looking at him.

677
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,480
He's upset that you stopped him.

678
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm upset too.

679
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,300
Why did he have to
say that to his friends?

680
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,880
Alright.

681
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Then let it be.

682
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,300
Let him go.

683
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,600
Break up with him.

684
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,160
Guy!

685
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,560
Why? It's okay if you
don't want to follow him.

686
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,660
You are both mad. Don't make up then.

687
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,060
Just let him go.

688
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,620
Where are you going?

689
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,520
Follow him.

690
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,140
You guys are such a...

691
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:45,248
I already told you to talk nicely.

692
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,620
Fuse.

693
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,800
You need to calm down.

694
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,920
I'm gonna cry.

695
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,920
I was just jealous.

696
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,640
Er..he was just worried about you.

697
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,500
No.

698
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,320
He dismissed me.

699
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,260
It was because you said
you don't want to talk to me.

700
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,440
Please talk nicely.

701
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,420
Hey.

702
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,100
I have to go have dinner with my dad.

703
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,040
Please stay.

704
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,500
Talk to each other nicely.

705
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
Kamphan.

706
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,080
Ana.

707
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,940
He really loves you.

708
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,520
Have I ever told you that I'm jealous?

709
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,680
Have I ever told you that I
don't like others touching you?

710
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,620
Have I ever told you that...

711
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,240
I don't like when you're being around this guy?

712
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,740
You dismissed me.

713
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,060
I was angry.

714
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,980
So was I.

715
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,740
What do you want me to do?

716
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,020
I came to make up.

717
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,820
And saw you with someone,
what do you want me to do?

718
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,360
He's my friend.

719
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,200
I know. I know that he's your friend.

720
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,600
But do you know that
you guys are too close?

721
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,460
That even me, your boyfriend,
wouldn't dare to interrupt.

722
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,580
Just like you and that
guy you used to date?

723
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,560
Fuse!

724
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,500
Why?

725
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,940
I can't mention him, right?

726
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,600
If you're gonna start the fight,

727
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,620
Then I will go.

728
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,580
I won't let you go.

729
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:02,660
Why?

730
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,560
When you walked away, I didn't try to stop you.

731
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,320
Then why wouldn't you stop me?

732
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,087
I wouldn't have walked
away if you had stopped me.

733
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,440
If you had told me to sit still,

734
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,320
Looked how he's smiling at you,

735
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
I would have done that.

736
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,240
If you had stopped me,
do you think I would have walked away?

737
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,840
You dismissed me.

738
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,520
You don't want to be with me.

739
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,520
You don't want to see me anymore.

740
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,300
If I make you feel uncomfortable,

741
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,040
Then we should break up.

742
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,000
We should break up.

743
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,460
