(Episode 4)

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,780
[Never have to think]

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,820
[Never have to worry]

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,740
[Everything I do is up to me]

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,480
[My heart never has to think about anyone]

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,880
[But when I met you]

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,840
[You made me confused]

12
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:48,029
[Why am I feeling nervous]

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,680
[What happened to me?]

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,500
[Maybe it's intimacy or faith..]

15
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:03,241
[that make my heart shake]

16
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:11,640
[My heart beats faster especially when our eyes meet]

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,100
[I'm falling hard for you]

18
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,920
[Never been like this before]

19
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,280
[Really falling for you]

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,240
[It's all because of you]

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,300
[It's all because of you]

22
00:01:44,927 --> 00:01:46,217
If you're gonna start a fight,

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,190
Then I'll leave.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,120
I won't let you go.

25
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,480
Why?

26
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,140
When you walked away,
I didn't try to stop you.

27
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,080
Then why wouldn't you stop me?

28
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,750
I wouldn't have walked away
if you had stopped me.

29
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,180
If you had told me to sit still,

30
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,960
I could have sit still,
looking at him smiling at you.

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,990
If you had stopped me,
do you think I would have walked away?

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,580
But you dismissed me.

33
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,170
You don't want to be with me.

34
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,000
You don't want to see me anymore!

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,930
If I make you feel uncomfortable,

36
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,660
Then we should break up.

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,180
I don't want to!

38
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,730
Did you hear that?

39
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,250
I'm not breaking up with you!

40
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:04,322
I hear you.

41
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,780
Why did we have to fight because of others?

42
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,910
It's love.

43
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,420
You love someone, so you're mad.

44
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,780
About that time... I was worried about
you. I don't want you to get into a fight.

45
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:15,368
I know.

46
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,080
But I was mad...

47
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,930
when you said that we should break up.

48
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,860
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,790
Please don't say it again.

50
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,430
I don't want to break up with you.

51
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,900
I was mad and angry...

52
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,810
and also jealous.

53
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,890
I fell head over
heels in love with you.

54
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,430
Don't talk about breaking up ever again.

55
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,390
I'm not f*cking willing.

56
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,050
I was really furious.

57
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,500
I won't bring it up again.

58
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:30,429
Leon Hotel, Lasalle 27 residence

59
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,620
Fuse, what are you doing?

60
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,240
Go take a bath and give me a ride.

61
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,540
What ride?

62
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,120
Do you still have
the strength to study?

63
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,960
I won't let you go.

64
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,640
No can do.

65
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,760
I have a quiz today, did you forget?

66
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,620
I should borrow Gun's money
to buy the Dentistry Faculty.

67
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,740
Then I'll tell the teacher
to stop making quizzes.

68
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,550
No.

69
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,840
I should borrow North's money to buy the whole university.

70
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,940
My brother is rich.

71
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,100
Nonsense.

72
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,880
I just... don't want you to go.

73
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,420
I mean it.

74
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,960
Go take a shower!

75
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,380
Awww.

76
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,680
Why did you cover my head?

77
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,940
- Can you help me take a shower?
- Fine, I'm on my way.

78
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,820
When will you finish studying?

79
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,155
Around 6 p.m.

80
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,460
But I might have to go to
my dad's clinic after that.

81
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,600
Will you be fine? Isn't it too much to do?

82
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,540
Yes, the clinic will be
closed around 9 p.m.

83
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,160
Then... I'll pick you up.

84
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,120
And get you something for dinner.

85
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,240
Will you be free at that time?

86
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:14,900
Huh?

87
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,320
Don't you have to
practice football?

88
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,260
I saw the announcement.

89
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,380
The next match is between the
Engineering and Medicine faculty.

90
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,400
So...

91
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,920
You know I'm the faculty's football player?

92
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,480
Hey, hey.

93
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,140
Are you following me?

94
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,160
I just saw it somewhere.

95
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,700
Really?

96
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,980
I was so happy just now.

97
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,040
What were you happy about?

98
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,500
Go back to study.

99
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,180
And if there's anything
you have to do, do it first.

100
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,820
Actually,

101
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,500
I only have to practice football.

102
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,340
But...

103
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,760
I want to see you more.

104
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,520
You're good at skipping things!

105
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,100
It's just... between studying and you, I love you more.

106
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,260
Something like that.

107
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,360
Go go.

108
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,480
Go to your class.

109
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,780
It's you who should go. I'm here to drop you off.

110
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,100
I'm going then.

111
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,680
Bye.

112
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,880
Study hard.

113
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,500
Ana!

114
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,140
Bye bye!

115
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,400
Just go.

116
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,420
I'm not going.

117
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,720
Hey, you're here early.

118
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,340
Eh, why did you guys come so early?

119
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,320
This is the way to my faculty.

120
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,260
Yeah. And my friend
asked me to print his work.

121
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,780
So I have to give it to him.

122
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
What?

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,520
So if you have a good grade
and someone to tutor you...

124
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,760
you can skip classes?

125
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,560
Look at this. He texted me and
asked me to keep the lecture for him.

126
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,220
And he sent me the photo he
took with Vee on their vacation.

127
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,800
What a show-off bastard.

128
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,120
Hey, you can't blame him.

129
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,580
You also like to show-off!

130
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,200
Ha! Why?

131
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,400
Ana is lovely, so I want to
show him off to the world.

132
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,200
Brag all you want.

133
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,300
Um.

134
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,500
You just started a fight with him yesterday, did you forget that?

135
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,440
Hey, it's normal to be jealous.

136
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,020
But you need to have
a good talk with him.

137
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,380
It's bad to be mad over night.

138
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,220
We've made up, and
we're even more in love.

139
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,640
We were mad for 2 hours
and made up in only a night.

140
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,980
Hmm.

141
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,780
I didn't let it be over night,

142
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,880
go overseas to spend time with him, then
finally try to make up, unlike your friend.

143
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,480
Hm.

144
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,020
Don't mention him.

145
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,920
He no longer calls me to talk about Vee.

146
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,100
So I'm at a loss on how
to spy on their relationship.

147
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,260
Um!

148
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,240
Why do you want to know in the first place?

149
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,490
So I could start a daily news report page like Dew.

150
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,560
Um.

151
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,780
By the way,

152
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,600
You were so mad yesterday. How did you guys make up?

153
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,400
You don't need to know.

154
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,750
It's enough to know that
I'm on good terms with him.

155
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,680
- Hm.
- You guys made up so quickly.

156
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:21,832
When you were with me, you
were extremely upset with him.

157
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:22,860
You have a point.

158
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,030
I just can't stand it!

159
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,290
Believe it or not...

160
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,290
I'm more mad at myself than at him.

161
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,490
And...

162
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,860
It seems like he tried to coax me.

163
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,010
Huh?

164
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:37,000
Uh! You're smiling from ear to ear!

165
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,550
How long did you reflect
on your mistakes?

166
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,450
- I wanna beat him up.
- Um.

167
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,950
I was on my way going to eat ice cream...

168
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,490
and you suddenly called.

169
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,970
After giving you a ride,
you also asked me to stay.

170
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,270
And when his boyfriend came,

171
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,210
he even held my hands!

172
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,700
Huh?

173
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,700
Why did you do that?

174
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,780
I wanted someone to be with me at that time...

175
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,780
because I was afraid that
he would break up with me.

176
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,530
That's fine.

177
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,380
Then I'll take it as you
love your boyfriend so much!

178
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,110
Exactly!

179
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,910
- Don't you guys have to go to class?
- Um.

180
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,910
Can I hear more gossip?

181
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,030
Win.

182
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,370
Let's go.

183
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,350
To study?

184
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,720
To the Engineering faculty, of course!

185
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,400
- Hm.
- You guys are really...

186
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,120
Come on.

187
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,640
See ya.

188
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,430
Kamphan, give this
sheet to Mark for me.

189
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,390
Fine.

190
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,140
Damn. He sure likes to trouble me.

191
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,400
Um.

192
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,550
Didn't you guys make up
already? What's with the long face?

193
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,520
Yeah, kind of.

194
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,000
But I'm worried about mom.

195
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,240
I'm afraid she won't accept it.

196
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,470
Hey, you know what...

197
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,320
Parents are concerned
about our happiness.

198
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,880
Sometimes they are just worried...

199
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,830
that we'll be unhappy.

200
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,850
Just look at Mark. His parents
accepted his decision in the end.

201
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,160
Or... are you uncertain about
your relationship with Ana?

202
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,980
I'm certain!

203
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,560
Er.

204
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,970
If you're sure he's the one,

205
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,750
don't worry about your mom.

206
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,110
She'll accept it in the end.

207
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,500
I can't help worrying, though.

208
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,031
Don't worry.

209
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,700
You should worry about
practicing football instead.

210
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,040
Aren't you in the lineup?

211
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,380
No, I'm not.

212
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,380
But I still have to practice.

213
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,380
Hey.

214
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,250
This is a good chance!

215
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:46,895
Girls will be moved by your football skills.

216
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,880
And Ana will like you even more!

217
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,880
Is that so?

218
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,690
Yes!

219
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,050
Forget about your mom for now.

220
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,450
You need to focus on football first.

221
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,450
Trust me.

222
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,200
I believe you.

223
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,640
What do you get?

224
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,420
Noodles.

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,320
We need to hurry.

226
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,420
Hm.

227
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,980
Hehe.

228
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,230
You!

229
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,040
You're late and still want to eat?!

230
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,430
Be quick!

231
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,720
How could you blame
me? You're also eating!

232
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,340
Er, just eat.

233
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,940
Ouch!

234
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,270
Sh*t!

235
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,270
Hey!

236
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,420
- It splashed on me!
- I'm sorry.

237
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,880
- Do you have napkins?
- Yes, hold on!

238
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,320
What's wrong with you guys?

239
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,800
It was an accident.

240
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,360
Ah!

241
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,220
Ana! Why do you have marks all over your body?!

242
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,920
Hurry up! Take him to the bathroom!

243
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,300
Let's go. I'm sorry.

244
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,720
Hm.

245
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,000
- To the canteen.
- Um.

246
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,920
How was your day? Are you tired?

247
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,040
Nah.

248
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,780
- I wanna drink so bad.
- Chill out.

249
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,880
Are you going to have lunch at
Dentistry and come back afterwards?

250
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:54,595
I'll ask Ana first.

251
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:55,518
Hm.

252
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:59,212
I think you should go, so you can
invite his friends to watch your match.

253
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:01,751
Uh, sounds good.

254
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:07,631
He said he's not feeling well.

255
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:11,065
His body is fine, but
his heart blushes deeply.

256
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,600
@AnaFuture

257
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,920
What's wrong? Do you
want a doctor to treat you?

258
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,820
An engineer has already treated me.

259
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:24,172
Hey, since when did Engineering
students start diagnosing people?

260
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,660
Will I be left unemployed?

261
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,540
The engineer treated him, but also bit him.

262
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,140
I can't think straight.

263
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:40,551
What's wrong?

264
00:15:42,246 --> 00:15:43,626
It seems like Ana took off his shirt.

265
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:46,003
Really?

266
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:48,743
I'm gonna ask him.

267
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,621
Did you take off your shirt?

268
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,600
News travels so fast.

269
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,460
Ana, answer me first.

270
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,080
Guy's noodle soup
splashed on me, so I had to.

271
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,500
Where are you? What are you wearing?

272
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:16,292
Guy's clothes.

273
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,780
I'll be there.

274
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,040
Did he take it off for real?

275
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,160
Yeah.

276
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,400
I'll go back to bring
his shirt. I might be late.

277
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,720
Alright.

278
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,500
My friend.

279
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:47,754
Fuse.

280
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:52,255
Here you are.

281
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,810
Let's go get you changed.

282
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:18,523
Why do you look so fierce?

283
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:20,314
Well, look at you.

284
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:22,562
How did they see the marks?

285
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,940
Well... I took it off in a hurry because it's so hot.

286
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,479
But in the canteen?

287
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,600
How many people saw you?

288
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,440
I didn't take it off on the spot.

289
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,660
Guy tried to wipe it off and...

290
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:41,348
and he happened to see it. It's
because you left too many marks.

291
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,500
I'm not sure what to feel first.

292
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,080
Between being mad at Guy, or
be moved because of your face.

293
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,640
Who could you blame? You
left these marks by yourself.

294
00:17:58,949 --> 00:18:00,309
It's good I did, isn't it?

295
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,720
Let me see if you're all clean.

296
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,560
It's all good. And I've already applied medicine.

297
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,940
I'm still lucky since my old shirt isn't too thin.

298
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,300
Then I...

299
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,400
can't kiss the place
you're wounded too much?

300
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,840
Hmph! Nasty boy!

301
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,300
Who's going to let you kiss?

302
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,540
You.

303
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:35,192
I'm leaving!

304
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,900
Do you think he's done?

305
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,340
I have no idea.

306
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,700
- So long.
- Agreed.

307
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:50,620
Huh?

308
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,060
Woahh.

309
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,620
Your boy went back to
bring the gown for you?

310
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,720
Uh, not my boy. He's my boyfriend.

311
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,800
So dedicated.

312
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,020
You mean Fuse?

313
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,800
You! You said he's
your boyfriend so clearly.

314
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,320
So... do you want anything to drink?

315
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,560
It's alright. My afternoon
class is cancelled.

316
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,760
I'll drink something later.

317
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,700
Hm.

318
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,580
I wanna go to the university's
market this evening.

319
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,660
Sure, I'll go with you.

320
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,860
Hey, do you think it's
time I should find a lover?

321
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,780
You should've found one a
long time ago. Same goes for me.

322
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,480
If I want a boyfriend like
Fuse, where could I find one?

323
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,400
Beside Ana.

324
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,040
There's someone like Fuse on Ana's side?

325
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,020
Fuse is beside Ana,
but no one is beside you.

326
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,720
Stop fantasizing, okay?

327
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,800
You guys are funny

328
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,580
like the seniors at my faculty.

329
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,100
Even though we're funny,

330
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,640
we also want to have true love.

331
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,260
You'll have one soon, Polla.

332
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,520
Hm, this is it!

333
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,220
Someone needs to cheer me up like this!

334
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,220
Soon, right after graduation.

335
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,580
- That hurts.
- Shut up!

336
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,100
Er.

337
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,180
When is your football match?

338
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,600
Will you be a player?

339
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,520
Well, it's in two days.

340
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,920
Don't forget to come and cheer on me.

341
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,000
I need to study hard that day.

342
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,200
Is that so?

343
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,880
But I'll go right after class is dismissed.

344
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,000
Hm.

345
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,220
I admire this dedication.

346
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,900
Dedicated to studying?

347
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,480
Dedicated to a guy.

348
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,480
- So you're not going?
- I'm going.

349
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,940
Fuse, I'll quickly finish
studying and go to cheer on you.

350
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,380
You both are the same.

351
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,880
Hm.

352
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,120
You have to go.

353
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,940
Go where?

354
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,940
To cheer me on playing football.

355
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,440
Of course, I'll go.

356
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,760
You promise?

357
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,420
Fuse! Let's practice.

358
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,080
I'm coming.

359
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,280
Hey, Fuse, you're so late.

360
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,920
You have to wear a leftover shirt.

361
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,320
Is Ana coming?

362
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,540
He said he'll come.

363
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,660
You guys have been together for awhile.

364
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,720
Why are you still calling
him like normal person?

365
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,980
How should I call him then?

366
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,340
Baby?

367
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,420
Well, I don't know.

368
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,900
I thought you might have a special name.

369
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,060
Special like ...?

370
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,880
A-Tee?

371
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,420
A-Tee.

372
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
See?

373
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,040
If Ana gets jealous, I won't help you.

374
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,860
I have Jame and Win as my witnesses

375
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,560
that I didn't have that intention.

376
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
What intention?

377
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,380
You started it first.

378
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,700
Why you won't help me.

379
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,580
I'm gonna stir the pot.

380
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,340
And let Mark date Ana instead.

381
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,800
Mark is going to date Ana?

382
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,640
Before you do that, try
to let him meet us first.

383
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,900
He's always with Vee

384
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,660
I wouldn't dare to bother him.

385
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:33,228
But you dare to bother me?

386
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:34,832
Of course.

387
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,660
But I think Ana is everyone's type.

388
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,560
Even me, I also like him.

389
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,980
True, how can he be that cute?

390
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,720
He's my boyfriend.

391
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,760
Alright.

392
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,200
You guys are bad.

393
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,800
I'm gonna tell Ana.

394
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,920
What?
It's just what I was thinking.

395
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,560
I said that because he's so cute.

396
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,960
And that cute boy is actually my boyfriend.

397
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,820
Alright.

398
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,980
You keep saying it.

399
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,140
You shouldn't brag about Ana like this.

400
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,840
What if Ana heard it?

401
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,380
What's wrong?

402
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,420
You should think more.

403
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,560
It's like you date him
just to brag to your friends.

404
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,860
You're too serious.

405
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,600
He wouldn't think this way.

406
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,460
Alright, I'm being too serious.

407
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,880
But you should think more too.

408
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,440
Stop playing.

409
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,920
And you, go practice.

410
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,100
Go!

411
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,320
He makes me worry.

412
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,020
I'm just kidding.

413
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,100
Ok, I'm sorry.

414
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,820
I shouldn't mind your business.

415
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,260
I'm not mad.

416
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,260
You should find yourself a boyfriend.

417
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,000
You're a master of connecting
unrelated things together.

418
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,560
Is that so?

419
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,100
I wanna play too.

420
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,820
Unfortunately, we're
not engineering students.

421
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,220
Hey, Fuse!

422
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,200
Today you'll play at the front.

423
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,820
Noted.

424
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,540
We have 3 people at the back, right?

425
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,940
Yes.

426
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,600
We'll play a defensive game.

427
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,660
Alright, you guys don't be too harsh.

428
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,280
They're smaller than us.

429
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,840
What faculty?

430
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,020
Med.

431
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,140
Easy.

432
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,920
Why do we get to play with them?

433
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,120
Because Vee drew lots that day.

434
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,400
Good, he didn't even help us play.

435
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,280
He said he'll help to draw lots only.

436
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,780
He did help though.

437
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,140
Don't underestimate them.

438
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,060
You're afraid of doctors now?

439
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,640
Don't worry, they're not dentists.

440
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,580
Not like that.

441
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,720
I just don't want you
to underestimate them.

442
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,960
We're not.

443
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,260
Just playing the game, that's it.

444
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,660
By the way, I saw Ana posted picture of your shirt.

445
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,880
I'm jealous.

446
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,060
I can't tell who's the biggest simp.

447
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,540
Why do you have to focus this thing?

448
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,000
You need to focus on the game.

449
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,980
Because your story is trendy right now.

450
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,500
Ok, whatever, let's review our plan.

451
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,640
Let's do it.

452
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,300
Well...

453
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,060
You, play at the front with Fuse.

454
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,840
- Focus on the right side, ok?
- Ok.

455
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,860
You, play at the back.

456
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,860
Hey! Fuse!

457
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,280
Are you with me?

458
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,720
Are you alright, huh?

459
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,500
I'm focusing.

460
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,240
Look at me.

461
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,660
Fuse, look at me.

462
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,540
Are you with me?

463
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,320
If not, I'll let Jet play instead.

464
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,660
I'm alright.

465
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,560
Ana says I'm good.

466
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,700
Playing football is easy for me.

467
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,640
Alright, if we're all ready then let's go.

468
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,000
Let's do the boom.

469
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,340
1 2 3 Engineers!

470
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,680
Let's go!

471
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,180
Hey, Fuse!

472
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,760
They're all gone.

473
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,980
I'm getting emotional support.

474
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,700
If you don't go, I'll punish you. Now!

475
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,840
Fuse!

476
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,200
Kick it!

477
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,340
Kick now!

478
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,100
That's it!

479
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,400
Fuse.

480
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:08,720
Fuse!

481
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,880
Hey, Fuse!

482
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,080
What's wrong with you?

483
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,340
Look at me.

484
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,880
Talk to me.

485
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,920
What's our deal before
going on the field?

486
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,300
Why didn't you shoot?

487
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,520
I tried.

488
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,660
I did shoot once.

489
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,440
Just once.

490
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:30,572
You said you're gonna do two.

491
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,460
I can't.

492
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,420
Why you can't do it?

493
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,880
I saw that there was no obstacles.

494
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,820
And you were just dribbling.

495
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,240
Well, Ana said I can't do it.

496
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,000
Huh?

497
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,640
How does Ana relate to this?

498
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,000
He doesn't want me to make a scene.

499
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,920
If I shoot, I'll make a scene.

500
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:55,327
So I didn't do it.

501
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,980
Well...

502
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,980
You're saying that...

503
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,340
the reason you didn't shoot is because
you're afraid you'll make a scene.

504
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,260
Umm!

505
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,360
And if you make a scene,
your boyfriend will get jealous.

506
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:11,064
Right?

507
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,940
Yes.

508
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,580
I have no words to say.

509
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,480
Good, I'll punish you.

510
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,940
You guys don't care about my love?

511
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,000
No, I don't.

512
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,400
All I care is you didn't shoot.

513
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,580
Bro.

514
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,420
Kla, my bro.

515
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:45,020
Don't be nice to me, Ana will get jealous.

516
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,620
Then how will you punish me?

517
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,100
Let's do this.

518
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,140
If he loves his boyfriend that much.

519
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,240
Let him run and shout his boyfriend's name.

520
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,900
Good idea.

521
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,720
Let's do it now.

522
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,660
Really?

523
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,680
Or you won't do it?

524
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,660
Alright, I'll do it.

525
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,400
Good bro, start now.

526
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,560
But there will be another match.

527
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,220
Go now!

528
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,320
Run, Fuse!

529
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:31,900
Hurry up!

530
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,640
Keep shouting!

531
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,240
My boyfriend is Ana.

532
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,900
My boyfriend is Ana.

533
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,500
My boyfriend is Ana.

534
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,160
I can't hear you, louder!

535
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,920
My boyfriend is Ana.

536
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,820
Keep shouting.

537
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,940
My boyfriend is Ana.

538
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,300
My boyfriend is Ana.

539
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,820
My boyfriend is Ana.

540
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,340
My boyfriend is Ana.

541
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,540
My boyfriend is Ana.

542
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,080
Wait! Ana is Fuse's boyfriend...

543
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,200
Who's Ana boyfriend?

544
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,220
It's Fuse.

545
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,440
Woah.

546
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,640
Everyone knows.

547
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,080
Enough.

548
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,700
My boyfriend is Ana.

549
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,220
My boyfriend is Ana.

550
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,480
My boyfriend is Ana.

551
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,340
My boyfriend is Ana.

552
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,300
My boyfriend is Ana.

553
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,320
My boyfriend is Ana.

554
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,320
My boyfriend is Ana.

555
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,050
I'll help

556
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,370
Hey!

557
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,210
I know you'll kiss me.

558
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,370
You caught me!

559
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,730
Just pretend you
don't know sometimes.

560
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,510
So comfy.

561
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,830
See! I'm taking care of you.

562
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,790
So what? You want a reward?

563
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,610
Why are you so cute?

564
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,150
I'm cute so, you'll
have to love only me.

565
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,350
Can you do that?

566
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,250
I love only you.

567
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,450
Go take a shower.

568
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,430
Hey, Ana.

569
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,590
Can you help me with this?

570
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,350
You want me to shave for you?

571
00:33:06,357 --> 00:33:08,637
It's easy.

572
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:10,970
Well, well.

573
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,870
Wait.

574
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,310
Why?

575
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,870
You don't want to shave for me?

576
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,330
I'm going to.

577
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,770
But...

578
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,290
Huh?

579
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,690
I have to kiss you first.

580
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,450
Fuse.

581
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:01,750
Fuse.

582
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,010
Wake up.

583
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,950
Give me five minutes.

584
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,550
Really?

585
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,170
Fuse.

586
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,390
Fuse.

587
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,490
Fuse!

588
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,030
Mom!

589
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,590
Is this the person you like?

590
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,230
Hello.

591
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,430
I'm Ana.

592
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,950
Where do you study?

593
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,790
Who are your parents?

594
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,170
Are your parents ok to let
you stay with him like this?

595
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,550
Mom.

596
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,010
I'm studying in Faculty of Dentistry.

597
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,290
My dad is a dentist.

598
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:31,314
We've been together for awhile.

599
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,830
And my parents know about this.

600
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:36,830
Know?

601
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,110
And still let you do this?

602
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,710
You're both still young.

603
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,970
Staying together like this.

604
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,650
Will you graduate?

605
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,250
Mom.

606
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,210
He's a fifth year student.

607
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:53,294
And if you hadn't visited,

608
00:35:53,797 --> 00:35:55,757
I would have taken him to university.

609
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,830
Is that so?

610
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,930
I walked in and saw you guys still cuddled.

611
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,950
Why don't you go to class?

612
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,230
Mom.

613
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,570
I already told you that I'm dating him.

614
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,250
Even though your dad
and I don't accept it,

615
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,830
you would still date him, right?

616
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:30,470
Mom.

617
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,410
I really love him.

618
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,810
It's hard to make me accept you.

619
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,750
You've never been like this.

620
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,450
Do you understand me?

621
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,570
I know.

622
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,250
I have loved him,

623
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,790
since when I told you.

624
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,550
I really love him.

625
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,510
Don't you have class?

626
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,410
Or you won't go?

627
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,830
Ah yes, I will go.

628
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,690
I'll give him a ride.

629
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,790
No need.

630
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,530
You can stay with your mom.

631
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,790
Use my car.

632
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,650
Go get dressed first.

633
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,610
And come back right away.

634
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,470
I'll wait.

635
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,230
Yes, mom.

636
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:21,750
Let's go.

637
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,450
Good bye.

638
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,170
Ana.

639
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,690
I love you.

640
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:11,630
I really love you.

641
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,550
I know.

642
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,630
I really love you too.

643
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,250
And I won't leave you.

644
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,570
Talk to your mom nicely.

645
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,810
Don't be aggressive.

646
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,430
She loves you a lot.

647
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,970
Do you have time for breakfast?

648
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:49,950
Do you have a headache?

649
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,490
I don't want to go to class.

650
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,450
I'm sorry.

651
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,510
I'm sorry that I made
you feel like this.

652
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:17,322
Sorry that I made you feel uncomfortable.

653
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:20,850
And...

654
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,350
I'm sorry that I couldn't
do anything for you.

655
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,390
You did well.

656
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,070
I really love you for that.

657
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,570
I really love you too.

658
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,870
And I won't leave you.

659
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:56,130
Don't worry.

660
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,370
Focus on studying.

661
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,810
Call me when you finish the class.

662
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,970
Are you actually going to pick me up?

663
00:41:11,877 --> 00:41:12,737
Of course.

664
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,090
Ana.

665
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,650
Be patient and trust me.

666
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,030
I really love you.

667
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,130
Do you know that?

668
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,030
I really love you too.

669
00:41:49,234 --> 00:41:50,094
It's ok.

670
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,070
Don't cry.

(Next Episode)
Fuse.

678
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,690
Ana.

679
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,250
There's nothing between me and him.

680
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,070
He's my friend.

681
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,490
He just comforted me.

682
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,010
I know, I understand.

683
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:39,050
Just wait and see how it'll be.

684
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:41,010
Did he hurt you?

685
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,830
Fuse, you makes me happy.

686
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,390
But I might not be your happiness.
