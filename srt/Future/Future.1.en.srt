(Future)
(Episode 1)

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,380
[Never have to think]

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,420
[Never have to worry]

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,340
[Everything I do is up to me]

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,080
[My heart never has to think about anyone]

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,480
[But when I met you]

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,440
[You make me confused]

17
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:08,675
[Why I'm feeling nervous]

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,280
[What happened to me?]

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,100
[Maybe it's intimacy or faith..]

20
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,880
[that make my heart shakes]

21
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:32,240
[My heart beats faster especially when our eyes meet]

22
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,700
[I'm falling hard for you]

23
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,520
[Never been like this before]

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,880
[Really falling for you]

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,840
[It's all because of you]

26
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,900
[It's all because of you]

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,820
Why don't you go home and do your homework?
What keeps you here?

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,520
Are you taking a peek at Fuse again?

29
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:31,127
What? I didn't do that!

30
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,420
Really? Then what is this, huh?

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,640
Err...

32
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,820
He's going to claim that
he opened that page by accident.

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,940
Well, I just... scrolled through it.

34
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,260
Hm? Then why don't you go home?

35
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,540
My dad won't come today,
so I waited for you to give me a ride.

36
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,040
Me?

37
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,500
So you're free?

38
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,660
Should I take you for a stroll
through the Engineering Faculty?

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,980
And you can flirt with him
right at his faculty's door step.

40
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,740
Are you kidding me? Flirt how?
Who says I'm gonna do that?

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,820
You like him.

42
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,960
I don't!

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,700
I see you look at him everyday.

44
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,000
It's just a look.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,260
You like him!

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,180
You like him.

47
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,340
- I don't...
- You do.

48
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,580
- Ah! - Hehe.
- See? You didn't deny it.

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,360
You really like him!

50
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:28,652
Well...

51
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,700
But I'm not gonna flirt with him.

52
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,920
Ha! It's not strange even if you do so.

53
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,920
You have been alone for so long.

54
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,840
- Yeah!
- Um.

55
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,920
He's not going to like me. Besides,
a good guy like that can't be single.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,120
Have you already seen his partner? Huh?

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,900
Nah.

58
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,920
Right? So he's still single.

59
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,420
- Give it a try.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:58,152
You're Ana, you can do it!

61
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,320
Ehh Enough!

62
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Well well well.

63
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,340
If we're really meant to be,
he'll come to me by himself.

64
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,335
- Ah!
- You're so full of yourself.

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,880
That's not it! If you like him,
then you should approach him!

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,060
Get up!

67
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,940
Where are you going?

68
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,020
Go home, of course!
How long do you plan to stay here?

69
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,840
- Oh.
- Why? Did you think he'd help you pursue Fuse?

70
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,100
Aye aye Ahahaha

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,140
I didn't! Anyway, I'm going.

72
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,840
- Hey. - Ana!
- Hey, he's gone.

73
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,240
Fine! I'll carry his bag.

74
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,520
Where are we going?

75
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,040
I'm going to peek at my Fuse!

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
What? I'm not going.

77
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,000
This is not for you. You just happened to be here.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,720
We initially planned to have a look at him.

79
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,820
- Right, Polla?
- Yes. - I'm going.

80
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,800
Hey! Is that Fuse?

81
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,600
Oh my god, yes! Even from a distance,
I can tell he is attractive.

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,780
Are they dating?

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,420
Didn't you say you aren't going to flirt with him?

84
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,280
I'm just curious!

85
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,720
They're only an imagined couple.

86
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,860
Imagined couple...

87
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,360
usually becomes a real couple.

88
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,060
Ah. Who could blame you?

89
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,840
And you also don't want to be with him, do you?

90
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,620
This is what we want.
We didn't do this for you.

91
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,080
Don't overthink it. He won't like you anyway.

92
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,900
- I think he's already with someone.
- I agree.

93
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,360
- You guys are really silly.
- You too!

94
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,000
1 year later.

95
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,424
- Hey! - Huh?
- What's up, Fuse?

96
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,280
What are you doing? Waiting for my brother?

97
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,320
I'm not waiting for you, obviously.

98
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,680
Can you not bug me,
doctor? I'm stressed enough.

99
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,640
What's troubling you? Should you go see a doctor?

100
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,600
It's not that serious.

101
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,840
I just...

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
Just what?

103
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,980
Here's the thing.

104
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,680
Ah?

105
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,480
Doc.

106
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,360
Hm.

107
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,740
Is it true that a person will be
more handsome while dating?

108
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,280
Bar also told me about it.

109
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,740
He said people who're
in love tend to be happy.

110
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,120
And if you're happy, you'll shine with some kind of aura.

111
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,520
So... do you think I'm handsome?

112
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,840
Ummm.

113
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:41,275
Less than me.

114
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,360
- Really?
- I'm joking.

115
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:47,747
Oh, do you know where are Mark and Kamphan?

116
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,920
Mark is buying stuff to filled his room.
He brought Kamphan with him.

117
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,580
Uhuh.

118
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,180
So he left you here?

119
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,320
Um, because I'm getting my teeth cleaned today.

120
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,920
So... do you have a regular clinic?

121
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,880
Um, but it's closed.

122
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,180
So I have nothing to do right now.

123
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,640
Then, do you wanna try the clinic of my bro's father?

124
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,180
Are you coming with me?

125
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,480
Nope.

126
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,300
I'm gonna eat out with Bar,
I just want to tell you where the clinic is.

127
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,720
Damn!

128
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,060
Wait until I found a lover! I'll show him around 24/7.

129
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,060
People like to say this.

130
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,620
But you know what?

131
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,200
Those who say it stay single for over a year.

132
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,640
Doc!!

133
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,661
Screw you!

134
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:43,260
Hey, guys! What's with
this lively atmosphere?

135
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,180
F*ck!

136
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,060
You're acting like you've never show off your boyfriend!

137
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,360
I have, but I want to do more.

138
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,440
Because I have a boyfriend.

139
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,540
- Bragging bastard! - Haa.
- What's wrong with you two?

140
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,120
- Gun keeps bragging about you!, so I...
- Then stop.

141
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,860
Stop it, bro.

142
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,660
- Bar.
- Huh?

143
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,800
Where is Vee?
He was behind us just a moment ago.

144
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,240
He followed us, answered a call and
said "Yes, Mark" and then he's gone.

145
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,060
Hmmm.

146
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,320
Just wait and see! If I have a boyfriend,
I'll stick with him all the time!

147
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,620
Haha, then don't have one, my bro.

148
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,560
Just this much is annoying enough.

149
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,600
Kla!

150
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,620
Hey, don't act cute at him.
He can't find a boyfriend for you.

151
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,280
Hehe.

152
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
What are we going to eat?

153
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,620
Um, up to you.

154
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:58,532
What if I don't have anything in mind?

155
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,500
Hello? Yeah, I just got out of class.

156
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,600
Ah, that's good, okay.

157
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:09,512
- Kla! - Huh?
- Where are you going?

158
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,140
Why? You think I could just
conjure a partner out of nowhere?

159
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,420
Ha, I'm just going to play games!
It's a waste of time being with you.

160
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,660
Hm, what was the name of the restaurant
we went to that day?

161
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,740
Ah, where is Yihwa?

162
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,940
Why?

163
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,100
- I want to form a squad!
- What kind of squad?

164
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,520
- An Anti-Love squad!
- Woah, can you stop being silly?

165
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,680
What would you like to eat, Bar?

166
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,920
Let's go to the restaurant we visited that day.

167
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:47,551
Arghhh, when will I finally
have a lover like this?!

168
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,000
You're silly.

169
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,020
Here, I sent you the clinic's location.

170
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,440
Open your mouth and get your teeth cleaned
so that you won't have time to talk nonsense.

171
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,860
Let's get going.

172
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,240
See you, bro.

173
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,340
This is yours.

174
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:17,951
I can get it cleaned any time, can't I?

175
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,820
(Next Break)
I think I'm quite handsome.

176
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,040
Do you think I'll be able to win someone
over with this face?

177
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,880
Then... Why don't you try it with me?

178
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,740
- Hello.
- Hello.

179
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm here for teeth cleaning.

180
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,820
Oh. Have you ever been here or have medical records here?

181
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,300
Not yet.

182
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,880
Oh, then...

183
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:37,000
Here, please fill out your personal info.
When you finish, you can go wait upstairs.

184
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:47,628
Er, if you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

185
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,320
- Mr. Doctor, no, Mr. Nurse.
- Yes?

186
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,420
- Yes, you.
- Huh?

187
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,920
Do you think I'm handsome?

188
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,760
Oh.

189
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,440
Yes, you're quite good looking.

190
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,500
Why?

191
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:05,012
Then why am I still single?

192
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,760
Huh?

193
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,400
Why am I still single if I'm really handsome.

194
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,200
Do you know Gun?

195
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,220
Oh yes, He's Bar's boyfriend.

196
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,080
And do you know Vee from the Engineering faculty?

197
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,220
He is my friend's boyfriend!

198
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,380
Oh, sorry. I don't know that many people in Engineering.

199
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,860
But I do know Gun.

200
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,100
Then, you should start with me.

201
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,820
I'm Fuse, a sophomore of Mechanical Engineering.

202
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,120
Ah, yes.

203
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,020
I think I'm quite handsome.

204
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,880
Do you think I'll be able to win someone's heart with this face?

205
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,700
Then... Why don't you try it with me?

206
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,500
I'm Ana, Anakhot, Dentistry's fifth year student.

207
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,740
You're...

208
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Ana?

209
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,100
Is my name too hard to say?

210
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,520
Eh, aren't you embarrassed?

211
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,880
Are you?

212
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,280
Then if I successfully hit on you,
you have to be my bottom.

213
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,280
Soo... Deal?

214
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,960
Yes, and I'll hit on you until you fall for me.

215
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,160
Then, are you going to invite me to a meal?

216
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,600
If not, I'll go eat with my dad.

217
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:31,136
Hey! I'm going!

218
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,520
Will you be willing to eat out with me?

219
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,560
Sure, my shift is about to end.

220
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,315
Fah, please take care of the clinic for me.

221
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,780
I'm going to eat with a guy who is trying to hit on me.

222
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,900
Wait a second.

223
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,900
Your food is ready.

224
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,340
Ah, thank you.

225
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,660
Woah, it looks so good.

226
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,020
Fuse?

227
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,060
Huh? Yes?

228
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,520
Why are you staring at me like that?

229
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,540
I'm wondering about...

230
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,380
Why did you let me approach you so easily?

231
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,020
And I'm also curious...

232
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Is it true that no one has pursued
a good-looking man like you?

233
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,100
Huh?

234
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,120
And I wonder that if
you have a lot of suitors...

235
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,420
what should I do to win you over?

236
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,260
Just flirt with me and you'll win.

237
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,260
Why is everyone letting
you fall into my hands?

238
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,260
And why are they
letting you fall into mine?

239
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,540
Ana.

240
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,980
If I flirt with you,

241
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,180
you can't play around anymore.

242
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:20,485
Isn't it the opposite?

243
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,040
You're trying to win my heart, so why
should I be the one to constrain myself?

244
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,740
You are the one that can't play around.

245
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,800
And the one that should be serious.

246
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,440
Of course, I'm serious.

247
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,120
I'm just worry that
you'll play me for a fool.

248
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,820
Doctors are good at fooling people.

249
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:38,812
Like fooling a patient
that teeth cleaning won't hurt.

250
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,240
But it's always hurt.

251
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,080
Hm... but.

252
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,520
Dentists are good at taking care of people.

253
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,640
I'm the one who's
going to take care of you.

254
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,480
Can you really do it?

255
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,120
Why? Is it challenging to take care of you?

256
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,680
I think so.

257
00:16:54,184 --> 00:16:56,384
I like challenges.

258
00:16:58,203 --> 00:16:59,623
Ah...

259
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,640
I accidentally let you
approach me too easily.

260
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,060
See? You are really
good at enticing people!

261
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
So... you don't like it?

262
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,900
I'm scared.

263
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,040
Scared of me?

264
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,500
I'm scared that I'll like you even more.

265
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,440
Just eat.

266
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,260
Ana, what have you been doing?

267
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,080
Ana, you traitor!

268
00:17:49,112 --> 00:17:51,752
How did you know him, Ana?

269
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:56,547
Read my messages and answer me!

270
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,400
Check out Dew's page.

271
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:08,267
A new couple after a semester break?

272
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,780
May I ask the Engineering
students something?

273
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,060
Is every treasure there love
flirting with Med students? Hm?

274
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:16,367
When I first saw the photos my followers
sent me, I firmly turned the idea down.

275
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,920
Because Fuse is my future.

276
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,440
But after I saw his post,

277
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,860
I realized it could only be a daydream.

278
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,460
Our university have more
than 2 faculties, you know?

279
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,240
Medical students can't always
be with Engineering students!

280
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,040
The news travels so fast.

281
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:35,944
We can do as we please, though.

282
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,000
Unlike Tossara.

283
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,960
This time, it's a handsome engineering
student flirting with a med student.

284
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,563
Stop fooling people.

285
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:54,580
Are there any available
med students left for you?

286
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,660
He should keep being the faculty's
treasure! Why did he find himself a partner?

287
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,575
You should be my bright future.

288
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,860
You shouldn't flirt with
a med student like this.

289
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,300
Future (Anakhot in Thai)
is bright, but it's mine.

290
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,640
You mean this future
(Anakhot)? @Ana Future.

291
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,947
Hey, hey! Is it real?

292
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,720
I said go get your teeth cleaned,
not go get a med student!

293
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,180
But he said I can try to get him.

294
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,420
Are you finish reading, Ana? Answer me now!

295
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,060
It's like what he said.

296
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,840
Leave our group, now!

297
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,500
Traitor!

298
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,560
Hey!

299
00:20:25,656 --> 00:20:27,276
You're so nuts about him.

300
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,140
What? Who?

301
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,820
What are you doing here?

302
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,740
If you pass by my faculty,

303
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,760
- send Mark's work for me.
- Um.

304
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,260
Ah, where is Mark?

305
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,560
You guess.

306
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,600
- Is he with Vee?
- Um!

307
00:20:48,103 --> 00:20:50,183
Then I might be...

308
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,620
nuts about Ana like Mark's with Vee.

309
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,740
Wait.

310
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:58,545
Mark isn't nuts about Vee since the start.

311
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,560
Unlike you and Ana.

312
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:02,812
Don't interrupt him.

313
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,180
He's new to Love.

314
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,020
Wait until his heart is broken,
he'll understand what you mean by then.

315
00:21:08,573 --> 00:21:11,773
Hey! Why are you discouraging
me right at the start?

316
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,050
Listen. He's that cute,
so how could you be able to win his heart?

317
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:20,410
But... he said that I can try.

318
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,330
And I think.... I'm quite
handsome, aren't I?

319
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,330
Ha?

320
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,330
And I'm also quite a good guy, right?

321
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,655
Oh, Fuse, you're beyond help.

322
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,108
So you had your teeth cleaned
then asked if you can hit on him?

323
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,010
Here's the thing...

324
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,030
I asked him what he thought
if I were to hit on someone.

325
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,030
Then he said I could try it with him.

326
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,170
Ha? Then, what do you feel?

327
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:56,862
- You mean my first impression of him?
- Yeah!

328
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:05,170
I feel as if... I fell into a pit
that is 3,542 meters deep.

329
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,330
And I have no way to climb out!

330
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:16,245
- Fool! - Hey!
- I told you to stop being like this!

331
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,370
It doesn't work for you.

332
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,410
I was going to eat lunch here, but now I
want to go back to my faculty's canteen.

333
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,990
- I'll go with you.
- I want to eat fried meatballs.

334
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,970
Hey! You guys, wait!

335
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:31,270
Where are you going?
Don't go! Stay with me.

336
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,330
Just continue to hit on him. Let me go!

337
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,410
What the f*ck? Are you really my friends?

338
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,530
He even left his water.

339
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,230
(Next Break)
I think... you shouldn't fool Ana.

340
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,330
He's pitiful.

341
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,350
I like him a lot.

342
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,830
But he never said he likes me.

343
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,910
Then make him like you right away!

344
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,650
I want to be somebody's green tea boba with extra whip.

345
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,330
Why with extra whip?

346
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,150
Because it's extra.

347
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,190
Should I put a lot of whip?

348
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,190
Can I always add whip?

349
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,270
Well well.

350
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:49,070
Well, well, someone's
got you smiling.

351
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:51,049
I can see the aura of love.

352
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,130
Why are you here?

353
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,910
Having lunch.

354
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:59,122
Or you want me to have Tossakan here?

355
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,030
Stop saying this joke.

356
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,590
I'm bored.

357
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,850
Such a lame joke.

358
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,150
What joke could I say?

359
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,830
Could I say the "Green
tea with extra whip" joke?

360
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,310
Stop teasing him.

361
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,010
If you're serious with Ana, it'll be nice.

362
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:23,655
But if you aren't, then
you shouldn't play him.

363
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:25,826
I feel sorry for him.

364
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,170
Why?

365
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,350
He's unlucky in love.

366
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,570
Even though he's cute.

367
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,290
Smart, cheerful.

368
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,110
And has a cute smile.

369
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,290
He got dumped.

370
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,370
He's never dumped anyone first.

371
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,790
Wait, how did you know?

372
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,790
You said you aren't interested
in other people' stories.

373
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,690
His dad and mine are friends.

374
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,070
When Ana's dad visit, he usually talks about his son.

375
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,070
That's why I know.

376
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:06,090
So, his dad knows that
he's not into girls, right?

377
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,070
Yes.

378
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,630
He's never dated a girl.

379
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,522
Easy for you, Fuse.

380
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,310
No family issues.

381
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,390
I think it's not that easy.

382
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,450
His parents must want a good
person to take care their son.

383
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,790
They don't want their son to get dumped again.

384
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:29,630
Unless you're serious with him.

385
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,190
But you have to prove yourself.

386
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,190
Calm down

387
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,618
I've just gotten to know him.

388
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:41,275
OK, I admit that I really like him.

389
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,690
But he hasn't said that he likes me.

390
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,930
You have to make him.

391
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:53,230
Bar, even though he's more
good at seduction than you.

392
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,610
He's not easy like you.

393
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,630
I'm not easy.

394
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:07,757
Oh, you aren't? You've just talked to Tossakan
for 2 months and ended up being together

395
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,910
well, he's had a crush on me for 6 years.

396
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,270
Don't brag about your love's life.

397
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,710
I'm just starting mine.

398
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,450
I'm not, I'm just saying.

399
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,150
Where are you going?

400
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,010
Finding dessert to eat.

401
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:31,637
It's already here.

402
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,070
This canteen has no special dessert.

403
00:26:37,818 --> 00:26:40,198
Go have your green tea extra whip.

404
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:09,810
Ana!

405
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,970
How did you get here?

406
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,190
I saw you checked in this place.

407
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,530
So I rode my motorbike here.

408
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,150
You've come here for me?

409
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,150
No, I've come here for boba tea.

410
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,630
Aww, I thought you've come here for me.

411
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,910
Umm, do you have any recommendations?

412
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,830
How about... Ana crispy fried.

413
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,910
So, I'll have Ana crispy fried.

414
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,910
With extra whip.

415
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,550
- Hey.
- Wait!

416
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,330
They don't have it.

417
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,450
Just go for green tea.

418
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,210
Well, the special dish you talked about...

419
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:56,633
Where can I get it?

420
00:27:58,337 --> 00:27:59,997
Just go and order your green tea.

421
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,790
Go.

422
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,730
I'll have one green tea.

423
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,410
And strawberry soda, please.

424
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:17,950
Alright.

425
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,730
Enough.

426
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,170
How can I study if you keep staring at me?

427
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,690
You said you didn't
come here for me, did you?

428
00:28:58,435 --> 00:28:59,815
You just came here
to have green tea.

429
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,814
Don't condemn me for that.

430
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:04,414
You know I've come here for you.

431
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:07,639
Will you only let me have
this and then let me go?

432
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:09,639
Are you free?

433
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,530
Yes, actually I have a lot of free time.

434
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,670
The more I come to see
you, the more time I have.

435
00:29:17,271 --> 00:29:18,871
I have a lot of free time.

436
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,790
And my heart is also free.

437
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,390
Is there enough space?

438
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:27,624
How many people can fit in your heart?

439
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:33,450
I have enough space to fit in a crispy-fried Ana.

440
00:29:34,318 --> 00:29:37,638
Um, you're such a sweet talker.

441
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,350
I'm not but you are.

442
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,670
Well, you're free until what time?

443
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,530
After I finish studying, I have to write 3-4 cases.

444
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,310
If you're not finished today,
you can come tomorrow. I'll come too.

445
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,630
Please always be like this.

446
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,330
I want to take a picture with green tea.

447
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:57,990
Can you take a picture of me?

448
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,990
OK.

449
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,190
You just want to take
picture with just the green tea?

450
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,810
Actually, I want to take a
picture with my boyfriend.

451
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,217
Sadly, we're not together yet.

452
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,130
Well, for now you have to take
a picture with green tea only.

453
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:20,230
You have to let me give you a ride home.

454
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,810
How come?

455
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,810
Please.

456
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:28,430
Fine, but you have to take
me to the pharmacy first.

457
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,010
Isn't your motorbike here?

458
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,410
Yes, leave it here

459
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,410
I'll let Mark take me to get it later.

460
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,810
Such an effort!

461
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,650
Please

462
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,130
I'll just leave it here and get it later.

463
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,990
Alright

464
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,390
I'll continue studying.

465
00:30:49,685 --> 00:30:52,585
You'll keep staring at me, won't you?

466
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:55,310
You keep studying, don't look at me.

467
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,430
Don't distract me then.

468
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:12,510
Why do you have to follow
me? I'm buying some drugs

469
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,750
I need to buy muscle massage oil.

470
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,850
It's 304 baht

471
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,290
300 baht?

472
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,070
Yes.

473
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,690
Can I just have paracetamol only?

474
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:31,030
But it'll take longer for your grandchild to recover.

475
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,030
I don't have enough money.

476
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,210
Just paracetamol would be fine.

477
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,030
Drugs are more expensive than
a daily wage, what a country!

478
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,850
Here you are.

479
00:31:46,202 --> 00:31:48,262
Don't forget to take him to the hospital

480
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,770
I don't have time for that.

481
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,030
He would be fine by taking this medicine

482
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,110
I'll pay for that.

483
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,110
You'll pay for her?

484
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,710
Yes, I will.

485
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,310
Can I have the medicine she needs and first aid kit, please?

486
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,190
Yes.

487
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,010
You don't have to

488
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,030
I'll just take what I can pay.

489
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,030
Save your money dear,
everything is expensive these day.

490
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,770
It's OK

491
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,770
I have enough money.

492
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,050
Here you are.

493
00:32:19,424 --> 00:32:20,284
Here you are.

494
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:22,488
Don't forget to read the prescription.

495
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:24,098
Thank you so much, dear

496
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,170
I can't find the words to thank you.

497
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,530
It's fine.

498
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,050
You have a good looking face and a kind heart.

499
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:33,209
You have such a good boyfriend.

500
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:36,413
Er... thank you.

501
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,336
I have to go, thank you so much.

502
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,430
Good bye.

503
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,270
What can I get for you?

504
00:32:53,953 --> 00:33:00,933
I'll have Esomeprazole, masks, and...

505
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,670
Muscle massage oil, please.

506
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,290
Alright.

507
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,870
(Next Break)
You're just in the talking stage with him.

508
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,870
You can't be more than that.

509
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:22,862
Fuse!

510
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,590
Let's go.

511
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,390
Here.

512
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,390
Thank you.

513
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:59,042
You really want me to drop
you off at the Engineering faculty?

514
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,210
Yes, how could you find your friends
if you drop me off at my dorm?

515
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,030
Don't forget that your motorbike is at the cafe.

516
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,650
I almost got a chance to take you home.

517
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:12,130
You've already taken me here.

518
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,570
This is more like you taking me home.

519
00:34:15,491 --> 00:34:17,611
Well, are you free tomorrow?

520
00:34:18,316 --> 00:34:20,216
You can pick me up so, I won't take my car.

521
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:21,490
OK.

522
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:22,930
Such a good boy.

523
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,350
You're so cool today.

524
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:29,950
When?

525
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,710
At the pharmacy store

526
00:34:33,498 --> 00:34:37,058
I've never paid for a stranger.

527
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,990
You know there are a lot of swindlers these day.

528
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,550
I didn't think in that way.

529
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,510
She even came to the pharmacy store.

530
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:50,161
If she was a swindler, why
would she have to be here?

531
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,110
Also, I'm OK if she fooled me.

532
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,050
Because I gave her medicine to recover

533
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,810
I didn't give her my money.

534
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,030
That's why I think you're so cool.

535
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,250
No one has ever said this to me before.

536
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,985
I don't want this day to end.

537
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,010
It already has.

538
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,530
I'll pick you up tomorrow then.

539
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,850
And take you home also.

540
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,450
Alright, I'll send my location to you.

541
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,350
OK.

542
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,350
Good bye.

543
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:30,375
Oh, here's your car key.

544
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,790
Wait, where's my muscle massage oil?

545
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,810
Oh, I forgot.

546
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:38,090
Here you are.

547
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,110
Thank you.

548
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,490
Don't forget to use it.

549
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,010
Alright.

550
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,650
Bye bye.

551
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,650
Get home safely.

552
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,790
Ana!

553
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,030
You! Stop there!

554
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,030
You have to tell me now.

555
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,690
What did you do to him?

556
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,230
That's Fuse, from Engineering faculty

557
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:21,690
I took you to see him, he's the
father of my children. You betrayed me.

558
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,190
I didn't do anything, I just tease him.

559
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,890
Tease?

560
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,310
How?

561
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,050
Do you have time to do that?

562
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,150
Huh?

563
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,770
Well, he got his tooth
cleaned at my father's clinic.

564
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,110
And I was at the clinic.

565
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:42,310
He asked me could he flirt with someone.

566
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,730
So I....

567
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,390
Volunteered yourself?

568
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,570
Not like that.

569
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,590
Can I say "bullshit"?

570
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,447
Would the patients hear me?

571
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,970
You already said it.

572
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,290
So you two had a talk.

573
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,650
And then f*cked?

574
00:36:59,857 --> 00:37:02,797
What? Can you say a better word?

575
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,210
Alright, but did you two just.....?

576
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,010
Huh?

577
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,610
Well, we're still talking.

578
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,590
You're so....

579
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,250
Awesome.

580
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,250
How's he like when he's with you?

581
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,330
Is he cute?

582
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,730
Calm or fierce?

583
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,390
Is he talkative?

584
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,390
I wanna know.

585
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,830
My shoulder's hurting.

586
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,970
Did you blush when you were with him?

587
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:38,150
Is his six pack good?

588
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,970
Ana can't answer that question.

589
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:46,990
I'm Fuse.

590
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,310
Hello.

591
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,750
Wow.

592
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,750
You're more gorgeous
in real life than in photo.

593
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,750
How did you come here?

594
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,750
I rode my motorbike

595
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,190
I parked it at the front gate,
they don't allow it in here

596
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,490
I mean how did you know
when I'll finish my class?

597
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,490
I have time, so I come here.

598
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,890
I'm so lucky I came.

599
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,690
They're so close

600
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,350
I've just finished.

601
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,350
Haven't eaten anything.

602
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,490
He's seducing him.

603
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,730
I can hear that.

604
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:18,283
Will you eat out with me?

605
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,530
Would you guys want to join?

606
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,870
You're just asking for manner's sake
or you really want us to go?

607
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:31,270
Well, to be honest, I want to go with Ana only.

608
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:37,850
But if Ana wants to have you joined,
I'm fine with that too.

609
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,250
I want to get to know Ana's friends as well.

610
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,510
He wants to know me~

611
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,690
He said "if".

612
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:47,606
If your friend wants to have you join

613
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,450
And look at your friend.

614
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,250
It's up to you.

615
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:55,490
But you have cases tomorrow, don't you?

616
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,550
From level of your intelligence,

617
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,250
What does Ana mean?

618
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,250
Can I be dumped today?

619
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:06,590
I can't think of anything when I meet Fuse.

620
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,150
Please be smart.

621
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,250
Alright. I'll go prepare my case.

622
00:39:11,437 --> 00:39:13,437
But not just me.

623
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,270
You have to go too.

624
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,150
Can you do it for me?

625
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,890
Can you share Fuse with me?

626
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,170
Fine, I'll do it myself.

627
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,170
He's being possessive.

628
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,610
Well!

629
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,090
Why don't you let Polla do it for you?

630
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,650
He called my name.

631
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,310
Don't be over react, Polla.

632
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,050
Say that to yourself.

633
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,010
Let's go, Fuse.

634
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,250
See you later.

635
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:39,476
He wants to see me again~

636
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:44,366
So cute~!

637
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,410
He's with your friend already.

638
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,010
And you, go back to work.

639
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,750
I don't want to.

640
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,390
Why did you take me to the market?

641
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,510
I thought you might not often come here?

642
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,990
Ah, yes.

643
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,990
I rarely come here.

644
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,630
It's far from my faculty.

645
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,210
It's not that far.

646
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,750
What do you want to have?

647
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,810
I don't know, let's take a look first.

648
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:27,370
Well, would you like to have me?

649
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,430
What?

650
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,050
Have me.

651
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,670
Have Fuse.

652
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,290
No, I'm afraid I might get diarrhea.

653
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,870
You're not being romantic.

654
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:46,090
Hey Fuse. You said you
needed to hurry, didn't you?

655
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,170
Er..yes I did.

656
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,570
Hurry? Going to the
market is a pressing issue?

657
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,570
In a lovely manner?

658
00:40:58,182 --> 00:40:59,562
Yeah.

659
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:05,490
Ana's still cute with red lips....

660
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,450
Hey.

661
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:12,690
What the hell is wrong with you?

662
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,350
You're being possessive?

663
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,510
Did you f*ck him already?

664
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,250
No, you didn't, right?

665
00:41:18,758 --> 00:41:20,718
You're just in the talking stage with him.

666
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,750
You can't be more than that.

667
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,030
Don't tell me that you're already in a relationship with him.

668
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,550
You're going to break you record, aren't you?

669
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,810
Talking only one day.

670
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,350
And then f*cking.

671
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,790
Stop being f*cking nosy and go back.

672
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,250
Fuse.

673
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,790
I've heard that.

674
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,630
He's not that hard to get.

675
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,850
What the hell?

676
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,530
I'm telling you the truth.

677
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,770
Damn you!

678
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:55,790
Fuse!

679
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:56,930
Don't.

680
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,450
Fuse.

681
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,430
Why you have to be
mad? I'm telling the truth.

682
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,410
How well do you know him?

683
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,730
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

684
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,130
Fuse!

685
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:14,950
Come back here.

686
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:15,610
Fuse.

687
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,450
Come back!

688
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:16,950
Don't do that.

689
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,070
Fuse.

690
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:18,890
Come back.

691
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:19,330
Fuse.

692
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,750
People are watching.

693
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,150
Hey you!

694
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,850
He talked about you.

695
00:42:35,883 --> 00:42:37,363
It is like he said.

696
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,810
I'm not mad at him.

697
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,790
I don't want you to have
problems because of my past.

698
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,690
I don't care about your past.

699
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,550
I care more about your feelings.

700
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:02,450
Maybe if you know me a little more.

701
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,890
You might not like me, like he said.

702
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:09,670
Never mind.

703
00:43:10,482 --> 00:43:12,442
I can't change my past.

704
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,690
But I'm sure I can change for you.

705
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,290
I don't care about your past.

706
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:55,330
(Ana crispy fried)

707
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:20,450
(Next Episode)
Who are you to be mad at him?

708
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,590
I'm Ana's.

709
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,750
Fuse is a noob.

710
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,430
Don't start a fight.

711
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,010
Let me help.

712
00:44:30,597 --> 00:44:31,197
Who is he?
