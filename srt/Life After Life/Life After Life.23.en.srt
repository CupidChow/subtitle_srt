00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 23
Cunning Meng Ge framed Yo brutally
Loyal Temple God tried to send the message

5
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,600
Yo,

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,160
I'm looking into a case.

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,960
Yet the hens kept making trouble and lay no eggs.

8
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,680
Why don't we give them to the others?

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,480
They are from Li Bugui.

10
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
I'll give them to nobody else.

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Li Bugui forgot you already,

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,280
how long do you want to remember him?

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,920
When

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,160
I can no longer remember him.

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,600
Bofeng.

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,080
I'm here to see you again.

17
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,520
They all said that your soul dispersed,

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,400
but I don't believe it.

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,039
I feel that you're still here

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
and stay with me.

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,280
It's like when I had the plague,

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,080
everyone said I'd die,

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,200
only you

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,480
stayed with me

25
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,440
and took care of me.

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,440
I knew at that time

27
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,079
that I would

28
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
love nobody but you.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,560
Since the day I came to Lingyuan,

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,200
I made a meticulous plan for you.

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,640
To gain the trust of Lady Destiny,

32
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,240
I tolerated her for hundreds of years

33
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,280
and finally crossed out your name.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,600
I knew they'd find it out,

35
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,560
so I was going

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,600
to make Meng Yo a scapegoat.

37
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,080
I would kill her myself

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,680
and make Li Bugui

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
taste the feeling of losing his love.

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Ha-ha.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,880
But I didn't do it

42
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,280
because I came up with a better idea.

43
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,560
I will make them suffer ultimately

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,720
for their mistake.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,160
If you were alive,

46
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,920
you'd like that idea,

47
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,200
but you will never know it.

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,800
Who's there?

49
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,840
Love is a grave indeed.

50
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,240
Meng Yo has sent me

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,560
the cure for the Camouflage Beast,

52
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,920
or I would

53
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,480
die right now.

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,480
Xie Lian.

55
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,880
Do I need

56
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,720
your approval to go to Lingyuan?

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,959
Why do you go there as a human being?

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,760
You...

59
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,959
Now,

60
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,880
we don't have to be separated by death.

61
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,280
Yue.

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,000
Gege.

63
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,600
Gege.

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,000
Gege.

65
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,240
Sister,

66
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,960
did you see my hen?

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,040
It disappeared suddenly.

68
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,880
I didn't see any hen

69
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,800
except a dead one.

70
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,600
Why did you kill my hen?

71
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
You are so mad

72
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,560
because I killed your hen.

73
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,320
What shall I do

74
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,360
since you killed my man?

75
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,440
Sister.

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Since you love Tao Ran deeply,

77
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,680
you must know

78
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,960
how hard it is to meet someone

79
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,120
who's loyal to you.

80
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,920
Ji Bofeng and I stayed together for over 1,000 years

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,360
and nothing separated us,

82
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
but Li Bugui killed him.

83
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,080
It was you.

84
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,760
You helped Ji Bofeng

85
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,200
to transfer ages.

86
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,840
Yes, so what?

87
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,840
As a Lethe Water seller, you should know

88
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,240
how terrible it is

89
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,040
for a person to lose memories.

90
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,480
It's like the way

91
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,320
how Li Bugui treats you now.

92
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,440
Is there any love left?

93
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,680
Don't you think

94
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,880
it was too selfish to do that?

95
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,960
How many innocent people

96
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,680
got killed because you wanted to be together?

97
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,440
I'd rather live

98
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,160
in Lingyuan alone forever

99
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,760
than have

100
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,080
your selfish relationship.

101
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,040
I'm going to tell His Majesty

102
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,520
the truth of all those things.

103
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,640
Advent God and Departure God.

104
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Right on time.

105
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:57,919
She...

106
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,200
It's the edict of His Majesty.

107
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,560
Spiritual Officer Meng Yo

108
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,719
colluded with Li Bugui, the mortal,

109
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,880
to change the ages of others secretly.

110
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,440
The proofs are solid.

111
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
She will be exiled to Void

112
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,760
till her soul disperses.

113
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,080
That's not true.

114
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
It was Meng Ge.

115
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,680
She and Ji Bofeng...

116
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,480
Spiritual Officer Meng Ge.

117
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,280
Yes.

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,720
You made achievements in investigating Li Bugui's case.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,160
Go to the Left-Yin Pavilion for a reward.

120
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,320
Yes.

121
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,640
You...

122
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,200
She's a felon who disturbs Lingyuan.

123
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,320
Though she belonged to the Lethe Hall,

124
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,159
you should show her no mercy.

125
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,840
Lady Meng Ge.

126
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,840
You've been kind to us,

127
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,800
so we know

128
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,440
what to do.

129
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,159
It's the firmest Soul-shattering Cage in Void.

130
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,080
Any Spiritual Officer will

131
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,920
lose their soul and guts

132
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,559
in less than one day.

133
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
In the end, she will turn

134
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,640
into some blood despite her power.

135
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,439
Lady.

136
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,400
Thank you.

137
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,760
Bofeng,

138
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,560
I've managed to distract Lady Destiny.

139
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,760
This day finally comes.

140
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,040
Who's there?

141
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,640
Little Gourd, is that you?

142
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,560
It's such a trouble to have no Camouflage Beast.

143
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,240
Stay put. Let me open your Celestial Eye.

144
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,040
You've got so many treasures against the Spiritual Officers,

145
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,960
or they'd break in.

146
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,840
Why did they chase you?

147
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,520
Though Ji Bofeng died,

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,840
the ages of those children

149
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,720
were not restored,

150
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,840
so people went to Lingyuan through my temple each day.

151
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
I couldn't bear it

152
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,400
and restored their age without permission.

153
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,960
Then...

154
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
They noticed it since I changed too many.

155
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,280
So many innocent children died,

156
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,040
but Lingyuan did nothing?

157
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,000
Drop it.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,200
Meng Yo got in trouble

159
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,040
because of that.

160
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,880
Meng Yo?

161
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
What happened to her?

162
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,960
She was accused

163
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,640
and exiled to Void

164
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
by His Majesty.

165
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,520
How is she now?

166
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,920
Void

167
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,839
is a place for felons in Lingyuan.

168
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,920
Nobody can reincarnate there.

169
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,439
And the one who accused her

170
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,079
was Meng Ge, the maid

171
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,560
who ran Lethe Hall during Lady Destiny's absence.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,560
She took advantage of her power

173
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
to fake proofs

174
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,680
to deceive His Majesty

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,680
and wanted Meng Yo dead.

176
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,680
I need to save her.

177
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,560
Li Bugui.

178
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,479
The people of Qingchuan can't go to Lingyuan,

179
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,520
not to mention to save her in Void.

180
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,199
Meng Ge has plotted for many years

181
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,240
and planted many spies in Lingyuan.

182
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,400
You'll be at stake

183
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,560
once you go there.

184
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,720
I can't just leave Meng Yo be.

185
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,400
You know how to send me there, right?

186
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,520
There is a way.
