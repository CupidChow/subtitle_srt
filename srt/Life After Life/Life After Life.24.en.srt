00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 24
Li Bugui went to Lingyuan to save his love
Meng Yo cried bitterly for Bugui's dispersed soul

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,599
You know it.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,279
You know how to send me there, right?

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,440
There is a way.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,680
Your soul may leave your body and go there,

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,640
but you only have 24 hours.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,960
After that, your soul will disperse

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,120
and you will no longer exist in Qingchuan.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if my soul will disperse,

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,440
I won't let her suffer alone.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,840
Send me there now.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,560
Remember, only 24 hours.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,040
It ends when a rooster crows.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,120
Understood.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,239
I have collected the proofs for Ji Bofeng's crimes.

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,119
You just need to take them to His Majesty

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,919
and Meng Yo's name will be cleared

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,480
and the children of Qingchuan will be safe.

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,679
Okay. Do it now.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,320
By the way,

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,680
you can't take your weapon there.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,600
So I've sent them along with the proofs

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,800
to the Left-Yin Pavilion.

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,560
Remember to take them.

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,080
Cut the crap. Hurry.

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:43,540
The sacrifices for you two.

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,520
<i>Left-Yin Pavilion
The sacrifices for you two.</i>

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:44,679
<i>Left-Yin Pavilion</i>

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,320
Here you are.
<i>Left-Yin Pavilion</i>

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,460
<i>Left-Yin Pavilion</i>

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,000
You don't look familiar.

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,399
Whose sacrifice will you take?

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,960
Li Bugui.

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,840
The word.

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,799
What?

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,080
Nobody told you when you came?

40
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,240
It's the last word before you come to Lingyuan.

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
Send me to Lingyuan.

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,320
No. It's wrong.

43
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,520
Go.

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,799
Your stuff will be frozen

45
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,560
if your answer is wrong three times

46
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,200
and you will be interrogated.

47
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,920
Forget it. I can't remember it.

48
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,640
Cut the crap. Hurry.

49
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,000
Right answer.

50
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,920
I'm taking the stuff for you.

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,760
Yo.

52
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,760
Yo.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Yo.

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,400
Wake up.

55
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,320
It's me.

56
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
It's Bugui.

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,760
Yo.

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,160
Yo.

59
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,760
Li Bugui?

60
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,480
It's me.

61
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,519
It's said

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,720
that a dying person

63
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,600
may dream of her love

64
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,880
who picks her up.

65
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,520
So

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,440
it's true.

67
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,440
What're you talking about?

68
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,120
It's really me.

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,240
I'm here to save you.

70
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,959
Come.

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,840
How's that possible?

72
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,840
You drank the Lethe Water

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,560
and forgot me already,

74
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,680
how could you still remember me?

75
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,959
Yo.

76
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,800
Did you forget it?

77
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
You left an affectionate fruit

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,400
to me on the day you left

79
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,159
which had your tears.

80
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,520
I remembered everything

81
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,760
when I ate it.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,880
I remembered I was Li Bugui

83
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
and I was also

84
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
your Tao Ran.

85
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,600
So the tears of one's love

86
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,400
may neutralize the Lethe Water.

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Tao Ran.

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
Tao Ran.

89
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,640
It's me.

90
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
You are really Tao Ran?

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,760
Yes.

92
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,120
It's me.

93
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,880
It's really me.

94
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,320
How's that possible?

95
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,280
You forgot me already.

96
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,080
How could it be?

97
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,560
How is that possible?

98
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,720
No you believe it?

99
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,080
I am your love and I've come to save you.

100
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,160
Tao Ran.

101
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
It's really you.

102
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,600
You are real.

103
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,400
Yes.

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,000
How did you get inside?

105
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,440
It's perilous here.

106
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,280
Did you get hurt?

107
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,719
Yo.

108
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,120
Yo.

109
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,920
Are you wounded?

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It doesn't matter.

111
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,920
Come with me now.

112
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,159
Let's go.

113
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,000
Come on.

114
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,520
Are you crazy?

115
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,680
The guards are watching here.

116
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,760
God of Well, please.

117
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,440
We need to go back to Qingchuan now.

118
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,760
What...

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,880
What can I do for you?

120
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
Just open the Divine Well, all right?

121
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,680
Okay.

122
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,520
Let's go.

123
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,720
Yo.

124
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,680
You go back first.

125
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,640
I'm going to Qingchuan alone?

126
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Where will you go?

127
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,320
I need to see the Emperor of Lingyuan.

128
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,799
You want to see His Majesty?

129
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,760
What for?

130
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,800
The ages of the children

131
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,360
who were hurt by Ji Bofeng

132
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
were not restored.

133
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,080
If I don't handle that matter,

134
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,920
those children will die.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,160
Besides, I don't want you to be wronged

136
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,520
and keep hiding all your life.

137
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,200
What will you do then?

138
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Look, you go back to Town God Temple.

139
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,400
When I solve it,

140
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,280
I'll go back to see you.

141
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,520
No.

142
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,160
If you insist on doing it,

143
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
I'll go with you.

144
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,280
Just listen to me.

145
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,000
No.

146
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,360
Neither of you can get away.

147
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,600
You broke into the Void

148
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
and took away a condemned prisoner,

149
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,080
so you shall not be pardoned.

150
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,520
Li Bugui,

151
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,719
how do you save her

152
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,920
without the Soul-locking Cup?

153
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,160
Guards.

154
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,000
Arrest them.

155
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,960
Are you alright?

156
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,440
Yes. What brings you here?

157
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,840
Not now. Go.

158
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,440
Go now.

159
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,160
Be careful.

160
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,360
Your Majesty.

161
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,760
I have found out

162
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,600
that the Scarlet Cloud appeared hundreds of years ago

163
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,480
and was just blocked by someone with spells.

164
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,799
When Li Bugui stole the Book of Destiny,

165
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,319
the caster let the Cloud out.

166
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,079
So Li Bugui and Meng Yo

167
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,320
were framed?

168
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,040
Halt.

169
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,320
Who are you?

170
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,800
How dare you break into Qingjing Hall?

171
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm Li Bugui from Qingchuan

172
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,400
and I'm here to see His Majesty.

173
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,280
This is the truth of the Scarlet Cloud.

174
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,760
Let him in.

175
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,439
Lass,

176
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,840
how did you become this?

177
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,560
Your Majesty.

178
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,160
Meng Yo is wronged.

179
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,680
This is the proof.

180
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
Bring it here.

181
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,360
Your Majesty.

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,520
Xie Lian,

183
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,880
the Town God of Guangping, made that name list

184
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,400
of the children whose ages

185
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,680
were deprived.

186
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,240
It's 968 in all.

187
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,240
69 of them arrived in Lingyuan already

188
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,439
and were exiled to the Void without asking you.

189
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,920
The children are still dying one by one.

190
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,920
Please start a retrial

191
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
to find the real criminal

192
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,920
and save the innocent children.

193
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,920
It concerns the order of the two realms,

194
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,880
please recheck the case.

195
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
How dare they?

196
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,199
To think they made such a vile trade

197
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
right under my nose.

198
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,720
I need to see who they are.

199
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,920
Your Majesty,

200
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,439
you have been deceived once,

201
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,680
please uphold justice this time.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You don't have

203
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,880
to worry about it.

204
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,280
I will find the truth.

205
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,280
Your hand.

206
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
What's going on?

207
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,600
It is time.

208
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,560
Time for what?

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,520
No.

210
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,680
Yo,

211
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,800
it's fine.

212
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,760
You are safe now

213
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,200
and so are the children.

214
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,200
I have no regret

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,400
to be able to see you one last time.

216
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
One last time?

217
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,040
What one last time?

218
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,680
No.

219
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,160
I don't want it to be one last time.

220
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,120
I don't want it.

221
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,240
Yo.

222
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Listen to me.

223
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,480
Don't forget me.

224
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,520
You have to remember me.

225
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,760
I love you.

226
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,560
No.

227
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,840
No.

228
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,360
Li Bugui,

229
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,280
don't leave me alone.

230
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,480
Yo.

231
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,160
Lady, I'm begging you.

232
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,920
Yo.
