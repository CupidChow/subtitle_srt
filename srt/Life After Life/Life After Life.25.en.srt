Life After Life

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 25
Scarlet Cloud dispersed
Bugui and Yo drank the Lethe Water together

5
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,559
Kneel.

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,960
Meng Ge.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,519
You colluded with Ji Bofeng of Qingchuan

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,320
to falsify the Book of Destiny

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,840
and disturbed Lingyuan's order

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,000
as well as destiny.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
The proof is solid.

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,440
You'll be sent to the Void now.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,840
You will never reincarnate.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,280
Take her away.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:57,920
Yes.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,360
Lady.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,840
Since karma is in disorder because of Meng Ge,

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,440
the Book of Destiny should be remade.

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,800
The people's ages may be restored.

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,160
Lady Destiny will be in charge of it.

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,000
I will do it.

22
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,960
It's dispersing.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,880
It's dispersing.

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,360
It's dispersing.

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,440
Ha-ha.

26
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,000
Good.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,720
Officer Meng Yo,

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,240
you helped us to find the true criminal

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
and secured the two realms' order.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,480
Just tell me

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,480
the reward you want.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,160
Li Bugui no longer exists,

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,000
so I want nothing.

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,040
What?

35
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,920
I heard

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,640
that though Li Bugui was cursed,

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,200
he still tried to catch Ji Bofeng in Qingchuan

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,560
to protect the people

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,960
and restore order.

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,959
I'm making a bold

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,560
request.

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,760
Please recover Li Bugui's soul

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,239
and let him go back to Qingchuan.

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,440
Well...

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,280
You can recover his soul?

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:46,920
Alas.

47
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,120
All of us know

48
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,120
that one can't come back to life.

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,800
Though I'm the lord of everything,

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,600
I can't break the rule.

51
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,160
Fine.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,880
I shouldn't have had the vain hope.

53
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,240
However, a man will return

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,360
to Qingchuan with a new identity

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,800
by the sunset.

56
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,359
He looks like your Li Bugui,

57
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,680
do you want to take a look?

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,840
What's the point?

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,720
It's not him anyway.

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,920
Foolish girl,

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,640
His Majesty has agreed

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,840
to restore Li Bugui's soul

63
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,040
so Li Bugui may be alive.

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,320
It's a top secret. Tell nobody else.

65
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,359
Thank you, Your Majesty.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm willing to be your slave

67
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,480
forever.

68
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,640
Come on. Forget it.

69
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,760
I'll be grateful if you can

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,360
no longer shatter my houses.

71
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,640
Ha-ha.

72
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,359
Your Majesty,

73
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,240
since Li Bugui is reincarnated,

74
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,880
let's do one more good thing

75
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,799
and send Yo back

76
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,799
to carry on their relationship.

77
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,120
Huh?

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Yo,

79
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,800
I could tell

80
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,880
that you're in love

81
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,480
and don't want to stay here,

82
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,520
so why don't you go to have your life?

83
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
Destiny.

84
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,719
There was no such a precedent.

85
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,760
There was not a Spiritual Officer

86
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,159
who helped you to solve such a major case, either.

87
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,440
Fine.

88
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Officer Meng Yo.

89
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,920
I can let you return to Qingchuan.

90
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,960
As for whether you can meet Li Bugui

91
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,400
and be with him,

92
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,320
it depends on your own destiny.

93
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,640
From now on,

94
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,200
Meng Yo is removed from her post

95
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
and will be sent to Qingchuan

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,840
as a mortal.

97
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,880
I

98
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
thank you, Your Majesty.

99
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,719
Thank you, Lady.

100
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,880
Stand up.

101
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,359
Town God Xie Lian.

102
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,280
Your Majesty.

103
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,520
I heard that you wanted to be transferred here long ago.

104
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,840
Since you have great credit in Meng Ge's case,

105
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,520
you may come to be my guard.

106
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,720
I... I'm afraid that I'm incapable

107
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,840
of doing that.

108
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,840
So, I'd like to go back to my humble temple

109
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,960
to keep being a Town God.

110
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Are you refusing me?

111
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,080
No.

112
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,599
I'll wake up laughing

113
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,799
if I could be your guard.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,240
Ha-ha.

115
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,840
Yue is going back to face her fate,

116
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,920
I'd like to wait for her at my temple

117
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
because I can't

118
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,840
leave her alone.

119
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,880
Ha-ha.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,560
Very well.

121
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,040
So your love is so precious

122
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,440
that it matters more than my post.

123
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,440
Since your love

124
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,920
is not weaker than you,

125
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,239
from now on,

126
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,800
Shen Zhuoyue will be Departure God

127
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,440
and Xie Lian will be Advent God.

128
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,120
You two shall work together

129
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,560
to punish the evil

130
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,720
and safeguard the two realms' order.

131
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

132
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,359
Ha-ha.

133
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,840
What are you waiting for?

134
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,360
Li Bugui is going back to Qingchuan.

135
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,960
Go back to look for him.

136
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,360
Are you sure

137
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,919
you'll resign

138
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,000
and go to Qingchuan with me?

139
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,760
Yes.

140
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,560
But there are so many people in Qingchuan.

141
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,440
Trust me.

142
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,720
I will find you.

143
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,960
A hair of worries.

144
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,520
The silk of love is sheared.

145
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,160
Two lines of love tears.

146
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,520
The bond is crushed.

147
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,320
Three drops of sorrowful tears.

148
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,120
The affection of this life is dissolved.

149
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,520
This time,

150
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,319
you will taste your own Lethe Water.

151
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,600
Okay.

152
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,079
All right.

153
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,560
You're free to go

154
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
after drinking.

155
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,920
Lady.

156
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,319
Take care.

157
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,480
Ji Bofeng.

158
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,240
We are going to meet soon.

159
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,620
<i>Many years later</i>

160
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,600
Wow. That's amazing.

161
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,599
Advent God is coming.

162
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,960
Departure God is coming.

163
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,520
Aren't they us?

164
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,040
To think we are so popular

165
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,760
in Qingchuan.

166
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,640
It's Advent God and Departure God.

167
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,160
That's me.

168
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
And that's me.

169
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
I wonder if Shuanzi

170
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,760
has met Lady Meng or not.

171
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,120
Don't worry.

172
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
They are like us.

173
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,640
Even if they are in two different positions

174
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
at Qingchuan,

175
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,360
in the end,

176
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,920
they will still be together.

177
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,800
Why?

178
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,040
Why?

179
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Because I used to be the God of Matchmaker.

180
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,880
I used to be a matchmaker, too.

181
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,120
Come on. You used to be

182
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,840
a matchmaker?

183
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,739
<i>Ending</i>

184
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,060
Thanks for watching!
