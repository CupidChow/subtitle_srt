00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 4
Meng Yo got Bugui's hair
All the Town Gods offered the help

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,160
You again?

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,680
I am Tingyun.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,480
Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,200
You are an entertainer?

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,720
Well,

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,200
I am an entertainer today.

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,080
This man is Ji Bofeng.

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,879
He saved my life before.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,800
If any of you have seen him,

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,160
please tell me.

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,519
I haven't.

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,440
Do you know him?

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,039
I don't.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,240
Let me show you something else.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,800
What's that?

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,480
What's that thing?

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,679
What's that smell?

22
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,440
What is it?

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,960
Could you tell us what it is?

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,400
Human skin.

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,600
If any guest of yours

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,880
has such a tattoo,

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,160
please tell me.

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,200
Master Li, I saw it before.

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,360
All right. You stay.

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,680
Others may leave.

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Isn't it a shame

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,840
to leave?

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,520
When did you see it?

34
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,839
There were some guests in Luohua Town.

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
I saw it, too.

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,759
I also saw that crane tattoo.

37
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,000
Could I talk to you in private?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
Just stand there and speak.

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,440
But how could she...

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Then...

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,280
I also saw that man.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now

43
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,959
could we talk alone?

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,880
Fine. Show me your trick this time.

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,760
The one who provided fake information

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,160
last time lost his tongue.

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,680
No, my tongue is so cute.

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,440
Scared?

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
No.

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,200
I really know that man.

51
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,440
Speak.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,720
What can I get in return

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,600
if I tell you?

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,720
What do you want?

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,400
I want...

56
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
I want you not to move.

57
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,560
Mister Li,

58
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,840
I'm not sure

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,760
if I shall tell you this.

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,760
I have been grateful to you.

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,480
Maybe you forgot it already,

62
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,680
but I could never

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,519
forget that day.

64
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,680
It

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,559
was such a cold day

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,880
and your body

67
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,480
was so warm.

68
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,600
Give it to me.

69
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,880
What?

70
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,960
The thing in your hand.

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
There's more.

72
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,599
No.

73
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,560
Why did you cut my hair stealthily?

74
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Who sent you? Speak.

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,400
Who sent me?

76
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,000
I just cut your hair

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,680
to return your favor.

78
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
It's said

79
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,159
that if one's hair is buried at Town God Temple,

80
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,120
its owner may be prayed

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
for to always be safe.

82
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,760
Do you have to wear those to return the favor?

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,240
I thought men all liked it.

84
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,240
Childish.

85
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,920
Don't think

86
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,040
about useless things.

87
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,560
I'm warning you

88
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,680
that if you dare

89
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,359
to lie to me about Ji Bofeng,

90
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,200
I will kill you.

91
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
I'm sorry

92
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,680
because I didn't see him.

93
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,560
But if I see him later,

94
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,760
will you see me again?

95
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,120
When you find him.

96
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,560
Qingshui Street.

97
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,560
The south of Yong'an Town.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,840
Qiyue Calligraphy.

99
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,680
Wait. Why can't I find it?

100
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,920
Come out.

101
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,080
Why did you leave me alone again yesterday?

102
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,400
Because I met someone I knew.

103
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,440
An old friend.

104
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,200
An old friend?

105
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,000
By the way,

106
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,520
how could she see you?

107
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,640
She has Yin-Yang Eyes.

108
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,680
We knew each other long ago.

109
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,080
But we haven't contacted each other

110
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,520
since I went to war.

111
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,200
I see.

112
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,200
No wonder she seemed to be looking at a ghost.

113
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,400
Heroine,

114
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,560
what are you looking for?

115
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,920
Li Bugui is looking for someone

116
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,359
named Ji Bofeng.

117
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,040
I have got Li Bugui's hair.

118
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,360
If I find this Ji Bofeng,

119
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,440
I can get close to Li Bugui again.

120
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,359
Then

121
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,040
I will get his tears

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,920
or blood.

123
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,000
Shumiao Pavilion

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,440
has the records of all the natives,

125
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,200
but

126
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,160
I have never heard

127
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,400
about Ji Bofeng.

128
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,440
Anyway, don't worry.

129
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Shumiao Pavilion

130
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,200
is a base for all Town Gods.

131
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,479
So there is everything

132
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,640
about the people from the nobles

133
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,000
to the newborn babies.

134
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,200
Let me write a letter

135
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,960
to tell all the Town Gods in Qingchuan to look for him.

136
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,480
Really?

137
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,200
Yes.

138
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,440
Thank you, Xie.

139
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,360
No problem.

140
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,760
It's just

141
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,159
I have a question.

142
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,880
What is it?

143
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,200
Heroine, how did you

144
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,680
get a physical body in Qingchuan?

145
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,040
The Camouflage Beast?

146
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,440
Yes.

147
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,080
It's granted by His Majesty,

148
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,000
it offers me a physical figure here.

149
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,480
But one of its petals

150
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,160
drops each seven days.

151
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,719
If I can't go back

152
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,080
in 49 days,

153
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,920
I will feel extremely itchy and sore

154
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,160
and suffer the biting of worms

155
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,040
till I'm totally engulfed.

156
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Then I can

157
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,599
never go back.

158
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,680
Trust me.

159
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,760
I will help you to complete the mission

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,960
before the petals disappear.

161
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,680
I'm sending the message right now.

162
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,040
A letter from the Town God of Huangling.

163
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,800
I have checked the records of three centuries

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,480
and only found one person who was like Ji Bofeng,

165
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,000
but that man died

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,120
210 years ago.

167
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,600
Died?

168
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,319
Yes.

169
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,920
A letter

170
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
From the Town God of Youyun.

171
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,120
A letter...

172
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,240
A letter from...

173
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,200
From Taohua Town.

174
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,000
Yunmeng Town.

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,960
Jiuzhou Town.

176
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,880
Xilan Town.

177
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,480
Yong'an Town.

178
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,160
Tianshui Town.

179
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,560
A letter...

180
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,079
A letter from

181
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,840
From the Town God of Luohua.

182
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,120
So, heroine,

183
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,960
impressed

184
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,920
by my connections?

185
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
Yes.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
Let's go back to check them.

187
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:31,800
Okay.

188
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,200
It's weird.

189
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,040
Why did they look all the same?

190
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,560
Yes. And they all died in their 30s.

191
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,640
This man is still alive.

192
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,439
He should be in Luohua.

193
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,000
Tell Li Bugui right now.

194
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,199
No.

195
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,000
I lied to him once,

196
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,640
so he won't believe it

197
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,040
if I tell him now.

198
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,920
I'll go to Luohua Town

199
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,400
to invite Ji Bofeng back.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,160
Li Bugui will be grateful to me

201
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,000
for seeing his savior.

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,240
Hold on.

203
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,120
I can't leave my own town.

204
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,360
Then you go to tell Li Bugui.

205
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,420
Luohua Town

206
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,480
Excuse me.

207
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Anybody home?

208
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,000
Ji Bofeng?

209
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,400
Why

210
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,280
are there

211
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,800
so many toys here?

212
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,240
What are you looking for, elder sister?

213
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
Elder sister?

214
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,120
I'm here to see Ji Bofeng.

215
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,959
Master Li.

216
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,040
It's all the people

217
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,839
with the crane tattoo I have met.

218
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,160
What's more,

219
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,480
I'm not sure if I shall tell you this.

220
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,080
Yes?

221
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,360
The girl you met yesterday

222
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,520
wasn't Tingyun.

223
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,560
I'm sure of it because I saw Tingyun before.

224
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,560
I knew it was her trick.

225
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
Ever heard the crap that one may be safe

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,880
if his hair is taken to Town God Temple?

227
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,880
My friends and I

228
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,360
usually talk so to please the guests.

229
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,560
So it seems

230
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
she's quite possible to be in our circle.

231
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,000
Did that entertainer

232
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,520
try to use such a mean way

233
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,480
to seduce you?

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,640
Go check it out.

235
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,000
To Zhongsheng Yard in the south of Luohua City.

236
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,079
Ji Bofeng is over there.

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,480
Please come in.

238
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,200
Well,

239
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,880
are you Ji Bofeng?

240
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,240
How do you know I'm here?

241
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,280
I...

242
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,800
I have many friends

243
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,240
and I've got the news from them.

244
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,280
Show me your hand.

245
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,800
Hand?

246
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,920
This is a clinic.

247
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,880
Get treated

248
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,000
or get out.

249
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,320
No.

250
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,160
I...

251
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,040
I'm ill.

252
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,800
Meng Yo.

253
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,040
You were recruited by Lethe Hall 800 years ago

254
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,560
and became a maid of Lady Destiny.

255
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,840
You feed the souls with Lethe Water.

256
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,520
Once you cry,

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,720
an earthquake occurs.

258
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,080
Am I right?

259
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,640
Who...

260
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,600
Who are you exactly?
