Life After Life

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 8
Meng Yo moved into Li Bugui's home
Tried every means to make him shed tears

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,439
Why can I touch you?

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,560
You're not a Spiritual Officer?

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,200
I...

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,479
I'm sorry, Lady Shen.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,080
I have a task to do,

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,000
so I can't tell you the truth.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,360
Of course, I'm not a Spiritual Officer.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,920
I am

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,520
just an ordinary person.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,840
But since my cousin was entitled the Town God

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
after he died,

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,200
so I piggybacked on his status

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,559
and saw Spiritual Officers a few times.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,199
But

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,279
they all seemed so mysterious

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,160
and didn't talk to me too much.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,680
Then did you get close

22
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,880
to us by their order?

23
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,400
Why do you ask so?

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,480
Do you have issues with them?

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,960
No.

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,840
It's Li Bugui.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,320
He doesn't like the people of Lingyuan.

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,320
Does he have any secrets?

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,080
There are no secrets.

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,119
As long as you're not a Spiritual Officer.

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,840
You alright?

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,679
I'm fine.

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,679
You,

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,760
come with me.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,520
Huh?

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,080
Don't try to help others

37
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,520
since you can't fight.

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,920
Who were they?

39
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,280
Why did they hunt me?

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,680
It's Ji Bofeng.

41
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,880
You are his target.

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,640
Why did I get in such trouble?

43
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,720
You can no longer stay in Guangping.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,720
Leave now.

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,119
I can't. I have things to do here.

46
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,960
Does it matter more than your life?

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,040
It does.

48
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,519
Well,

49
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,000
my petty life matters a bit also.

50
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,280
Do you have any relatives here?

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,760
Yes,

52
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,280
my brother is in the town.

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,400
Go seek refuge with him.

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,000
All right.

55
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,040
Brother, I'm here to seek refuge.

56
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,680
Could I live here?

57
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,959
I...

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,280
Are you going back on your word?

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,320
We just swore to be siblings.

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,000
You...

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,520
Fine.

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,440
Change your mind if you like,

63
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,040
I can keep staying in this deserted temple.

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,720
Look,

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,560
I can choose a corner to lie down

66
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
and sleep.

67
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,320
Stand up.

68
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,120
How can you sleep here?

69
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
I think you are right.

70
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,480
I need a quilt.

71
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,960
There is a rag by the gate.

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,400
Though it has many holes,

73
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
I can make do with it.

74
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,280
Besides,

75
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,040
it's not a bad thing to sleep here

76
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,520
though it's a bit cold and damp

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,200
and there are also some insects.

78
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Anyway, don't worry, brother.

79
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,920
I'm used to them.

80
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
What's more,

81
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,000
even if Ji Bofeng comes to kill me,

82
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,079
what's the big deal?

83
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,880
People

84
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,080
die anyway.

85
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,240
But I'm glad

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,480
to die for my brother.

87
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,560
Get up.

88
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,840
Since you saved my granny's sister,

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,920
you may move to Lingxiao Sect.

90
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,640
Thanks, brother.

91
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,640
It will be easier

92
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,880
to get his tears at that place.

93
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,600
Let me warn you first,

94
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,560
if you do something absurd,

95
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,240
I can still drive you out.

96
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,280
What

97
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,320
is the thing absurd?

98
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,200
I will tell you

99
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,839
when you do it.

100
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,480
All right.

101
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,320
Thank you, brother.

102
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,120
You're so kind, brother.

103
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,440
Goodbye, brother.

104
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,640
See you tomorrow.

105
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,359
Heroine.

106
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm impressed by you.

107
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,120
Once you move into his home,

108
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,640
we will have more chances

109
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,400
to do it.

110
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,480
I've prepared this useful item to make him cry.

111
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,760
There are onions, artemisia argyi and pepper in it.

112
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,600
I'm sure they can protect you

113
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,680
and help you to make it.

114
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,000
With them,

115
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,280
I can get the tears

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,599
and make Lethe Water soon.

117
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,719
Yes.

118
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,120
Heroine.

119
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,679
Why are you sighing?

120
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
Li Bugui kept me safe

121
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,520
all day,

122
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,560
yet I've been lying to him.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,920
Don't blame yourself

124
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,120
because you didn't have a choice.

125
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,840
You need to save the whole Lingyuan.

126
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,080
Besides,

127
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,960
you are not going to kill him, right?

128
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,560
Li Bugui carries the grudges

129
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,039
of two lifetimes,

130
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,680
so if you let him drink Lethe Water,

131
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,440
you may help him to relieve.

132
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,599
Then

133
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,159
he may have a happy life.

134
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,320
That being said,

135
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,240
will he be happy

136
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,440
when he forgets everything?

137
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
Well...

138
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,800
I was wondering

139
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,680
why you let that suspicious lass move in.

140
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,920
So you want to use her to lure Ji Bofeng out.

141
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,280
Since she has learned Ji Bofeng's secret,

142
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,080
he will come after her.

143
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,200
Fortunately,

144
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,840
she has eaten my Bettle Pearls of Blood,

145
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,960
I can know her whereabouts anytime.

146
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,840
Therefore, I can wait

147
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,719
till Ji Bofeng is drawn out.

148
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,960
But I still don't know

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,800
the reason that woman

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
gets close to me.

151
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,120
Is it possible

152
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,320
that she gets close to you for no reason special

153
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,640
or

154
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
she just loves you?

155
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,000
Love?

156
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,080
I'm not sure if I guessed it right.

157
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,000
Look,

158
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,320
she tried to approach you.

159
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,280
She swore to be your sister even when she knew

160
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,000
you killed many people.

161
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,560
She sucked out the poisonous blood for you

162
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,520
and insisted on living near you.

163
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,760
I'd do the same if I loved someone.

164
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,000
There is no reason else

165
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,359
which can make her treat you in that way.

166
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,200
She saved you today,

167
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
did she also buy your tongue over?

168
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,160
Fine.

169
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,360
Whatever you say.

170
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,960
Let me help her to clean up.

171
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,640
Love?

172
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,960
This is your room.

173
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,440
Feel free to use the gold,

174
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,520
the silver and other things here.

175
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,400
If it's not enough,

176
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,320
take more from the treasury.

177
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,840
What's more,

178
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,040
you may also order the servants here.

179
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,320
I didn't know you were such a thoughtful person.

180
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,160
It's so well-prepared.

181
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,160
They are

182
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,840
prepared by Li Bugui.

183
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:53,960
Huh?

184
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,960
That bru...

185
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,159
My

186
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,200
brother?

187
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,520
Just settle down here.

188
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,760
Li Bugui is in the next door.

189
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,320
Call him when you're in danger

190
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,560
and he'll show up at once.

191
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,239
Wow?

192
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,080
At once?

193
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:09,840
Yes.

194
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,560
Thank you, brother.

195
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,440
You're so nice.

196
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,360
This is the main hall of Lingxiao Sect,

197
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,520
a place where we handle the businesses

198
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
and other things.

199
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,280
Okay.

200
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,400
That is...

201
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,320
the drawings of Ten Spiritual Officers.

202
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,000
So he has been guarding against the Spiritual Officers.

203
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,439
I'm not on it luckily.

204
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,200
I wonder if he saw me

205
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,240
when he refused to drink Lethe Water.

206
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
Those devices are used to guard against the Spiritual Officers.

207
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,319
Once any Spiritual Officer steps into this house

208
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,880
they can't get away.

209
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,959
Okay.

210
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,839
The Spiritual Officer?

211
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,880
Why are you on guard against them?

212
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,680
Did you see one?

213
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,280
You don't need to know it.

214
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,120
Okay.

215
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,240
Ji Bofeng

216
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,080
is your largest threat.

217
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,520
You're safe now.

218
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,680
I'm relieved to be with you.

219
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,600
Anyway, I have made up my mind.

220
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,640
I won't be a freeloader here.

221
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,440
Feel free to tell me what you need.

222
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,959
I can be happy with you when you're glad

223
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,560
and I can shed tears with you when you're upset.

224
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,280
Just take me as a brick of yours

225
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,840
and place me anywhere you like.

226
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,040
What do you think?

227
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,880
I don't need any brick.

228
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,520
He does,

229
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,240
he just doesn't realize it.

230
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:49,960
All right.

231
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,880
What is it?

232
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,760
Why is it so irritating?

233
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,760
It is my special

234
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,200
spicy tear hot pot.

235
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,320
It's said to be great

236
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,480
for fighters.

237
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,359
Indeed?

238
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,000
It tastes good.

239
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,400
Isn't it?

240
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,800
Shuanzi,

241
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,880
why don't you take a bite?

242
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,359
Yes, brother,

243
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,520
have some meat.

244
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,520
I'm good.

245
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,720
I hate that taste.

246
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,760
I've prepared it carefully.

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,720
Forget him.

248
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,360
Let's eat.

249
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,880
So I can't use the hot pot

250
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,439
to make him shed tears.

251
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,280
Hey,

252
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,000
why did you call him Shuanzi?

253
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,520
It's his infant name.

254
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,880
His mother was afraid that he would die,

255
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,520
so she named him Shuanzi

256
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,080
which means holding his life.

257
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,319
I see.

258
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,040
Shuanzi.

259
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,480
Brother Shuanzi.

260
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,440
Want an onion bath?

261
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,640
How did you get inside?

262
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,160
Out.

263
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,560
If you don't like onions,

264
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,160
I also have other herbs

265
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,560
for you to have a herbal bath.

266
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,920
I'm so healthy

267
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
that I don't need it.

268
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,839
I'm sure you do.

269
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,640
You do.
