Episode 10
Meng Yo befriends Li Bugui
Cute guy Zhang Shen showed up

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,760
Sleeping on the beam hurts your waist.

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,639
How did she come up here?

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,480
Why don't you come down?

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,279
The bed down here is cozy.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,360
Boring.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,919
I've hidden a treasure in your bed.

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,680
Why don't you look for it?

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,240
So troublesome.

13
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,440
This Sooth Soup

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,520
offers you a sound sleep.

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,680
Brother Shuanzi.

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,679
Brother Shuanzi.

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
You're finally awake.

18
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,600
What time is it?

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,760
It's noon.

20
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,000
The noon?

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,360
Yes.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,280
How did I sleep for so long?

23
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Did you

24
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,280
put some sleeping drugs in your gourd?

25
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,239
I made it for you especially,

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,760
so I used dozens of herbs to help you to sleep.

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,799
Brother Shuanzi, what are you looking for?

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,000
Where are my clothes?

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,079
Outside.

30
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,160
Why did you wash them suddenly?

31
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,760
We are siblings.

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,800
Shouldn't I do something for you?

33
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
Why are you frowning again?

34
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,480
I was going to make you happy.

35
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,280
If you don't like it,

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,240
I won't touch your things again.

37
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,240
You shouldn't have

38
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,160
washed all my clothes.

39
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,120
What can I wear now?

40
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Fair enough.

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,880
Just wait.

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,920
Let me take the dry ones for you.

43
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,800
Brother Shuanzi, give me a hand.

44
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,840
I...

45
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,080
I didn't mean this.

46
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,560
It's fine. Just take it.

47
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,280
It's done.

48
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Okay.

49
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,200
Brother Shuanzi.

50
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Are you alright?

51
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,599
Stand up and put it on.

52
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,600
Brother Shuanzi.

53
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,640
I prepared a gift for you.

54
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
As an apology,

55
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,800
I bought you a new robe.

56
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,800
You like it?

57
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,880
Its color doesn't fit me.

58
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
You haven't even tried it yet.

59
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,080
You always wear white or black ones

60
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,680
which look like the ink paintings on the wall.

61
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,600
Isn't it ominous?

62
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,159
So you have to try different colors

63
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,760
to make your life colorful.

64
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,719
Besides, your clothes are still wet.

65
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Come on.

66
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,920
Then...

67
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,280
Fine.

68
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,600
Alas. That's nice.

69
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,560
Don't you look good in it?

70
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,720
As I said,

71
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,240
this color doesn't fit me.

72
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,320
How could it be?

73
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
All right, Brother Shuanzi.

74
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,840
I'm going to get groceries.

75
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,320
So you'll have soup tonight.

76
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,480
Didn't you go for groceries?

77
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
No.

78
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,160
I'd like to ask you

79
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,440
if you want the soup

80
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,640
to be cooked with ginger.

81
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,920
Either will do.

82
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
All right.

83
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
I'll be right back.

84
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,760
You are gorgeous today, brother.

85
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,960
You...

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,080
Marriage chickens.

87
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,160
Marriage chickens.

88
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,120
Take a look, you love birds.

89
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Marriage chickens.

90
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,080
Mister, I want one.

91
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,560
Lady, it's not sold

92
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,440
individually,

93
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,560
but in pairs.

94
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,320
Why?

95
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,719
The Moon Sacrifice is approaching.

96
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,440
So the love birds all want to be together.

97
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,680
Look at this street,

98
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,440
all the things

99
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,240
are sold in pairs.

100
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,360
Moon Sacrifice?

101
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,080
Mister,

102
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,400
what do people do at that festival?

103
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,160
So you are not a native.

104
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,479
On Moon Sacrifice,

105
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,200
the people in love wear the same clothes

106
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,400
to worship the moon

107
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,840
and pray to the God of Matchmaker

108
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,880
to let them be together till their death.

109
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,720
Then

110
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,960
they go to the fair

111
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,039
and eat affectionate fruit.

112
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,039
Lady,

113
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
you're such a charming girl,

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,720
why did

115
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,479
nobody invite you

116
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,160
to spend the festival?

117
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,640
I...

118
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,200
am a stranger here.

119
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,919
I see.

120
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,440
Lady,

121
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,360
since

122
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,320
nobody invited you,

123
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,240
look,

124
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,440
I'm not married, so...

125
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,520
I'm good.

126
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,680
I just want to buy a chicken.

127
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,000
Two.

128
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,440
Two.

129
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,320
Ha-ha. All right.

130
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,320
Let me take two for you.

131
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
I wonder who he will invite to the festival.

132
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,799
Did you write the name on the handkerchief?

133
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,720
And the address?

134
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,640
Check it out for me.

135
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,199
All right.

136
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,280
Zhang Shen is coming.

137
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:40,760
It's him.

138
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
He's coming.

139
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,920
Zhang Shen!

140
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,160
Who's that?

141
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,600
So dramatic.

142
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,600
Advent God and Departure God?

143
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,080
What brings them here?

144
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Did they

145
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,920
come to catch Li Bugui?

146
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,520
Just like our boss said,

147
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,880
she'd follow us if we put

148
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,000
on the Spiritual Officer's uniforms.

149
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,400
You...

150
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,520
work for Ji Bofeng?

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,840
Yes. So what?

152
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Since you offended him,

153
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,360
don't blame us for this.

154
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,719
Li Bugui?

155
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,640
Li Bugui, why did you come here?

156
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,240
Aren't you still ill?

157
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,920
Why did you follow the strangers?

158
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,320
My fault.

159
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,280
I mistook them for the Spiritual Officer

160
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,400
who'd come after you.

161
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,079
You wanted to protect me?

162
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,720
I know it sounds ridiculous.

163
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,000
It is ridiculous.

164
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,560
Brother Shuanzi.

165
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,520
How did you know where I was?

166
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,760
I just happened to pass by.

167
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,600
Hold on.

168
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,640
It's been several times.

169
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,600
It seems each time I was in danger,

170
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,920
you could find me immediately.

171
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,720
Because you were so dumb

172
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,160
that you always encountered the bad guys.

173
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,080
What are you holding?

174
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,359
They are marriage chickens.

175
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,640
I'm taking them home to make soup for you.

176
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,440
Okay. Let's go then.

177
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,760
Okay.

178
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,400
Take a look.

179
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,160
Keep them away from me.

180
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,079
You said

181
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,720
that Li Bugui saved her?

182
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,360
Yes.

183
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,400
Then

184
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,880
why did you come back?

185
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,640
Bofeng.

186
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,600
Do you need my help?

187
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,920
No.

188
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,360
It's a mere Spiritual Officer.

189
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,800
I don't believe

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,560
that Li Bugui will always be by her side.

191
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,920
Well then,

192
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
we may use her

193
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,360
