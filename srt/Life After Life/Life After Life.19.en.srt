Episode 19
Fight in Zhongsheng Yard
Review the history through the History Stone

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,640
You did become a child.

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,600
Yes.

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,559
It's just the clothes are too big.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,880
Now it's my show time.

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,640
Okay.

10
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,880
You were of this age

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,160
when I first met you.

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,520
I was walking on the street

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,240
and you were playing on a swing.

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,080
You showed up to smile at me

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,600
and then did it again.

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,040
I was wondering

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,640
who that girl was

18
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,360
and if she was scared

19
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,680
to swing so high.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,920
But you were a wuss

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,320
and ran away in each fight.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,520
So I had to protect you.

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,600
In a blink,

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,520
we have known each other for a decade.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,240
We had an agreement

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,600
that I'd come back to marry you

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,479
when I became a high official.

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,720
To think I became the local Town God

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,680
and dared not to see you.

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,520
What I could do

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,479
was miss you on the swing.

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,360
A Town God is also an official,

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,679
so you kept your word.

34
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,840
Take the dagger

35
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,600
when you leave tomorrow.

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,880
Isn't it weird

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,680
for me to carry a weapon?

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,800
If I can make it back,

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,519
make a statue for me too

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,040
and put it beside yours.

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,000
Call it Town Goddess.

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,840
You have such an ambition as a child.

43
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,600
You have to come back

44
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,640
in one piece,

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,720
did you hear me?

46
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,560
Sure.

47
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,880
I know Lady Shen

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,840
is your last relative

49
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,360
in this world,

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,560
so you must worry about her.

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,640
Trust me, I won't let Ji Bofeng

52
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,320
lay a finger on any of you.

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,080
Okay.

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,360
Father.

55
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
Why do you only look at mother?

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,320
Am I no longer your child?

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
To think the boy has

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,280
forgotten his granny's sister once he has a wife.

59
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,320
Do be careful later.

60
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't worry.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,760
I'll have the tea you offer me at your wedding

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,000
and I've already prepared the lucky money.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,920
You're so wordy.

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,160
Indeed?

65
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,320
Aren't you so glad to pretend

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,600
to be her husband?

67
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,239
I can even see your molars.

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Clay figurines.

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,960
Clay figurines.

70
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
It's Clay figurines.

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,200
Yue,

72
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,320
go to have fun there.

73
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,640
I'm going shopping with your mother.

74
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,120
Girl, take a look.

75
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,960
Old man, where are we?

76
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm no old man,

77
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,920
I'm just seven.

78
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,800
Then how could you be so old?

79
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,160
You will be older than me

80
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,800
within two hours.

81
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
You can only choose one.

82
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,120
As for how many years you can get,

83
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,120
it depends on your luck.

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,920
That...

85
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,120
Too thin. He won't live long.

86
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,360
That...

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,200
is too fat.

88
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,880
That...

89
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,720
He...

90
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,800
he is so old.

91
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,880
That. I want him.

92
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,840
Fine. Take him away.

93
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,520
No. Let me go.

94
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,320
Hold on.

95
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,520
Why don't you choose me?

96
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,840
You? Why?

97
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Don't you know it?

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,360
Women live longer than men.

99
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,160
Girl, aren't you scared?

100
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,880
Yes, but Shuanzi told me

101
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,640
that one shouldn't

102
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,200
chicken out because one is scared.

103
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,840
Fine.

104
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,640
You have the guts.

105
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:52,960
Okay.

106
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,800
It's her then.

107
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,560
Take her away.

108
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,360
Move.

109
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,120
Alas.

110
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,800
The girl is ill-fated

111
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
and can only live to 30,

112
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,039
so you may have 20 years more.

113
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,800
20 years?

114
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,720
No, I need to change it.

115
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,000
I want that boy.

116
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,720
You think my Zhongsheng Yard is a market?

117
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,800
If you change your mind,

118
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,120
you will be the one to die.

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,159
I won't.

120
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,640
Let's begin now.

121
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,880
Girl, what are you looking for?

122
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,479
Are you looking

123
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,560
for him?

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,960
He has been following you.

125
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,160
I shouldn't let him jeopardize our cause.

126
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,920
Xie Lian.

127
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,440
Xie Lian, you jerk.

128
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,760
Wake up now.

129
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,080
He can't hear you.

130
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,320
When I caught him,

131
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,760
he couldn't

132
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,240
warn Meng Yo and Li Bugui,

133
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,640
so,

134
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,800
you'd better give up.

135
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Shen Zhuoyue.

136
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,440
What's that?

137
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,440
The medicine to take your life.

138
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,119
After a while,

139
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,479
you will throw up your age.

140
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
Spectacular.

141
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,880
Each time I see it,

142
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,280
it makes me overjoyed.

143
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,000
Take it

144
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,800
and eat it.

145
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,920
You may live 20 years more.

146
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
20 years.

147
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,720
20 years.

148
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
Li Bugui, you again.

149
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,160
You hindered me each time.

150
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,520
Li Bugui,

151
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,040
this is not over.

152
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,000
Kill him.

153
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,040
It's so hard to catch this soul.

154
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,439
Thanks to you.

155
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
So, let me treat you to a drink tonight?

156
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
All right.

157
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,600
Advent God and Departure God.

158
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,640
It seems to be Lingyuan.

159
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,760
The History Stone?

160
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,880
Li Bugui.

161
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,280
Born in the sixth year of Xian'guan.

162
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,920
Loved martial arts and weapons since he was a boy.

163
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,680
Killed numerous people.

164
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,520
Died in the 52nd year of Xian'guan

165
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
at Guangping Town God Temple after drinking.

166
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,040
Shen Yan.

167
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,440
Born in the ninth year of Yongyuan.

168
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,439
A young master of Zhenyuan Escort Agency.

169
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,520
Kidnapped at five.

170
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,560
His parents managed to save him

171
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,520
and died terribly.

172
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,560
He learned martial arts to take revenge.

173
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,640
In the 44th year of Yongyuan,

174
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,920
he found the enemy.

175
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,360
But he was plotted against after the three-day fight.

176
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,760
Then got killed by the enemy.

177
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,359
Tao Ran.

178
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,319
Tao Ran?

179
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,600
Isn't it Zhang Shen?

180
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,840
Tao Ran.

181
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,560
Born in the third year of Jinghui.

182
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,640
The husband of Meng Yo.

183
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,800
Taken to build fortifications on his wedding day.

184
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,719
Died outside exhausted

185
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,800
after ten years of labor work.

186
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,520
Meng Yo cried for ten days to look for his bones

187
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,640
which moved the heaven and the earth.

188
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,960
So...

189
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,160
So I am Tao Ran.

190
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,240
Meng Yo.

191
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,400
Meng Yo.

192
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Destiny is so hard to anticipate.

193
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,359
You!

194
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,839
Owe me thanks.

195
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,920
I'm the first one to tell you

196
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,720
who you really are.

197
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,920
800 years ago,

198
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,199
your love even moved the gods.

199
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,840
To think

200
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,040
you are reunited today.

201
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,040
Among all the men in that world,

202
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,760
she fell in love with you again.

203
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,560
Nonsense.

204
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,520
I don't believe a single word you said.

205
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,720
I may lie to you, but the History Stone doesn't.

206
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,120
When you were having a good life in Qingchuan,

207
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,200
did you know

208
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,959
that Lady Meng

209
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,200
had waited for you for 800 years?

210
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,319
Why did you draw me here?

211
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,240
Because I pity her.

212
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,440
She waited for you for so long

213
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,960
and finally,

214
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,600
she met you again,

215
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,240
yet you will drink Lethe Water

216
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,920
and forget her totally.

217
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,200
Loving someone requires a moment

218
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,080
while forgetting one

219
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,480
takes so long.

220
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,480
Li Bugui,

221
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,560
let's have a deal.

222
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,800
You know what I'm capable of.

223
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,640
I have lived for over 1,000 years

224
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,600
and I have loved

225
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
a person for over 1,000 years.

226
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,920
Only I

227
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,360
know the feeling of missing someone.

228
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,240
So if you let me go,

229
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,160
I can make you live forever.

230
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,920
Then you may always

231
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,680
be with Lady Meng.

232
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,320
Do you have the heart

233
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,400
to let her wait for you for 800 years more?

234
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,840
Your happiness with her

235
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,800
depends on your choice.

236
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,680
I choose...
