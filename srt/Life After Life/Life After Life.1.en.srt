00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 1
The Book of Destiny was stolen and the Scarlet Cloud appears
Spiritual Officer goes to the mortals' realm to remedy

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,720
A thousand years ago,

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,759
there were two realms in the world.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,860
Qingchuan and Lingyuan.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,200
<i>Guangping, Qingchuan
Qingchuan and Lingyuan.</i>

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>Guangping, Qingchuan</i>

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,960
On Obon by the end of summer,
<i>Guangping, Qingchuan</i>

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:31,980
<i>Guangping, Qingchuan</i>

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,560
the two realms would be connected.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,000
Sister, my umbrella is stuck.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,800
Come on, so careless.

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,100
<i>Meng Yo
Spiritual Officer</i>

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,640
<i>Meng Ge
Spiritual Officer</i>

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,780
Right on that day,
<i>Meng Ge
Spiritual Officer</i>

18
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:52,800
Right on that day,

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,280
I also came to Qingchuan.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,519
The Spiritual Officers came to Qingchuan

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,800
to inspect the natural rules and the destinies

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,360
handled by them.

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,600
Mortals' destinies

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,440
are recorded in the Book of Destiny

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:07,899
by Lady Destiny.

26
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,920
<i>Lady Destiny
Spiritual Officer
by Lady Destiny.</i>

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,360
<i>Lady Destiny
Spiritual Officer</i>

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,920
She's in charge
<i>Lady Destiny
Spiritual Officer</i>

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:10,980
of all the nobles
<i>Lady Destiny
Spiritual Officer</i>

30
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,320
<i>Advent God
Spiritual Officer
of all the nobles</i>

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,740
<i>Advent God
Spiritual Officer</i>

32
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:12,759
<i>Departure God
Spiritual Officer</i>

33
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,520
and ordinary people
<i>Departure God
Spiritual Officer</i>

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:14,740
<i>Departure God
Spiritual Officer</i>

35
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,119
and I

36
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,479
am her maid.

37
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,560
It's Advent God.

38
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,280
It's Departure God.

39
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,320
I envy them

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,119
for their popularity in Qingchuan.

41
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,840
They even have their own lanterns.

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,080
Don't look for him.

43
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,560
It's been over 800 years.

44
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,679
After so many lifetimes,

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,480
maybe your Mister Tao

46
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,400
is drinking with beauty in his arms.

47
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,360
So fragrant.

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,920
Someone's worshipping gods.

49
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,720
Come here.

50
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,320
Emperor of Lingyuan, please give my mother a long life.

51
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,240
Could I use the fire?

52
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,160
Spiritual Officer Ling Ge,

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,760
may you gain a good reputation in Qingchuan

54
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
and have your own lantern soon.

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,440
My umbrella.

56
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,640
Who was bold enough

57
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,679
to steal the Book of Destiny?

58
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,640
Advent, Departure.

59
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,820
<i>Emperor of Lingyuan
Spiritual Officer</i>

60
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,359
No.

61
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,640
Something is not right.

62
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,320
I can't find him in the Book.

63
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,440
Where is he?

64
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,060
Li Bugui

65
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,200
Why is the Book of Destiny here?

66
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,320
Your Majesty.

67
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,360
I've looked into it.
<i>Qingjing Hall of Lingyuan</i>

68
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:28,760
<i>Qingjing Hall of Lingyuan</i>

69
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
The one who stole the book
<i>Qingjing Hall of Lingyuan</i>

70
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,140
was Li Bugui.
<i>Qingjing Hall of Lingyuan</i>

71
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,760
was Li Bugui.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,960
He is a strong man

73
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,960
who is well aware of the deeds

74
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,520
and taboos of the Spiritual Officers.

75
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,080
It seems he still keeps the memories of his previous life.

76
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,920
Maybe he didn't drink the Lethe Water.

77
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,920
Who's in charge of it

78
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,760
in the Lethe Hall?

79
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,440
Your Majesty.

80
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,280
It's the Spiritual Officer who brought back the Book,

81
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,080
Meng Yo.

82
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,080
A hair of worries.

83
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,919
The silk of love is sheared.

84
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,840
Two lines of love tears.

85
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,480
The bond is crushed.

86
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,640
Three drops of sorrowful tears.

87
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,239
The affection of this life is dissolved.

88
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,920
Drink this water

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,320
and you may go.

90
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,600
So this is the Lethe Water

91
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,280
which may make people forget?

92
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,560
Yes.

93
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,760
Once you drink it,

94
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,320
all your emotions in the previous life will disappear.

95
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,640
Then you may go on.

96
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,400
Go on?

97
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,760
What shall I do?

98
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
My poor fiancée is still waiting for me

99
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
to marry her after I pass the test.

100
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,640
I didn't expect I'd meet the bandits on the way.

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,640
What shall she do alone in the future?

102
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,280
I can't forget her.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
Fine.

104
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,360
You're lucky to have met me today.

105
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,360
I can help you.

106
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,440
Don't be a fool.

107
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,880
There are tens of thousands of people in Lingyuan every day.

108
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,760
Can you help them all?

109
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,920
Meng Yo,

110
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,959
how many times have you done it?

111
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,440
If you ask me,

112
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,480
force them to drink it if they refuse.

113
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,919
They'll forget it anyway,

114
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,000
so why bother

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
to help them?

116
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm just trying to help as many as I can.

117
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,200
Spiritual Officer Meng Yo.

118
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,079
Yes.

119
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,520
You're summoned by His Majesty.

120
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Me?

121
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,240
Your Majesty?

122
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,760
The Spiritual Record shows

123
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,320
that you didn't let a man

124
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,560
drink the Lethe Water 20 years ago.

125
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,760
Do you know your crime?

126
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,680
Your Majesty,

127
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,640
it's been over 20 years,

128
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
so I can't remember it clearly.

129
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,040
In that case,

130
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
you will be banished to the Void

131
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,359
to ruin your soul.

132
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,320
Hold on.

133
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,160
Lady.

134
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,880
Your Majesty.

135
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,360
Meng Yo just forgot carelessly

136
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,160
to let that mortal drink it,

137
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,120
isn't the punishment too severe for her?

138
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,800
We may bring Li Bugui back

139
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,319
and let him drink the Lethe Water.

140
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
Bring him back?

141
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,319
It's easy to say.

142
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
The Scarlet Cloud is an ominous sign

143
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,120
which shows that Destiny is denied.

144
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,360
Li Bugui wasn't supposed to die,

145
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,200
so there will be serious troubles if we bring him back.

146
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,400
By that time,

147
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
not only Qingchuan's karma will be out of control,

148
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,480
but even Lingyuan will be in turbulence.

149
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,560
Your Majesty.

150
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,120
It's easy to punish Meng Yo,

151
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,880
but the Scarlet Cloud

152
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,920
won't disperse because of that.

153
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,240
So we should make Li Bugui drink the Lethe Water

154
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,040
to restore the order of Qingchuan.

155
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,840
Your Majesty.

156
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,800
I caused such an issue,

157
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,280
so let me make up for it.

158
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,640
If you send me to Qingchuan,

159
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
I'll look for a way

160
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,600
to make him drink the Water

161
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,040
without disturbing Qingchuan.

162
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,200
I can vouch for her.

163
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
If Meng Yo fails

164
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,200
to let him drink it within a hundred days,

165
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,280
I'm willing to be punished for her.

166
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,760
Please give her one more chance.

167
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,840
Please give her one more chance.

168
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,560
Please give her one more chance.

169
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,199
You...

170
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,160
Lady.

171
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,680
You...

172
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,439
What's going on?

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,520
Be careful.

174
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,480
Is it an earthquake?

175
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,040
Be careful.

176
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,120
Your Majesty.

177
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,200
It's her.

178
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,440
Once she cries,

179
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
the buildings around collapse.

180
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,800
What?

181
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,439
Let her stop.

182
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
You, don't cry.

183
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,840
Come on. Don't cry.

184
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,760
Just do as I say.

185
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,599
I can

186
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,360
send you there,

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,040
but

188
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,839
a hundred days is too many.

189
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,440
The Camouflage Beast

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,120
enables you

191
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,040
to live in Qingchuan like a mortal,

192
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,079
but you only have 49 days.

193
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,360
If you can make Li Bugui

194
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,720
drink the Water during that period,

195
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,920
I will pardon you.

196
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,520
But if you can't,

197
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,760
your Lady will be banished

198
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,320
to the Void.

199
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,360
As you

200
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,360
wish.

201
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,600
The outside

202
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
isn't like home.

203
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,520
Be careful

204
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,120
and keep your eyes sharp.

205
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,880
There is food

206
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,240
and mosquito repellent

207
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,160
in the basket.

208
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,280
It's dry in Qingchuan,

209
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,080
so I've prepared a water bag for you.

210
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,840
Girls need more water.

211
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,680
Okay.

212
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
There's also silver in your basket.

213
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,760
Use it.

214
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,120
Okay.

215
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,320
Lady,

216
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,520
what if I can't

217
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,439
handle that man?

218
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,400
How can a Spiritual Officer

219
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,920
not handle a mortal?

220
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,400
When you get there,

221
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,520
look for a chance

222
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,720
to force him to drink it.

223
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Don't always cry.

224
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,800
There are not so many good buildings in Qingchuan,

225
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,440
so keep them for that realm.

226
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,680
Okay.

227
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,719
It's dangerous there,

228
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,040
write to me when you are in danger.

229
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,880
Make it precise,

230
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,480
it's tiring for me to read at this age.

231
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,920
Lady. Sister.

232
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,480
Wait for me.

233
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,000
We will.

234
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,280
It's late.

235
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,439
Sweetheart, just go.

236
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
I'm leaving then.

237
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,280
Take care of yourself.

238
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,200
Be careful.

239
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,339
<i>Divine Well</i>

240
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,040
<i>God of Well
Spiritual Officer</i>

241
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,120
Where are you going?
<i>God of Well
Spiritual Officer</i>

242
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,200
<i>God of Well
Spiritual Officer</i>

243
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,140
Show me the document.
<i>God of Well
Spiritual Officer</i>

244
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,439
Show me the document.

245
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,520
I'm going to Qingchuan to look for Li Bugui.

246
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,800
Qingchuan?

247
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,080
This is an Individual passport

248
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,680
and it's a banishing one,

249
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,640
so you can't take so many things with you.

250
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,160
Huh?

251
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,840
But they are my supplies.

252
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,080
Enough.

253
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,719
Take the most important things

254
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
and leave the rest there.

255
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,760
All right then.

256
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,960
There are two wells around his home.

257
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,520
The northeast one is in his yard

258
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,199
and the southwest one is at the Town God Temple.

259
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,360
Which one do you choose?

260
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,200
It should be weird to get out

261
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,240
of the well in his yard.

262
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,960
I'll choose the southwest one.

263
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,319
Fine.

264
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,280
Stand by the well.

265
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,360
Close your eyes.

266
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,120
What are you waiting for?
