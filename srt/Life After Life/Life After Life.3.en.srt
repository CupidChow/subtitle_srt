00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 3
Poor girl cried because of the Lethe Water
A top entertainer teased Li Bugui.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,240
You...

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,520
You are not sleeping?

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,240
Who are you?

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,080
Me?

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,160
I...

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,040
I...

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,160
I...

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,199
I... I'm here to return the favor.

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,440
Favor?

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,200
Yes.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,400
Heroine, help.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,319
Help me.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,200
Come on. Help me.

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,080
Do you have

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,760
to return the favor on my bed?

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
I have to.

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,240
Since your bed

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,920
is so nice,

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,680
I'd like

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,320
to take a look.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,400
Well,

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,880
since everything is fine here,

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,919
I'm off then.

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,120
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,280
I didn't mean to do it.

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,160
This gourd...

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
That gourd is mine.

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,320
Could you

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,720
give it back to me?

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,440
What's in it?

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,600
It's...

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,680
It's hard to say.

37
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,239
Why don't

38
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,760
you take a sip?

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,840
If you don't tell me,

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,120
I'll dump it.

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,359
No.

42
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,040
I only take one gourd of it,

43
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,600
don't waste such a thing.

44
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
You...

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
No!

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,320
Lady.

47
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,959
My Water!

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,760
An earthquake?

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,880
Lady.

50
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,760
Don't come to Lingxiao Sect again.

51
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,800
Lady, I have arrived in Qingchuan

52
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,040
and am living at Town God Temple.

53
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,160
The Water was spilled.

54
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,560
Li Bugui hasn't lost his memories,

55
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,120
so could you make 5 liters of the Lethe Water

56
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,920
and send it here?

57
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,520
Hurry.

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,200
Give it to me.

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,560
The letter is sent to the Lethe Hall of Lingyuan.

60
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,040
Heroine, I'm sorry

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,600
for getting away last night.

62
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,079
I'm ashamed of that

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,119
Anyway,

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,520
if I had a physical body,

65
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
I'd do many things

66
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,520
and protect you.

67
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,520
Why don't you look for one?

68
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,719
Without the permission of Lingyuan,

69
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,800
the Spiritual Officers like me

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,240
can't use the others' bodies

71
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,320
in Qingchuan.

72
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,240
Besides, the living bodies, especially the men's,

73
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
have too much Yang Qi.

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Then what can I do

75
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,400
without support?

76
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,239
Well...

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,040
A letter arrived at the Town God Temple, Guangping.

78
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,760
There it is.

79
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,120
So soon.

80
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,799
Lass, as you know,

81
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,480
the Lethe Water

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,920
doesn't just need rare herbs,

83
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,760
but three things from Li Bugui.

84
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
There are no such things in Lingyuan.

85
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,640
Luckily, Li Bugui is in Qingchuan,

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,800
so you may take those materials

87
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,640
from him and mail them to me.

88
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,240
I'm waiting for your return.

89
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,080
Heroine, what do

90
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,040
we need from Li Bugui?

91
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,720
His hair,

92
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,360
blood and tears.

93
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,320
Huh?

94
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,600
Isn't it so hard

95
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,000
to get those things

96
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,360
from him?

97
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,240
Yes.

98
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,480
Show yourself.

99
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,520
You've become more cautious

100
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,200
since you robbed that spiritual officer.

101
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,520
Because

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,039
you didn't control your breath well.

103
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,400
<i>Shen Zhuoyue</i>

104
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,919
Have you no respect for your granny's sister?
<i>Shen Zhuoyue</i>

105
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,360
<i>Shen Zhuoyue</i>

106
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,660
Tell me
<i>Shen Zhuoyue</i>

107
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:11,960
Tell me

108
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,400
why you called me back.

109
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,440
Let me show you something.

110
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,800
I've found it recently.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,800
All the people who traded with Ji Bofeng on life expectancy

112
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,840
had this crane tattoo on their shoulders.

113
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Check it out

114
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,479
and look for the ones with it.

115
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,280
Once we find one person,

116
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,679
we may follow it

117
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,080
to look for Ji Bofeng.

118
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,480
Why don't you ask the girls

119
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,640
in brothels instead of me?

120
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,240
They even know

121
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,760
whose butt has a mole,

122
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,800
not to mention a tattoo.

123
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,400
I can write letters to the famous entertainers

124
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,960
of Guangping in your name

125
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,479
and invite them to Huancai Pavilion in three days.

126
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,440
Then won't it be more efficient

127
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,280
for you to ask them?

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,080
All right.

129
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,239
It seems

130
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,840
you had assassins yesterday.

131
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,160
Yes.

132
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,000
Could you clean up the yard for me?

133
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,599
Sure.

134
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,159
But...

135
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,120
But?

136
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,800
A person yesterday

137
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,280
seemed to be foolish,

138
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,560
so I didn't kill her.

139
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,200
Check her out for me.

140
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,520
Since what happened last time,

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
I'm sure Li Bugui has become more vigilant.

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,800
How do I get the things from him?

143
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,760
Heroine.

144
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,920
Heroine.

145
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,960
This is a good chance.

146
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,200
What?

147
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,640
I've just got the message

148
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,440
that Li Bugui will hold a feast and he has

149
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,080
invited six top entertainers

150
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,080
of Qingchuan.

151
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,400
Six?

152
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes.

153
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,360
Can he handle them?

154
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,239
It's inevitable

155
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,960
for a man to overestimate himself.

156
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,159
Don't worry,

157
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
I've made the arrangement.

158
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,120
There's a new entertainer in Liangye Pavilion

159
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,920
named Tingyun.

160
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,120
No one has seen her.

161
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,960
You may pretend to be her to go there.

162
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,720
A beauty's bed is a hero's grave.

163
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,280
Won't it be easier for you to do it in bed?

164
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,840
No, I can't do that.

165
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,640
Isn't it an easy thing? Look.

166
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,760
Mister, let's have fun.

167
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,880
I'm sure you are a fast learner.

168
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,800
Besides, I'm not telling you to sacrifice yourself.

169
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,719
You may take action

170
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,920
when you drink with him.

171
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,080
Even if we can't get his blood and tear,

172
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,799
we can get some hair.

173
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,720
Mister,

174
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,160
let's have fun.

175
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
Alas. I can't.

176
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,360
Besides, he saw me last night,

177
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,320
I'm sure he can recognize me.

178
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,480
No way.

179
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,560
What's the big deal?

180
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,199
You didn't tell him who you were yesterday.

181
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,480
Just tell him you are Tingyun,

182
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,680
the top entertainer of Liangye Pavilion.

183
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,480
Top entertainer?

184
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,800
Me?

185
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
Jin Qiao'er of Huancai Pavilion has arrived.

186
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,120
Jin Lv'er of Yichun House has arrived.

187
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,280
Jin Chou'er of Chunying House has arrived.

188
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,680
Hua Nu'er of Yanyun Pavilion has arrived.

189
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,400
Zhu Hongshang of Baihua House has arrived.

190
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,319
Master Li.

191
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,840
I'm sure you have invited us here so early

192
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,320
for some business.

193
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,960
Is everyone here?

194
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,439
There is one missing.

195
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,560
Who?

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,240
Liangye Pavilion's top entertainer, Tingyun.

197
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,920
When did she come back?

198
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,960
Xie Lian?

199
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,400
Heroine, good luck.

200
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,480
I have to go.

201
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,319
It must be so hurt.

202
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,079
I even pity her.

203
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,959
You again?
