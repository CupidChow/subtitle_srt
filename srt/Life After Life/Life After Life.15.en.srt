Episode 15
Meng Yo stabbed Li
Li will marry Meng for her reputation

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,080
Master.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,959
There is

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,920
only one month left for you.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,840
Did you complete the mission

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,599
as I ordered?

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,640
Master.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,480
I helped Meng Yo to get the tears,

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,160
but that lass

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,599
didn't do it.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,520
I'm afraid she is in love with him.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,480
Humph.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,560
Even an alien prince

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,120
was attracted by you before,

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,960
why did you

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,440
fail to seduce

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,080
a mere lass?

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,080
Master.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,080
Maybe I came too late

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,920
so Li Bugui had gained her heart already.

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,080
Looking for excuses?

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,560
Are you bored

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,040
of living?

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,040
Please spare me.

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,360
Please have mercy.

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,039
Master, I have a plan

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,119
to make Meng Yo

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,480
give up Li Bugui.

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,280
Li Bugui.

33
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,920
Li Bugui.

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,640
What to do?

35
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,680
Li Bugui.

36
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,280
Lady Meng.

37
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,480
Ji Bofeng?

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,200
Don't be afraid.

39
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,520
I'm here to thank you.

40
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,200
That man

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,280
hunted me for so many years

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,160
and I sent so many men

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,680
to kill him but in vain.

44
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,039
To think

45
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,520
he was killed by you.

46
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,959
Ha-ha.

47
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,720
In that case,

48
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,640
you have saved me.

49
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,560
Mister Zhang.

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,400
Please take me out of here.

51
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,280
I managed to lure you here,

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,600
how could I take you away soon?

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,160
You...

54
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,200
You work for Ji Bofeng?

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,120
Not yet.

56
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,160
After I kill you,

57
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,560
I can finish the deal with him.

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,399
The beauty's tears could be the hero's bane.

59
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,640
Now the hero is dead,

60
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,840
how shall we deal with the beauty?

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,040
How about

62
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,000
giving her to you?

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,880
I don't want a woman

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,400
without chastity.

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,760
See? Even he rejected you.

66
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,400
Since nobody wants her,

67
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,920
we shall only

68
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
kill her.

69
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,200
Kill her.

70
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,640
Kill her

71
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,640
and gain 100 years of life.

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,200
You mean it?

73
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,480
Of course.

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,160
Lady Meng,

75
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,519
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,640
We have to be a couple

77
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,960
in the next life.

78
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,799
Don't you even think about it.

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
Li Bugui?

80
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,680
You are not dead?

81
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,480
Ji Bofeng.

82
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
It's time to put an end

83
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,240
to our two-generation grudge.

84
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,280
Impossible.

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,120
Absolutely impossible.

86
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,200
I did...

87
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,039
I did see you were poisoned by her Intercourse Perfume

88
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,440
and then were stabbed by her.

89
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,480
You didn't do homework

90
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,320
before taking action?

91
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,920
Li Buguo knows

92
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,520
all the poisons

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,840
and can't be hurt by any of them.

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,840
We were just defeating you

95
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,320
in your own game.

96
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,359
A game?

97
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
Lady Meng,

98
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,000
you have ruined your reputation.

99
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,599
I will be responsible for her, of course.

100
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,440
Ji Bofeng.

101
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,960
Die.

102
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,720
How could there be the spell of Lingyuan here?

103
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,480
Li Bugui.

104
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,760
Kill me.

105
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,159
Compared to being tortured by the disease for ten days,

106
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,800
a quick death from you would be merciful.

107
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,160
Ha-ha.

108
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,600
As you wish.

109
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,120
Mister Zhang.

110
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,400
Are you really ill?

111
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,440
Lady Meng.

112
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,840
You are the woman in my dream.

113
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,040
If I didn't have this incurable disease,

114
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,280
how would I have helped Ji Bofeng to hurt you?

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,920
Little Gourd, don't trust him.

116
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,120
He hurt you,

117
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,080
yet you want to let him go?

118
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,880
He will die one day,

119
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,040
but I don't

120
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,120
want you to kill more people.

121
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,039
If a man kills too many people,

122
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,720
he will be sent to Void when he dies.

123
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,520
He is doomed,

124
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,320
so leave him be.

125
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,120
Don't let me see you in Guangping again.

126
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,480
Get lost.

127
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,840
Li Bugui.

128
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,440
Did I really stab you?

129
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,600
I was almost scared to death when you fell.

130
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,000
Little Gourd.

131
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,160
I will hide a bag

132
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,280
of pig blood here later,

133
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,920
do you have the guts to stab me?

134
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,640
What if I can't stab it accurately?

135
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,839
I'm entrusting you with my life

136
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,800
and I trust you.

137
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,800
Okay.

138
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,680
How did you know

139
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,760
I wouldn't hurt you?

140
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,520
Because I knew

141
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,640
you didn't want me to die.

142
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,040
Greetings, Madam Li.

143
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,280
Will you give birth

144
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,840
to a little demon in a couple of days,

145
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,200
Madam Li?

146
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,520
Madam Li... Madam Li?

147
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
If you don't do it,

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,520
you will really become Madam Li.

149
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,680
Xie, I have made up my mind.

150
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,200
For Lady and myself,

151
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,719
I have

152
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,199
to make Li Bugui drink it today.

153
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,960
Are you sure?

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,480
Yes!

155
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,920
You will go to his home with me tonight.

156
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,680
All right.

157
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
Let me prepare for it.

158
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,440
Okay.

159
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,680
Lady,

160
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,400
please let me make it tonight.

161
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,680
Yes!

162
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,200
Brother Shuanzi,

163
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,520
this is my cousin Xie Lian.

164
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,240
Nice to meet you.

165
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,520
All right.

166
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,600
Look, Bugui...

167
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,160
Greetings.

168
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,600
It's fine. Please.

169
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,160
This is the good wine from my hometown.

170
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,720
I got this for you.

171
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,160
It tastes

172
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,600
so good.

173
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,680
Then let's have a good drink.

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,080
I propose a good toast to you.

175
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,040
May you be immune to any harm and poisons,

176
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,800
and always have guts.

177
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,240
Also thank you for saving me numerous times.

178
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,600
Then he can't drink it.

179
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,240
Shuanzi isn't immune to the poisons,

180
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,040
he just manages to bear them.

181
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,560
Including

182
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,000
the Intercourse Perfume?

183
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,120
Then let me...

184
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,240
Little Gourd, no need to toast.

185
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,920
I'd like to tell you something.

186
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,160
This is the jade bracelet left by my mother.

187
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm giving it to you now.

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,400
I know what you want to say,

189
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,440
but

190
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,120
just wait.

191
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,240
Why?

192
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,040
I don't think you have to be responsible for me

193
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,160
because of their words.

194
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,240
What if I mean it?

195
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,880
Little Gourd,

196
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,800
would you

197
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,319
marry me?

198
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,760
I...

199
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,680
Master, someone came to send presents.

200
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
Please go to the guest hall.

201
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,760
I'll be there later.

202
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,719
It's said to be

203
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,560
of great importance.

204
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,719
Please see him now.

205
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,400
Wait for me a while.

206
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,640
I'll be right back.

207
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,960
Okay.

208
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,680
Let's eat then.

209
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,200
Okay.

210
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,720
Yue, eat a shrimp.

211
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,200
Who sent it?

212
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,959
A woman,

213
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,000
but she left already.

214
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,960
I see. You may leave.

215
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes.

216
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,959
The Officers of Lingyuan.

217
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,160
The dishes here are all tasty.

218
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,040
Let's eat more.

219
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,319
The big hero came back.

220
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,440
So,

221
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,880
what treasure have you seen?

222
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,280
Nothing.

223
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,760
Just a small gift.

224
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,640
So mysterious.

225
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,840
Shouldn't you have a drink

226
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,600
as the punishment for leaving so long?

227
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,760
I want to know

228
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,120
what kind of good wine is in your gourd.

229
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,760
Let me taste it.

230
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,840
Don't touch my stuff.

231
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,640
Why?

232
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,480
I insist.

233
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,800
Can't I deal with you?

234
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,959
Shuanzi, stop him.

235
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,520
Why do you two

236
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,920
have the same flower tattoos?

237
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,160
Well...

238
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,719
Yes.

239
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,800
My whole family have it.

240
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,040
Yes.

241
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,360
What a coincidence!

242
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,360
Little Gourd, will you be free tonight?

243
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,520
Why?

244
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,240
Come to my chamber.

245
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,760
I have a good thing to show you.

246
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,680
Okay.

247
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,120
Shuanzi.

248
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,319
Nice trick.

249
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,800
Brother Shuanzi.

250
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,719
Hi there.

251
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,320
Hi.

252
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,839
Look,

253
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,359
it's the present I have received.

254
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,200
It's said

255
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,600
that all Spiritual Officers of Lingyuan

256
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,080
are on it.

257
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,720
Do you like it?
