Life After Life

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 9
Used onions and mugwort to get Bugui's tears
Tried to move Li Bugui by lighting sky lanterns

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,520
I'm so healthy

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,440
that I don't need it.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
I'm sure you do.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,160
You do.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,320
Do it again

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,520
and I'll drag you in to bathe with me.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,640
Huh?

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,720
I'll stop then...

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,400
Get out.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,040
All right.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,800
Brother Shuanzi.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,320
What now?

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,720
It's mugwort.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,400
I've learned that you can't sleep well,

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,440
Using it for fumigation

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,960
may improve your sleep quality.

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,360
Why not

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,320
try it?

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,360
So?

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,200
Are your eyes swollen?

25
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,679
Enough.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,520
I'm almost choked.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,399
Why are you still alright?

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,080
I practiced my eyes

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
in case I'd be attacked by surprise.

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,039
Huh?

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,560
Brother Shuanzi, I'm sleepy.

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
So I'm going to sleep.

33
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,320
Since you've smoked me for so long

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,040
and there are many mosquitoes,

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,360
you will stay to drive them off.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,640
Stand straight.

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,840
Don't move.

38
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,680
Li Bugui.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,680
When will you

40
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,600
shed tears for me?

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,760
What are you talking about?

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,880
She's really carrying my hair.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,000
Did she tell me the truth?

44
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,560
Is it possible

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,680
that she gets close to you for no reason special

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,560
or she just loves you?

47
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,720
The matter you told me to do is done.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,440
So we may have some peace.

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:17,840
Okay.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,880
Thank you.

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,120
Brother Shuanzi.

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
Why did you get up so early?

53
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,960
I haven't made breakfast for you.

54
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,280
You put me through it all night,

55
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,160
are you done?

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,240
Things go on so quickly between you.

57
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,720
No, Lady Shen...

58
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,240
Look, you two carry on.

59
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,680
I'll come later.

60
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,520
No, Lady Shen...

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
I need to read.

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,520
You may go back.

63
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,560
Okay.

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,240
Brother Shuanzi.

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,320
Are you fond of reading?

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,720
Not your business.

67
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,920
My sister and I cried bitterly

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,160
when we listened to Lady's stories.

69
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,880
Since Shuanzi loves reading,

70
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,920
he may be moved by the plots in books.

71
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,480
Brother Shuanzi.

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,560
I heard that the tea house of Guangping was lively.

73
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,720
As a newcomer, I'd like to see it.

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,960
Could you go with me?

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,080
I'm busy.

76
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,720
Okay.

77
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,039
I'm going there alone.

78
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,280
Maybe Ji Bofeng

79
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,520
is waiting for me in the dark

80
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,880
and he will

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,960
rush out to kill me with one strike

82
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,400
when I'm alone.

83
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,840
Then,

84
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,160
remember to bury me

85
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,440
when you have time.

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
How long do you need?

87
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,200
Soon.

88
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,200
Please enjoy.

89
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,080
Thank you.

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,040
You shouldn't have ordered so many.

91
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,360
I want you to have no excuse to come again.

92
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,599
Eat now quickly.

93
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,400
Then we leave.

94
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:11,960
Fine.

95
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,680
It's tasty.

96
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:35,960
You...

97
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,799
Are you my match?

98
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,320
I...

99
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,080
Something was on your lips.

100
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,080
Look,

101
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,320
the storyteller

102
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,120
is the best in Guangping.

103
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,240
Listen to him carefully.

104
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,000
Thank you for coming.

105
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,360
Thank you for coming.

106
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,040
Today,

107
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,919
I'm going to tell you the story of Li Bugui,

108
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,800
the Master of Lingxiao Sect.

109
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,560
It's your story.

110
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,200
Li Bugui is the reincarnation of a demon.

111
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,680
On the day he was born,

112
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,760
Guangping's sky was covered by bloody clouds

113
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,919
as if it were a catastrophe.

114
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Indeed,

115
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,280
he got his parents killed

116
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,440
on the third day after his birth.

117
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,600
Others raise sons for retirement,

118
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,000
but his parents raised him to be killed.

119
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,119
More horribly,

120
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
when he became an adult,

121
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,360
36 people of his clan

122
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,360
were all slaughtered by him.

123
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,680
Henceforth,

124
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,800
the seed of butchery was rooted deeply

125
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,520
in his heart.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,360
Sit.

127
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,600
Having enjoyed the fun of killing,

128
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,080
Li Bugui couldn't stop it.

129
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,280
No matter if it was an old person or a child,

130
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,919
he killed that person

131
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,800
as long as he didn't

132
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,080
like him or her.

133
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,720
Guangping has been filled

134
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,480
with blood and corpses henceforth

135
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,920
and the people are like

136
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,040
living in nightmares.

137
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,280
If I were Li Bugui,

138
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,479
I'd kill myself for the crimes.

139
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,560
That man has a snake's heart

140
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,960
and a wolf's nature,

141
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
so he will be hated

142
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,880
by gods and people.

143
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,000
Everyone wants to kill him.

144
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:26,880
Hey.

145
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,880
Don't talk nonsense.

146
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,919
Those 36 people

147
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,960
were killed by someone else.

148
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,720
It had nothing to do with Li Bugui.

149
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,080
Besides, he is pitiful enough

150
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,239
to have lost his family,

151
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,720
why are you slandering him?

152
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,479
Little girl, what do you know?

153
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,120
Everyone in Guangping knows

154
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,480
how vile and bloody-thirsty Li Bugui is.

155
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,960
He's not such a man.

156
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,120
Don't you talk nonsense.

157
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,600
Well, well, this is

158
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,360
such a rare thing.

159
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,760
To think someone's speaking up for Li Bugui.

160
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,520
Girl.

161
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,640
Are you his lover?

162
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,679
Anyway,

163
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,280
the Li Bugui I know

164
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,799
isn't such a man.

165
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,440
You know him?

166
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,320
Did I guess it right?

167
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,640
Then you shall be careful.

168
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,280
Or your entire family will be killed.

169
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,960
Maybe

170
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
you already slept

171
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,520
with him?

172
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,919
Ha-ha.

173
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,960
The cool water...

174
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,400
Chills the purple grapes.

175
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
You...

176
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,640
Li Bugui, what have you done?

177
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,760
You are Li Bugui?

178
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,799
Good.

179
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,360
You said it so well.

180
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,760
Since you said I was brutal,

181
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,880
let me show you

182
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,800
what true brutality is.

183
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,440
No.

184
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,480
Li Bugui is killing people.

185
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,880
Li Bugui is killing people.

186
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,000
Hey, you...

187
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,880
Will you still eat?

188
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,079
I...

189
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,840
Why did you speak up for me just now?

190
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,560
Because they were wrong.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,600
I know

192
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,839
you're not such a man.

193
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,480
Don't think you know me

194
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,439
because we've met for a few days.

195
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
I do know many things about you,

196
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,680
even more than you think I do.

197
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,720
Alas.

198
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,520
I thought

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
my childhood was miserable enough,

200
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,880
but compared with yours...

201
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,800
Childhood?

202
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,880
Yes.

203
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,880
I usually cried when I was a kid,

204
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,600
but when I cried,

205
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
the buildings around me collapsed.

206
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,120
So my parents forbade me

207
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,880
to cry.

208
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,040
If only I could be as indifferent

209
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,040
as you.

210
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,719
Actually,

211
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,199
you cry

212
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,360
because you care about some people.

213
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,120
Don't you have someone to care about?

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,960
Not even one?

215
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,000
I've forgotten the feeling of care.

216
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,200
Then does it hurt

217
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,880
when you are upset?

218
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,400
Do you want to shed tears

219
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,880
when it hurts?

220
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,120
My heart doesn't hurt

221
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,520
and I don't shed tears.

222
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,040
Okay.

223
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,199
Wow.

224
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,560
Sky lanterns!

225
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,600
Come on.

226
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,239
Li Bugui.

227
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,560
Why don't you make a wish?

228
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,840
I never spend my wish

229
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,600
on such a thing.

230
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,440
It doesn't matter if you believe it.

231
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,079
The point

232
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,680
is the feeling of hope

233
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,880
when you see the lantern rising.

234
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,040
Have you felt it?

235
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,320
I don't need it.

236
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,199
Li Bugui,

237
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
don't tell me you've never

238
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,440
made a wish.

239
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,079
Wait here.

240
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,560
Why are you looking at me?

241
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,320
Make a wish now.

242
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,720
Okay.

243
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
Have you made it?

244
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,400
So, do you feel the new hope,

245
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,360
just like everything

246
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,160
will be alright tomorrow?

247
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,520
No.

248
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,360
How could it be?

249
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
It's like

250
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,720
something warm

251
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,720
is rising

252
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,119
here.

253
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,200
Can you feel it?

254
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,520
No.

255
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,520
Li Bugui has such a pathetic past,

256
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,560
no wonder he doesn't cry.

257
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,839
If I am kind to him

258
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,720
and make him feel warm,

259
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,080
will he weep?

260
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,520
Yes.

261
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,920
I'll start by being kind to him.
