Life After Life

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 7
Shen Zhuoyue learned the truth
Li Bugui showed up to save Little Gourd

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,480
Will you tell me

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,240
the reason you took my blood now?

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,440
Blood?

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,320
What blood?

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,280
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,280
Didn't you try to get close to me

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,839
by sucking my wound

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,160
and swearing to be my sister

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,960
because you wanted my blood?

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,440
- I... - Wow.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,279
So the wound on your neck

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,560
was caused by Little Gourd.

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,320
When were you together?

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,680
So that bowl of blood was Li Bugui's.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,840
Why did you tell me it was snake blood?

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,040
It was a metaphor.

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,000
So you two have already...

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,560
Oh.

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,120
It happened at Huancai Pavilion?

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,239
I was wondering

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,080
why you were so kind

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,000
to her.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,800
- No.- No.

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,080
So consistent.

29
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,000
Little Gourd.

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,240
If you don't tell me,

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,880
I'll pour this bowl of blood.

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,560
Brother, you can't do that.

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,640
Why?

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,320
Why?

35
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,960
Why...

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,400
Why...

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,080
Come on.

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,280
Just lower your sword

39
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,720
and listen to me.

40
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,920
That is

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,400
an arcane art from abroad.

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,040
Since I'm too fragile,

43
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,679
I need a strong man's blood

44
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,000
to save my weak body.

45
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,360
But

46
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,720
I do want

47
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,360
to be your sworn sister.

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,440
Fragile?

49
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
You look so lively.

50
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,839
I just pretend to be so.

51
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,520
In fact,

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,160
I am dying.

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,680
What's that?

54
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,080
This

55
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,440
is my flower of life.

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,280
It shows up

57
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,040
on my arm just because I'm too weak.

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,120
Once the flower disappears,

59
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,040
my life is gone.

60
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,360
So, brother,

61
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,200
please

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,040
let me drink the blood.

63
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
I'll be fine after drinking it.

64
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,760
Fine.

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,240
Drink it up right in front of me.

66
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,400
Thank you, brother.

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,800
Brother.

68
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,280
If there's no business else,

69
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,880
I'm going back to rest.

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,040
That lass

71
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,320
may have some reasons.

72
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,000
Let me follow her to check it out?

73
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,720
No.

74
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,519
She has eaten the Bettle Pearls of Blood,

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,280
so I can

76
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,840
observe her anytime.

77
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,560
So, heroine?

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,160
What are you looking for?

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,520
I was almost suffocated.

80
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,040
It was so close.

81
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,799
You got it?

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,399
Yes.

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,200
However,

84
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
I think I swallowed something.

85
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,240
Though I have got this,

86
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,960
Li Bugui is suspecting me now,

87
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,040
so it will be harder

88
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,440
to get his tears.

89
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,359
Don't worry.

90
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,160
As long as we can find Li Bugui's soft spot,

91
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,120
it's just a matter of time to get it.

92
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,519
Aren't you familiar

93
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,440
with Lady Shen?

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,160
Well,

95
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,160
we are just ordinary friends.

96
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,640
Humph.

97
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
Could you

98
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,080
tell this ordinary friend of yours

99
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,000
to help us?

100
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,040
To do what?

101
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,079
Master.

102
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,919
I've found out that Meng Yo

103
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,559
is living at Town God Temple in Guangping.

104
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,800
No wonder she could find me.

105
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,520
It proves that the Town God helped her.

106
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,360
He's a mere local Spiritual Officer.

107
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,520
Don't worry.

108
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,280
I'm afraid she may jeopardize our plan.

109
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Even an insect will die

110
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,520
as long as

111
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,080
it's in our way.

112
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,280
Since they've arrived in Qingchuan,

113
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,720
they can no longer

114
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,360
make the call.

115
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,760
Aren't you a celebrated man

116
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,039
because of your military achievements?

117
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,599
Then why did you condescend to come?

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,360
Yue,

119
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,200
today,

120
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,479
let's put our relationship aside.

121
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,320
I need to ask you something serious.

122
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,239
Do you know

123
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,360
what

124
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,720
makes Li Bugui the saddest?

125
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,840
I do.

126
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,840
One hundred taels of silver

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,040
for one question.

128
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,080
Are you robbing me?

129
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,120
We are not that close.

130
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,640
Shouldn't you pay me for what I do?

131
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,480
Understood.

132
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,680
Heroine, give me the money.

133
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,479
Huh?

134
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,880
How do I have the money?

135
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,400
So I will pay for it?

136
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,680
Fine. Come.

137
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,480
Feel free to take the money from the Merit Box.

138
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,440
Xie Lian, shame on you.

139
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,280
How dare you take Town God's money?

140
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,760
Xie Lian.

141
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,440
Why couldn't I touch you?

142
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,840
What are you talking about?

143
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,880
How couldn't you touch me?

144
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,200
How did you become this?

145
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,159
What a mess.

146
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,760
Why did you expose me?

147
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,840
Didn't you fight on the battlefield?

148
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,080
How did you become a Town God?

149
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,560
Because I died in the battle

150
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,840
and went to another world.

151
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,560
You could see me

152
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,200
thanks to your Yin-Yang Eyes.

153
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,599
What about her?

154
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,800
Why could she see you, too?

155
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,120
She has the same eyes.

156
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,480
How could there be so many Yin-Yang Eyes?

157
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,360
Nonsense.

158
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,799
Unless...

159
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,080
Unless you are also a Spiritual Officer.

160
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,400
Li Bugui didn't drink Lethe Water,

161
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,919
so you came to catch him.

162
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,280
You've been lying to me.

163
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,440
I'm going to tell Li Bugui.

164
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,840
Lady Shen, listen to me.

165
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,880
Xie Lian, you bastard. Let me go.

166
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,400
Xie Lian. You jerk. Let me go.

167
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,560
Yue.

168
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,080
Calm down and listen to me.

169
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,719
I know

170
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,560
you hate me.

171
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,239
But I didn't

172
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,160
have a choice before.

173
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,200
I should

174
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,799
be blamed for being unable

175
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,680
to take care of you.

176
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,280
I was just an ordinary man.

177
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,240
Then I went to war.

178
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,720
After that,

179
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,760
I could only ignore you.

180
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
As you can see,

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm a Spiritual Officer

182
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,360
and you're still in Qingchuan.

183
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,960
So we are in different worlds.

184
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
If I get close to you,

185
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,960
I can only bring disasters to you.

186
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,199
Therefore,

187
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,439
what you need

188
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,120
is a man

189
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,679
you can see and touch

190
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,040
to spend your life with.

191
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,280
In fact,

192
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,520
I'm working so hard now

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,400
so I can be with you

194
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,720
and carry on our love

195
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,720
someday.

196
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,040
Look, I'm sorry

197
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,400
for this.

198
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,680
What...

199
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,880
What are you doing?

200
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,120
Ah!

201
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,360
You...

202
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,000
Why are you doing this?

203
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,120
Let's go.

204
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,080
Xie Lian.

205
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,920
Come on.

206
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,840
The lass cries so easily.

207
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,280
She shed the tears

208
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,000
soon after I talked to her.

209
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,360
It seems she loves you sincerely.

210
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,280
Don't be so cruel to her.

211
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,079
You have no idea.

212
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Things can never

213
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,680
work out

214
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,960
between us,

215
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,840
so I'd better let her give up.

216
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,360
Then she may start a new life.

217
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,560
To think Shen Zhuoyue will drink the Water

218
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,400
before Li Bugui does.

219
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,359
Heroine, keep the dose well

220
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,319
and just let her forget what happened today.

221
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,880
How do I keep it?

222
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,680
I'm sure you can do it since you're from Lingyuan.

223
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,040
But I don't...

224
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,240
They're here to kill you. Run.

225
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,960
What about you?

226
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,120
They can't see me. Don't worry.

227
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,800
No. Shen Zhuoyue is still in there.

228
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,479
Untie her now.

229
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,160
Let me go.

230
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,080
Hurry.

231
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,680
Easy.

232
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,400
Why are you still here?

233
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,680
To take a look at you.

234
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,000
Get lost.

235
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:45,880
No problem.

236
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,560
Lady Shen.

237
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,120
I'm sorry

238
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,280
for implicating you today.

239
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,120
Don't be.

240
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,680
You saved me.

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,920
I owe you.

242
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,360
How's your wound?

243
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,880
It's fine.

244
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,560
Why can I touch you?

245
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
You're really not a Spiritual Officer?

246
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,199
I...
