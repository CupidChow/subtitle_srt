00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 14
Meng Yo quit feeding Bugui with the Lethe Water
Bugui couldn't control himself and forcibly kissed Meng Yo

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,559
Alas.

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,600
Xie,

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,000
why are you blushing?

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,680
You accepted Lady Shen?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,720
We...

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,400
It's good you've come around.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
Lady Shen

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,880
is a nice person

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,520
though she is ill-fated

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,200
to fall in love with you, a Spiritual Officer.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,680
What is this?

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,960
Hey.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,960
It's soaked by Li Bugui's tears.

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,160
You've got it?

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,120
That's right.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,240
As we expected.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,480
Since you made him cry,

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,360
why didn't you take a bowl

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,679
or a basin to catch the tears?

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,399
I did take one,

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,080
but he was crying so bitterly

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,280
that I didn't have the heart to catch the tears.

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,720
Anyway,

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
the materials are all collected.

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,479
So there won't be a problem.

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,279
I wonder how Lady is.

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,720
It took me so many days

32
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,640
to get all the stuff for Lethe Water.

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,360
It seems

34
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,960
Li Bugui trusts you now

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,520
and eats all the things you give him.

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,840
I guess

37
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,759
you may soon return to Lingyuan.

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,080
Well, I'm reluctant

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,039
to let you leave now.

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,800
Yes.

41
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,080
I can finally go back to Lingyuan.

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,320
But

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,760
why does my heart feel empty?

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,440
You used to introduce the things

45
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,600
you cooked for me before,

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,720
why don't you do it today?

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,280
This is called

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,040
Forgetness Soup.

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,560
Forgetness Soup?

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,679
It's so tasty

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,920
that it may make you forget your worries.

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,160
I see.

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,400
It's a nice name.

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,200
Let me try it then.

55
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,320
Li Bugui,

56
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,399
is there anything else

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,560
you want to do

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
except take revenge?

59
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,440
Anything else I want to do?

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,160
Yes.

61
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,800
I hope you don't

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,240
meet Zhang Shen again.

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,760
I'm sure he has designs on you.

64
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,720
No.

65
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,359
I'm not letting you talk about me,

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,680
but yourself.

67
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
What do you want to do?

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,360
My own business?

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,679
I don't want

70
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
to see you flirting

71
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,400
with Zhang Shen again.

72
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,000
You...

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're so childish.

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,400
Come on.

75
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,960
I'm satisfied already

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,240
since you managed to let me

77
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,000
see my parents.

78
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,920
I wronged you before.

79
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,520
Little Gourd,

80
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,959
thank you.

81
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,120
Why are you crying?

82
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,560
Li Bugui,

83
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,280
if you find out

84
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,760
one day

85
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,800
that I'm not myself,

86
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,880
what will you do?

87
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,560
What are you talking about?

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,160
Little Gourd, just remember

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,720
that I'll show up in front of you at once

90
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,000
no matter what happens in the future.

91
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,200
So worry about nothing,

92
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,560
all right?

93
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't cry.

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,400
Brother Shuanzi.

95
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,160
It's a bit cold.

96
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,599
Let me heat it up for you.

97
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,520
It's fine.

98
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,720
I can drink the cold one.

99
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,400
If you don't do it now,

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
I don't know when you'll have the next chance.

101
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,400
Says who?

102
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,600
Isn't there still time?

103
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,360
Love is such a mysterious thing in the world.

104
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,640
I'm alright with it

105
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,560
since I've decided to be with Yue.

106
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,600
But you,

107
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,480
you have to save your Lady

108
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
and the whole Lingyuan.

109
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,840
Alas. I know it.

110
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,159
I'll try to find a better chance.

111
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,360
Anyway,

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,200
not today.

113
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,760
Mister Zhang.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,920
Thank you for the mirror.

115
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,160
I should apologize to you

116
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,040
for leaving in a hurry that day.

117
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,799
It's the past,

118
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,000
so forget it.

119
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,200
Whether the love

120
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,599
in the previous life was true,

121
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,880
it passed already.

122
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,520
Tomorrow

123
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm going back to Yuling Villa.

124
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,760
Please take care of yourself.

125
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,680
Mister Zhang,

126
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,760
you are leaving here?

127
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,640
Yes.

128
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,160
Then I wish you

129
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
every success

130
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,799
and happiness in marrying a beauty

131
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,280
Thank you.

132
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,560
You guessed it right.

133
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,159
Zhang Shen is a suspicious man.

134
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,440
There is a young master

135
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,480
named Zhang Shen in Yuling Villa,

136
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,000
but he has been so fragile

137
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,400
that he couldn't bear the sunlight and the wind,

138
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,400
so how could he come to our home

139
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,840
as a strong man?

140
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,679
It seems

141
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,040
the fish bit the hook.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,600
You.

143
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,599
Master.

144
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,320
Where is Little Gourd?

145
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,000
She left early

146
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,120
and didn't come back.

147
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,440
Where did she go?

148
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
It's found in her chamber.

149
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,840
Huancai Pavilion?

150
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,520
By the way,

151
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
it's Rose Dew made by me

152
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,920
which may moisten the skin.

153
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,880
Okay.

154
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,840
I was going to give it to you

155
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,280
after eating the affectionate fruit.

156
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,880
But now,

157
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,320
just take it as a souvenir.

158
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,960
Do I have the honor

159
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,160
to let you try it?

160
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,760
Well...

161
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,480
Though the dew is fresh and sweet,

162
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,599
it shall be used properly

163
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,840
to take effect.

164
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,440
I just want

165
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,640
to show you the details.

166
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,280
Okay.

167
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,760
All right.

168
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,320
Here.

169
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,280
Like this?

170
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,719
Ah!

171
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,560
Alas.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,320
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,200
It's fine.

174
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,080
Lady Meng.

175
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,920
So our relationship

176
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,040
has ended indeed.

177
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,920
Since it is so,

178
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,960
I shall no longer keep you.

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,080
Mister.

180
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,520
Come.

181
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
Let's have fun, mister.

182
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,640
Come on in, mister.

183
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,560
Come on in.

184
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,200
Alas. Mister.

185
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,440
Li Bugui?

186
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,079
Why did he come here?

187
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,640
Huancai Pavilion

188
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,960
is a place for fops to have fun,

189
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,880
I'm sure

190
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,400
he has come here for pleasure.

191
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,760
It seems

192
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,040
Master Li isn't a good choice for you, either.

193
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,319
Please take care of yourself.

194
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,280
I am taking my leave.

195
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,240
Okay.

196
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,880
Hold on.

197
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,719
Lady.

198
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,680
Here's a letter for you.

199
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,000
For me?

200
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,319
Okay. Thank you.

201
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,080
Little Gourd, I have found the whereabouts of Ji Bofeng.

202
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,480
I'll wait for you at Huancai Pavilion. Come now.

203
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,480
Gui.

204
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,560
Little Gourd.

205
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,920
You came because Zhang Shen told you to come.

206
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,160
Aren't you growing bolder?

207
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,040
Zhang Shen?

208
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,080
Didn't you call me here?

209
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,560
See it yourself.

210
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,320
It's fishy.

211
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,800
What's that smell on you?

212
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,960
It's Rose Dew.

213
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,560
Zhang Shen gave it to me

214
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,520
and I spilled it on my carelessly.

215
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,880
Leave now.

216
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,960
Leave?

217
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,280
Li Bugui.

218
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,800
What's wrong?

219
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,680
I'm telling you to go.

220
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,880
Can't you understand it?

221
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,680
How could I just leave you be?

222
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,920
You don't feel well?

223
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,439
Tell me.

224
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,320
Don't scare me.

225
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,320
Li Bugui.

226
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,960
You are hurting me.

227
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,280
It's the Intercourse Perfume.

228
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,640
The Intercourse Perfume?

229
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,000
It's an aphrodisiac.

230
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,319
Go now.

231
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,400
An aphrodisiac?

232
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
I've been cautious all my life,

233
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,199
and now to think they put the drug on you.

234
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,960
I'm sorry. I was careless.

235
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,959
Li Bugui.

236
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,640
You are so strong,

237
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,120
you can resist it, can't you?

238
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,160
Don't think too highly of me.

239
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,840
Li Bugui.

240
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,640
Don't do this. You're not such a man.

241
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,520
Little Gourd.

242
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,680
You know why they

243
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
call me a demon?

244
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
Little Gourd.

245
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,800
Little Gourd, listen to me.

246
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,520
Don't touch me.

247
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,000
Little Gourd.

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,560
Don't touch me.

249
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,719
Okay. I won't.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,880
It was my fault.

251
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,640
I couldn't control myself.

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,080
I can do anything

253
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,840
to make up for you.

254
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,680
I'm sorry.

255
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,680
I'm so sorry.

256
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,720
Stay away.

257
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,240
Don't come any closer.

258
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,520
Little Gourd,

259
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,439
we've been through so many things.

260
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,079
If...

261
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,959
If I hadn't met you that day,

262
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,160
I wouldn't have suffered those things,

263
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,079
not to mention what happened today.

264
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,840
Li Bugui.

265
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,880
I hate you.

266
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,920
She killed him!

267
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,560
Why didn't you dodge?

268
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,080
Little Gourd,

269
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,240
I don't want you to hate me.

270
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,080
They will come soon.

271
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,720
Leave now.

272
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,080
Li Bugui.

273
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Li Bugui.

274
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,640
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,000
Tell me

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,280
what I shall do.

277
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,480
Don't cry.

278
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,880
Just go back

279
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,200
to see Shen Zhuoyue

280
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,480
and get away as far as you can.

281
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,439
Since I could be killed by you,

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,240
I'm so...

283
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm so...

284
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,280
Li Bugui.

285
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,160
Li Bugui.

286
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,440
Li Bugui.

287
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,120
Li Bugui. Wake up.

288
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,840
Wake up.

289
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,000
Li Bugui.

290
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
Li Bugui.

291
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,400
Wake up.
