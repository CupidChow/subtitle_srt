Episode 22
Li Bugui saved Drought Witch
The affectionate fruit reminded Bugui of everything

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,880
Master Li.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,280
You know me?

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,080
I don't just know you,

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,479
but also know

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,080
who made you lose your memories.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:45,720
Kill her.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,599
Folks, be quiet.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,160
Kill her.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,919
Make space.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,559
It's Master Li of Lingxiao Sect.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,720
Li Bugui?

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,119
Master Li.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,080
That Drought Witch hurt you

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,880
and the people of Guangping.

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,920
Since you are here,

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,760
please

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,240
help us

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,080
to end that bane.

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:54,480
Kill her.

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,359
You are the Drought Witch?

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,160
No.

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,480
I'm not.

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,920
They set me up.

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,280
They set me up.

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,600
The witch is a cunning

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,640
and plausible liar.

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Master Li, don't trust her.

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,280
I know what to do.

33
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,959
You don't tell me.

34
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,960
You mean

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,600
it will rain if she dies, right?

36
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,280
Yes.

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,680
That's not true.

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,120
Don't trust them.

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,880
If I don't trust them,

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,840
should I trust you instead?

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
You said

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,040
that even if you drank the Lethe Water

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,320
and your mind couldn't remember me,

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,840
your heart would.

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,040
To think I took those words

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
as real.

47
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
It seems

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,040
800 years of love

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,519
couldn't withstand a bowl of Lethe Water.

50
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,720
Don't do it.

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,519
Don't kill her.

52
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,080
What is Master Li waiting for?

53
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,520
Yes.

54
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,440
What's going on?

55
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,320
Master.

56
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,720
We've got an urgency.

57
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,880
Please go back now.

58
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,000
Come on.

59
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,240
Master Li.

60
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,640
Kill her.

61
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,000
What shall we do to the Drought Witch?

62
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Watch her.

63
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,120
We will make Li Bugui

64
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,840
kill her tomorrow anyway.

65
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,640
Master.

66
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,200
She may not

67
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,720
live to tomorrow.

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,040
Good-for-nothing.

69
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,600
Wake her up.

70
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,799
She must die tomorrow.

71
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,400
Yes.

72
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,800
Still won't wake up?

73
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,080
Then don't blame me.

74
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,640
Stop.

75
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,640
Li Bugui?

76
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,160
What do you want?

77
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,320
Hero,

78
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,479
why did you save me?

79
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,960
Though you're a vicious person,

80
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
they are not either since they wanted

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,360
to use me to kill you.

82
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,440
This is my mansion,

83
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,359
you may rest here for a while.

84
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,400
That's not necessary.

85
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Thank you for saving me.

86
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Then you may leave.

87
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,480
Don't come back again.

88
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,159
I promise

89
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,720
that you will never

90
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,560
see me again.

91
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Wait.

92
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,960
Did we meet before?

93
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,439
Why did you ask so?

94
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
I just...

95
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,800
No.

96
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,560
Maybe I think too much.

97
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,439
You may leave.

98
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,720
I have this fruit

99
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,760
for you.

100
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,280
May you

101
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,080
have a peaceful life.

102
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,040
Take care.

103
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,080
Farewell.

104
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Destiny.

105
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
Did Li Bugui really drink the Lethe Water?

106
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,440
I have looked into it,

107
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,479
Li Bugui did drink it

108
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,360
and lose his memories.

109
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,400
But why is the Scarlet Cloud still there?

110
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,599
Well...

111
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,199
I'll check it out now.

112
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,520
So I'm the Master of Lingxiao Sect

113
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,400
which is the top assassin organization?

114
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,000
Exactly.

115
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,280
The fruit is going bad.

116
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,479
Let me ditch it.

117
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,079
You've grown weird

118
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,080
since you woke up.

119
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
I have this fruit

120
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,600
for you.

121
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,400
May you

122
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,960
have a peaceful life.

123
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,440
Li Bugui.

124
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,920
From now on,

125
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,000
take care of yourself.

126
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,600
The seeds of the affectionate fruit.

127
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,120
Grow one in your yard

128
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,080
and grow the other at my Lethe Hall.

129
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,640
We will

130
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,360
be together for eternity.

131
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,760
Brother Shuanzi,

132
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,920
want an onion bath?

133
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,400
I heard that you can't sleep well,

134
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,640
Using it for fumigation

135
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,160
may improve your sleep quality.

136
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,400
I know Li Bugui.

137
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,360
He isn't such a man.

138
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,080
Besides, he's pitiful enough

139
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,640
to have lost his family.

140
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,120
Why are you still slandering him?

141
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,320
From now on,

142
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,120
Li Bugui and I

143
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,440
will be sworn siblings.

144
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,760
We will eat

145
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,200
and drink together,

146
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,640
and share weal and woe.

147
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,040
I'm begging you

148
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
to save her.

149
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,880
Li Bugui.

150
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,320
it seems the love thread of us

151
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,480
is going to be untied.

152
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,640
I won't forget you.

153
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,520
Even if my mind forgets you,

154
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,319
my heart will remember you.

155
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,160
It seems

156
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,319
800 years of love

157
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,480
couldn't withstand a bowl of Lethe Water.

158
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,000
Are you alright?

159
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,359
What happened?

160
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,359
Li Bugui, what's wrong?

161
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Don't scare me.

162
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,360
Let me fetch you some water.

163
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,959
Why are you looking at that?

164
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
I'm going to ditch it.

165
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,360
I'm going out.

166
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,320
You need to rest

167
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,240
and don't go out.

168
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,000
Little Gourd.
