00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 17
Li Bugui gave up his pride to beg Zhang Shen
Bugui took off clothes to warm his girl

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,759
Right.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,519
I know a way to cure a Spiritual Officer.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,600
But I am going to die now,

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,720
who can save me?

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,519
You got me into this situation,

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,280
so I just wish you'd all die

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,160
with me.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,960
Believe it or not?

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,879
I can kill you right now.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,760
Go ahead.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,160
Kill me.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,120
When I die,

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,520
your Little Gourd's body and soul will vanish.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,120
The only thing you can do

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,240
is to beg me sincerely.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,480
Maybe I will agree

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,240
to save her when I go soft.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,679
I'm begging you

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,840
to save her.

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,919
What?

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Beg me?

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,040
Why can't I

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,240
feel your sincerity?

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,600
What else do you want?

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,400
Kneel

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,839
and kowtow to me three times.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,600
Then shout this,

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,320
"Grandpa Zhang,

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,080
I was wrong."

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,880
What?

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
You can't do that?

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,240
Right.

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,320
You're the Master of Lingxiao Sect.

38
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,880
It's not worthwhile to do so for a woman

39
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,679
who deceived you.

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,960
You'd better keep your word.

41
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,760
Go ahead then.

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,000
One.

43
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,120
Two.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,840
Three.

45
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,000
Say "Grandpa Zhang, I was wrong."

46
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,120
Come on.

47
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,960
Shout it.

48
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,920
Now.

49
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
Grandpa Zhang.

50
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,960
I was wrong.

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,440
Ha-ha.

52
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
Give me the cure.

53
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,080
Alas.

54
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,400
To think there

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,800
is such an idiot.

56
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,519
You...

57
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,040
If you really want to save your Little Gourd,

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,160
give me your Soul-locking Cup

59
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,520
in exchange.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
Little Gourd.

61
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
Little Gourd.

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,280
It's me.

63
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,120
Li Bugui.

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
I've got the cure for you.

65
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,600
How did you get it?

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,840
It doesn't matter

67
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,239
as long as it can save you.

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,599
Come on.

69
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,560
Let me help you.

70
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,960
Li Bugui.

71
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Thank you.

72
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,719
What happened to your forehead?

73
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,400
Even you would fall down?

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,680
I would.

75
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,960
Since you've taken it,

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,960
rest now.

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,880
Okay.

78
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,600
Come on.

79
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,440
Easy.

80
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,840
I feel so cold.

81
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,960
Let me fetch you one more blanket.

82
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
No.

83
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,320
The coldness is inside of me,

84
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,680
so I can't get warm.

85
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,240
I...

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,880
I'm not trying to get close to you.

87
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,360
It's just too cold.

88
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,360
I feel so good.

89
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,200
Li Bugui,

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,320
you are really not mad now?

91
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,719
I didn't drink Lethe Water,

92
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,360
so the Spiritual Officer would come after me sooner or later.

93
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Even if it wasn't you,

94
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,080
someone else would.

95
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
Master Li

96
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,480
is a generous man indeed.

97
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,520
Now could you tell me

98
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,160
your story?

99
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,160
Yes.

100
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,400
My name is Meng Yo.

101
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,280
When I died from an accident 800 years ago,

102
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,520
I went to Lingyuan.

103
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,159
Then I was adopted

104
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,760
by Lady Destiny

105
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,120
and became her maid.

106
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,440
Lingyuan was in chaos

107
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,120
because of the Scarlet Cloud,

108
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,800
so the Emperor of Lingyuan sent me

109
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
to make you drink the Lethe Water.

110
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,320
You know

111
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,240
what happened afterwards.

112
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,200
It's me, Shuanzi.

113
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,880
I'm here to send the medicine to Little Gourd.

114
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,400
Shuanzi,

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
I'd like to talk to Little Gourd.

116
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,240
Could you leave for a while?

117
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay.

118
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,160
It's the herb I picked from Mt. Zhongnan

119
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,280
which deals with all kinds of coldness.

120
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
Though it's not a radical cure,

121
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,320
it may relieve it.

122
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,640
Lady Shen,

123
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,120
I'm much better now. Thank you.

124
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
But then,

125
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,920
Shuanzi hasn't taken the revenge,

126
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
so there's no way he will drink the Lethe water.

127
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,720
So what's your next plan?

128
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,440
Why don't you stay in Qingchuan

129
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
instead of going back?

130
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,040
We will keep you safe.

131
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,920
You will be in trouble

132
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,160
if I stay in Qingchuan.

133
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,600
What's more,

134
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,480
the Emperor of Lingyuan

135
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,760
will come after us.

136
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,439
Look,

137
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,319
the flower on my arm

138
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,560
is the record.

139
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,239
It's the last petal of time

140
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,120
I can stay in Qingchuan.

141
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,760
Namely,

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,680
there are only seven days

143
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,920
for me here.

144
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,280
Is there

145
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,880
really no other way?

146
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,280
Little Gourd.

147
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,760
Have some soup.

148
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,040
What's the trick this time?

149
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,120
Choose one from three.

150
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,160
Dare you?

151
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,480
What do they say?

152
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,120
You drink Lethe Water,

153
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,480
I give up

154
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,000
and we

155
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,920
get married.

156
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,760
Didn't you say

157
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,840
you wanted to marry me?

158
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
It was the past.

159
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,680
What about now?

160
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,040
Huh?

161
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,440
You don't want to marry me now?

162
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,920
Then why did you save me?

163
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,760
You also took...

164
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,520
off all your clothes.

165
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,719
I helped you

166
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
because you felt cold.

167
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,080
Didn't you agree anyway?

168
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,760
Think about it,

169
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,080
isn't it exciting and alluring

170
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,840
to marry a Spiritual Officer?

171
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,439
So,

172
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,840
why don't you let destiny

173
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,480
make the call?

174
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,520
If I draw it,

175
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,280
will you keep your word?

176
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,560
If you can,

177
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,239
I will.

178
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:19,960
Okay.

179
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,480
Don't be regretful.

180
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,160
I won't be regretful.
