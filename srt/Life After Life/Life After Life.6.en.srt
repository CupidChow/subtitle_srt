Episode 6
Sworn Friends with Hidden Motives     A Confused Woman Catching Snakes.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,919
Then let me go away,

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,920
leave me alone,

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,400
and don't care about me.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,119
Hold on.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,120
What's wrong?

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,800
Fine.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,279
You agree?

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,519
I'll go back and make arrangements.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,640
Prepare the ceremony ASAP.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,160
I'd like to see

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,760
what you are up to.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,400
Grandma, bless me.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
This time it will go smoothly.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,440
What are you doing?

19
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,600
I am

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,280
making soup.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
Making soup

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,160
in such a big pot?

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,320
Yeah.

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
All my families cook

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,679
with a big pot.

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,520
By the way, what's your name?

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,920
I...

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,280
I'm Meng Yo.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,480
Meng Yo?

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah.

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,360
Here, for the snake.

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,080
Ah!

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,940
I forgot to ask what kind of snake you need,

34
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,160
so I got you two of each.

35
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,940
I'll open it for you.

36
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,080
No...

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,800
Well,

38
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,600
open it later.

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,800
What? Is it not enough?

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,800
No.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,120
I just said some words

42
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,360
and you did it without understanding

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,040
what I meant.

44
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,560
You mean I'm silly?

45
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,440
No.

46
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,120
I mean,

47
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,960
except grandma,

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,320
no one's ever been as good to me as you have.

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,480
That's why you have to get the snake out

50
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,520
and save your grandma.

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,000
Let me tell you.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,720
I just caught these snakes from the mountain.

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,199
Look how many I got for you.

54
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,360
Such a big bag of them.

55
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,000
Look.

56
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,960
It's really not necessary.

57
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,240
These two beetle pearls of blood

58
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,960
finally come in handy.

59
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,400
Li Bugui, have some snake soup.

60
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,840
You made it?

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,360
No.

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,800
Then I won't drink it.

63
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,320
You are too cautious

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,240
to enjoy many nice things.

65
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,920
This isn't Lethe Water

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,480
and won't cause memory loss.

67
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,440
Why do you have bite marks

68
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,400
on your neck?

69
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
Just a small wound.

70
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,440
I'm not talking about cuts,

71
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,520
but the bite marks

72
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,840
which were obviously from someone.

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
Is it a woman?

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,840
Li Bugui.

75
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,040
You finally meet a girl.

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Aren't you overreaching yourself?

77
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,200
Let me tell you something.

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,880
Someone wants to be my sworn sister today.

79
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,080
Your sworn sister?

80
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,640
Who's so blind?

81
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,880
I don't who she is.

82
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,280
Since she always carries a gourd,

83
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,120
let's call her

84
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,200
Little Gourd.

85
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,880
Little Gourd?

86
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,040
Are you talking about Meng Yo?

87
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,960
Meng Yo? You know her.

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,120
We just met.

89
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,480
She is the one who made the soup.

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,680
She is

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,040
very strange.

92
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,800
It seems that she wants

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,360
to get close to me instead of killing me.

94
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,480
Therefore, I agreed

95
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,840
to see what she's up to.

96
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,960
Since I've known you,

97
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,600
you've had little to do with others,

98
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,560
not to mention making friends.

99
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I know

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,760
that you are reluctant

101
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,760
to associate with others

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,680
because you're afraid

103
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,160
that you didn't drink Lethe Water

104
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,280
and would be taken away

105
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,120
by Spiritual Officers.

106
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,560
But all these years,

107
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
they haven't come,

108
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,200
and you can't stay alone all the time.

109
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,080
Now someone wants to be your friend,

110
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,880
isn't it a good thing?

111
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,839
Friend?

112
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,079
I don't need one.

113
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,279
See,

114
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,399
A chopstick breaks

115
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,360
at the slightest snap

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,160
while

117
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,200
two chopsticks

118
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,760
support each other and become strong.

119
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,599
I can break

120
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,440
two chopsticks.

121
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,920
You are single for a reason.

122
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,800
Just drink it.

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,840
Isn't this dress too festive?

124
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
After all, it's for an important occasion.

125
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,260
The dress left by

126
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,560
incense burners in the Town God Temple

127
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,080
fits you so well.

128
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,440
The last time I wore something like this

129
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,320
was when I got married to Tao Ran.

130
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,360
Then,

131
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,240
did you ever see him again?

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,160
When I went to Lingyuan,

133
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,159
he had gone already.

134
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,440
But you still miss him very much, don't you?

135
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,440
800 years have passed,

136
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,440
love or hate,

137
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,640
and many things should be let go.

138
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,000
Anyway,

139
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,160
our story is over,

140
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,640
but yours is not.

141
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,360
Lady Shen seems to have a crush on you.

142
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,400
What are you gonna do?

143
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,680
What to do?

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,080
What could I do?

145
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,040
She is human

146
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,920
while I'm a spiritual officer.

147
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,960
We are not meant to be together.

148
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,280
How about this?

149
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,440
After Li Bugui

150
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,960
drinks Lethe Water,

151
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,560
I'll borrow the Camouflage Beast to you for several days

152
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,760
so that you can say goodbye to her.

153
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,920
Good!

154
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,159
Thank you, heroine.

155
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,520
Here you are.

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,240
Why are you dressed like that?

157
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
It's a happy event.

158
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,640
From now on, I'll have someone to turn to.

159
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,560
So I have to dress festively today.

160
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,159
It's time,

161
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,039
please.

162
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,960
I'm here for the blood,

163
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,960
I can't keep my word.

164
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,960
From today,

165
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,719
Li Buwei and I are brother and sister.

166
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,960
We will

167
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,520
share weal and woe

168
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,440
until death separates us away.

169
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,840
OK.

170
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,160
Until death.

171
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,600
Now you two can finish the ceremony

172
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
and become sworn friends.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
Is this a blood ritual or a suicide?

174
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,760
 A blood ritual...

175
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,520
I just think more blood shows

176
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,039
that we are close.

177
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,000
Brother,

178
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,200
Why don't you use this bowl?

179
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,920
That bowl is full of my blood.

180
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,120
Why are you so happy?

181
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,520
Huh?

182
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,840
I'm happy

183
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,079
because no one dares to bully me anymore.

184
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,360
That's the reason.

185
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,400
You can drink it now.

186
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,160
What to drink?

187
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,199
The blood alcohol.

188
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,960
Why else did you put blood in the bowl?

189
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,480
Nobody told me before

190
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,760
that the blood shall be taken in.

191
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,520
It's a part of the ritual

192
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,480
to show your sincerity.

193
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Hey, brother.

194
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,040
How about switching?

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
I want to drink your blood

196
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,280
to taste its flavour.

197
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,880
Why don't you taste mine

198
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
to see whether there's a difference?

199
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
What a nuisance!

200
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,400
I'm full.

201
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,320
I'll drink it when I'm hungry.

202
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,480
Huh?

203
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,400
It doesn't matter.

204
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,040
As she wishes.

205
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,480
Go ahead.

206
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,840
Okay, now you're being protective.

207
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,280
Now kowtow.

208
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,359
It's done.

209
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,400
All right.

210
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,880
If there's nothing else,

211
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,840
 I'm gonna head back.

212
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,560
Hold on.
