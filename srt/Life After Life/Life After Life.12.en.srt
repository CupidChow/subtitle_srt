Episode 12
Meng Yo dated Zhang Shen
Li Bugui is jealous

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,759
Though it stopped raining,

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,440
it is still humid.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,360
If you want to leave,

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,320
let me walk with you.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,040
That's not necessary.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,720
I will go with her.

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,199
Lady Meng.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,440
I'm taking my leave then.

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,480
Stop watching.

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:10,920
Go home.

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,040
How did you get the umbrella?

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,960
I snatched it.

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,880
Huh?

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
What could its owner do?

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,160
Did you bully someone?

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,480
Didn't you give me the word?

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
I was kidding.

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,480
I took it from home.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,320
Okay.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,040
It's sunny now.

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,160
You may close the umbrella.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,120
Well,

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,399
it's just rained,

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,800
so the sunlight is a bit...

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,000
fierce,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,160
so let's use it.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,600
Huh?

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,000
Is that so?

33
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,039
Yes.

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,479
What are you holding?

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,680
The Moon Sacrifice gown.

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,840
The Moon Sacrifice gown?

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,960
You're celebrating the festival with him?

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
No.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,520
Don't be so emotional.

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,600
How could I be emotional?

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,320
Impossible.

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:06,920
You were not?

43
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
I saw it.

44
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,799
Illusion.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,720
Illusion?

46
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,600
Show me again then.

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,400
Humph.

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,839
How could I do that?

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,960
Why is it not possible?

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,880
You've come

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,720
to ask me to celebrate the festival with you?

52
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,640
Yes.

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,120
Didn't you use to accompany me before?

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,200
Things are different now.

55
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,359
I don't even have a physical body.

56
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,240
So ask someone else.

57
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,360
If you have one,

58
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,560
will you go with me?

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,080
How could there be such a good thing?

60
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,920
I mean if.

61
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,840
Then you may just assume it.

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,040
It won't come true anyway.

63
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,359
You...

64
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,880
Come on.

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,920
Take my advice

66
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,520
and don't waste your time.

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,080
You'd better find a good husband

68
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,240
and have children earlier.

69
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,000
When you have a chubby son,

70
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,640
come to pray for him

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,040
and I'll divine to give him a good name.

72
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,080
Don't do that.

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,040
If it's a son,

74
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
I'll name him Xie Lian.

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,000
Fine,

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
but you need to find a husband surnamed Xie.

77
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,959
Xie,

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,280
don't be regretful!

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,160
Humph.

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,799
All excuses.

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,240
You just don't love me enough.

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,840
When the festival comes,

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,440
I will find a young and capable man

84
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,240
and take him there

85
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,440
to show you

86
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,280
that I, Shen Zhuoyue,

87
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,440
have admirers.

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,679
Lady,

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,400
want a clay figurine?

90
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,799
You may pray to the God of Matchmaker.

91
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,520
It will work.

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,760
Take a look.

93
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,120
Do you have a Town God's figurine here?

94
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,519
I don't have that.

95
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,720
Could you make one?

96
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,079
But I don't know

97
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,000
what he looks like.

98
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,320
Easy.

99
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,640
I'll tell you, you make it.

100
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,520
All right.

101
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,800
Xie, though I can't get you,

102
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,040
can't I get your figurine?

103
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,320
Lady Shen.

104
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,359
Mister Zhang.

105
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,480
You are frowning.

106
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,279
Are you bothered by something?

107
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,279
I wonder

108
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,520
if there is anything I can do for you.

109
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,360
Mister Zhang.

110
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,440
Is it true that your Yuling Villa

111
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,320
has everything?

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
It's the Camouflage Beast you told me to look for.

113
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,080
It only eats peach blossoms

114
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,200
and drinks the morning dew,

115
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,560
so pay attention

116
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,599
when you feed it.

117
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,520
When it is raised for 12 hours,

118
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,159
it may give a Spiritual Officer a physical figure.

119
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,719
That is fantastic.

120
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,640
Thank you so much.

121
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,960
Lady Meng.

122
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,520
Mister Zhang.

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,920
Lady Meng.

124
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,320
Just tell me your mind.

125
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
Why did you bring so many things here?

126
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,720
It's the bride price.

127
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,520
Our Yuling Villa always pays attention to the rituals.

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,080
Since I'm proposing,

129
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
I need the documents and the presents.

130
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,560
Okay.

131
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,520
About this Nine-dimensions Mirror you talked about,

132
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
could you show me it?

133
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,880
Forget it if you don't want to.

134
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,760
I was just saying.

135
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,039
No.

136
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,040
If you're interested,

137
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,640
I'll tell them to take it tonight

138
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,160
so I can take it to you

139
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,040
at the festival tomorrow.

140
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,720
Go out and turn right

141
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
if you want to set up a stall.

142
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
I'll tell them to buy it

143
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
if you want a mirror.

144
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,440
We can buy as many as you want.

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,120
It's no ordinary mirror.

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,240
It's special because it is

147
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,600
from Mister Zhang?

148
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,920
Right.

149
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,680
All right.

150
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,960
If you'll excuse me.

151
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,120
Lady Meng.

152
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,919
I'll be waiting at Yilan Pier around six o'clock tomorrow.

153
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Okay.

154
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,960
Come with me.

155
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,360
It's for you.

156
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,000
Brother Shuanzi.

157
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
What's this?

158
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,320
It's for the festival.

159
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,159
Are you also

160
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,440
inviting me to celebrate it?

161
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,640
Well,

162
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,360
here's the thing.

163
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,640
There will be many people then,

164
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,600
so it's a good chance for Ji Bofeng to take action.

165
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,320
It's risky for you to go with another guy.

166
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,200
But I've given him the word.

167
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,120
Take it back.

168
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,919
How could I

169
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,160
take my word back casually?

170
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,640
If you don't do it,

171
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,560
I will kill him.

172
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,160
You...

173
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,520
But we are sworn siblings now

174
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,680
and it's a festival for the people in love.

175
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,120
So how could we

176
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,960
go celebrate it together?

177
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,120
We have our reason,

178
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,240
so it's not against the ethics.

179
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,320
Brother Shuanzi.

180
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,400
You're always capable of doing anything.

181
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,120
By the way,

182
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,159
where did he say he'd wait for you?

183
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,680
- It's... - I remembered it.

184
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,000
The east of Yilan Pier.

185
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,320
Yes.

186
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,840
Well,

187
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
I'll be waiting

188
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,600
at the west there at a quarter to seven.

189
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,400
I'm leaving for a business.

190
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,400
Try the gown.

191
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,159
Hey, you...

192
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,680
What is wrong

193
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,239
with Shuanzi?

194
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,920
To think

195
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,040
you'll celebrate the festival, too.

196
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm doing it to draw Ji Bofeng out.

197
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,400
Zhang Shen tries to get close to Little Gourd,

198
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,719
but I suspect that he is up

199
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,720
to something else.

200
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Little Gourd is a cute girl.

201
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,400
It's reasonable for her

202
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,559
to have attracted the young guys.

203
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,200
Why are you jealous?

204
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,200
The elder brother is like a father.

205
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,640
As her brother,

206
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
I can't watch her stepping into a trap.

207
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,360
Look,

208
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,000
Check Zhang Shen out.

209
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,160
I think he's fishy.

210
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,560
You are the fishy guy.

211
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,360
Why am I fishy?

212
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,880
I just want to protect Little Gourd.

213
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,840
Yue.

214
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,319
When I make military achievements,

215
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,960
I will come back to marry you.

216
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,400
Okay.

217
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,040
I'll wait for you.

218
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,920
You're still keeping that gown?

219
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,520
You just want to go with me.

220
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:38,880
Come on.

221
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,080
Why did you walk without a sound?

222
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,920
You freaked me out.

223
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,520
So,

224
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,520
did you change your mind

225
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,800
and want to go with me?

226
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,640
No.

227
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,040
I ran out of firewood

228
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,400
and I was looking for something to burn.

229
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,319
Still denying it.

230
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,560
See how long can you hold up there.

231
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,360
Down to business.

232
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,400
Help me to check on a man,

233
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,360
you'll be rewarded.

234
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,439
Reward?

235
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,920
What good stuff could you have?

236
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,439
What's that?

237
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,080
Camouflage Beast.

238
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,280
Camouflage Beast?

239
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,439
You... you've found one for me?

240
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,000
Li Bugui will kill me

241
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,520
if he knows.

242
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,520
Forget it.

243
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,880
I need to go back to Lingyuan

244
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,400
after making him drink Lethe Water.

245
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,720
Dear gown,

246
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,839
I can take you to Lingyuan

247
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
as a souvenir.

248
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,680
Mister Zhang.

249
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,680
Lady Meng.

250
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,280
Mister Zhang.

251
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,040
Shall we?
