Life After Life

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 21
Bugui lost his memories through the Lethe Water
Meng Yo became the Drought Witch

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,320
I've prepared the things you like.

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,560
See if you need something else,

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,640
then I'll go get it.

8
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,000
Why are there two chickens?

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,120
Don't you usually make soup?

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,840
Okay. I'll accept them all.

11
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,920
Li Bugui.

12
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,040
Could you help me to comb my hair?

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,800
Okay.

14
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,960
When you combed for me last time,

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,440
you found out that I'm a Spiritual Officer.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
I should have

17
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,679
drunk that Lethe Water

18
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,160
since I'd forget everything

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
anyway.

20
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,200
It doesn't matter

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,520
if you can remember or not.

22
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,280
No matter if you drink the Lethe Water,

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,640
we have met each other.

24
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,400
So there are memories

25
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,360
that can't be wiped out, right?

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,120
Little Gourd.

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,880
When you go back to Lingyuan,

28
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,760
don't miss me too much.

29
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
I will

30
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,440
miss you just a bit.

31
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,240
I have many things

32
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,120
to handle in Lingyuan.

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,560
A horde of people go there every day,

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,280
so maybe

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,880
I can meet a guy named Zhu Bugui or Liu Bugui.

36
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
And maybe

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,240
I can meet Tao Ran

38
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
to continue our love.

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,720
All right,

40
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,440
whatever will be,

41
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
will be.

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,120
Li Bugui.

43
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,960
From now on,

44
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,720
take care of yourself.

45
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,560
Farewell,

46
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,280
the man I've loved for 800 years.

47
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,039
Farewell,

48
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Little Gourd.

49
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,320
My mission is done,

50
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,680
time to go back to Lingyuan for my happy life.

51
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
I wonder

52
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,000
if I still have a chance

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
to come back.

54
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,320
Xie,

55
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,040
thank you for helping me.

56
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,479
I'll talk with His Majesty

57
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,920
to see if he can change a job for you.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,400
Okay.

59
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Thank you for your support.

60
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,800
By the way,

61
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,600
I'll try to get you the cure

62
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,760
for the Camouflage Beast quickly.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,680
So don't worry.

64
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,160
Okay.

65
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,320
Then I

66
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,240
am leaving.

67
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,159
Okay.

68
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,120
Take care.

69
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,560
Take a good look.

70
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,960
Who am I?

71
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,440
Zhang Shen?

72
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,120
Where to?

73
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,560
You will go nowhere

74
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,400
before I give you to my master.

75
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,400
Zhang Shen.

76
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,440
Ji Bofeng is dead.

77
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,320
Why are you still doing evil things?

78
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,680
Meng Yo.

79
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,960
You should

80
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,320
blame your ill fate.

81
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,520
You have insulted so many people

82
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
that I can't help you

83
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
even if I want to.

84
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,680
What the old master couldn't offer,

85
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,840
the new one can.

86
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,479
I can even live much longer.

87
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,440
Ha-ha.

88
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,480
Ha-ha.

89
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,120
Where is Xie Lian?

90
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,280
What did you do to him?

91
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,000
Well,

92
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,040
you mean that stupid Town God?

93
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,320
He thought he was getting promoted,

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,360
so he went to ask the Emperor of Lingyuan for a reward.

95
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,960
Don't worry.

96
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,520
He will never know that you are in my hands.

97
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,159
Even if you die in Qingchuan,

98
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,840
they will believe that you have gone back to Lingyuan.

99
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,800
Ha-ha.

100
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,600
Ha-ha.

101
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,079
Where is he?

102
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Who are you?

103
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,440
Shuanzi, it's me.

104
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,240
Master.

105
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,439
Check the goods.

106
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,719
Should I kill her right now

107
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,320
to avenge my old master?

108
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,600
Too merciful.

109
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,160
I want all of them

110
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,880
to feel my pain doubled.

111
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,200
Yes.

112
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,599
Who is locked in there?

113
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,959
What does the board read?

114
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,319
Folks.

115
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,520
Folks.

116
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,800
Folks.

117
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,080
Guangping has had years of drought,

118
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,319
so many people are starved

119
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,680
and the rest are suffering.

120
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,960
Everything

121
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
was caused by her.

122
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,400
What?

123
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Who is that woman?

124
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,680
She is a vicious Drought Witch.

125
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
As long as she is alive,

126
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,199
the people of Qingchuan

127
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
will never have a good life.

128
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,480
So we have to kill her.

129
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,880
Kill her?

130
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,439
Is he lying?

131
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,680
It's not me.

132
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,760
Folks,

133
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
take a look.

134
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,280
It's The Tiger is Eating the Drought Witch.

135
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,080
Look carefully,

136
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
does the woman on it

137
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,680
look like her?

138
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,920
The Drought Witch

139
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,319
is exactly like her.

140
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,400
It's not me.

141
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,839
He fabricated it.

142
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,600
It's really not me.

143
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
It's really not me.

144
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,480
Don't mislead the people.

145
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,720
What is he doing?

146
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,280
What will he do?

147
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,160
Killing her in public?

148
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,520
It's scary.

149
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Did you see it?

150
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,520
It's not the earthquake,

151
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,480
but the witch's anger.

152
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,800
She's really the Drought Witch.

153
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,080
We can't keep her alive.

154
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,000
We can't keep her alive.

155
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,240
Kill her.

156
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,760
Kill her.

157
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,520
Kill her.

158
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,080
I told you that you are Li Bugui,

159
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,600
the Master of Lingxiao Sect.

160
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,520
Your nickname is Shuanzi.

161
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,840
I'm your granny's sister

162
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,040
and you are my grandson.

163
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,000
Why don't you listen?

164
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,680
Then

165
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,240
why can I remember nothing?

166
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,480
Well, you fell down

167
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,240
from a roof of this height

168
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,000
when you were practicing,

169
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,319
so you lost the memories.

170
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
That seems like a person from Lingyuan.

171
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,480
Did she come to catch Li Bugui?

172
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,520
Wait here.

173
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,680
I'll be right back.

174
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,120
Master Li.

175
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,800
You know me?
