Life After Life

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 18
Meng Ge came to persuade Li Bugui to drink the Lethe Water
Shen Zhuoyue became a kid to catch Ji Bofeng

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,360
I choose Lethe Water.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,279
How did you know the words on it?

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
When you let someone draw lots again,

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,440
borrow a mask from my servants.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,960
I could read it on your face.

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,040
Then why did you choose it?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,080
You will remember nothing

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,760
after you drink the Lethe Water.

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,280
But if I don't drink it,

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,519
your Lady and you will be in danger.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,520
That being said,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,640
but...

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,800
Why don't you give it a second thought?

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,280
If you drink it,

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,479
your memories...

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,600
You will forget everything.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,800
Compared to those memories,

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,520
your life

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,080
matters more.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,360
Then

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,560
you won't kill Ji Bofeng, either?

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,600
You know

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,759
the reason I have to kill Ji Bofeng?

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
I don't know

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
how he learned that trick.

30
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,600
He could transfer a kid's age

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,560
to someone else,

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,399
so the people who bought it

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,680
could live longer

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,960
and the kids whose ages were deprived of

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,759
would grow old immediately and die.

36
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,880
So far as I know,

37
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,120
he has used that way

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,839
to live for over 1,000 years

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,720
and collected huge wealth.

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,240
No wonder that old man sounded

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,119
like a child.

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,039
But such a thing destroys the balance of the two realms.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,640
Why didn't I hear about it

44
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,200
when I was in Lingyuan?

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
That's why I guess

46
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,240
he has an informer in Lingyuan.

47
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,480
Yes.

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,320
And I was taken away

49
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,040
and almost killed by him

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,000
in my previous life.

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,520
My parents risked their lives to save me

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,280
and they

53
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,560
were killed by him.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,040
Let us

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,880
put the Lethe Water aside.

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
I need to tell Lady Destiny about it

57
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,520
and expose it

58
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,200
to the whole world.

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,000
Little Gourd.

60
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,440
Yes.

61
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,399
Lady, a man named Ji Bofeng

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,480
in Qingchuan

63
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,359
can increase and reduce the age of people

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,480
and seems to have an informer in Lingyuan.

65
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,760
Please look into it.

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,160
I can't make Li Bugui drink the Lethe Water

67
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,799
before finding the truth.

68
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,280
Please understand it.

69
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,760
The letter is sent to Lethe Hall of Lingyuan.

70
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,000
It can really send letters?

71
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,960
Of course.

72
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,160
When did I lie to you?

73
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,240
Haven't you lied enough?

74
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
You have my word.

75
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,320
From now on,

76
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
each word I tell you

77
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,399
will be true.

78
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,280
I will never deceive you.

79
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,280
Now we are talking.

80
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,080
Why hasn't Lingyuan

81
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,040
written in reply?

82
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,160
It's been a while.

83
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,720
Don't they need time to investigate it?

84
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,080
She isn't worried yet.

85
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,240
Why are you so anxious?

86
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,840
It's someone from Lingyuan.

87
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,760
Sister? What brings you here?

88
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,920
Yo, I'm here to see you.

89
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,080
We heard you were wounded,

90
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,760
so Lady and I got so anxious.

91
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
How are you doing now?

92
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,360
Don't worry. I've recovered already.

93
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,560
How is Lady?

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,919
And Ji Bofeng's case,

95
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,880
have you found the truth?

96
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,120
She is fine.

97
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,160
It's just Ji Bofeng's case

98
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,160
is complicated,

99
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,920
so we shall keep it a secret

100
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
before finding the truth.

101
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,679
Okay.

102
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,400
We are looking into it secretly,

103
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,440
don't worry.

104
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,120
Good then.

105
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,680
By the way,

106
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
there are many delicious things in Qingchuan.

107
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,640
Let me take you to try them.

108
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,159
Okay.

109
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:02,920
Meng Yo.

110
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,960
Do you take here as your home?

111
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
Of course, not.

112
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,400
But Li Bugui

113
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,679
is hunting Ji Bofeng now,

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
so he can't lose the memories

115
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,040
before we find the truth.

116
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,359
Are you crazy?

117
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,360
What will happen to Lady

118
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,440
when you run out of time?

119
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,080
Sister, I know the law of Lingyuan.

120
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,760
If the wrongdoer,

121
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,320
is willing to be executed

122
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,400
and lose her soul,

123
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,960
the others may be pardoned.

124
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,640
I can lose my soul at the worst,

125
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,560
so you and Lady will be safe.

126
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,720
You fool.

127
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
Even if you lose your soul,

128
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,159
will the Emperor of Lingyuan allow Li Bugui

129
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
not to drink the Lethe Water?

130
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,919
Maybe I can feed him a bowl of fake one,

131
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,000
it may be risky,

132
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,640
but His Majesty may not know it.

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,840
If you deceive His Majesty,

134
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,640
you will all be executed

135
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,720
once it's exposed.

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,840
Executed?

137
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,200
What shall I do, sister?

138
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,200
I really can't do it

139
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,239
to Li Bugui.

140
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,520
You're in love with him?

141
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm warning you

142
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,480
that you shall never

143
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,760
trust a man.

144
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,800
He could give you his life

145
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,040
when he loves you

146
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,640
and he will dump you at once

147
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,880
when he changes his mind.

148
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Didn't you get wounded because of him?

149
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
If he did love you,

150
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,760
how could he let you get hurt?

151
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,880
But

152
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,520
I lied to him first,

153
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,560
not...

154
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,240
I will drink it.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you will lose your soul because I don't drink it,

156
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,640
I can drink it right now.

157
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
You are a hero indeed,

158
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,080
no wonder my sister loves you.

159
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Since you agreed,

160
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,359
don't go back on your word.

161
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,080
Drink Lethe Water now

162
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,640
so my sister may return to report for duty early.

163
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,080
All right, I know you have words to say

164
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,719
and I can not stay here for too long,

165
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm heading back.

166
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,680
Yo, Lady and I will wait for you.

167
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,200
Okay.

168
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,720
You have decided

169
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,719
not to kill your enemy?

170
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,320
As it may,

171
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,359
I don't want you to take risks for me.

172
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,280
It's settled.

173
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,560
Okay.

174
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,760
Please, Town God.

175
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,400
Let my Bao come back quickly.

176
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm begging you.

177
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,840
Town God.

178
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,640
Let my son come back.

179
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
I can't live

180
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,760
without him.

181
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,400
Please.

182
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,200
Have you lost your child?

183
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,840
That damn villain caught my Douzi.

184
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,440
He's my only son.

185
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,839
All of our children were taken away.

186
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,520
If I know who did it,

187
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,919
I will kill him 100,

188
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,559
1,000, 10,000 times.

189
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,600
My child.

190
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,400
Did they take my Douzi away

191
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,920
to lock him up

192
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,760
or kill him?

193
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,720
What should I do

194
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,080
if he is dead?

195
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,120
What shall I do?

196
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,080
Please

197
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,600
tell Town God

198
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,880
to save our children.

199
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
I'm begging you.

200
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,760
Don't worry.

201
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,360
Trust me.

202
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,560
I'll try to help you.

203
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,720
Town God.

204
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,760
Please. Town God,

205
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,640
save our children.

206
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,480
Town God.

207
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,080
Save our children.

208
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,520
Please save our children.

209
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,600
My Douzi.

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,800
Li Bugui,

211
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,280
what will you do

212
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,439
after drinking it?

213
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,319
I have no idea.

214
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,000
Selling soup maybe.

215
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,120
You sell it in the heaven

216
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,240
and I sell it on the earth.

217
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,800
Take it as a branch of yours.

218
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,880
Why don't you become a matchmaker?

219
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,760
When I

220
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,720
untie the love thread of two people,

221
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,040
you may

222
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,719
fasten it again here.

223
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,040
Isn't it good?

224
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,479
Li Bugui,

225
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,680
it seems the love thread of us

226
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
is going to be untied.

227
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,160
I won't forget you.

228
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,360
It's Lethe Water

229
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,080
and it will make you forget everything.

230
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,000
Even if my mind forgets you,

231
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,160
my heart will remember you.

232
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,120
It's said

233
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,280
that once you can't have someone,

234
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,439
the only thing you can do is to remember that person.

235
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,160
But we

236
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,800
can't even do that.

237
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,719
We have a problem.

238
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,800
We have...

239
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,360
a problem.

240
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,840
A lot of children disappeared in the town.

241
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,920
It must be the age trade of Ji Bofeng.

242
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,760
If we miss it,

243
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,960
I don't know

244
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,120
when we can find him.

245
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,839
Say something.

246
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,080
You want to put a two-generation grudge aside?

247
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,760
But there's no time for Little Gourd.

248
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,000
If I can't make it back in time...

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,680
Li Bugui.

250
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,240
Don't worry about me.

251
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,320
Just catch Ji Bofeng

252
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,400
and take him to Lingyuan.

253
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,680
I'll be fine.

254
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,520
Are you sure?

255
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,640
Yes.

256
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,439
Okay.

257
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,280
I will be back in time

258
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,120
and make sure you're safe.

259
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,839
I'll be waiting.

260
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,160
Okay.

261
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,120
Guys, we have a problem now.

262
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,120
None of the Town Gods

263
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,960
could locate Ji Bofeng.

264
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,640
That's weird.

265
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,319
Seems like they were bought over.

266
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,800
Ji Bofeng

267
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,680
is no match for Shuanzi,

268
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,640
but he's cunning, discreet and good at escaping.

269
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,960
Time is not on our side,

270
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,120
we have to catch him by one strike.

271
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,480
Then we draw him out.

272
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,200
We can't do it by using a child.

273
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,439
It will be our sin if the child gets hurt.

274
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:08,920
Little Gourd.

275
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,960
Is there a way in Lingyuan

276
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,120
which can change an adult into a child?

277
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,240
You want

278
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,080
to disguise as a child to get inside?

279
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,840
Yes.

280
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,640
No.

281
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,560
If Shuanzi changes into a child,

282
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
who will kill Ji Bofeng?

283
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,480
Let me do it.

284
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,240
I'll go there.

285
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,920
It's just my documents are in Lingyuan

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,480
and it will take a while to get them.

287
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,319
Too late.

288
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,199
Once Ji Bofeng has transferred the ages,

289
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,360
he will hide up immediately.

290
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,440
So I'm the best choice.

291
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,400
I don't agree.

292
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,160
Too perilous.

293
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,840
Xie Lian.

294
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,840
You are the local Town God.

295
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,280
Will you ignore those kids

296
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,000
because of me?

297
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,560
Is that your final decision?

298
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,880
I'm changing it now.

299
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,560
Xie Lian, you are a good officer.

300
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,120
I thank you for those kids.

301
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,320
It's fine.

302
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,280
Don't thank me.
