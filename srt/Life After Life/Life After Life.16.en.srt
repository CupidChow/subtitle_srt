Episode 16
Li Bugui stabbed Meng Yo to see if she was a Spiritual Officer
Meng Yo is in dire condition

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,040
Do you like it?

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,400
Why is your hand so cold?

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,080
Scared?

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,040
It's just a painting,

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,560
why should I be?

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,319
Brother Shuanzi.

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,760
Why are you so strange today?

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,400
I'm glad

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,800
to see you two.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,480
Your hair is in a bit mess.

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,520
Let me help you comb it.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,120
Why do we comb

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,320
at night?

18
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,920
What's wrong?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,880
You don't like it?

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,960
I...

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,320
I do.

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,720
It's still that smell,

23
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,400
just like the smell of your gourd

24
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,960
when I first met you.

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,600
If I guess it right,

26
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,760
what's in it

27
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,840
is Lethe Water which makes people

28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,640
forget things.

29
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,640
Little Gourd,

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,359
I once believed

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,560
that you were the only one

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,040
who wouldn't lie to me.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
I was on guard against the Spiritual Officers,

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,360
it was you who made me tear down my walls.

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,840
Besides, I wanted

36
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,040
to marry you sincerely today.

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,840
Could you tell me

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,440
the relationship between the woman

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
I wanted to marry

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,080
and the Spiritual Officer on that painting?

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,880
Li Bugui.

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,280
What are you talking about?

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,520
I don't know

44
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,799
that Spiritual Officer.

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,920
Fine.

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,040
Then...

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,920
Then let me make it clear.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,120
Jade may hurt the Spiritual Officer,

49
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,880
dare you let me stab you?

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Li Bugui,

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,760
you want to stab me?

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,240
Don't do that.

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,880
She is not a Spiritual Officer who wants to hurt you.

54
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,359
Right on time.

55
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,000
Little Gourd,

56
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,560
if you don't

57
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,960
tell me the truth,

58
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,959
your cousin

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,840
will perish.

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,880
Shuanzi, have you lost your mind?

61
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,640
Who the hell are you?

62
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,399
Speak.

63
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,640
All right.

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,040
Now.

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,760
I'm a Spiritual Officer, Meng Yo, from the Lethe Hall.

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,920
I came by His Majesty's order

67
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,880
to give you a bowl of Lethe Water

68
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,039
so you will lose the memories

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
and the order of Lingyuan will be restored.

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,440
So you did lie to me.

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,040
If I didn't come,

73
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,080
they would kill my Lady.

74
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,840
Little Gourd, what a scheme.

75
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,640
Do your people

76
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,400
have to enjoy fooling the people enough

77
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,159
before making them drink the Lethe Water?

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,320
It's not true.

79
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Not true?

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,680
Since you lied to me,

81
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,920
you cannot leave here alive.

82
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,320
Fine.

83
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,200
If

84
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,320
you still don't believe me,

85
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,000
don't kill me,

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
I'll do it myself.

87
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,840
You...

88
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,320
Heroine.

89
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,680
Don't let me see you again.

90
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,000
Come.

91
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,040
Heroine.

92
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,600
Let me send you back to Lingyuan.

93
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,800
You can't hold it too long.

94
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,360
No.

95
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,960
If I go back,

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,120
Lady and I

97
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,000
will all be exiled to Void

98
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,960
and the troops will be sent here.

99
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,280
Then Li Bugui

100
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,919
will be executed.

101
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,719
You are still worrying about him?

102
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,280
He wanted to kill you.

103
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,080
If he did want to do so,

104
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,760
would I have survived so long?

105
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,159
He had

106
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,320
shown mercy to me.

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,240
Even if he didn't want to kill you,

108
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,320
the Purejade Sword is too icy, you may...

109
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,760
Xie,

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,880
if I can't make it,

111
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,440
could you

112
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,240
tell Li Bugui at once?

113
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,160
Send the message

114
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,120
to Lingyuan after a while

115
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,120
so he may

116
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,280
be prepared for it.

117
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:52,919
Knock on wood.

118
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,720
I'm sure we can find another way.

119
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,760
Don't think wildly.

120
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,800
What way can there be?

121
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,560
I'm afraid

122
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,119
I can no longer get close to him.

123
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,120
Xie,

124
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,560
I feel so cold.

125
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,720
Could you

126
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,320
fetch me some braziers?

127
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,840
Okay. I'll do it now.

128
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,719
The color doesn't fit me.

129
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,720
How do you know it without trying?

130
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,480
You need more colors

131
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,880
to make your life colorful.

132
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,040
The point is the feeling of hope

133
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,160
when you see the lantern rising.

134
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,160
So, do you feel the new hope,

135
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,200
just like everything

136
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,680
will be alright tomorrow?

137
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,039
Li Bugui.

138
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,760
if you find out

139
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,640
one day

140
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,280
that I'm not myself,

141
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,680
what will you do?

142
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,280
Since it's empty now,

143
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,839
I'll tell them to take those things out.

144
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Little Gourd,

145
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,040
just remember

146
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,239
that I'll show up in front of you at once

147
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
no matter what happens to you,

148
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,000
so fear nothing,

149
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,560
all right?

150
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,319
Li Bugui,

151
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,320
you haven't eaten for three days.

152
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,640
When that little liar was here,

153
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,440
you ate and slept well.

154
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,160
You even celebrated the festival.

155
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,800
Now what?

156
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,160
Your soul went away with her.

157
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,600
If you worry about her,

158
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,720
go to see her.

159
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,360
It's better

160
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,760
than living like a corpse.

161
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,840
She should

162
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,160
have returned to Lingyuan already.

163
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,160
Why did you come here?

164
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,560
Li Bugui.

165
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
She is dying,

166
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,240
but she is still

167
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,480
worrying about you.

168
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,560
She keeps calling your name

169
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,120
and thinking about making up for her mistake.

170
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,280
As long as you still have some conscience,

171
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,000
you should be able to sense

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,480
that she didn't mean to lie to you.

173
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
She is in my temple now.

174
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,920
If you want

175
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,079
to see her last time,

176
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,920
go now.

177
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,120
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,680
- Little Gourd- - I'm sorry.

180
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,240
Little Gourd.

181
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,520
You've woken up?

182
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
Li Bugui?

183
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,000
Li Bugui.

184
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,960
It's really you.

185
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,800
Yes.

186
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,880
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,160
I didn't expect the sword

188
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,400
could hurt you so badly.

189
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,560
Why is her body so cold?

190
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,000
The Purejade Sword is too icy,

191
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,560
so even if a Spiritual Officer survives it,

192
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,640
she will be in dire condition.

193
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,760
Li Bugui.

194
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,600
I'm sure you hate my guts now.

195
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,920
If you hate me,

196
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,040
I'm leaving right now.

197
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,520
It was my fault.

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,120
I was on a whim.

199
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,000
Trust me.

200
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,160
I will never let you die.

201
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,400
Take a good rest now.

202
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,160
Come on.

203
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,560
Why didn't you send her back to Lingyuan?

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,160
It was because of you.

205
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,080
Me?

206
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,400
She said if she went back,

207
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,160
the Emperor of Lingyuan

208
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,680
would send others here.

209
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,720
Then

210
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,160
things would get worse,

211
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,479
you would be taken to Lingyuan.

212
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,120
She worries about you

213
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,320
even when she is dying.

214
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,920
But you

215
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,360
are such an imbecile.

216
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,080
You know how to save her?

217
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,599
Her soul is hurt by the coldness.

218
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,839
Since she's a Spiritual Officer,

219
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,520
the medicine of Qingchuan can't cure her.

220
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
I'm afraid

221
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,320
only one man

222
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,160
can save her.

223
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,160
Who?

224
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,720
The young master of Yuling Villa,

225
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,800
Zhang Shen.
