Life After Life

00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,980
Episode 13
Shuanzi finally shed tears because of his parents
Xie Lian got a mortal body to hug Shen Zhuoyue

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,040
Take it easy.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,160
There are still more.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,760
Don't worry.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,839
Don't push.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,400
Listen to me, everyone will have one.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,600
Everyone will.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,640
The affectionate fruits

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,440
are fresh!

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,000
Everyone may have it.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,040
So there are many people who want to eat it.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,480
The affectionate fruits grow up in pairs,

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,400
so it's a symbol of love.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,440
It's said that once two people eat them,

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,239
their hearts

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,080
will be bonded together tightly

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,600
and they will never be separated.

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,120
I guess

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,200
it was

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,320
because we ate them together many years ago

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,560
so we could reunite again.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,800
Then the fruit is impressive.

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,679
Yes.

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,560
It's kind of a merry wish.

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,280
By the way.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,840
Lady Meng.

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,520
This is the Nine-dimensions Mirror.

31
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,960
When you use it,

32
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,279
hold it in front of your chest

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,720
and think

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,520
about the one you miss.

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,720
After a while,

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,160
the mirror may link its holder

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,800
and show the condition

38
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,160
of the person

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,640
you want to see.

40
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,880
Okay.

41
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,280
Thank you, Mister Zhang.

42
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,520
You are welcome.

43
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,600
Li Bugui should be moved into tears

44
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,440
when he sees his relatives in it.

45
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,240
I wonder

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,080
how he is now.

47
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,640
What's wrong, Lady Meng?

48
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,039
Nothing.

49
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,800
It's just my chest is a bit hurt.

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,160
Maybe I feel suffocated because of the crowd.

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,760
I can let them leave

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,600
if necessary.

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,840
No.

54
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,960
Since those love birds

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,040
just want to be together,

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,840
we shouldn't stop them.

57
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,480
Okay.

58
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,359
Well then,

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,720
let's get in line.

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,480
All right.

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,799
Lady Meng.

62
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,519
Please.

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,200
Xie Lian.

64
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,480
I can really touch you.

65
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,240
So,

66
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,080
am I so attractive?

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,960
But I only have 49 days left.

68
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,640
So you need to cherish me.

69
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,660
Let's go.

70
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,380
Let me show you something.

71
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,679
What is it?

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,640
May you always be together.

73
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,519
Thank you.

74
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,400
Excuse me.

75
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,640
Come on.

76
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,359
The affectionate fruit concerns the relationship.

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,160
It may let you always be together.

78
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,519
You two look outstanding,

79
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,799
so you deserve

80
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,360
the king of affectionate fruit.

81
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,200
Here you are.

82
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,440
Thank you.

83
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,440
Wish you

84
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,719
could always be together

85
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,200
and never be separated

86
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,479
in the next lifetimes.

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,600
Thank you.

88
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,960
Thank you, mister.

89
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,080
Thank you.

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,160
What?

91
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,680
Little Gourd,

92
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,919
how dare you eat the fruit with Zhang Shen?

93
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,840
Come back right now.

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,280
Mister Zhang, I have an urgency.

95
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,280
I need to go back right now.

96
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,240
Meng...

97
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,200
Lady Meng.

98
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:01,919
Lady Meng.

99
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,760
Where is he?

100
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,600
Did he go back alone?

101
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,240
Yes.

102
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,640
Are you blind?

103
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,080
The blood pill did work.

104
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,680
What?

105
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,880
You don't want to be

106
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,080
with Zhang Shen for the next lifetimes?

107
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,520
I haven't figured it out this life,

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,080
not to mention those lifetimes.

109
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,960
So,

110
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,320
want the fruit?

111
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,040
You want to eat them with me

112
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,120
instead of Zhang Shen.

113
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,359
What's on your mind, Little Gourd?

114
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,840
I...

115
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,159
Hey. Don't think too much.

116
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,480
I'm not going to be with you in those lifetimes.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,280
I just saw you were angry,

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,240
so you might be thirsty.

119
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,200
That's why I took them here.

120
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,680
Then I won't eat it.

121
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,719
Fine.

122
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,200
What's that?

123
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,440
It's the Nine-dimensions Mirror I asked Zhang Shen for.

124
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,200
You may get to know where your family

125
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,919
is now.

126
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,560
I think

127
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,360
you want to know that.

128
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,080
Just hold it in front of your chest

129
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,360
and think about the person you miss,

130
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,280
and then that one will show up.

131
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,479
So you went to see Zhang Shen

132
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
to get this junk mirror?

133
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,560
It's not a junk mirror,

134
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,560
it's a treasure

135
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,040
which may help you to see the person you miss.

136
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,039
I won't use his stuff.

137
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,160
Hey.

138
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,640
You refuse to see the person

139
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,360
you miss the most just because of your anger?

140
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,440
Anyway,

141
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,240
I'll return it to Zhang Shen tomorrow.

142
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,200
Suit yourself. Humph.

143
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,920
Where are you going?

144
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,080
To sleep.

145
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,840
What is that?

146
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,760
I got two affectionate fruits each year

147
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,400
since you left

148
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,039
and was going to eat them with you.

149
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,920
Then I noticed

150
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,000
that they couldn't be preserved long,

151
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,200
so I put them in the wine,

152
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,360
thinking we may not eat the fruits,

153
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,280
but drink the wine.

154
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,760
You did so each year?

155
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,320
You've left for five years,

156
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,159
so I buried the fruits for five years.

157
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,280
I was going

158
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,799
to drink it when you'd come to marry me.

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,640
Since it could never happen...

160
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
Why don't we drink it today?

161
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,000
So

162
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,760
you buried the fruits alone

163
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,840
on the Moon Sacrifice each year?

164
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,200
I told you

165
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,600
I'd wait for your return,

166
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,800
so I'd keep my word.

167
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,520
Yue,

168
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,520
I have kept you waiting

169
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,480
for too long.

170
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,439
Fool.

171
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,240
Didn't you try to make military credits

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,920
for me too?

173
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,680
Is Li Bugui going to cry?

174
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,600
Shall I go inside?

175
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
Forget it.

176
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,480
Let him spend more time with his family.

177
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,839
Take it easy.

178
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,880
Mother.

179
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
That's my parents in the previous life.

180
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,880
Be careful.

181
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,360
It seems

182
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,040
that they are having a happy life now.

183
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,520
How to read it?

184
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,079
You don't even know that?

185
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,080
So dumb.

186
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,560
My parents in the life before the previous one.

187
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,640
You are dumb.

188
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,920
To think they became brothers now.

189
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,120
Teacher taught us before.

190
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,240
Let me

191
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,680
go with you to see them tomorrow.

192
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,000
No.

193
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,920
Just leave them be.

194
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,600
They should be upset

195
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,480
to see you being like this.

196
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,920
Which parents don't

197
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,000
want their child

198
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,960
to be happy?

199
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,440
Li Bugui,

200
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,200
let the past go.

201
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,120
Time to start a new life.
