Episode 11
The affections in the previous life
Meet again in this life

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,560
It's the chicken soup for you.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,480
Try it.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,560
Here.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,360
I don't want it.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,960
You can't get well

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,080
if you don't eat.

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,760
Besides,

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,199
you got ill because of me,

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,640
so I'll blame myself

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,640
if you can't recover.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:51,720
Here.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,480
So,

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,600
does it taste better

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,560
when you are fed by someone else?

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,120
Listen to me.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,479
I'm not like you

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,919
who has been accompanied by Lady Shen.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,440
I've been alone for so long,

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,280
so nobody takes care of me.

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,720
When I was ill,

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,480
I had to decoct for myself.

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,199
When the decoction was too bitter

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,840
to drink,

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,120
I came up with an idea.

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,000
I pretended to be my mom

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,960
to feed myself.

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,600
Like this,

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,479
Yo, I know it's bitter,

33
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,720
but you'll get well after having it,

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,760
so I don't have to be worried.

35
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,120
Just have it for me, okay?

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,240
Then I would

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,679
drink up the whole decoction.

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,320
Do you think

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,120
something is wrong with me?

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,160
Brother Shuanzi, have more.

41
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,160
In fact,

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,720
when you are alone,

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
you may deceive yourself

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
to go through.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,440
Look,

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,160
don't you want to know

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,720
how I found you?

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,960
Yes.

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,519
Let me show you something.

50
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,239
It's called Bettle Pearls of Blood

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
which is the concentration of the cluster bettle blood.

52
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,720
What's in me is the maternal blood

53
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,160
and what you had is the filial one.

54
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,840
So when you are in danger,

55
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,640
I could sense your position.

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,920
Bettle Pearls of Blood?

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
When did you let me eat it?

58
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,320
That's not your concern.

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,360
Just remember

60
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,839
I'll go to rescue you

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,160
when you're in danger, that's enough.

62
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,040
You will show up

63
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,280
whenever I'm in danger?

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
What are you chatting about?

65
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,440
What brings you here?

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,959
Zhang Shen, the young master of Yuling Villa, awaits you.

67
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,440
Yuling Villa?

68
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,720
Let me meet the man.

69
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,880
No. He wants to see her.

70
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,880
Huh?

71
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,040
Me?

72
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,400
I am Zhang Shen of Yuling Villa.

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
It's an honor, Master Li, Lady Meng.

74
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,679
So it's him.

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,240
For what

76
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,280
do we owe this honor?

77
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,640
Honestly,

78
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,360
I do have a business

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,360
and I need your favor.

80
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,240
The elder brother is said to be like a father.

81
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,280
I fell in love with Lady Meng

82
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,079
at first sight,

83
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,200
so I made bold

84
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,000
to ask you to let me marry her.

85
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,119
Marry her?

86
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,920
Precisely.

87
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,920
Little Gourd,

88
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,200
do you know him?

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,480
All right. Walk the guest out.

90
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,840
Hold on.

91
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,240
Lady Meng.

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,760
Could you look at this painting

93
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,240
before driving me away?

94
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,560
This is...

95
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,039
How did you get it?

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,480
Did you

97
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,080
have the same dream repeatedly?

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
For 23 years,

99
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,440
I always dreamed

100
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,360
of a weeping girl.

101
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,240
So when I saw you yesterday,

102
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,880
I felt like being struck by a bolt.

103
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,520
Lady Meng,

104
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,119
do you

105
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
believe in the love in the previous life?

106
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,680
She doesn't.

107
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,640
You may leave.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,560
Master Li.

109
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,440
She hasn't answered yet.

110
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,000
Little Gourd,

111
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,159
what's wrong?

112
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,480
I have no idea,

113
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,039
but he seems like an old friend.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,360
She doesn't feel well today.

115
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,440
If you'll excuse us.

116
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,200
Master Li,

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
our Yuling Villa

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,360
is a celebrated sect after all.

119
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,120
So if you're not satisfied with me,

120
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,640
just tell me frankly.

121
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,640
Why must you just reject me?

122
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,840
I have made it so clear.

123
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
You are free to go.

124
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,520
Walk him out.

125
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,040
In that case,

126
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm taking my leave.

127
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,960
Lady Meng, if you change your mind,

128
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,919
feel free to see me at Yichun Teahouse.

129
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,320
I will always

130
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,000
be waiting for you.

131
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
Is he really Tao Ran?

132
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,200
How could it be so coincidental?

133
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,480
No.

134
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,000
Since I've managed to come to Qingchuan,

135
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
I need to find the truth.

136
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,400
But what shall I say to him?

137
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,760
He said it was a dream,

138
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,640
so he should have forgotten me.

139
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,960
Besides, I can't tell him

140
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,000
that I'm a Spiritual Officer.

141
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,240
However,

142
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,359
what if he still remembers me?

143
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,239
What am I thinking about?

144
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
He drank Lethe Water already,

145
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,280
so he must have forgotten me.

146
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,520
But how did he find me?

147
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,159
Forget it. I need to see him tomorrow.

148
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,600
Where to?

149
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,760
Brother,

150
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,040
I want to see Mister Zhang.

151
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,239
Go.

152
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,480
Thank you, brother.

153
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,080
Ji Bofeng is waiting to kill you outside.

154
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,959
As long as you show up,

155
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,640
thousands of blades will come to you.

156
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,520
Don't we have

157
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,160
Bettle Pearls of Blood?

158
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,760
Won't you come

159
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,840
to save me when I'm in danger?

160
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,439
It depends on my mood.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,120
Then I'll tell Mister Zhang

162
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
to save me.

163
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,520
He seems to be strong enough.

164
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Do you know him?

165
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,040
If you go out

166
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,760
and encounter any danger,

167
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,079
I won't save you.

168
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't care.

169
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,960
Excuse me.

170
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,319
Why did you come here?

171
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,840
I'm afraid your Mister Zhang is too weak

172
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,120
to protect you.

173
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,240
Why are you laughing?

174
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,560
Because you said you wouldn't protect me,

175
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,160
yet you still worry about me, right?

176
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,520
I'm so lucky to have a good brother

177
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,640
like you.

178
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,560
Humph.

179
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,640
Good brother?

180
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,839
Brother Shuanzi, I'm going upstairs.

181
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,840
Let me go with you.

182
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,560
No.

183
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,600
There are things

184
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,280
I need to figure out myself.

185
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,199
Okay.

186
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,600
I'll be waiting here.

187
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,280
That's not necessary.

188
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,480
It is cloudy now,

189
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,040
so it's going to rain.

190
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,560
Just go back.

191
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,560
Lady Meng.

192
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,880
I knew you'd come.

193
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,640
Please sit.

194
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,439
Okay.

195
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,080
Mister Zhang,

196
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,760
about the love in the previous life you mentioned,

197
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,080
what did that mean?

198
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,880
I didn't believe my previous life in the first place.

199
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,880
But I was

200
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,120
disturbed by the dreams

201
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,319
about you,

202
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,120
so I got this Nine-dimensions Mirror

203
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,400
from a guru.

204
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,680
One may find the whereabouts

205
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
of the person he cared about the most

206
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,760
in the mirror.

207
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,560
Then I saw you

208
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,160
in it.

209
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,400
Since we happened to meet on the street,

210
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,959
I made bold to propose to you.

211
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,280
Is he really Tao Ran?

212
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,520
We can be together again

213
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,959
after I have been waiting for so long?

214
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,600
But now I am...

215
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,199
Lady Meng?

216
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,920
I understand

217
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
if you don't believe it.

218
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,120
The past

219
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,960
is the past,

220
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,040
so who can be sure about it?

221
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,480
What I want

222
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,480
is our relationship in this life.

223
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,479
The relationship in this life

224
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,160
is kind of thorny.

225
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,199
Huh?

226
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,600
Mister Zhang, are you happy

227
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,480
in this life?

228
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,520
My happiness

229
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,160
relies on you.

230
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,240
Thank you for your flattering,

231
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,199
but I'm not bonded to you this life.

232
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,239
Should there be the next life...

233
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,120
The pouring rain ended up with a colorful rainbow.

234
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,400
The fresh torrent rushed onto the broken shore.

235
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,800
There is no need

236
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,320
to go on with this heartbreaking topic.

237
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,880
Tao Ran said the same words to me.

238
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,280
It's Moon Sacrifice the day after tomorrow.

239
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,240
I have prepared this for you especially.

240
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,040
It's said that two people will be together forever

241
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,040
they eat the affectionate fruit together.

242
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,160
Would you like to put on the sacrifice gown

243
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,800
and join me to eat the fruit?

244
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,400
I...

245
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,040
No.

246
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,280
Why is it raining heavily?

247
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,160
Is Li Bugui still waiting for me downstairs?

248
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,800
It's raining heavily.

249
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,240
Master Li should have left already.

250
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,599
Lady Meng,

251
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,839
why don't you go back till it stops?

252
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,400
No.

253
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,240
He should be waiting.

254
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,040
Lady Meng.

255
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,600
It seems

256
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,360
he did go back.

257
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,439
Lady Meng.

258
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,320
Though it stopped raining,

259
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,120
it is still humid.

260
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,800
If you want to leave,

261
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,840
let me walk with you.

262
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,200
That's not necessary.
