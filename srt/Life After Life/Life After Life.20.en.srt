Episode 20
Li Bugui finally took the revenge
The lovers are facing separation

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,919
I choose...

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,720
to kill you.

7
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,160
So

8
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,440
this

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,800
is the feeling of death.

10
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,600
How did they get inside?

11
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,399
Isn't it a miraculous mirror?

12
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,040
I wonder

13
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,240
if Li Bugui is safe.

14
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,520
Don't worry.

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,440
Li

16
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,680
is fighting Ji Bofeng

17
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,800
fiercely.

18
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,360
It's a shame we can't see it.

19
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,440
Trust me.

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,920
Shuanzi will be fine.

21
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,080
Yes.

22
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,880
Let's go back and wait.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,759
Okay.

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,360
Yo.

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,400
So,

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,760
did you take revenge?

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,080
Why don't you speak?

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,480
Something wrong?

29
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Did you get hurt?

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,359
Let me check on you.

31
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,000
Is there any wound?

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,760
What's up?

33
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,079
What happened exactly?

34
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
To your revenge.

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,600
Cheers.

36
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,080
Okay.

37
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Cheers.

38
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,840
Nice wine.

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,840
It's like a dream to grow younger

40
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
and change back.

41
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,800
Why did you become uglier

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
when you grew up?

43
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,200
Xie Lian, I...

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,120
Eat this.

45
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,680
It's good.

46
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,359
He has been absent-minded

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
since he came back.

48
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,679
Hey.

49
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,120
What happened

50
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,680
after you went through the mirror?

51
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,159
Forget it.

52
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
I don't want

53
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,800
to know

54
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,079
about how you fought and killed.

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,880
It's good that you could come back

56
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,800
after taking revenge.

57
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,599
Since it's done,

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
shouldn't you drink Lethe Water?

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,920
Only you have a tongue.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,880
Only you can talk.

61
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,280
Only you...

62
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,880
I was wrong.

63
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,680
If

64
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,120
you don't want to give up your memories,

65
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,560
I can...

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,680
How much longer do you have?

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,240
Maybe

68
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,000
a few days.

69
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Is there anything you want to do?

70
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,880
Hey. Let's drink. Come on.

71
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
Heroine. Hero.

72
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,440
Okay.

73
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,240
Cheers.

74
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,800
We are so lucky this time.

75
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,560
How long have the children come back?

76
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,039
It's Master Li.

77
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,880
Master Li is back.

78
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,080
Let's kowtow to Master Li.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Thank you, Master Li.

80
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,000
Thank you, Master Li.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,560
Please rise.

82
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,200
Master Li,

83
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,000
my son wouldn't

84
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,680
have been able to come back without you.

85
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,880
We could never

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,680
return that great favor.

87
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,000
If anyone speaks ill of you,

88
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
I will fight him to the end.

89
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,679
Yes, to the end.

90
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,440
To the end.

91
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,920
Thank you.

92
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,640
Thank you for your great favor.

93
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,840
Thank you.

94
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,320
Thank you, Master Li.

95
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,560
Why are you nervous?

96
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,719
When the news spreads out tomorrow,

97
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,719
this place will be livelier.

98
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,120
Thank you.

99
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,200
Kowtow to Master Li.

100
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,720
Come on.

101
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,560
Please stand up.

102
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Folks, please rise.

103
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,280
Master Li was taken care of by you before,

104
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,720
so it was his responsibility

105
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,800
to return the favor.

106
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,120
If you encounter

107
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,280
anything unfair

108
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,440
in Guangping,

109
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,040
feel free to come to Lingxiao Sect

110
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,520
to ask him to uphold justice.

111
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,520
We won't give you the cold shoulder.

112
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,200
We just want

113
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,920
to offer our kindness.

114
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,240
Thank you, Master Li.

115
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,600
Li Bugui.

116
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
From now on,

117
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,000
more people will like you.

118
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,840
So you need to get used

119
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,960
to their kindness.

120
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,280
Li Bugui.

121
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,480
Give me your hand.

122
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,960
This is?

123
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,760
The seed of the affectionate fruit.

124
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,760
I asked it from that orchardman.

125
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,440
Grow one in your yard

126
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,320
and grow the other at my Lethe Hall.

127
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,560
In this case, we will

128
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,720
have the same thing.

129
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,719
When the fruit is ripe,

130
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,599
we can have it

131
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,960
each year.

132
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,719
Then we will be together

133
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,800
for eternity.

134
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,000
You may forget me,

135
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,360
but your tree,

136
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
fruit,

137
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,200
and everything around you

138
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,680
will remember me for you.

139
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,360
It's like

140
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,680
the History Stone

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,600
which records

142
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
all that happened between us.

143
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,600
The History Stone?

144
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,640
Yes.

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,840
I heard

146
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,480
that it could record a man's previous

147
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,520
and present lives,

148
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,120
is it true?

149
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,959
Of course.

150
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,840
Even if you drink Lethe Water,

151
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,679
someone will remember me

152
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,400
for you somewhere.

153
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,720
Does it go wrong?

154
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,760
How's that possible?

155
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,760
Does it muddle up

156
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,000
or record the wrong thing

157
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,480
or...

158
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,200
Li Bugui.

159
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,760
The Stone

160
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,960
records all karma in this world.

161
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,200
If it goes wrong,

162
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
the world will be in chaos.

163
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I'm just afraid

164
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,800
that when I drink the Lethe Water

165
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,959
and see the Stone by accident,

166
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,120
I'll be curious

167
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,680
that I loved a fool like you.

168
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,640
Fool?

169
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,960
Li Bugui.

170
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,920
Say it again and I'll bite you.

171
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,800
Little Gourd.

172
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,199
I will always remember you.

173
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay.

174
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,020
<i>To Tao Ran</i>

175
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,719
Your name is Li

176
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,680
Bugui,

177
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,880
a man from Guangping in Qingchuan.

178
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Your parents died early.

179
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,080
Then your relatives passed away one by one.

180
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,000
You lost the memories

181
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,840
because you drank the Lethe Water.

182
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
800 years ago,

183
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,920
your name was Tao Ran

184
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
and you married Meng Yo.

185
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,839
To think

186
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,520
Li Bugui was Tao Ran.
