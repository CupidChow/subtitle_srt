Town God recommended himself to get promoted

Emperor of Lingyuan
<i>Town God Temple, Guangping</i>

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,520
Emperor of Lingyuan

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,400
granted you ordinary spirits

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,200
to come to me, Town God.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,080
I don't care what you did

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
when you were alive,

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,480
as long as you came to Lingyuan,

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,760
you are granted one more chance.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,960
So you need to cherish this chance

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,400
and do your best to...

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,400
Who?

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,200
Who did it?

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,320
I can hold no longer,

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,920
how much longer do you want to speak?

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,920
Do you still want to reincarnate or not?

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,760
The ideological remolding is necessary

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,240
even if you get to that realm.

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,080
Nobody leaves

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,040
until the incense is burnt out.

25
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,600
Can't I discipline you?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Speaking of your previous life...

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,239
What now?

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,800
Look, why is the water splashing?

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,600
It's weird.

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,000
My bottom.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,240
I should have

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,880
told Lady to spend more money on a better way to get here.

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,160
You...

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,120
Hello.

35
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,079
Newcomer?

36
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,079
Huh?

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,160
Yes.

38
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,720
<i>Xie Lian
Town God</i>

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,840
Why do I remember only six people died today?
<i>Xie Lian
Town God</i>

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,380
<i>Xie Lian
Town God</i>

41
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,640
You were just drowned?

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
I died 800 years ago.

43
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,200
800 years ago?

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,320
Then why did you come to report so late?

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,480
Why didn't you come earlier?

46
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,280
I used to distribute the water in the Lethe Hall.

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,760
The Lethe Hall?

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,800
Yes.

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,880
Perfect.

50
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,920
Hey,

51
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,560
what's your name?

52
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,520
Well,

53
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,800
just call me Xie.

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
Xie,

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,840
thank you for taking me in.

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,720
Alas. That's my honor.

57
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,760
I have nothing else to do here anyway.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,640
Heroine,

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,000
here are some snacks and fruits for you.

60
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,799
Please enjoy.

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,760
Help yourself at home.

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:06,880
Here.

63
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,400
Wow.

64
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,600
Yes.

65
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,920
I miss the taste.

66
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,920
Heroine.

67
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,720
Did you come here with

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,280
any instructions from the headquarters?

69
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,359
A man left without having the Lethe Water

70
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,519
and came to Guangping.

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,320
So His Majesty let me give him a bowl of it.

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,239
Who

73
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,600
is so bold?

74
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,200
A man

75
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,480
named Li Bugui.

76
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,480
Li Bugui?

77
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,280
He didn't have the Water?

78
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,920
What? You know him?

79
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,640
I couldn't know him better.

80
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,359
He's just a demon.

81
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,560
Li Bugui

82
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,719
was from an ordinary family in Qingchuan.

83
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,919
I don't know who they offended,

84
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,480
Li Bugui's family was killed

85
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,120
soon after his birth

86
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,440
and only he survived by a miracle.

87
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,280
Since then,

88
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,039
he has begun to hide

89
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,200
and learn martial arts.

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,280
Meanwhile, he became

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,160
so brutal.

92
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,960
Then he killed the master of the Lingxiao Sect,

93
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,840
took the artifact, the Soul-locking Cup,

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,440
and became the sect's new master.

95
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,680
Then he became more rampant

96
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,520
and bloodthirsty.

97
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,000
No matter who

98
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,480
insulted him,

99
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,800
no one could survive.

100
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
So all the people of Guangping know

101
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,640
that better go to Hell

102
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,880
than look at Bugui's mansion.

103
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,599
Huh?

104
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,400
He is

105
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,840
so brutal?

106
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,200
Not just brutal,

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,080
he's an animal.

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,560
Then

109
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,760
it is a thorny matter.

110
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,920
Well, it's not absolutely impossible.

111
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,840
Heroine.

112
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,240
With all due respect,

113
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,000
if I can help you

114
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,080
to catch Li Bugui,

115
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,960
could you

116
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,240
help me

117
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,400
to transfer back to Lingyuan?

118
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
I can give you no promise.

119
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,919
Why do you want to work there?

120
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,760
Anything will do.

121
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
As long as I can be transferred to Lingyuan,

122
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,800
I don't mind where I shall go.

123
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,080
Okay.

124
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,300
<i>Lingxiao Sect</i>

125
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,640
Heroine, don't be afraid.

126
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,799
We are the ghosts.

127
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,000
Fair enough.

128
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,480
No.

129
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,960
Those charms

130
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,200
are keeping us out.

131
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,360
Huh?

132
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,480
What now?

133
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,840
Let's take another entry.

134
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,960
Come with me.

135
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,440
Okay.

136
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,120
Here we are.

137
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,000
A dog hole?

138
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,599
Let me show you. Look.

139
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,159
Come.

140
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
This way.

141
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,480
Let's go.

142
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,599
Look, so many people died.

143
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,840
Why are you so familiar with this place?

144
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
I prepared for your business

145
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
in advance.

146
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,080
I see.

147
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,760
Heroine, come in.

148
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,840
Okay.

149
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,360
Tiger-head Bells.

150
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
Yes. So he's prepared.

151
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,200
We need to do it quickly.

152
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,159
Yes. Go.

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,840
Hurry up.

154
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,719
Make him have the Water.

155
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:20,960
Right.

156
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,280
Where's my gourd?

157
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,080
Li Bugui?
