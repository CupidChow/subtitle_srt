Episode 5
Ji Bofeng showed up
A kiss on the neck to suck the blood

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Am I right?

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,560
Who...

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,360
Who are you exactly?

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,880
Who am I?

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,640
I didn't mean to offend you.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,640
Please don't stoop down to my level.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,320
By the way,

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,080
did you save Li Bugui before?

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,839
I'm quite familiar with him.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,160
Then for his sake, could you...

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,040
<i>Ji Bofeng</i>

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,920
You said
<i>Ji Bofeng</i>

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,500
<i>Ji Bofeng</i>

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,480
I saved Li Bugui before?

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,800
Yes.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,800
Ha-ha.

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,160
I killed over 30 people of his family,

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,160
you said I saved him?

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,520
But Li Bugui

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,960
did tell me...

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,200
The Spiritual Officers are said to fear jade,

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,120
I haven't killed one yet.

27
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,160
Well...

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,160
Why did you come in?

29
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,179
<i>Lingxiao Sect</i>

30
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,400
Treat the wound yourself.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,600
Let me.

32
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,720
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,400
You let the enemy go

34
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,400
in order to save me.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,440
It's fine.

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,400
I made that choice.

37
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,320
What is this Ji Bofeng?

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,079
He is so scary.

39
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,560
And why was

40
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,000
that old man's voice so strange?

41
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
You don't have

42
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,640
to know it.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,880
It's not a good thing

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,160
to know too much.

45
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,880
But he almost killed me.

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,680
I'll kill him before he kills you.

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,520
Bah!

48
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
Bragging again.

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,680
You didn't even know where he was

50
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,959
and you found him because of me.

51
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,440
How did you find him?

52
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,640
I...

53
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,080
My cousin told me.

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,200
Cousin?

55
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,880
Yes.

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,520
Look,

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Ji Bofeng said

58
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,200
that if you cry,

59
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,839
there will be an earthquake.

60
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,720
Why did you eavesdrop on our talk?

61
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,280
I just happened

62
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,720
to hear it when I passed by.

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,760
He...

64
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,840
mistook it.

65
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,000
He meant my ancestor.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,280
Since I have her blood,

67
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,480
my cry can also shake things.

68
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,680
I'm just not as strong as her.

69
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,360
Full of lies.

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,079
You may leave.

71
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,640
Okay.

72
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,360
Alas. Your neck is bleeding.

73
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,159
Well,

74
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,039
just a scratch. Don't worry.

75
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,680
That ice cone was poisonous.

76
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Ji Bofeng said

77
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,280
it would kill someone within three days.

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,320
Your hand is wounded, too.

79
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,160
My hand?

80
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,599
I sucked the poisonous blood out

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,160
long ago,

82
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,360
but that wound on your neck

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,240
is perilous.

84
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm sure you can't see it yourself.

85
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,880
Easy. Let me suck it out.

86
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,640
Hey...

87
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,760
See how black the blood is?

88
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,560
It's red apparently.

89
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,760
I'm sure your sight

90
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,680
is influenced by the poison.

91
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,960
It has to be sucked out entirely.

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,760
Easy.

93
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,400
Gourd, have you sucked enough?

94
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,640
No.

95
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,320
Now the poisonous blood is all out.

96
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,159
Recuperate here. I'll see you tomorrow.

97
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,800
I wonder how is she now.

98
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,120
Xie, get your butt here.

99
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,440
Very well.

100
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
So you have been hiding here during all those years.

101
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,240
Tell me,

102
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,640
why didn't you come back to marry me?

103
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,480
How could I remember such a thing long ago?

104
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,440
You won't tell me?

105
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,280
All right.

106
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,560
Look, I got military achievements then,

107
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,080
so my status changed.

108
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,520
You mean I didn't deserve you?

109
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't mean that.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,480
Xie, look, I got it.

111
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,919
Since I don't deserve you,

112
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,360
she does?

113
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,000
Heroine.

114
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,560
We can discuss it.

115
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,640
Take it easy.

116
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,520
Go ahead and chat.

117
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,479
I'm leaving.

118
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,520
Don't do this.

119
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,400
Ah!

120
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,919
I'm sorry

121
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,839
for wronging you.

122
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,720
I didn't know that bowl of blood meant so much.

123
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,440
Why don't you tell me what blood it is

124
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
so I can get another bowl of it for you?

125
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,560
Out of the question.

126
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
I have alarmed the snake,

127
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,959
so it won't give me more blood.

128
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,880
So it was snake blood?

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You want to save someone?

130
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,079
What shall Lady do?

131
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,600
You want to save your lady?

132
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,840
It was my fault.

133
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,640
Just wait. Let me fetch one more bowl of it.

134
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,280
Okay...

135
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,000
Hold on.

136
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,160
I wonder if Li Bugui has recovered.

137
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,439
If I go to suck his blood again,

138
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,920
I'll be killed.

139
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,480
I can't look for Ji Bofeng.

140
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,560
It's not really a bad idea.

141
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,959
What shall I do?

142
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,800
Heroine. I'm sorry.

143
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,880
Listen to me,

144
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,600
there are many ways

145
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,960
to make a man bleed

146
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,360
and it doesn't have to be due to a fight.

147
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,800
Huh?

148
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,680
What do you suggest?

149
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,200
The people on this list all died,

150
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
so it's impossible to find Ji Bofeng

151
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,839
through them.

152
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,840
Master Li.

153
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,040
Why did you come again?

154
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,439
I wonder

155
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,839
if you'd agree with my one request.

156
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,760
Say it.

157
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,160
Nobody is your match

158
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,959
in Guangping.

159
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,080
I may not be as strong as you,

160
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,560
but I'm good at looking for people,

161
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,480
so don't we have similar status?

162
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,360
What do you want?

163
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,840
Then it's the destiny.

164
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
You saved my life

165
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,760
and I sucked out your poisonous blood,

166
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,920
so didn't we risk our lives together?

167
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,599
So?

168
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,839
So could we get...

169
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,800
Get?

170
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,640
Get what?

171
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,240
Get

172
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,599
to be sworn siblings?

173
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,440
Little Gourd,

174
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,120
do you know what that means?

175
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,760
Of course, I know it.

176
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,839
I drop my blood into a bowl

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,920
and you drop yours,

178
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,000
then we may die at the same time.

179
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,280
But so many people want to kill me,

180
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
aren't you afraid

181
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,640
to die with me?

182
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,479
I am,

183
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,920
but

184
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,840
won't you protect me?

185
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,400
Why should I protect you?

186
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,280
Because we are siblings.

187
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,160
Come on. Just drop that question

188
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,400
because it's pointless.

189
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,160
Though

190
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,520
you're not smart enough,

191
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,480
nasty and often hit people,

192
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,360
you are a loyal man.

193
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,680
Tell me directly if you think I'm not strong.

194
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,800
I'll try to make progress.

195
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,120
Will you do that or not?

196
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,920
No.

197
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,199
Why?

198
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,800
Because the sworn siblings

199
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,199
shall share weal and woe

200
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,760
and always be together.

201
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,959
I'll follow you when you die

202
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,680
and you don't have to do it when I die, okay?

203
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,520
Not okay.

204
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,800
You...

205
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,719
They all call you a blood-thirsty

206
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,400
and thorough demon,

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,200
but I think you are a good man.

208
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,560
That's why I wanted to be your sworn sister.

209
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,360
Now it's proved

210
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
that you are really an indifferent man.

211
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,360
What makes you think

212
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm a good man?

213
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
I just think so.

214
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,600
You didn't kill me

215
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
when we first met

216
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,280
and then you saved me

217
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,199
from Ji Bofeng.

218
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,480
If you are truly

219
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,600
a demon,

220
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
why did you care

221
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,359
about the life of a person unrelated?

222
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,000
Fine.

223
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,120
It was my wishful thinking.

224
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,079
If you really don't want to be my sworn brother,

225
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
I'm going back.

226
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,280
If I

227
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,640
am killed

228
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,319
by Ji Bofeng,

229
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,400
let me die far away

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,520
and rot there.

231
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,000
None of you shall care about me.

232
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,760
Wait.
