1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,810
 

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,080
 

3
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,190
 

4
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,280
It's snowing.

5
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,080
Oh, my. Isn't this the first snow of the season?

6
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,610
It's the first snow.

7
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,950
Wow, it's so beautiful.

8
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,030
My goodness.

9
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,250
I think only good things will happen from now on.

10
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,640
I know.

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,920
Seeing how the snow is welcoming us,

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,890
I think everything will be fine.

13
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,030
Right. Of course.

14
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,720
 He's stopped at a red light at the three-way intersection. 

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,080
Gosh, so pretty.

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,440
The light changed.

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,380
I'm taking off.

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,310
Taxi!

19
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,480
To Hyehyun Hospital, please.

20
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,270
Emergency patient!

21
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,700
- Other patients will arrive soon. 
- Okay.

22
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,090
Please rush in this patient!

23
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,550
Ma'am, can you hear me?

24
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,730
Wake up!

25
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,540
Patient!

26
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,320
What's taking them so long?

27
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,390
Cardiac arrest!

28
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,280
Defibrillator, please!

29
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,780
150 joules.

30
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,110
Charge.

31
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,340
Clear. Shoot!

32
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,800
Doctor, this person needs attention!

33
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,830
I'm ready!

34
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,020
Clear, shoot!

35
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,970
 Hae Ra! Hae Ra! 

36
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,390
What happened?

37
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,110
Didn't Hae Ra go in your car?

38
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,620
Well...

39
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,210
Hae Ra wanted to interview Mr. Hong and the protestors more,

40
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,550
so we split into two cars at FSS.

41
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,100
Where are you going?

42
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,160
I want to look into this accident.

43
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,790
I want to check if it truly was caused by a slippery snowy road.

44
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,710
Let me look into that.

45
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,790
Please stay by Hae Ra's side.

46
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,590
If you tell me what to look for...

47
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,880
Well, I'm scared that something might happen to Hae Ra

48
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,270
and there's nothing I can do even if I stay with her.

49
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,040
I'm confident I can handle investigating and running on my feet.

50
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,200
If the accident was intentional,

51
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,380
there should be a piece of evidence.

52
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,200
We need to obtain that first.

53
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,150
Okay.

54
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,450
   

55
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,450
   

56
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,710
   

57
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,870
    
 What do you know? 

58
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,780
How dare you write such crap?

59
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,240
You know what?

60
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,430
The one behind Cha Yi Hyeon's sexual favors

61
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,260
is FB Life's Chairman Kim Sang Goo.

62
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,190
I found out recently, too.

63
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,970
I think you should know since you're her brother.

64
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,160
I heard Chairman Kim has had his eye on Cha Yi Hyeon for a while.

65
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,910
That's why he asked Cha Yi Hyeon to interview him.

66
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,870
But the scandal got exposed

67
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,560
right before his wife's imminent death.

68
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,800
Whether it was Chairman Kim or FB Life,

69
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,180
I'm sure they didn't want his scandal linked to his wife's death.

70
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,860
Perhaps that's the reason.

71
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,620
They left Chairman Kim out of the story

72
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,900
and focused it on Cha Yi Hyeon getting sponsored by him.

73
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,030
Only if she came forward and said she wasn't sponsored,

74
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,550
all those speculative articles wouldn't have been published.

75
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,360
Damn it...

76
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,880
Our field is like that.

77
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,350
If the story is intriguing, they spew it out

78
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,000
and make it more provocative.

79
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,400
 I don't know how Reporter Kang Hae Ra found out and aired it live. 

80
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,800
 But that was the beginning. 

81
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,080
 This afternoon, at a hotel near Han River, 

82
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
 our fav emcee Lee Hoon Seok and 

83
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,140
 reporter Kang Hae Ra had their wedding. 

84
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,350
 The two of them met on Lee Hoon Seok's show 

85
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,660
 Entertainment News as a host and a reporter 

86
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,470
 and became lovers. 

87
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,350
 The bride Kang Hae Ra was gorgeous. 

88
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,270
     
 I can see how Lee Hoon Seok could fall for her. 

89
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,380
 Kang Hae Ra hit it big ever since Yi Yeon sunbae's scandal. 

90
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,220
 But I heard that Yi Yeon sunbae recommended her for that position. 

91
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,420
 I heard Yi Yeon sunbae took care of Kang Hae Ra 

92
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,860
 since she was her college hoobae. 

93
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,740
A man is dead!

94
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,140
Everyone in that car is severely injured.

95
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,800
You saw the wrecked car.

96
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,300
No matter the truck driver reported the accident,

97
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,590
don't you think it's weird by looking at the wreck?

98
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,580
Well, I...

99
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,970
And even the black box was turned off.

100
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,920
How can you just believe the truck driver's testimony

101
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,130
and conclude it was a traffic accident?

102
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,900
I do understand the victims' situation, but

103
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,840
he says he stepped on the brake

104
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,020
and slipped on the snowy road. What can I say?

105
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,710
The truck driver reported the accident himself

106
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,510
and admitted his mistake.

107
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,430
It will be tough to prove that it was intentional.

108
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,810
That it was not intentional and that he slipped

109
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,510
are all based on his testimony.

110
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,740
If there's no black box footage on the truck,

111
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,290
show us the CCTV footage from the road.

112
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,660
Geez, look at this guy. Hey.

113
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,610
Do you think the road CCTVs are personal black boxes?

114
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,950
To show it to anyone who asks for it?

115
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,600
You people want to gloss over this incident!

116
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,060
I want to investigate it myself.

117
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,570
- "You people"? "Gloss over?" 
- No, no.

118
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,810
We got it.

119
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,500
I'll call you again when the patient regains consciousness.

120
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,080
Stop now.

121
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,590
Damn it!

122
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,870
Gosh.

123
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,080
Are you sure?

124
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,830
Are you sure the truck driver is one of the Happy Credit guys?

125
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,810
I'm positive.

126
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,060
Where are you going?

127
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,840
We suspect it was intentional,

128
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,170
but it's just our gut feeling.

129
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,200
To have the police investigate, we must find proof first.

130
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,690
Are you Kang Hae Ra's guardian?

131
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,840
Yes.

132
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,560
Internal hemorrhage isn't that severe at the moment.

133
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,000
She won't need surgery or medication.

134
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,280
When she wakes up, we'll move her to a regular hospital ward.

135
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,500
- All right. 
- All right then.

136
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,310
   

137
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,810
What happened?

138
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,590
I heard the truck driver turned himself in.

139
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,070
Well...

140
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,510
Get some info on the truck driver.

141
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,180
If the accident occurred in Gamyeongdong,

142
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,150
the case must be at Seobu Police Station.

143
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,600
Go find Detective Han. I'll let him know.

144
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,020
Okay.

145
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,880
Kang Hae Ra is okay, right?

146
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,610
I told her she didn't have to take this case.

147
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,810
But...

148
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,990
 That person ended up with me since no one would listen to him. 

149
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,660
 I'd like to provide support for that person. 

150
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,970
I really have no idea...

151
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,910
who she really is.

152
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,550
Do you see anything?

153
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,290
No.

154
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,570
They said the truck's black box was turned off.

155
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,320
The truck didn't come crashing from the front of the back.

156
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,790
It will be tough to prove that it was intentional

157
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,930
with Mr. Hong's black box alone.

158
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,200
The solution is...

159
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,050
to get the black box from the car behind Mr. Hong's car.

160
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,780
How to find out the license plate number of the car behind him...

161
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,470
Is that CCTV the only way?

162
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,120
The license plate number of the car behind him.

163
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,580
Are you sure?

164
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,550
Yes, I'm sure I saw it.

165
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,100
We should fix our rear bumper, too.

166
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,750
I thought he was just here.

167
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,180
Geez, when did he leave?

168
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,200
Your car black box...

169
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,130
Can you rewind it?

170
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,060
It was there.

171
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,230
But the number is...

172
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,160
   

173
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,520
   

174
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,540
Yes.

175
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,600
Okay, I'll be there early in the morning with her stuff.

176
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,330
Okay. Thank you in advance.

177
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,410
They'll monitor her in the ICU tonight

178
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,440
and move her to a regular ward tomorrow.

179
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,030
Mr. Cha says he'll stay at the hospital tonight.

180
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,800
Let's go home for now and come back tomorrow.

181
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,350
You go ahead.

182
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,410
He could've changed his location.

183
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,110
I'll look a bit more.

184
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,470
Wait.

185
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,820
He must be home at this hour.

186
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,810
- Let's go home and rest—  
- I don't think I can.

187
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,820
They listened to me...

188
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,390
and while on their way to a new protest location...

189
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,470
I feel the same way.

190
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,830
But we have to focus on finding the proof first.

191
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,900
If we start blaming ourselves now, we can't do anything.

192
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,610
   

193
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,230
It's nice.

194
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,670
You said you didn't like tea because it's bland.

195
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:10,670
Assemblyman Kim said he brought it from overseas.

196
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,680
I heard you were at the John Field Hotel yesterday.

197
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,840
Assemblyman Kim said he saw you there.

198
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,420
Auntie finally resigned from her executive director position.

199
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,720
Resigned?

200
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,280
It's a resignation, to put it nicely. She might as well gotten fired.

201
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,300
After the private school corruption was revealed,

202
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,940
the student body and even the alumni association wouldn't let it go.

203
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,730
That's what I mean.

204
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,030
When she had the chance last year,

205
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,740
she should've stepped down on her own.

206
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,270
In the end, she's shamed in public.

207
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,450
Geez.

208
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,830
I know, right?

209
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,550
It was really an ugly sight to behold.

210
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:01,190
She had so many opportunities to step down with applause,

211
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,680
but she insisted on staying on just a little longer.

212
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,430
I wonder why she insisted on staying to that extent.

213
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,140
Because she doesn't trust other people?

214
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,840
Or...

215
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,370
being in that position for so long

216
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,890
caused her to forget who the real owner is?

217
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,970
Why didn't you ask her while you were there?

218
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,770
Why she insisted on standing her ground.

219
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,390
I'll ask her for sure next time I see her.

220
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,560
I have a meeting this morning. I have to get going.

221
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,910
Thanks for the tea.

222
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,410
Tell Mr. Ko to come in.

223
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,790
Yes.

224
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,920
Finding the owner of that cellphone number that Cha Yi Hyeon wrote in her letter...

225
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,830
How far did you get?

226
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,560
We found the owner, so we're tracking him down.

227
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,400
Mom...

228
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,420
Just watch me.

229
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,800
I'll make sure to let Dad know

230
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,430
who the real owner of FB Life is.

231
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,390
You poured your sweat and blood into growing FB Group.

232
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,670
I'll be sure to protect it.

233
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,730
Mom!

234
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,060
Mom...

235
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,080
Mom!

236
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,000
Mom...

237
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,080
    
The result of her CT scan shows

238
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,430
that the hemorrhage is reduced.

239
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,210
It looks like the bleeding has stopped.

240
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,270
However, it can increase again.

241
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,660
If she complains of headaches or dizziness,

242
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,900
let me know right away.

243
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,970
- Okay, thank you. 
- Sure.

244
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,460
Thank you.

245
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,000
This is my father.

246
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,710
He's the attorney from upstairs.

247
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,090
He helps us out.

248
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,370
I'm Cha Min Joon.

249
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,310
I've heard a lot about you.

250
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,590
I heard you're helping them out.

251
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,500
Is she asleep?

252
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,520
Yes.

253
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,470
They just gave her some pain killer.

254
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,580
Aigoo, I told her to be careful.

255
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,440
She doesn't listen to me.

256
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,890
Geez...

257
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,750
Shall we grab some coffee?

258
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,880
Is he not here yet?

259
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,860
- Here. 
- Thank you.

260
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,300
Eun Hye and I will stay here.

261
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,930
Go home and get some rest.

262
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,830
It looks like you didn't get any sleep at all.

263
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,450
I'm okay.

264
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,960
By chance...

265
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,790
are you close to Hae Ra?

266
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,940
Pardon?

267
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,240
Aigoo...

268
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,670
I guess I'm being nosy.

269
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,040
If by chance you get close to Hae Ra,

270
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,180
show her your love for her.

271
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,160
It's about time she becomes happy.

272
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,900
So, how long have you known Hae Ra?

273
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,100
I got to know her when she began working as a reporter.

274
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,440
It turns out her mom and I are from the same town.

275
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,230
I cared for her since I also have a daughter.

276
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,080
Go home and get some sleep.

277
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,880
Kang Hae Ra!

278
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,780
Hey, are you crazy? Where do you think you're going in your condition?

279
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,140
I have to confirm with my own eyes.

280
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,000
Hae Ra! Hae...

281
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,870
I'll go with her.

282
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,650
Yeah.

283
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,250
You found it?

284
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,680
Oh, no...

285
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,690
Oh, no...

286
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,280
Hello, are you Hong Seung Ki's mother?

287
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,600
I'm from Sebit Credit Information Company.

288
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,200
Here is a document that says

289
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,980
the payouts from the truck's insurance company and from FB Life

290
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,760
is being turned over to the primary creditor,

291
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,250
Sebit Credit Information Company.

292
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,090
 The truck from the accident? 

293
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,320
   

294
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,250
Who is she?

295
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,660
Hey!

296
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,360
I'm Hong Seung Ki's attorney.

297
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,380
Please talk to me for a moment.

298
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,940
Okay.

299
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,300
   

300
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,890
How can I help you...

301
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,540
   

302
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,590
   

303
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,490
Wait...

304
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,630
You managed to stay alive.

305
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,400
You sure have a long life.

306
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,010
How...

307
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,940
How can you be here?

308
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,010
This is my desk.

309
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,600
Well, I guess...

310
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:11,140
everyone went back to where they belong.

311
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,740
You murderer!

312
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,730
Sue me if you want to.

313
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,590
And I'll show you where you belong very soon.

314
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,860
I have no idea why you two are doing this here.

315
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,810
I just go to people who owe me money

316
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,580
and get the money back.

317
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,580
 That it's being turned over to the primary creditor,  

318
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,550
  Sebit Credit Information Company. 

319
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,650
By chance, did you...

320
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,860
cause that accident on purpose?

321
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,160
When the insurance pays out after the accident,

322
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,040
you wanted to collect the money as his creditor?

323
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,280
Did something happen to your brain from the accident?

324
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,950
Do you have proof?

325
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:10,010
How can you accuse someone of that without any evidence?

326
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:14,300
This is defamation based on a false accusation!

327
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,000
Am I not right, Attorney?

328
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,080
And...

329
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,920
if someone were to be accountable for his death,

330
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,900
don't you think it should be you?

331
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,850
 Stay strong. 

332
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,460
 Her dad has to stay strong for Eun Ji to do so. 

333
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,630
 Kids know when their parents are struggling. 

334
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,930
 Okay. 

335
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,020
 Thank you for everything. 

336
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,380
Kang Hae Ra.

337
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,270
Kang Hae Ra!

338
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,300
   

339
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,470
Where is Hae Ra?

340
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,380
She fell asleep after taking a tranquilizer.

341
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,010
Is he the one?

342
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,560
He wanted to switch the location, thinking we're paparazzi.

343
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,070
We barely managed to have him stay.

344
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,350
Excuse me, sir.

345
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,510
Not again. Why do you keep bothering me?

346
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:55,490
Hello, I'm Attorney Cha Min Joon.

347
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,140
Even an attorney now? Why?

348
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,890
Yesterday's accident in front of the Gamyeongdong tunnel,

349
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,540
if the truck had slowed down,

350
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,740
not that many people would've been injured.

351
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,640
It's not a traffic accident caused by a slippery road.

352
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,330
Then are you saying the truck caused the accident intentionally?

353
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,790
Well, considering the circumstances...

354
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,730
We're saying it's highly probable.

355
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,340
That's why we need your car black box.

356
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,590
But this is far from where the accident occurred.

357
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,690
Yes, I know.

358
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,290
But my sister was on the road where you had parked your car yesterday.

359
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,400
We need a recording from the car behind her car.

360
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,190
I think something must be captured by the car behind her car.

361
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,370
- If you help us out—  
- Oh, yeah.

362
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,680
We need to fix our car's rear bumper, too.

363
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,030
Our car needs lots of repairs.

364
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,290
Yeah, right. We do.

365
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:47,380
Sir, how much does it cost to fix that car's rear bumper?

366
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,460
We'll take over from here.

367
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,520
Mr. Cha, go back to the hospital.

368
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,970
Hae Ra might be awake by now.

369
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,140
- Okay. Call me. 
- Okay.

370
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:22,520
But how can we contact the car owner?

371
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,260
Don't worry about that.

372
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,990
Including the time I was learning my ropes,

373
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,880
I've worked at the PI agency for 30 years.

374
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,810
I know numerous detectives and fixers.

375
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,470
Hi, Uncle. Long time no see.

376
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,590
I was wondering...

377
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,650
I'll send you a few license plate numbers. Can you get me the owners' numbers?

378
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
Yes.

379
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,440
 Cha Min Joon and Kang Hae Ra were just here. 

380
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,020
 They must be both furious. 

381
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,710
Mr. Ko had planted the truck driver.

382
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,630
They'll think this accident is linked to Chairman Kim.

383
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,640
Call them and...

384
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,090
find out if they drove on that road around the accident time.

385
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,220
If they did, tell them what's going on and ask for their black box footage.

386
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,880
Tell them we'll pay.

387
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,850
What if they ask me how I got their number?

388
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,150
What then?

389
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:43,030
Then we'll have to sell out Prosecutor Jang.

390
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,400
Oh, mark the ones who won't cooperate.

391
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,450
Okay.

392
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,990
Yes.

393
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,200
I was wondering if you drove around the accident on Gamyeongdong tunnel yesterday.

394
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,330
No.

395
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,640
That accident may be linked to a crime...

396
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,010
Hello.

397
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,190
When you drove past Gamyeongdong tunnel yesterday,

398
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,350
did you witness an accident between a truck and a sedan?

399
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,410
Yes, excuse me, but...

400
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,100
I was wondering if you drove around the accident on Gamyeongdong tunnel yesterday.

401
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,370
   
I see. I'm sorry to call you so late. 

402
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,710
I'll call the people who didn't answer my call tomorrow.

403
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,900
Five people are sending me their recordings.

404
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,350
I have about that many as well.

405
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,210
The hospital visiting hours are over.

406
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,250
We'll finish watching the footage tomorrow morning.

407
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,280
Let's just go home and rest.

408
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,600
Okay.

409
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,900
Hey.

410
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,700
Will you continue this?

411
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,550
Will you keep using honorifics with me?

412
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,000
Dang it.

413
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,210
You should've never spoken casually with me then.

414
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,590
You spoke casually on your own, and now you speak honorifics.

415
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,110
You. This won't do.

416
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,820
Follow me.

417
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,130
Drink this and get some sleep.

418
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,410
You didn't get any sleep last night.

419
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:13,290
Let's catch the guys who should really be sorry and get punished.

420
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:18,460
And I can't work with people who use honorifics

421
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,360
with me because it's too uncomfortable.

422
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,780
If you'll keep speaking like that, let's work separately.

423
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,680
What are you doing, man?

424
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,240
- Stand up. 
- Oh, Hyungnim.

425
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,070
Aigoo...

426
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,070
Thank you, Hyungnim.

427
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,990
I mean, President.

428
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,910
Did you find out who recorded the video?

429
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,560
Who else?

430
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,490
It's the bastard who's not in there.

431
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,580
Get in the car if you're done. We have a lot to do.

432
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,300
   

433
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,070
Yes.

434
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,490
The truck driver who turned himself in has worked for a credit company.

435
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:47,330
 But the owner is younger than I expected. 

436
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,780
His name is Ko Joon Won. He's only 23 years old.

437
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,200
Ko Joon Won?

438
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,270
Then find out more about him.

439
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,920
His immediate family, relatives. Everyone.

440
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,200
Okay.

441
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,330
Are you awake?

442
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,920
You've been traumatized because of the accident.

443
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,030
You need to rest for a few days.

444
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,940
- If you move around—  
- You heard him.

445
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,310
Mr. Hong...

446
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,890
died because he was with me.

447
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,190
Kang...

448
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,550
works for FB Life.

449
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,970
The truck driver is also linked to FB Life.

450
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,600
It wasn't you.

451
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,690
They were trying to stop the agents from going over to FB Life.

452
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,360
And of all people,

453
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,890
you happened to be in that car.

454
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,890
In any case...

455
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:03,050
I'm the one who suggested switching the protest location.

456
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,090
Kang...

457
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,060
can also hold grudges

458
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,780
against me because of the bond exposé.

459
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,640
For now, take care of yourself.

460
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,050
As for FB Life and Kang...

461
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,630
I'll deal with them from now on.

462
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:28,080
And Mr. Hong was my client as well.

463
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,510
Yes.

464
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,890
 Ko Joon Won's uncle is Ko Deok Soo. Right? 

465
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,980
Ko Deok Soo...

466
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,400
Ko Deok Soo...

467
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,650
Ko Deok Soo?

468
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,490
   

469
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,290
- I'll meet Prosecutor Jang first. 
- Okay.

470
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,480
To bring down Chairman Kim fast,

471
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,080
I'll have to strengthen Director Kim Tae On.

472
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,140
Get me the materials you got on FB.

473
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,980
   

474
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,170
Yes.

475
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,590
Okay, I'll do that.

476
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,810
Okay.

477
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,800
   

478
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,140
Something came up for Mr. Cha. He's on his way out.

479
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,860
Then send me the black box footages you received.

480
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,260
I just sent them to you.

481
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,280
I'll call you from the hospital, depending on how it goes.

482
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:56,290
    
 Tell me your secret.

483
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,410
How did you get that particular man to like you?

484
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,110
These are civil complaints

485
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:08,050
filed against Chairman Kim submitted to the citizen group.

486
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,890
His abuse of power cases are included as well.

487
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,040
   

488
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,930
Didn't you say you'll remove only Chairman Kim?

489
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,890
If you release this,

490
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,950
you'll damage our corporate image as well.

491
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,860
We can make it into a risk owner issue.

492
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,370
If risk owner issues are repeated for Chairman Kim,

493
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,440
the shareholders won't let that slide.

494
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,660
And if you add your effort...

495
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,620
Effort?

496
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:52,880
You're doing nothing but waiting.

497
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,270
Do you think anyone would want to work with you?

498
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,000
From the shareholders' perspective, I'm sure they think that

499
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,670
you'll inherit Chairman Kim's shares.

500
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,630
Don't try to turn your back on Chairman Kim,

501
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,480
but be more aggressive...

502
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,680
in showing them your effort in the generational shift in management.

503
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,000
I'll get going then.

504
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,690
Is she all right?

505
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,130
Kang Hae Ra.

506
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,990
I heard she got into an accident.

507
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,350
Your hunting isn't over,

508
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:58,030
but I heard there's a problem with your hunting dog.

509
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,890
Let me know if you need my help anytime.

510
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,540
Will do that.

511
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,440
Arrogant bastard.

512
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,070
Show some effort?

513
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,820
Report to me every detail

514
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,530
what Cha Min Joon is up to.

515
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,880
Yes.

516
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,110
 When Director Kim Tae On makes her move, 

517
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:05,340
Chairman Kim will try to cover up things he's been up to.

518
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,720
Before that, we must obtain files

519
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,370
  on businesses and partners that may be paper companies. 

520
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,050
Open it.

521
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,290
   

522
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,550
I guess you didn't know, either.

523
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,010
Your sister gave birth to...

524
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,950
my son.

525
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,670
   

526
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,100
    
He's in Canada right now.

527
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,090
All this time...

528
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:48,680
a woman named Kang Hae Ra raised him.

529
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:57,280
   

530
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,950
 How could Kang Hae Ra have Noona's son? 

531
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:03,420
 Before she arrived at the hospital, 

532
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,290
    
 the unborn baby was already dead. 

533
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,960
   

534
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,940
 Hi, Ga On. 

535
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,890
 I'm eating right now. 

536
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,910
Right now...

537
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:34,630
I'm using all of my network and my ability

538
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,280
to find Yi Yeon.

539
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,180
Your sister.

540
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,210
Before that...

541
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,790
I'd like to bring him back here safely.

542
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,710
Drink this.

543
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,120
Yes.

544
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,060
 Is this Kang Hae Ra's cellphone? 

545
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,520
 I'm calling from FBC's News Nine. 

546
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,600
 I've been enjoying the recordings you posted on Live Revenge Agency. 

547
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,590
 I'd like to invite you as a guest on our News Nine. 

548
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,920
   

549
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,650
   

550
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:55,900
 What does your text mean? 

551
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,930
 Why Canada and why ask about Korean residents there? 

552
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,520
She had a child.

553
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:04,780
Noona gave birth to Chairman Kim's child.

554
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,220
Hold on.

555
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,540
What?

556
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,150
To see if Kang Hae Ra's child is my sister's child,

557
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:12,150
I need to check with my own eyes.

558
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,300
And if he's truly my sister's child,

559
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:19,750
I'm sure Noona is near the child.

560
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,530
What in the world?

561
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,150
Gosh, look at her.

562
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,920
This isn't a straight forward accident.

563
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,970
I clearly saw...

564
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,640
Kang's face with my own eyes.

565
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,070
Both the truck driver and Kang...

566
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,030
They're both linked to FB Life.

567
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,190
That's what scares me more.

568
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,800
That's why I want to quit.

569
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,800
If we give up now,

570
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,820
stuff like this will repeat.

571
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,950
When you go through something like this again,

572
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:07,300
you'll learn to accept it.

573
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,900
More than anything, Mr. Hong...

574
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,420
We can't let him die so meaninglessly.

575
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:27,510
What more do you need?

576
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,830
Reveal my face and my voice...

577
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,630
and say everything I want to say? Is that it?

578
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,340
And...

579
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,930
what I had to suffer through...

580
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,070
Should I talk about that?

581
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:49,090
Say that I feel something is very strange about this accident?

582
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,370
Why are you back so soon?

583
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,690
I'll put an exposé together.

584
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:12,980
We have our backups of the interview

585
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,400
with Mr. Hong and agents, right?

586
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,160
Find them for me.

587
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,000
And this is the file we've gathered, right?

588
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,100
My gosh.

589
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,840
- You're driving me nuts... 
- Rush over...

590
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,200
and interview the insurance agents.

591
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,230
Keep your eye on her. I'll be right back.

592
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:52,260
There has to be a complaint that FB Life sent to Mr. Hong's wife.

593
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:19,820
If you've been in this field for three years,

594
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,990
you must be better than me.

595
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,220
What?

596
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,590
Help me...

597
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,850
Hyung.

598
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,690
 I'm going overseas on a business trip. 

599
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,890
 Watch over Kang Hae Ra in the meantime. 

600
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,490
   

601
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,820
Here are the insurance policies.

602
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,140
These are complaints that the insurance agents received.

603
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,670
And the right of indemnity they received.

604
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,680
Here is the file on Mr. Hong's wife's case.

605
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:10,390
And this is the information on the truck driver that Mr. Cha compiled.

606
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,150
Thank you.

607
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:36,420
   

608
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,230
   

609
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,060
Sunbae.

610
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,550
I should mark the anomalies between agent training materials

611
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:48,100
and the policies, right?

612
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,750
Hello.

613
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:11,110
I'm Ga On's father's attorney. I had called you.

614
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,970
   

615
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,600
Come in.

616
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,890
 Come in. 

617
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,160
 Noona. 

618
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,500
 Hi, you came. 

619
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,240
    
Excuse me?

620
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,080
News Nine?

621
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,000
Starting tonight?

622
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,050
You heard from the press director, right?

623
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,820
Here is the file for tonight's show with the guest.

624
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,740
Please give me the script and video clips you brought with you.

625
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,210
Here is the script.

626
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,720
Here you go.

627
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,970
Starting today, we have a new anchorwoman.

628
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,640
This is Anchorwoman Jung Joo Yeon.

629
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,640
Ms. Jung, this is...

630
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,790
Hello.

631
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,660
I have enjoyed your videos on VTube.

632
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,290
I'm Jung Joo Yeon.

633
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,700
I'm Kang Hae Ra.

634
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:06,450
   

635
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,920
For tonight's News Nine guest,

636
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,310
we have VTuber Kang Hae Ra with us.

637
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,920
Hello.

638
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,130
Hello, I'm Kang Hae Ra.

639
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,580
Yes, the contents you have posted recently have all gone viral.

640
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,590
So our expectations for new content has been raised.

641
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,600
So you'll reveal a never-seen-before episode on our News Nine tonight?

642
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:28,970
Yes.

643
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:33,110
The new episode for Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency

644
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:35,140
is about FB Life's tyranny

645
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,480
against powerless insurance agents

646
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,090
and those who were involved in a mysterious accident

647
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:42,220
while protesting against them.

648
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:46,270
 FB Life, drop the lawsuits against the agents! 

649
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:48,220
 Drop the lawsuits! Drop the lawsuits! 

650
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,370
 We did what we were told! 

651
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,260
It's almost Ga On's arrival time.

652
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,100
Let's go.

653
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,640
Would you need to go yourself?

654
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,150
No, no.

655
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,660
I should go myself.

656
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:28,890
The next file you see

657
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,910
is the insurance product policy

658
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:33,090
that were distributed to insurance agents

659
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:35,210
and the ones that were used

660
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,620
while signing up clients.

661
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,020
As you can see,

662
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,500
there are differences between training product policy

663
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,480
and client product policy.

664
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,750
You're saying they deceived the insurance agents first.

665
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,690
Could you explain a mysterious accident that the

666
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:55,490
insurance agents were involved in while going up against FB Life?

667
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:57,010
A few days ago,

668
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,450
while an informer who filed a complaint against FB Life

669
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:02,960
got into an accident and died while he was on his way

670
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,180
to protest in front of the FB Life building.

671
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,530
Based on our investigation,

672
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:13,380
the truck driver who turned himself in

673
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,660
was confirmed to be linked to a credit company

674
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,440
that is a subsidiary of FB Life.

675
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:24,680
Are you talking about the connection between the informant's accident and FB Life?

676
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,720
 I'm saying there are many links to them 

677
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,710
 to discount it just as a coincidence. 

678
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:34,890
 That will be all with VTuber, Kang Hae Ra. 

679
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:55,120
Please go to Incheon Airport.

680
00:55:58,810 --> 00:56:00,260
   

681
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,350
  The call is not going through. After the beep...  

682
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,760
   

683
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,210
Ahjumma.

684
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,770
Ga On's father's attorney came by

685
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,570
and took Ga On.

686
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:22,290
I was wondering if you settled things with his father.

687
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,750
 Should I visit Ga On? 

688
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:35,470
 Passengers, 

689
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,300
 our plane will land at Incheon Airport shortly. 

690
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,700
 For your safety, please put on your seat belt. 

691
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:58,330
Yes.

692
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,010
Yes, I got it.

693
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:02,970
They just left the gate.

694
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:04,250
Okay.

695
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:27,330
Mr. Cha?

696
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,590
Ga On.

697
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,020
Ga On!

698
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,960
Mom!

699
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,730
It's the DNA test...

700
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,370
and a form to request a change of paternity rights.

701
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,960
Change of paternity rights?

702
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:11,750
Ga On is Chairman Kim Sang Goo's son,

703
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,460
so from now on, I'll make sure

704
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:25,080
Chairman Kim has all the paternal rights and custody.

705
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:14,830
♫  I'm facing the end of our passion  ♫

706
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:22,330
♫  Carrying the memories of us together to bridge the gap  ♫

707
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:25,500
♫  As you go away  ♫

708
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:33,500
♫  I let go of your hand that I held tightly as I turn around  ♫

709
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,200
♫  At the edge where I can't touch you any more  ♫

710
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:44,520
♫  The words circling in my head  ♫

711
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:54,070
 

712
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:03,130
