1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:06,850
  			 

2
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,170
   

3
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,880
Hello?

4
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,160
Min Joon.

5
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,770
It's me.

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,600
I'm fine, so don't worry about me.

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,700
Noona, where are you?

8
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,720
 - I'll be right there.  
 - I'm fine.

9
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,910
 So... 

10
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,760
don't try too hard to find me.

11
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,990
All right?

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,610
 I'll call you again. 

13
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,290
Noona, don't hang up! Noona! Noona!

14
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,640
 I'm fine. 

15
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,980
 So... 

16
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,850
   

17
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,970
How about the baby?

18
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,040
I don't see him.

19
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,400
Throw it out.

20
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,340
As is?

21
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,550
Her name is listed on the passenger list.

22
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,420
When the body comes up, they'll think she died on the ship.

23
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,810
All right.

24
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,470
But you know...

25
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,260
of all ships, how could the one she was going on

26
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,170
get into an accident like that?

27
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,400
We didn't have to come here if we knew the ship would sink.

28
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,390
Be sure to finish the job this time.

29
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,050
Got it.

30
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,330
   

31
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,440
   

32
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,920
Ga On, you'll have to stay with me.

33
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,510
What are you talking about?

34
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,870
Ga On is part of my family now.

35
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,880
While Father is away,

36
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,350
I think it's right that his older sister takes care of him.

37
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,060
Ga On, stay with me from now on.

38
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,020
I think people will start coming soon.

39
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,260
Do you want to talk here?

40
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,390
Why we're all standing here like this?

41
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,760
You didn't want to have Ga On...

42
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,830
be revealed to the world.

43
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,760
You can't take Ga On anymore.

44
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,470
I'll protect him.

45
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,880
Let's go.

46
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,460
He's not even your kid, yet

47
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,600
why are you so attached to him?

48
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,230
Is it because he's a child of the person you destroyed?

49
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,430
You exposed Cha Yi Hyeon's scandal

50
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,650
and ruined her life. So you feel guilty?

51
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,630
How did you know about that?

52
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,200
I was wondering why you were all over the place.

53
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,840
It turns out you were the reporter who exposed Chae Yi Hyeon's scandal.

54
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,580
I heard you two were close alumni.

55
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,410
I think your relationship with each other is so ironic.

56
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,190
Not as ironic as you and the chairman.

57
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,300
I can't even believe that

58
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,140
you two are family.

59
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,440
Chairman Kim was taken to the Prosecutors' Office just now.

60
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,460
Are you getting ready?

61
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,820
Yes. If you can stop Chairman Kim's people

62
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,690
from pressuring us,

63
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,950
 there's no problem in reporting. 

64
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,910
 More than that, how about Kang Hae Ra? 

65
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,190
I'm sure she's working diligently on it.

66
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,100
She wouldn't want Chairman Kim freed more than anyone else.

67
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,500
Okay.

68
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,380
Feel free to call me.

69
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,210
Have a seat.

70
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,840
What is Kang Hae Ra doing here?

71
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,880
She also wants to drag down Chairman Kim.

72
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,430
I don't know what your reasons are, but...

73
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,290
will you run away like last time?

74
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,930
VTube is also reporting.

75
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,900
How can I trust and work with someone

76
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,730
who took off when things got tough?

77
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,010
If another obstacle gets in the way,

78
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,270
you can do that again.

79
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,980
The first time is the hardest.

80
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,330
It gets easier after that.

81
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,300
I wouldn't even be sitting here if you did your job, to begin with.

82
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,860
The TV didn't do the job that I was hoping for.

83
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,600
Someone who ran off out of fear shouldn't be saying this.

84
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,150
Don't you dare...

85
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,570
turn over files relevant to Chairman Kim to others.

86
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,360
The first time is the hardest.

87
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,030
It gets easier after that.

88
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,620
Are things going well?

89
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,380
Yeah, I'm almost done editing files that Do Yoon gave me.

90
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Ga On, I'm going to work.

91
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,390
Sit on the sofa for a while.

92
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,970
Okay.

93
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,920
So, you're Ga On.

94
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,830
Wow, you're so handsome.

95
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,670
I just have to finish editing the voice file.

96
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,340
Sit here and wait.

97
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,790
I'll play with you.

98
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,760
Okay.

99
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,830
Do you want to do this?

100
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,110
Yes, I like this.

101
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,300
All right.

102
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,730
Sunbaenim, we're ready for you.

103
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,120
Okay.

104
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,320
This is Jung Joo Yeon's "Come to an End."

105
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,500
The first case to see to the end is

106
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,730
Key Ferry accident that has come to light

107
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,520
only after eleven years.

108
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,760
The stories that involve politicians and business figures linked to the accident.

109
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,460
Kang Hae Ra also started broadcasting.

110
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,010
    
  Gosh, the whole neighborhood was in mourning because of that accident. 

111
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,290
 Some guy who came from Seoul said 

112
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,760
 we had to disassemble the ship as soon as possible. 

113
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,320
 He said he'd pay extra if we're fast. 

114
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,240
 So we worked to disassemble the ship for a few days. 

115
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,640
 It's a testimony of a worker who participated in the disassembly at the time. 

116
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,950
For what reason did Gunmyeong Shipping

117
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,460
have to perform the disassembly that fast?

118
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,000
 Also, to disassemble the vessel before the accurate cause of the accident 

119
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,890
 is definitely illegal, but 

120
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,610
 why didn't the officials not do anything about it? 

121
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,670
   
 He's not talking at all. 

122
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,290
   
 He's pleading the fifth. 

123
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,630
Where is his lawyer?

124
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,450
Director Kim Tae On must be behind it.

125
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,700
No one showed up yet.

126
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,100
He's a chairman of a conglomerate.

127
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,250
This is the first time I've seen where they leave him alone.

128
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,690
I'm embarrassed for him.

129
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,420
Why don't you just let it go now?

130
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,180
Are you doing this...

131
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,700
because your sister went missing due to that ferry accident?

132
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,920
Her name was on the passenger list, but

133
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,780
Yi Hyeon wasn't on that ship.

134
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,410
I know that.

135
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,160
You still don't know what you've done wrong.

136
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,290
Like my sister, on that ship...

137
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,890
the passengers and crew with family...

138
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,400
People were on that ship.

139
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,200
There are some still missing who haven't come back to their family.

140
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,630
I just don't get it.

141
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,320
Why are you asking me about an accident

142
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,670
that happened eleven years ago?

143
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,280
And the vessels that I imported recently

144
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,630
aren't even in operation, let alone an accident.

145
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,100
Do you think the people on that ship were the only victim?

146
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,670
You ruined their family's lives overnight.

147
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,190
And you're still...

148
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,830
trying to fulfill your greed rather than be regretful.

149
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,270
Even though the potential for another accident is there.

150
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,680
I guess you're not made to do big things.

151
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,520
If you consider each and every individual's emotions like that,

152
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,330
I mean...

153
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,890
how would you lead an enormous corporation like ours?

154
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,820
Using the numbers and dollars

155
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,040
you like so much, I'll tell you what you did wrong.

156
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,740
With an astronomical amount of fines

157
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,460
and imprisonment for the rest of your life.

158
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,400
You should pray desperately that my sister is alive somewhere.

159
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,060
If you don't want to pay for her life as well.

160
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,340
 Some guy who came from Seoul said 

161
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,090
 we had to disassemble the ship as soon as possible. 

162
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,680
 He said he'd pay extra if we're fast. 

163
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,620
 Do you remember what the guy from Seoul looks like? 

164
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,430
 I'm not sure. 

165
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,520
 Is he one of these people? 

166
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,630
 Yeah, yeah. It's him. 

167
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,680
A man who worked on the disassembly

168
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,770
remembers your face, Mr. Ko.

169
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,980
I know full well that it was you that reported

170
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,100
Choi Do Yoon as the CEO of Seomyeong Shipping.

171
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,000
I can turn this into the Prosecutors' Office.

172
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,350
Okay, done!

173
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,580
I think that's good enough.

174
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,050
It looks good.

175
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,770
Let's eat.

176
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,720
The responses are good.

177
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,800
I'm hungry.

178
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,420
Wipe your hands first.

179
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,820
Thanks.

180
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,450
Look at you.

181
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,710
Cleaning your hands before you eat is basic.

182
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,620
You're worse than an elementary school kid.

183
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,900
I was working all this time.

184
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,960
How about you? Did you clean your hands?

185
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,550
I didn't touch a pizza yet.

186
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,990
Ga On, give me one, please.

187
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,400
Thanks.

188
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,760
Okay, let's eat.

189
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,670
Looks good.

190
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,140
Mom, you eat, too.

191
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,650
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

192
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,290
It's good.

193
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,900
What happened to Do Yoon hyung?

194
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,330
He'll be released tomorrow morning.

195
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,200
Are you going to go?

196
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,330
I have to go to the Prosecutors' Office.

197
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,690
So I came to ask for a favor.

198
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,960
I'll go see Do Yoon hyung.

199
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,710
I'll go with you.

200
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,800
We'll go to Do Yoon. Don't worry.

201
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,120
Thank you.

202
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,270
Please pick him up tomorrow morning.

203
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,070
Mr. Cha.

204
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,800
Have some pizza since you're here.

205
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
We just got started.

206
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,540
No thanks.

207
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,700
Eat with us.

208
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,940
   

209
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,040
Whoa, you two will sleep holding tightly like that?

210
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,700
- Yeah. 
 - Yes.

211
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,350
Gosh, I'm so lonely.

212
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,050
Who will comfort me in my loneliness?

213
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,070
Weren't you dating Hyun Sung hyung?

214
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,350
What?

215
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,180
What is he saying?

216
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,640
Ga On, I thought you were a good boy.

217
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,260
Was I wrong?

218
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,740
You can't fool a child.

219
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,940
What are you saying? Hey, you too?

220
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,590
How can I date a guy like that?

221
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,200
Hey, Ga On, did you notice that, too?

222
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,290
Yeah.

223
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,100
Geez, you two.

224
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,010
Stop it. Stop it now.

225
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,020
All right, we'll stop.

226
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,980
If you're bored, go downstairs and play with Hyun Sung a little longer.

227
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,400
- We'll sleep like this. 
 - Okay.

228
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,600
Mom.

229
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,110
I just ought to...

230
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,320
Geez, fine, sleep, sleep!

231
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,190
Come on now.

232
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,440
Aigoo!

233
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,260
See? Look how much room I have.

234
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,890
I'm not lonely at all. Not at all.

235
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,780
Ga On.

236
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,300
You know, I think that girl likes you.

237
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,960
No, she doesn't.

238
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,320
I think so. She likes you, and that's why she tried to talk to you.

239
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,340
Mom, I only look handsome to you.

240
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,340
Is that right?

241
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,090
I don't think so.

242
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,900
So cute. Come here.

243
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,510
Let's go to sleep.

244
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,660
- Goodnight. 
 - Goodnight.

245
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Here.

246
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,670
    
 They're complaints that the insurance agents had filed against FB Life.

247
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,250
I think you should add these.

248
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,490
Okay.

249
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,960
If we add this on top of others, it will pressure him more.

250
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,270
How is Kang doing?

251
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,950
The doctor says he might wake up soon.

252
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,060
I said we'll proceed with the investigation as soon as he wakes up.

253
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,880
I'll call you when I hear from the hospital.

254
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,040
Okay.

255
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,480
    
 There are more complaints.

256
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Then shall we begin again?

257
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,250
   

258
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,170
It's not just anyone. It's the chairman.

259
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,520
As I told you yesterday,

260
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,780
his scandal this time

261
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,870
will not be defended by the company legal team.

262
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,940
Many people are watching us.

263
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,720
- If we leave him like this... 
 - That's why.

264
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,610
Many people are watching, so you should come to your senses.

265
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:12,480
All the politicians and business figures close to Chairman are denying the connection.

266
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,580
If we side with him as a company hastily,

267
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,000
don't you know the foundation of our group will be shaken?

268
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,640
Don't you recognize how serious the situation is?

269
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,510
We must wrap up this scandal

270
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,860
as the Chairman's deviation as an individual.

271
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,800
That's how the entire FB Group will overcome this crisis.

272
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,920
I'll pause the effort to switch to holding companies

273
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,130
and other projects that the Chairman has been leading.

274
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,890
 You were craving this as soon as you woke up? 

275
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,520
Yeah. I really wanted to eat it.

276
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,490
I think we're their first customers.

277
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,920
I wanted to make you something delicious.

278
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,960
Were you uncomfortable last night?

279
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,170
I was so happy to sleep next to you!

280
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,990
Ga On.

281
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,110
I want to tell you something.

282
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,880
You know your birth mom who gave birth to you?

283
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,110
She...

284
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,490
really wanted to protect you well.

285
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,540
The same goes for me, too.

286
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,930
I had no idea you were struggling so much in Canada having those thoughts.

287
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm sorry that I didn't know how you felt.

288
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:50,320
I know you did that to protect me.

289
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,630
Now, I'll protect you, Mom.

290
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,570
I won't be picky about food,

291
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,550
and I'll play sports really hard.

292
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,980
I'll grow tall and grow strong.

293
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,580
I'll make sure no one hurts you.

294
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,800
Enjoy.

295
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,490
It looks so good.

296
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,300
Let's eat. Eat plenty.

297
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,890
Eat slowly, Ga On. Drink water.

298
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,210
And I want to go somewhere with you after we eat.

299
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,700
Where?

300
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,610
You'll find out.

301
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,150
It's a selfie photo studio?

302
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,680
Yeah. Not the cellphone photos, but...

303
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,620
I wanted to have a real photo.

304
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,420
In my days, we had sticker photos.

305
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,390
How do you do this?

306
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,680
Mom.

307
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,550
- Look over there. 
 - Where?

308
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,910
Where the camera is. Over there.

309
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,940
- Over there? Okay. 
 - Okay.

310
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,670
- I'll take it. 
 - Okay.

311
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,740
One, two.

312
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,900
- I'll take it again. 
 - Okay.

313
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,610
One, two.

314
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,760
One, two.

315
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,130
    
 The news will focus on Chairman Kim's

316
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,180
personal deviation for his slush funds.

317
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,480
To close the accident investigation quickly, I'll report that

318
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,550
Chairman Kim's people lobbied politicians.

319
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,090
Will you mention the Prosecutors' Office?

320
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,890
No, I won't mention people in the law.

321
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:47,150
Well, the prosecution is still investigating Chairman Kim.

322
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,160
Even if I mention them, I'll lead it toward the message

323
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
that they should not go easy

324
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,000
just because he's a chairman.

325
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,780
I don't think I need to turn them into my enemy.

326
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,680
That'd be good.

327
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,010
More than that, I'm more concerned about Kang Hae Ra.

328
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,060
Kang Hae Ray, that woman. Based on her actions so far,

329
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,510
she doesn't look like she'll stop at an appropriate moment.

330
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,470
Have you thought of how you'll handle Kang Hae Ra

331
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,560
if she becomes too difficult to control

332
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,400
or after everything is over?

333
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,790
Actually, I'm thinking if I should finish her off

334
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,800
right about now.

335
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,900
She bothers me in so many different ways.

336
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,400
That is true, but...

337
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,500
you can't ignore the influence Kang Hae Ra's channel has.

338
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,310
How about we put on a restraint on her?

339
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,310
Kang Hae Ra's channel has many subscribers

340
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,120
and the issues that are featured on her channel

341
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,630
tend to get reproduced on the news often.

342
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,690
Since Chairman Kim's issue hasn't been wrapped up,

343
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,670
we can use Kang Hae Ra as long as we need her

344
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,480
and when the time is right...

345
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,730
we toss her fake news that she might like.

346
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,290
Put on a restraint on Kang Hae Ra by using her own method.

347
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,740
Do you have anything in mind?

348
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,400
There is something I have thought of.

349
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,510
What's that?

350
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,640
Eat it.

351
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,520
You have to eat this to drive away bad luck.

352
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,590
Yes, eat it.

353
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,000
He went to the market to get it for you this morning.

354
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,310
Where is Do Yoon?

355
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,630
He's meeting the victims' families with Mr. Cha

356
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,800
in the office.

357
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,530
Then let's prepare our sequel.

358
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,200
This is the start of a real fight.

359
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,780
Will you be okay?

360
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,610
You're going up against Chairman Kim ultimately.

361
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,810
Chairman Kim is not regretful about his past wrongdoings.

362
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:10,130
It's sickening to me that he's trying to do the same thing again.

363
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,480
We don't know who will get hurt next time.

364
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,680
We must get rid of someone who is like a ticking time bomb.

365
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,950
Do Yoon said he'll meet the crewmen's families

366
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,630
and ask if they're willing to expose on our channel.

367
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,900
Please let me know if you hear from the victims' families.

368
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,070
We have to lead in the same direction anyway.

369
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,340
Don't upload it without discussing it with me.

370
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,900
Who the heck are you to tell us what to do?

371
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,880
Why don't you find out yourself?

372
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,870
We found all the difficult reporting materials you broadcasted so far.

373
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,980
All you did was put a bow on top, and now what?

374
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,590
You want us to report and get your permission now?

375
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,030
Did you forget?

376
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,220
She badmouthed our channel on the news.

377
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,800
Saying that Live Revenge Agency is harmful to teenagers...

378
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,420
and it's bad for our society

379
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,820
so the government should regulate and whatnot.

380
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,520
Are you laughing at what I said?

381
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,430
Is he Hyun Sung?

382
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,670
Yes, come and sit over here.

383
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,330
As I've heard, you have a hot temper.

384
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,390
It means your acting is good.

385
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,760
What the heck?

386
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,620
What's with you guys?

387
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,280
So, is the "New World" mission doable?

388
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,530
Acting isn't for everyone.

389
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,120
When I met with Director Kim and Hae Ra a few days ago,

390
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,380
I got so nervous.

391
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,890
Then that spark...

392
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,320
Would it be okay if I turned up the heat?

393
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,450
What if you take that spark

394
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,390
and turn it into something like the movie, "New World"?

395
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,550
Like the movie, play the double agent like Lee Jung Jae.

396
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,680
Expose Chairman Kim's corruption

397
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,610
and if you find out FB Life's corruption,

398
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,860
turn it over to us as well.

399
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,780
Are you not interested?

400
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,290
No, I think it's a good idea.

401
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,130
We have to go to that extent to get the bad guys.

402
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,000
Oh, Director Kim Tae On

403
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,100
wanted to get rid of your channel right away.

404
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,070
But I stopped her for now, saying that I'd look for another way.

405
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,700
I expected it. Of course, she does.

406
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,100
She wants to use our channel only to destroy Chairman Kim.

407
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,770
All this time...

408
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,110
you acted as if you were on Kim Tae On's side?

409
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,710
Why?

410
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,410
Were you victimized by them somehow?

411
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,480
Eleven years ago,

412
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,750
I saw how fast the Key Ferry accident wrapped up.

413
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,560
So I investigated it with my mentor.

414
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,350
But my mentor got fired

415
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,950
and I'm the only one who managed to stay in.

416
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,030
Chairman Kim and Director Kim...

417
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,820
They think reporters are some accessory components to the organization.

418
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,740
They've been using us to cover up their corruption.

419
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,330
I want to show them that reporters are not meant for that.

420
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,490
More than that, reporters have families, and they're people.

421
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:27,740
They threaten their livelihood and make them do their dirty work.

422
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,920
I want to revenge them for being called "trashy reporters."

423
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,100
It's just the beginning.

424
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,200
Let's wrap up Chairman Kim's case

425
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,060
and expose Director Kim's deeds to the world.

426
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,450
Welcome.

427
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,870
I'm sorry about everything.

428
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,660
From now on, let's work together.

429
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,950
Yes.

430
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,170
Come in this way.

431
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,110
You had it tough.

432
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,750
Sorry I couldn't pick you up.

433
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,550
You had it tougher.

434
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,620
Did you wrap up the investigation well?

435
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,560
- Yeah. Let's go in. 
 - Okay.

436
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:34,310
    
 Mr. Cha's office is putting together complaints by the victims' families.

437
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,400
Should I get an interview after they're done?

438
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,780
Yeah. It will be good to interview them about

439
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,170
how they're fighting the shipping company and

440
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,700
how they were after the accident.

441
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,960
I'll go ask what time they'll be done.

442
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,700
Ga On. Did you finish your movie?

443
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,490
Yeah. Can I do the puzzle I was working on yesterday?

444
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,750
Gosh, of course.

445
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,140
Come here.

446
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,480
Ga On is so cute.

447
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,500
 He's not even your kid, 

448
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,370
 why are you so attached to him? 

449
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,870
 You exposed Cha Yi Hyeon's scandal 

450
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,810
 and ruined her life. So you feel guilty? 

451
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,360
Eun Hye, I have to go and find out something.

452
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,920
Will you look after Ga On?

453
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,590
Okay, sure.

454
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,820
Yes, got it.

455
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,910
There's another complaint.

456
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,210
You're like a sweet potato.

457
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,440
When you pull one out of the ground,

458
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,930
there are so many others that get pulled with it.

459
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,070
 So that materials from back then... 

460
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,370
Where did you get it before you gave it to me?

461
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,280
What do you mean where?

462
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,720
I didn't think of this back then, but

463
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,650
exposing Yi Hyeon sunbae...

464
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,950
I was the first one, and it was the beginning.

465
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,900
I should've checked it out more carefully back then.

466
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,370
I mean...

467
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,420
To put it bluntly,

468
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,540
you hit it big, thanks to exposing that scandal.

469
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,830
You became so famous that you got to marry Lee Hoon Seok.

470
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,130
And you got to live happily ever after.

471
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,180
Why are you doing this now?

472
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,640
I lived happily ever after that?

473
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,470
I had no idea who Yi Hyeon sunbae's scandal was going after,

474
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,210
and I just trusted your file

475
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,870
and exposed it on the air.

476
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,920
I need to know now.

477
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,530
Where did that file come from?

478
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,870
It's been more than ten years.

479
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,240
I don't know. Whatever.

480
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,680
I don't remember.

481
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,790
It's the bank statement you gave me then.

482
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,720
The statement that contains

483
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,960
the transaction between Yi Hyeon sunbae and her sponsor.

484
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,360
I still have the officetel address you gave me then.

485
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,580
I'll have to turn these things to the police

486
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,090
and find out who the owner of the

487
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,550
- bank account and the officetel. 
 - What are you doing?

488
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,640
So, tell me!

489
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,510
Chairman Kim's interview was scheduled as a special.

490
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,080
    
  Chairman Kim picked out 

491
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,210
 Cha Yi Hyeon for the interview. 

492
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,860
 Wednesday? 

493
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,480
 I record Entertainment News that day. 

494
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,020
 This is a very important interview. 

495
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,570
 Then I'll talk to the PD and the writer of the show. 

496
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,730
 I was right. 

497
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,030
 - Thank you. 
 - Sure. 

498
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,430
 Chairman Kim had an ulterior motive with Cha Yi Hyeon. 

499
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,630
 After the interview that day, 

500
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,060
 there was so much pressure for me to 

501
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,050
 set up dinner with Cha Yi Hyeon. 

502
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,350
 I'm really fine. 

503
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,110
 Go and enjoy, PD. 

504
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,890
 How can I do that? 

505
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,420
 I'm sorry. I really have to go. 

506
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,600
 I'm sorry. 

507
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,070
 President will be there, too. 

508
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,440
 This is a continuation of work. 

509
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,740
 You're not a newbie. Why are you so cut and dry? 

510
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,070
 It's really just dinner, right? 

511
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,530
 That's what I said. 

512
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,760
 I'll text you. Come to that place later. 

513
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,590
   

514
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,450
 And soon after, Yi Hyeon 

515
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,170
 quit work at the station saying health issues. 

516
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,490
 Sunbaenim, are you okay? 

517
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,630
 Yeah, I'm okay. 

518
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,390
 Some said she's getting ready to get married 

519
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,150
 or she must be pregnant. People talked a lot. 

520
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,790
 Then a man visited me. 

521
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,390
 I'll pretend I didn't hear this. 

522
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,910
 From your outsourcing production company, 

523
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,360
 you received ten million won. 

524
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,610
 I don't think this was the only time, right? 

525
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,050
 I had no choice. 

526
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,130
 If I got fired from the station over that incident... 

527
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,240
 I have three kids who need to go to college. 

528
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,660
 That's why... 

529
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,250
 And this is... 

530
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,860
 a pretty big scandal. 

531
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,380
 Come see me if you're interested. 

532
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,700
 It doesn't suit my program. 

533
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,850
How could you do that?

534
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,680
I'm sorry.

535
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,390
I couldn't help it.

536
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,090
 Hae Ra, stay strong. 

537
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,000
 I'll cheer you on always. 

538
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,910
Kang Hae Ra went to see FBC's general manager.

539
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,370
I'm sure she knows her place now.

540
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:00,300
Why she shouldn't be creating too many waves.

541
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,400
How about Cha Min Joon?

542
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,980
Recently, he went to a women's recovery center

543
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,320
and ob/gyn offices in Gunsan.

544
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,580
He continues to stop by Kang's hospital room.

545
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,570
 Cha Yi Hyeon saw an ob/gyn there. 

546
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:37,910
I can't let this one go.

547
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,960
Chairman Kim's arrest warrant hasn't been issued?

548
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,330
No.

549
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,000
I need to meet Chairman Kim.

550
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,840
   

551
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,490
What brings you here?

552
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,210
I'll be out soon.

553
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,360
Isn't that why you didn't get me a lawyer?

554
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,340
Today is grandma's memorial day. You know, right?

555
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,740
Come to your uncle's house on time.

556
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,510
Today...

557
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:24,600
I'll introduce Ga On to grandma and our relatives.

558
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,550
It would be nice for the family to be together for such an occasion.

559
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,530
Do you think you can make it to Uncle's house?

560
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,540
Of course, I should go.

561
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,830
It's a memorial that happens only once a year.

562
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:47,160
And you must make it tonight.

563
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,500
You won't get to see them for about five years.

564
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,650
Yesterday and today, I've been thinking a lot here.

565
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,170
How should I raise Ga On...

566
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,610
and...

567
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,860
what should I do with you...

568
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,610
So I was thinking...

569
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:18,860
since you're going to China,

570
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:23,460
why don't you go to India and Russia as well?

571
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,220
And if you still don't change,

572
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,610
find something else to do that suits your personality. That's another way.

573
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,900
I'll support you that much.

574
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:40,590
I think you're too sure about getting past this crisis.

575
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,410
I'm concerned that you might be disappointed.

576
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,710
Don't worry.

577
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,670
They say a crisis is another opportunity.

578
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,860
I'll take this opportunity to clean up my connections.

579
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,170
At a time like this, I can find out for sure

580
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:08,470
if people around me are

581
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,550
for me or not.

582
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,130
Since you're sitting there alone,

583
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,850
I don't think you need to clean up your connections.

584
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,710
Well?

585
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:26,040
I still have some time left.

586
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,820
Then clean up the rest...

587
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,700
sitting over there comfortably.

588
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,420
But Tae On.

589
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,870
Where is...

590
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,270
Cha Yi Hyeon?

591
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,800
I couldn't find her anywhere.

592
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,990
There are traces of her being chased.

593
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,430
When I get out of here,

594
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,570
I'll look into Cha Yi Hyeon first.

595
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,900
Whether she's alive...

596
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,550
or dead.

597
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,300
If she's dead,

598
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,240
who killed her?

599
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,660
Even though you're my daughter, if you did that...

600
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,520
I don't think I can ever forgive you.

601
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,960
Ms. Yeon.

602
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,980
Find out who just went into the interrogation room.

603
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,290
Yes, ma'am.

604
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,670
You made an old man wait.

605
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,640
If you showed up a little later,

606
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,240
I almost said your name out loud, Assemblyman.

607
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,450
Did you find out?

608
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,680
It's someone from Taemindang's Emergency Response Committee chairman.

609
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,830
Taemindang's Emergency Response Committee chairman?

610
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,540
Taemindang's Emergency Response Committee chairman...

611
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,620
Likely a candidate for the next presidential run...

612
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,190
Assemblyman Seo Tae Ho.

613
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,330
Yes, Deputy Chief Ahn.

614
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,160
What?

615
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,980
What more do I need to do?

616
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,270
Ms. Yeon.

617
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:25,990
Find a way I can reach Assemblyman Seo's people.

618
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,770
Right this minute.

619
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:28,960
Yes, ma'am.

620
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:36,860
Pardon?

621
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,750
Kang woke up.

622
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,080
What?

623
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,390
Ms. Yeon.

624
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:51,680
Yes.

625
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,540
Take care of Kang first.

626
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,930
Yes, ma'am.

627
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,500
Thank you.

628
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,090
Thank you for staying late to work with us.

629
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:05,040
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

630
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,190
Thank you.

631
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,120
Hyung, give me the complaint.

632
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,210
I'll wrap up.

633
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,230
Yes.

634
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,420
All right.

635
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:27,970
Kang woke up.

636
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,670
I'll be right back.

637
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:30,920
Okay.

638
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,060
Kang Dae Shik!

639
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,200
Kang Dae Shik!

640
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,390
Wake up! Kang Dae Shik!

641
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,560
Kang Dae Shik!

642
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,590
Wake up! Kang Dae Shik!

643
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:13,450
Wake up!

644
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:15,120
What's happening to him?

645
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,260
I don't know. He regained consciousness and

646
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,090
his vitals were stable.

647
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,710
Kang Dae Shik.

648
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,690
Kang Dae Shik, where is my sister?

649
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:28,370
Kim Tae On told me to do it...

650
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:33,940
Find Choi...

651
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,210
- Choi... 
 - Patient! Patient! Move.

652
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,000
Take him to the treatment room now!

653
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,780
Hurry!

654
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,330
Hello.

655
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,480
 Are you Cha Yi Hyeon's brother? 

656
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,860
Who is this?

657
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,940
Kang has been taken care of.

658
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,910
How about Assemblyman Seo Hae Ho?

659
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:20,010
I can't seem to connect.

660
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,060
More importantly, Deputy Chief Ahn called.

661
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,250
Chairman personally asked the attorney general

662
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:32,200
to investigate Cha Yi Hyeon's missing case as a murder.

663
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,600
Ga On.

664
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,610
Mom.

665
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,820
It's time for the news.

666
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,470
Should we see if they talk about the shipping accident?

667
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,500
    
  Next news. 

668
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,120
    
  Along the coast of Gunsan this afternoon, 

669
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,900
 while draining the ocean water 

670
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,800
 for the coastal reclamation project,  

671
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,600
 remains of about ten people 

672
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,700
 and their belongings such as bags have been found. 

673
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,210
    
  Among the belongings found, 

674
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,290
 the ID card of the entertainer Cha Yi Hyeon 

675
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:19,200
 who went missing eleven years ago was found. 

676
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,830
 Based on her ID, 

677
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,520
 the authorities believe that they are remains of those 

678
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,600
 who went missing at the time of Key Ferry accident. 

679
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,730
 They requested detailed autopsies at the National Forensic Service.  

680
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,310
Eun Hye.

681
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,190
I have to look into something.

682
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,600
- Watch Ga On for me. 
 - Okay.

683
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,470
Ga On, let's play a little more with uncle and me.

684
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,930
Ahjussi, to Gunsan Police Station, please.

685
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,610
Where is Ga On?

686
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,920
He's with Kang Hae Ra.

687
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,820
Oh, yeah.

688
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,340
You haven't eaten yet, Ga On.

689
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,800
You must be hungry.

690
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,310
What do you want to eat?

691
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:52,730
Tteokboki.

692
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,430
The tent stall must be open near here.

693
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,610
- I'll go. 
 - No.

694
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:59,280
I'll go. Play with Ga On.

695
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,700
Okay.

696
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,290
Ga On.

697
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,960
Do you want to do the puzzle?

698
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,190
Here.

699
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,800
It's the purse and wallet with Cha Yi Hyeon's ID.

700
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,630
Did you confirm the identity...

701
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,710
of the remains?

702
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:19,300
The remains are at the NFS for autopsy.

703
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,060
Even if it's done fast,

704
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,380
it will take at least a month.

705
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:28,220
Take your time.

706
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:58,170
  The call is not going through...  

707
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,610
She's not answering.

708
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:03,530
How can you hand over Ga On to Chairman Kim so easily?

709
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,590
Chairman Kim said it's his grandma's memorial day.

710
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,670
He said he'll bring him back.

711
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,580
And he's quite overbearing...

712
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,400
True. I don't think I could've stopped him, either.

713
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,090
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

714
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,110
Is her phone dead?

715
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:35,240
If we go now, do we sleep over?

716
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,730
No.

717
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:43,420
We'll stay for the ceremony and come back up.

718
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,760
I have lots to do starting tomorrow.

719
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,950
How much longer?

720
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,990
About fifteen more minutes.

721
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:55,930
We'll get there on time. Please don't worry.

722
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,400
Geez. Something's wrong with the steering wheel.

723
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,180
The brake!

724
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,650
Damn it! The brake!

725
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:31,200
What happened?

726
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:33,760
Yi Hyeon sunbae...

727
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,100
You said she wasn't on that ferry.

728
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,270
It's all my fault.

729
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:51,080
I'm sorry.

730
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:55,530
Because I exposed her scandal...

731
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,180
It's not your fault, Hae Ra.

732
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,640
That scandal...

733
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,420
was planned by Kim Tae On

734
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:12,810
to take Sunbae away from Chairman  Kim.

735
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:17,280
I had no idea and...

736
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:36,810
   

737
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,390
- Yeah. 
  - Hyung. 

738
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:41,890
 Why didn't you answer your phone? 

739
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:44,050
 Prosecutor Jang has been trying to reach you, too. 

740
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,800
Sorry. I've been out of it.

741
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:49,630
By chance, are you with Kang Hae Ra?

742
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,590
I heard she went there, too.

743
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,010
What's going on?

744
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,270
Chairman Kim was released yesterday.

745
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:56,750
He did?

746
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:00,050
 Chairman Kim took Ga On to his uncle's 

747
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:02,150
and they got into a car accident.

748
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,460
Is something wrong?

749
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:34,270
Ga On!

750
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,980
Ga On!

751
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,390
What happened?

752
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,080
Is he okay?

753
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,450
Where are you taking him?

754
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,040
I was told to take him

755
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,290
and Chairman to the nursing center owned by FB Foundation.

756
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,220
You can't take Ga On.

757
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,570
I have to see him get treated and get well.

758
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:54,940
Who are you to be doing this?

759
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,420
I'm his mom!

760
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,190
Who's doing this?

761
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,330
I ordered them.

762
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:10,190
My father and brother got hurt and are hospitalized.

763
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,720
It's only right to have them near to take care of them.

764
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,710
And to be exact...

765
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,600
you're not Ga On's mom.

766
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,790
Shut up.

767
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:11,940
♫  Can't you hear my heart 
that is covered with pain?  ♫

768
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:19,750
♫  I don't even remember the moment 
we were in love anymore  ♫

769
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:23,200
♫  Up oh oh oh  ♫

770
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,630
♫  Hatred grows up oh oh oh oh  ♫

771
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:31,240
♫  Revenge grows up oh oh  ♫

772
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:36,180
♫  If I can't change the world, I'll show you  ♫

773
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:47,860
♫  Up oh oh oh  ♫

774
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,470
 

775
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,400
