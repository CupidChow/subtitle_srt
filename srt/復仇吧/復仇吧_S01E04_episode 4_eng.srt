1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:06,830
 

2
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,190
 

3
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,430
 

4
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,180
You knew everything already when you gave me this case, right?

5
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,150
Lee Hoon Seok, Director Song,

6
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,870
and even Director Kim Tae On.

7
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,040
You knew that...

8
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,950
everyone was involved, right?

9
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,580
Where should I begin?

10
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,040
 Kang Hae Ra and Lee Hoon Seok's explosive fight 

11
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,410
 is turning into a mud fight. 

12
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,760
  
 Our reporters... 

13
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,220
 have obtained evidence that Lee Hoon Seok  

14
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,960
 has been physically abusing 

15
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,300
 Kang Hae Ra as soon as they got married. 

16
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,790
Hyung.

17
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,360
You should see this.

18
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,550
I saw it.

19
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,690
All the articles are refuting his press conference,

20
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,250
and they're criticizing Lee Hoon Seok.

21
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,770
If all the public opinions side with Kang Hae Ra...

22
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,960
Find out where Kang Hae Ra is.

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,580
More than that, look at this document.

24
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,660
It's Kang Hae Ra's ob/gyn records from 11 years ago.

25
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,190
Where is the kid?

26
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,360
Where is he?

27
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,200
- Why now... 
- What?

28
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,690
Why now?

29
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,930
Hey.

30
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,390
Damn!

31
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,730
 

32
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,700
Yeah.

33
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,530
Switzerland?

34
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,370
Tomorrow?

35
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,980
Sounds good.

36
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,100
I'll send you my car.

37
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,420
Come to the Grand Hotel.

38
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,350
We'll stay there and leave together.

39
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,970
Okay.

40
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,310
 

41
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,960
 

42
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,270
 

43
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,680
 It's a record on Kang Hae Ra 

44
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,610
  
who arrived in an ambulance.

45
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,930
 

46
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,700
Before she arrived at the hospital,

47
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,850
the unborn baby was already dead.

48
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,740
 Why now... 

49
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,070
Why are you curious about that now?

50
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,310
The world should know...

51
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,910
what you did to me, shrew.

52
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,900
Where did you hide him?

53
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,950
Tell me!

54
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,180
I'll protect him this time.

55
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,460
I'll protect him for sure!

56
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,170
- Tell me! 
- Let go!

57
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,340
Hey, are you okay?

58
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,210
Director! Are you okay, Director?

59
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,540
Director!

60
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,390
Ga On.

61
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,070
Go into your room.

62
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,820
Hurry!

63
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,900
Hey.

64
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,820
Hey!

65
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,120
That punk...

66
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,180
I shouldn't touch him because he's your son?

67
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,530
S***!

68
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,280
How fun was it for you all this time?

69
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,100
He's not even my son,

70
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,380
yet I took him everywhere, including on TV shows,

71
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,800
and you saw me adoring him.

72
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,700
Hey.

73
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,330
Speak.

74
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,110
Who's the kid's father?

75
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,610
Who the hell is he?

76
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,520
Ga On...

77
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,390
is our child.

78
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,640
Fine.

79
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,690
If you won't talk,

80
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,070
I'll have to hear it from that punk.

81
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,100
Before I open the door,

82
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,540
it'd be good for that punk to open it first.

83
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,120
Damn it!

84
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,710
Damn...

85
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,080
Open.

86
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,960
Open the door!

87
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,980
 You guys... 

88
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,400
 The minute I open this door, 

89
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,190
 you two are dead. 

90
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,850
 - Open!  
- Mom...

91
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,200
Do we have to keep living like this?

92
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,490
Open!

93
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,890
I'm sorry, Ga On.

94
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,260
I'll change from now on.

95
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,930
Whatever happens,

96
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,260
I'll protect you, Ga On.

97
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,140
 Open! 

98
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,800
 Open! 

99
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,200
 Open! 

100
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,300
Damn...

101
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,160
 

102
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,720
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,730
There was an accident.

104
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,920
My apologies.

105
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,020
I got into an accident on my way in.

106
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,230
You should change your clothes.

107
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,290
- Get her some clothes. 
- Yes, sir.

108
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,040
Can I get in touch with Director Song?

109
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,610
He's in a monthly meeting with the executives.

110
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,000
  
 Kang Hae Ra and Lee Hoon Seok's explosive fight 

111
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 is turning into a mud fight. 

112
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,420
 According to the information our reporters have gathered, 

113
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,130
 soon after their wedding, 

114
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,080
 during her pregnancy and up until her recent divorce, 

115
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,860
 Kang Hae Ra has been 

116
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,780
  
 physically abused by her husband Lee Hoon Seok. 

117
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,700
 Mr. Han? 

118
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,420
 She even had a fractured rib on the day of the labor 

119
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,210
 when she was transferred to the ER 

120
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,920
 according to an EMT's testimony from that time. 

121
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,320
  
 At the time, we entered the house after receiving the call .

122
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,700
 and found a pregnant woman who had collapsed. 

123
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,720
 And she looked absolutely terrible. 

124
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,800
 She was covered in blood and bruises all over her body. 

125
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,360
 How could anyone beat up a pregnant woman like that? 

126
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,620
 Yes, Kang Hae Ra at the time... 

127
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,720
  
 suffered from not only fractured rib, 

128
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,060
 but she had traces of being beaten all over her body. 

129
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,460
 According to Manager Choi, who has known Lee Hoon Seok for a long time, 

130
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,350
  
 his wife Kang Hae Ra suffered through it for their child, 

131
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,230
 and while they were married, 

132
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,670
 Kang Hae Ra focused solely on being a supportive wife and raising a child. 

133
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,390
 He asserts that what Lee Hoon Seok 

134
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,600
 insists is unthinkable. 

135
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,240
 A loving husband, Lee Hoon Seok, that we're familiar with 

136
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,080
 and a husband who abuses his wife. 

137
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,060
 Which one is the real Lee Hoon Seok? 

138
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,000
 For baby teeth, we'd have to conduct a skeleton investigation. 

139
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,080
 The results will take over a month. 

140
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,510
A month?

141
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,180
Yes, it will cost an additional 1 million won.

142
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,180
The cost isn't an issue.

143
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,070
I just need the results as quickly as possible.

144
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,880
  
Then, for comparison,

145
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,990
you can bring in fingernails or hair.

146
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,420
You can get results in a day or two.

147
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,520
 

148
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,220
Hi.

149
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,660
  
 I heard that there's evidence that Lee Hoon Seok has been 

150
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,100
 physically abusing Kang Hae Ra for the last 12 years. 

151
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,490
 Yes, that's right. 

152
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,440
 First, let's watch an interview with the hospital staff that Kang Hae Ra goes to. 

153
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,890
Who the hell did this?

154
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,140
 She came by often. 

155
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,600
  
 She came in for fractures or bruises. 

156
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,570
 She always said she ran into something, 

157
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,120
 but we can tell right away. 

158
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,840
 There will be personnel changes in the presidential board in three weeks.
 

159
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,910
 Within three weeks,
 

160
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,950
 restore your image as it was before.
 

161
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,260
Call all these schools

162
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,870
and find out where Ga On is.

163
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,410
Buy the earliest airline ticket back as soon as you find him.

164
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,700
Okay.

165
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,290
 Director Song is preparing for a libel suit to restore his image.
 

166
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,580
  
 For making a false accusation or something.
 

167
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,480
 The director is suing my Seung Joo.
 

168
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,250
 You should trample her for good while you're at it.
 

169
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,760
 So that she can't rebuild.
 

170
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,030
Hello.

171
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,950
- I'll try it. 
- Okay.

172
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,180
Yeah.

173
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,950
Tell Kang Hae Ra to go to the hospital first.

174
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,410
She said she got into an accident on her way in this morning.

175
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,100
She didn't go to the hospital but came into work.

176
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,670
Oh, I see.

177
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,000
She's quite tenacious.

178
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,790
You have a good eye for people.

179
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,240
I'll watch her closely.

180
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,500
What brings you here?

181
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,620
I was wondering if we should let the

182
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,900
reporters know about Ms. Choi's trial.

183
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,400
If she hasn't suggested a settlement and no letter of apology,

184
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,900
it's highly possible that she'll get a severe sentence.

185
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,020
Since the press made a big deal out of this case,

186
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,950
they should highlight this ruling as well

187
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,390
for you to be declared a victim

188
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,480
and not an assailant.

189
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,540
You have a family celebration coming up,

190
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,160
and you should stress the fact that you're innocent

191
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,810
to the public when it comes to a case of this nature.

192
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,360
Right.

193
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,070
I think it would be good to pin it down like that.

194
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,080
 

195
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,300
 

196
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,290
All the articles on Kang Hae Ra

197
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,350
were circulated by the FB Life PR department.

198
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,860
To be blunt, I thought it was weird, too.

199
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,460
Her personal stories only she would know were mixed in

200
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,420
so you could think that Kang Hae Ra put it out there.

201
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,480
But within a few hours, an individual without an agency

202
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,450
can't possibly distribute that many articles to

203
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,090
numerous online sites and news media.

204
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,780
On top of that, the news networks are leading the way.

205
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,730
That means the advertisers or shareholders are applying pressure.

206
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,080
 Shareholders? 

207
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,210
 Managing Director Kim? 

208
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,350
 Or Chairman Kim? 

209
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,960
He's currently divorced

210
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,400
and is the CEO of Haega Entertainment.

211
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,720
He's totally Tae On's type.

212
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,630
He's clean cut.

213
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,230
He looks like the obedient type.

214
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,530
But you know...

215
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,950
guys who look like this always get into huge trouble.

216
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,200
You know?

217
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,500
But the weird thing is...

218
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,590
Director Kim's person

219
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,290
came to meet an EMT.

220
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,840
Oh, about that Fireworks bar last time...

221
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,150
I'm sorry about that.

222
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,970
No worries.

223
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,400
If you see anyone similar in the future, give me a call.

224
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,860
Okay, sure.

225
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,870
I'll see you again.

226
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,770
I have to rush to an interview.

227
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,500
Oh...

228
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,890
This is a bonus.

229
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,690
J &amp; Cell that FB Life is investing in.

230
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,510
They're one of the investment recipients of the

231
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,680
new biotechnology development effort by the government.

232
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Just the tax credit given to FB Life R&amp;D

233
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,220
is 30%.

234
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,140
 

235
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,350
 

236
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,280
I took care of it as you instructed.

237
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,000
Ms. Yeom, have you ever raised a puppy?

238
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,870
While you're raising your puppy,

239
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,220
sometimes they want to be teething.

240
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,300
Then you have to give them something to focus on.

241
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,720
If you don't, while you're out,

242
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,090
they'll chew on everything like your sofa and shoes.

243
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,810
If that happens,

244
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,170
you have to scold these cuties.

245
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,980
And your heart breaks so much.

246
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,190
It's not like they were thinking, you know.

247
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,270
At that rate, until things wrap up,

248
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,960
they'll focus on all that, right?

249
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,150
  The call is not going through. 

250
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,470
  You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

251
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,240
 

252
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,510
Why is it so hard to reach you?

253
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,420
The director has been in nonstop meetings.

254
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,620
Oh, yes.

255
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,360
 She was saying that she'll send you her car. 

256
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,620
Pardon?

257
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,340
 Do you have an urgent message for her? 

258
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,010
Right now, I only have the child's baby teeth.

259
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,460
But they say it takes about a month for the test results with teeth.

260
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,050
 We'll go through our connections 

261
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,400
 and make sure you get your test results quickly. 

262
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,390
Where did you submit your test?

263
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,460
 Don't watch TV for a while and relax. 

264
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,160
 I'll be right over as soon as I wrap things up here. 

265
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,490
 

266
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,760
Hey!

267
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,170
Gosh, what?

268
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,830
You just treated me like a criminal, huh?

269
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,790
Did something happen to you?

270
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,290
What happened to your leg?

271
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,960
Aigoo.

272
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,750
I knew it. I didn't think he'd leave you alone.

273
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,800
All over the TV and internet,

274
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,810
the articles and comments criticizing Lee Hoon Seok are no joke.

275
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:52,050
But how come everyone is taking your side?

276
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:56,510
Lee Hoon Seok must think that he got backstabbed by the media.

277
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,540
No.

278
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,120
It's called payback. Don't you think?

279
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,500
Gosh.

280
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,990
No wonder I wanted to come and get you.

281
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,070
Shouldn't you go to the hospital first?

282
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,200
Oh, yeah. Did you go see Seung Joo?

283
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,620
Yeah.

284
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,750
Seung Joo's condition is poor,

285
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,540
so she got out of going to the detention center.

286
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,000
But she needs to go on the trial.

287
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,850
I heard Seung Joo didn't want to settle.

288
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,720
Settle?

289
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,530
I heard she can receive a prison sentence.

290
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:30,760
Let's go to the hospital first.

291
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,190
Right.

292
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,930
- You should go there first. 
- No...

293
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,870
To Seung Joo's hospital.

294
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,750
Geez...

295
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,020
 

296
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,580
Ma'am.

297
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,350
I need to speak to Seung Joo alone.

298
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,450
I know it will be tough,

299
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,250
but can you tell me in detail

300
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,470
everything you went through?

301
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,230
Ma'am.

302
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,270
It can take a while.

303
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,050
Come with me and let's wait over there.

304
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,340
If she knows you're watching,

305
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,050
Seung Joo will have a hard time.

306
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,510
Let's go.

307
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,660
The trial...

308
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,490
process and the result will be tough on you.

309
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,440
But please trust me

310
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,790
and hold onto Seung Joo tightly

311
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,710
so she won't falter.

312
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,380
I won't let her suffer

313
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,920
like she did last time.

314
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,750
 

315
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,360
Director Song will highly publicize

316
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,370
the trial procedure and the verdict through the media.

317
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,650
  
The group's personnel changes with the presidential board and the wedding.

318
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,090
  
Since there are many issues at hand,

319
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,130
- the director and the rape... 
- He must...

320
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,750
want to get rid of that label.

321
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,080
More the witch-hunt against Seung Joo is highlighted,

322
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,260
Director Song's victim cosplay will hit the peak.

323
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,450
When the public feels betrayed, they feel twice,

324
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,560
no, they feel much angrier.

325
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,720
Just like Lee Hoon Seok right now.

326
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,070
This week at the lastest,

327
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,750
you need the dual agreement by Director Song and Director Kim.

328
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,000
Also, the document that proves J &amp; Cell is a shell corporation by Director Kim.

329
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,910
Oh, yeah.

330
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,230
How about the list of his secretaries who quit?

331
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,090
 

332
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,480
What's this?

333
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,060
A severance pay statement.

334
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,770
A list of people who received

335
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,860
a huge severance pay compared to the

336
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,120
length of their employment.

337
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:07,540
 The baby was Lee Hoon Seok's baby.
 

338
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,990
 If she believed that Lee Hoon Seok had killed her unborn child,
 

339
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,020
 no revenge would be worse than
 

340
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,910
 having him raise someone else's child
 

341
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,990
 as if he was his.
 

342
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,680
These addresses are correct, right?

343
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,390
Pardon?

344
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,370
Only three people on this list live in Seoul.

345
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,640
You confirmed these three addresses, right?

346
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,560
Yes.

347
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,430
If these people also experienced what Seung Joo went through,

348
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,870
I wonder how they're now.

349
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,770
I'll go see them now.

350
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,740
Right now?

351
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,850
I need testimonies from similar victims.

352
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,950
That Director Song didn't rape just Seung Joo,

353
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,800
but he consistently raped his secretaries,

354
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,130
and the proof that he paid them off to stay quiet.

355
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,150
I'll go with you.

356
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,830
Well...

357
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,670
did you work at Moa Mirae Welfare

358
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,840
- Foundation? 
- No.

359
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,500
Hold on.

360
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,740
If you'd tell me a little about it...

361
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,350
- it would be so helpful. 
- I have nothing to tell you.

362
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,600
Hello.

363
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,100
By chance, did you work at Moa Mirae Welfare Foundation?

364
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,610
As a secretary...

365
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,090
Hello.

366
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,820
Did you work at Moa Mirae Welfare Foundation?

367
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,970
You don't have to tell me everything,

368
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,910
but if you could tell me what happened at the secretary's office...

369
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,300
Hi, it's mommy.

370
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,720
Hi, Ga On.

371
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,250
Is something wrong?

372
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,020
 Mom, are you doing okay? 

373
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,370
Of course, I'm fine.

374
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:07,120
Except that I miss you so much, Ga On.

375
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,320
I'll visit you during your break.

376
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,490
You know that I love you so much, right?

377
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,680
 Mom, I love you. 

378
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,020
Gosh. I love you, too.

379
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,210
 

380
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,240
 First, I need the dual agreement that Director Song received. 

381
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,400
 I also need... 

382
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,940
 the location of the safe and the info on the 

383
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,570
 people who visit him. 

384
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,350
What are you doing?

385
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,500
I was going to clean up before the Director arrives.

386
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,940
That's Director's personal space.

387
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,990
You don't need to worry about that area.

388
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,090
Yes.

389
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,160
Ah...

390
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,500
Do you want to add that clause under article 2?

391
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,450
This way, please.

392
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,490
 J &amp; Cell's CEO... 

393
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,770
 went into Director Song's office. 

394
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,710
 

395
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,980
That room.

396
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,550
Inside that room, I wasn't a human being.

397
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,950
Is there a way?

398
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,230
To go in there with an expert,

399
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,290
it has to be when Director Song and others are out of the office.

400
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,870
Is that possible during the weekend?

401
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,620
I'll do it.

402
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,890
That room...

403
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,360
I'll go in there.

404
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,760
I don't think a card key or his fingerprints are used.

405
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,600
That means it's a passcode.

406
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,020
If he has a passcode to enter,

407
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,990
there have to be fingerprints on the spots he presses.

408
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,280
Gosh, only if we can find out.

409
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,380
 

410
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,840
You're in early.

411
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,280
I have a breakfast meeting this morning.

412
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,900
Okay.

413
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,490
Is work going okay for you?

414
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,040
Yes.

415
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,880
 

416
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,660
I've been so busy lately that

417
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,390
I couldn't even give you a welcome party.

418
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,990
We'll set up something real soon.

419
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,030
Let's talk more then.

420
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,510
Yes, thank you.

421
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,680
 

422
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,460
 

423
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,050
 Even though... 

424
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:02,520
the victim was declared not guilty in a trial,

425
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,710
the defendant shows no remorse.

426
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,320
Due to the defendant's accusation,

427
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,130
the criticisms the victim received from the society

428
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,150
and despite enormous financial damage,

429
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,270
the defendant does not try in any way

430
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,610
to compensate for the unfair treatment the victim received.

431
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,090
Because of the defendant's accusation,

432
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,880
the investigative efforts by law enforcement were wasted.

433
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,200
This court sentences the defendant

434
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,600
  
to two years in prison.

435
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,480
However, because this is the defendant's first offense

436
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,700
and considering other aspects of the defendant's situation,

437
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,170
the defendant will be on a three-year probation.

438
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,620
 The court, in an ususual fashion, 

439
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,510
 sentenced Director Song's former secretary Choi 

440
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,760
 to two years which is more time than requested by the prosecution 

441
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,550
 and three years of probation. 

442
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,210
 Due to Choi's accusation, 

443
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,170
 Director Song was marked as a sex offender. 

444
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,460
 Despite suffering from 

445
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,590
 psychological and financial damage from his family and society, 

446
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,770
 Choi was not remorseful of her crime. 

447
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,530
 That is the court's assessment of the case. 

448
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,900
 

449
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,270
 

450
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:11,410
 FB Life and J &amp; Cell 

451
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:15,040
 signed an MOU to collaborate on insurance technology innovation 

452
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,200
 and global base expansion. 

453
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,070
 Energized by the 

454
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,600
 expert forecasting that the signing of the MOU will maximize  

455
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,520
 the two corporation's mutual synergy, 

456
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,210
 the two corporation's stock prices 

457
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,030
 jumped more than 10% today. 

458
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,440
 Next news. 

459
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,470
  
 The court, in unusual fashion, 

460
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,420
 the former secretary of Moa Mirae Welfare Foundation's 

461
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,340
 Director Song received a severe sentence today. 

462
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,740
 Recently, the court has been pursuing aggressive legal actions  

463
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,980
 against false accusations of sexual offenses. 

464
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,990
 In the case of celebrities who are accused of sexual crimes, 

465
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,540
 they cannot avoid 

466
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,790
 legal actions against them and moral judgments. 

467
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,420
 It seems as though a severe sentencing 

468
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,820
 was given to the accuser. 

469
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,000
 Cut! Thank you, everyone! 

470
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,230
 - Thank you!  
- Thank you.

471
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,030
 Ready? 

472
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,840
 

473
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,100
 

474
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,200
I'm here. Wake up.

475
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,290
Dad!

476
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,630
You're ready, right? Let's hurry.

477
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,280
Okay.

478
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:55,960
Wait.

479
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,370
Gosh, Dad. What's wrong with your tie?

480
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,790
I knew this would happen.

481
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:03,860
Ta-da! I came prepared.

482
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,130
Let's put this one on.

483
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,900
Okay.

484
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,160
Gosh...

485
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,960
People are...

486
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,870
always asking me if you're my older brother.

487
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,960
If you look so young all the time,

488
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,710
Mother and Father would feel awkward.

489
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:28,160
Why?

490
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,090
Did they say something to you?

491
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,580
What do you mean?

492
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,240
In my eyes...

493
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,130
you look too young.

494
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,570
Okay.

495
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,800
You can go home for the day.

496
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,020
 Okay. 

497
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,430
You can go ahead.

498
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,320
You have to pick up your kids.

499
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,360
I'll wrap up everything.

500
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,030
Would you, please?

501
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,310
 I'll begin. 

502
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,680
Hi, Oppa.

503
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,360
We're almost there. Are you there already?

504
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,140
Oh...

505
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,340
We have no choice if that's what Father says.

506
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,370
Of course, I'm okay.

507
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:49,290
Then, should we meet you and your mother tonight?

508
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,890
You can't?

509
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,040
Mr. Park, stop the car.

510
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,460
Must you marry this guy?

511
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,130
If I don't?

512
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,600
What can I do if I don't?

513
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,840
Even though they look down on you even before the wedding?

514
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,820
I told you it has to be Min Kyu oppa!

515
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,460
And if we break up now, how about the baby?

516
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,580
Should I have the baby alone and raise him?

517
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,390
Does that punk even love you?

518
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,000
What would you say if he doesn't?

519
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,700
What could it be?

520
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,890
He's only a vice-minister.

521
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,130
 

522
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,870
Mr. Park.

523
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:11,200
Leave the car key and go home.

524
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:29,840
 

525
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:40,600
 

526
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,620
 

527
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,570
- Yes.
 - Director Song turned his car around. 

528
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,180
He's heading to his office.

529
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,900
I think he caught on.

530
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,210
 You must leave. You'll have another chance. 

531
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,970
Give me a moment.

532
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:32,080
 He'll be there in less than five minutes. 

533
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,840
He's going into the parking garage.

534
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,830
You must leave, Kang Hae Ra.

535
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,730
 Kang Hae Ra! 

536
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,540
Kang Hae Ra!

537
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,730
I thought I told you to go home early.

538
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,040
What are you still here?

539
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,620
I left something behind.

540
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,650
Really?

541
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,610
I'll come back tomorrow and look for it.

542
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:13,600
Why?

543
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,110
You should keep looking.

544
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:20,010
Didn't you stay because it's something important?

545
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,990
No.

546
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:26,230
I guess you came back to review something.

547
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,230
I'll leave you alone.

548
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,330
Let me go.

549
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,860
I thought it was weird that you were working so hard.

550
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,180
What the hell are you up to?

551
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,410
Why did you try to go into that room?

552
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,240
Are you awake now?

553
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,950
Now that I think about it,

554
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:55,530
Mr. Cha introduced you to me.

555
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:58,680
Why did Mr. Cha place you here,

556
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,450
and what exactly did you try to do?

557
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,980
I have so many questions...

558
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,390
but I'll have to teach a cat burglar a lesson.

559
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:35,720
If you're that curious, you should've told me sooner.

560
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,300
I'd welcome you anytime.

561
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,110
Playing in that room, you know?

562
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,950
 When I woke up, 

563
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,100
 he... 

564
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,900
 That devil dragged me into that room. 

565
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:53,260
 He treated me like an animal in there. 

566
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,560
 I was not human in there. 

567
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,280
How could a place like this exist?

568
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,060
I was going to give you a nice shot.

569
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,870
But if you're okay,

570
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:09,180
staying sober won't be so bad.

571
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,660
I'll give you special treatment.

572
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,200
Let go!

573
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:23,370
Let go of me!

574
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,250
What the hell are you doing?

575
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:30,180
If you don't let me go, you'll regret this!

576
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,170
Don't waste your energy already.

577
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,000
If you waste your energy like this, how will you play in there?

578
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,230
This is the scene...

579
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:44,000
where he raped his secretary

580
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,900
and used his money and power

581
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,890
to turn the victim into an assailant.

582
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:49,800
This is Director Song Seung Woo's

583
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,350
sexual assault scene.

584
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,440
This is...

585
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,100
as you all know...

586
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,500
Moa Mirae Welfare Foundation's Director Song Seung Woo's

587
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,520
bare face!

588
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:15,820
 

589
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:24,430
 I have to let the people know.
 

590
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:29,240
 That ugly and dirty bare face.
 

591
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:40,200
♫  Can't you hear my heart 
that is covered with pain?  ♫

592
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:48,760
 

593
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,580
 

594
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,250
   	
 Take this case. 

595
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,790
 I'll totally back you up. 

596
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:56,550
 I don't think it suits my channel. 

597
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:57,900
 In your life thus far, 

598
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,000
 haven't you ever received help from people around you? 

599
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,440
 Why are they so greedy? 

600
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,890
 You didn't come here to die. 

601
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,340
 I'm not lying. 

602
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,260
 I'll burn everything down! 

603
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,080
 If Kang Hae Ra doesn't want it, 

604
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,900
 I have no intention of forcing it on her. 

605
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,110
 Do you think trying to survive is a joke? 

606
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,060
 I can't waste the effort that went into enduring thus far. 

607
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,770
 I cannot die. 

608
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:22,340
♫  I will show you  ♫

609
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:30,920
