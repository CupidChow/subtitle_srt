1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:06,790
  			 

2
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,030
   

3
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,370
   

4
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,640
Get in the car first, Ga On.

5
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,180
What are you thinking of doing?

6
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,480
He said I should get close to him. So I'll try.

7
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,070
Chairman Kim knows that I'd hate him,

8
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,400
yet his brazen face doesn't even try to hide it.

9
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,560
When he hears that the child is missing,

10
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,860
I want to see how he'll frown.

11
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,040
And more than anything,

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,560
I want to find out what Kang Hae Ra was thinking

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,690
raising Chairman Kim's son.

14
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,050
We located Director Kim.

15
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,040
Ta-da!

16
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,790
Ga On.

17
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,140
Ga On, how did you come here?

18
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,400
Ga On.

19
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,400
Is this the place?

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,970
Yes, we found the right place.

21
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,440
Good job.

22
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,270
Hae Ra!

23
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,330
Gosh, this is fun.

24
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,860
Ga On, you're so popular.

25
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,630
Since Ga On is here, we all get to get together here.

26
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,770
But I wonder how you all found out that Ga On and I were here.

27
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,040
Ga On.

28
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,910
Don't scold Ga On.

29
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,550
Ga On wanted to see his mom, so I said I'd let him see her.

30
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,360
Right, Ga On?

31
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,480
He's my one and only brother.

32
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,770
I wanted to score some points with him.

33
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,890
Ga On, tell me whenever you want to see your mom again.

34
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,980
I'll let you meet her.

35
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,330
Go with Mr. Ko for now.

36
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,430
Ga On.

37
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,970
I'll see you next time.

38
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,550
You'll let me, right?

39
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,360
Of course.

40
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,320
Let's do that.

41
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,300
Ga On, adults need to talk right now.

42
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,600
Would you excuse us?

43
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,920
Let's go.

44
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,090
I had no idea you'd look after your younger brother this way.

45
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,420
It'd be good to get close to each other.

46
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,100
Isn't that what you wanted as well, Father?

47
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,060
I'm sure you feel the same, Mr. Cha.

48
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,910
Am I wrong?

49
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,060
The child is so friendly.

50
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,020
I wonder if his mom raised him that way,

51
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,690
or I wonder if he takes after his birth mom,

52
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,420
who gets together with just anyone.

53
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,340
So how did everyone know to gather here?

54
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,970
I wanted to ask Kang Hae Ra a few things about Ga On.

55
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,970
Kang Hae Ra, you sure have a long history with my family.

56
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,140
At this rate, you won't take over the master bedroom, will you?

57
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,040
Then I'll get going.

58
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,220
Go ahead and enjoy your conversation.

59
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,740
Before you leave, let me ask you one thing.

60
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,150
Eleven years ago, the day I met Ga On for the first time,

61
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,150
Yi Hyeon sunbae and Ga On were trapped in a burning warehouse.

62
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,560
Yi Hyeon sunbae seemed to be on the run for a long time.

63
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,000
I was wondering if you knew who'd set the

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,790
warehouse on fire after trapping Yi Hyeon sunbae and Ga On.

65
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,200
Were you not aware of this, Chairman?

66
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,830
I'm not sure.

67
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,140
I have nothing to say regarding that.

68
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,060
I met Ga On for the first time yesterday.

69
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,990
Do you know about that, Father?

70
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,570
I'll call you if I ever find out about it later.

71
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,660
What's your reason...

72
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,500
for bringing that up just now?

73
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,560
Because it's about Ga On.

74
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,870
Don't worry about Ga On.

75
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,860
I'll pay closer attention from now on.

76
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,920
But...

77
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,090
what brings you here, Mr. Cha?

78
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,460
My office is on the third floor of this building.

79
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,020
I see.

80
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,430
You were too hasty.

81
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,760
You could've revealed that after you obtained

82
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,390
evidence that Kang was behind the warehouse fire.

83
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,490
If you did that, Director Kim couldn't deny it like this.

84
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,300
And what if Ga On is in danger?

85
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,360
You said Kang works for Director Kim.

86
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,130
If I could, I want to bring Ga On right away.

87
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,360
Now that Director Kim knows about Ga On,

88
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,200
Chairman Kim is the one who could protect Ga On.

89
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,000
Didn't you say Ga On is a child of someone who hurt you badly?

90
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,710
Why do you pour out your love for that child this way?

91
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,790
Because he comes from someone like her.

92
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,070
If I ever meet Sunbae again,

93
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,600
I want to say, "Look. I kept the promise that

94
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,030
I'll protect Ga On."

95
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,490
From the first time I met you,

96
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,340
you always put him before you.

97
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,210
Kang Hae Ra, I understand how you want to protect him.

98
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,020
But still...

99
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,800
it's dangerous to go up against Director Kim.

100
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,690
You must protect...

101
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,280
yourself as well, Hae Ra.

102
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,140
Ga On...

103
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,910
always protected me.

104
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,380
If I didn't have Ga On...

105
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,490
I couldn't have endured that time in my life.

106
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,550
Because of me...

107
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,040
he went through the suffering he didn't have to endure.

108
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,590
To me, Ga On is...

109
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,590
my cross...

110
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,480
as well as my strength in life.

111
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,900
 I was wondering if you knew who'd set the 

112
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,440
 warehouse on fire after trapping Yi Hyeon sunbae and Ga On. 

113
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,090
I got rid of the tracker.

114
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,480
Kang Hae Ra reported Kang?

115
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,650
It looks like there was a scuffle

116
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,900
after Kang Hae Ra uploaded a video clip of Kang

117
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,210
at the truck accident scene on her VTube.

118
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,030
Kang Hae Ra...

119
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,740
What an ill-fated connection...

120
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,260
Monitor more tightly what Kang Hae Ra is up to.

121
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,310
Including people around Kang Hae Ra.

122
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,540
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,730
Yes, don't worry.

124
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,780
Due to careless exposés by VTubers these days,

125
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,250
I felt that their actions were causing social problems.

126
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,740
I was gathering clips regarding that matter.

127
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,910
Okay.

128
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,830
Yes, got it.

129
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,450
   

130
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,420
Hi.

131
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,840
On your way to cover a story?

132
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,160
On Kang Hae Ra's channel, a video clip on the insurance agents' accident was posted.

133
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
- We're going to cover it. 
 - Are you out of your mind?

134
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,500
Pardon?

135
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,010
That woman, Kang Hae Ra.

136
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,370
She exposed unconfirmed news on the agents' accident on the news.

137
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,080
Now that she can't handle the aftermath,

138
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,830
she let go of everything and did nothing.

139
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,310
Because of the trouble that she caused us,

140
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,120
our station spent days cleaning up her mess.

141
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,540
Yet you'll investigate again just because of a video clip she posted?

142
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,370
Considering the comments,

143
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,050
more than anything, I don't think she'll post such a clip for no reason.

144
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,420
First, I'll meet with Kang Hae Ra...

145
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,310
Wake up!

146
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,620
This isn't the first time they put on a show trying to get people to click their link!

147
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,330
Will you let those people toy you around as a reporter?

148
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,170
I'm going to put together a series on

149
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,350
the negative effects that careless VTubers are having on our society.

150
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,170
Get the relevant materials ready.

151
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,340
Okay.

152
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,450
 You have a child, Chairman. 

153
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,980
 Please find him and protect him. 

154
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,420
 Eleven years ago, the day I met Ga On for the first time, 

155
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,730
 Yi Hyeon sunbae and Ga On... 

156
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,530
 were trapped in a burning warehouse. 

157
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,310
Without my knowledge,

158
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,980
she tried to get rid of

159
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,320
my child and the woman who bore that child...

160
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,160
Come in.

161
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,090
Yes.

162
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,240
Among the warehouse that Tae On and her maternal side of the family own,

163
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,330
find out if there was one that was burned in a fire.

164
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,210
And find out everything on how Kang Hae Ra

165
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,910
has lived up until now.

166
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,120
Yes, sir.

167
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,010
Hyung, what happened?

168
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,310
Why did Chairman Kim and Director Kim both show up at Gusan Agency?

169
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,840
Director Kim Tae On...

170
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,570
found out about Ga On.

171
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,000
That woman...

172
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,200
brought Ga On here to provoke her father.

173
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,480
To send the message that

174
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,440
she can get rid of a child if she sets her mind to it.

175
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,280
Isn't that extremely dangerous?

176
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,610
Chairman Kim won't stay put.

177
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,300
More than that...

178
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,020
Kang Hae Ra...

179
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,730
told them that Ga On and Noona were trapped inside the warehouse.

180
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,120
About the place being set on fire, too?

181
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,890
What if Director Kim ordered Kang

182
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,970
to eliminate your sister and the child,

183
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,690
she won't sit back.

184
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,590
We must find Kang first somehow.

185
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,000
Hyung, this is the list of the warehouses that

186
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,300
Kang leases you told me to look up.

187
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,720
    
 Since cops are staking out around his offices,

188
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
I think he'll be around one of those places.

189
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,400
We have to find Kang's hideout and

190
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,290
look into Mr. Goo's right of indemnity lawsuit simultaneously.

191
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,190
If the insurance company was involved,

192
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,370
he couldn't have done it alone.

193
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,900
Send me this list to my phone.

194
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,730
I'll look into warehouses in and around Seoul.

195
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,760
Hyung.

196
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,590
But now...

197
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,350
shouldn't you tell Kang Hae Ra?

198
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,260
Why we moved into this building

199
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,060
and who you are.

200
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,860
I'm looking for the right timing.

201
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,160
I'll tell her soon.

202
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,830
Kang Hae Ra.

203
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,990
Are you headed out somewhere?

204
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,250
I want to go see Eun Hye.

205
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,970
After that happened yesterday,

206
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,660
she went to drop off Mr. Goo, and I haven't heard from her since.

207
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,600
You said his cafe is in Yangpyeong, right?

208
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,270
I'll drive you.

209
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,390
It's okay.

210
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,760
I'm headed that way anyway.

211
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,170
Get in.

212
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,490
 I wanted to ask that sunbae again. 

213
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,210
 Why did she recommend me for that position 

214
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,400
 and throw me into such hell? 

215
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,810
It must've been tough to endure your marriage.

216
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,300
Why didn't you leave him sooner?

217
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,390
If you were in an unhappy marriage,

218
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,740
I'm sure it must've affected the child, too.

219
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,620
I shouldn't have asked that. I'm sorry.

220
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,530
My father had passed away when I was young.

221
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,760
I lived with my mom as a child.

222
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,160
Living without a father...

223
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,810
both mentally and financially...

224
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,170
it's not easy.

225
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,240
The prejudice and loneliness I felt then...

226
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,720
I didn't want Ga On to feel any of it.

227
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:31,420
And when I tried to leave him, he didn't let me go easily.

228
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,110
 Shouldn't you tell Kang Hae Ra? 

229
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,950
 Who you are. 

230
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,560
Hae Ra.

231
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,570
There's something I haven't told you yet.

232
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,280
- To be honest... 
 - Excuse me.

233
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,910
Yes.

234
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,100
I'll call you as soon as I check.

235
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,620
Okay.

236
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,830
I'm sorry.

237
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,400
Oh, yeah.

238
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,290
Here you go.

239
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,050
I've received so much help from you,

240
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,090
yet I didn't get to thank you properly.

241
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,290
You can drop me off over there.

242
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,390
Oh, okay.

243
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,780
Thank you.

244
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,000
See you.

245
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,090
   

246
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,490
Give it to me.

247
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,880
Tell me to do stuff like this.

248
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,370
Why did you come all the way here?

249
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,300
Why else?

250
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,700
I was just worried about you.

251
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,400
Why worry...

252
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,730
Hyun Sung, you're here, too.

253
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,040
I'm sorry, I didn't tell you first.

254
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,820
When I think of how much Mr. Goo and you must've suffered...

255
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,790
Do I seem angry?

256
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,560
I'd be angry myself.

257
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,760
They sued him because I requested his service.

258
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,470
In the end, he lost everything.

259
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,270
You're right. I am angry.

260
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:13,090
But I'm not angry at you.

261
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,230
I wanted to know who Dad's client was for the warehouse case.

262
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,490
And when I found out yesterday that it was you,

263
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,440
I did feel dumbfounded.

264
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,370
And when I found out that the warehouse belonged to Kang,

265
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,480
it hit me.

266
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,420
Kang Hae Ra.

267
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,560
You know the kind of cases we exposed?

268
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,880
Can't you tell right away?

269
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,070
Kang and the lawsuit.

270
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,540
You get the big picture.

271
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,000
This is exactly what happened to Jung Woo.

272
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,690
When I learned that the warehouse belonged to Kang,

273
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,270
I thought that my dad...

274
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,820
might not have caused that fire.

275
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,450
So I needed to think things through

276
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,060
and wanted to secure the cafe. That's why I stayed here.

277
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,250
To chase down Kang,

278
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,710
I must make sure Dad is safe.

279
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,280
And as for Jung Woo's case,

280
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,830
we closed his case after exposing them.

281
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,320
But I think we should link these two cases and dig deeper.

282
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,170
You'll work with me, right?

283
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,740
Kang...

284
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,420
I got a tight grip on that creep.

285
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,230
Geez...

286
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,430
I skipped breakfast.

287
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,150
Did you eat?

288
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,220
Let's go.

289
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,940
There's a really good restaurant near here.

290
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,840
Hey, run, run!

291
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,380
Geez, you're young. Why are you so weak?

292
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,570
You pushed me all of a sudden.

293
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,370
Who pushed you?

294
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,200
You just pushed me.

295
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,130
Come on, young man!

296
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,550
I didn't push you!

297
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,770
Do you have weak legs?

298
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,110
My legs?

299
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,990
My legs are weak?

300
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,840
Aigoo, come on, people!

301
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,180
The way I see it, yes, you pushed him, Dad.

302
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,900
Hyun Sung, your legs are weak, so you fell.

303
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,200
- Whoa, seriously. 
 - That's what I mean!

304
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,180
You're a young man, yet so weak.

305
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,680
Geez, forget it. Let's just go eat.

306
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,960
I skipped breakfast. I'm starving.

307
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,400
You didn't eat, either, right?

308
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Since it's cold, should we go for tofu jeongol?

309
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,500
That's a great place.

310
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,100
Dad, do we go for drinks this early in the day then?

311
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,010
Nice!

312
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,380
Let's go.

313
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,760
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

314
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,050
Let's go.

315
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,450
Giddy up.

316
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,610
Giddy up.

317
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,510
Hi, did you find out?

318
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,780
Yes, it's registered as a warehouse.

319
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,340
They're currently in business?

320
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,650
Yes. The employees' salaries and rent...

321
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,410
 are being paid on a regular basis. 

322
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,130
 What's wrong? 

323
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,330
It looks like it's been empty for quite a while.

324
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,610
It's an empty warehouse but made to look like there are workers.

325
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,830
They're paying for salaries and rent

326
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,610
 on a regular basis? 

327
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,860
I don't see any traces of Kang being here.

328
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,320
I'll go to other locations as well.

329
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,920
And...

330
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,640
find out the real owner as well as the current owner.

331
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,610
Does this man keep circling around the warehouse?

332
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,520
Yes. He was there quite recently.

333
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,410
Did you find out who he is?

334
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,560
His name is Goo Sung Chul.

335
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,910
After the fire incident from elevan years ago,

336
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,860
Kang sued him for the right of indemnity.

337
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,640
At the time, Kang sued him for repairs and materials inside the warehouse

338
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,800
for two billion won.

339
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:07,960
Kang sure made money off of all sorts of things.

340
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,370
And he screws up on my orders?

341
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,850
And Goo Sung Chul...

342
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:16,010
also helped Kang Hae Ra place Cha Yi Hyeon's son on her family registry.

343
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,490
He did?

344
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,270
What does he do?

345
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,220
At the time, he was running Gusan Agency, a P.I. firm.

346
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,210
But he's currently running a cafe in Yangpyeong.

347
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,700
Gusan Agency?

348
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,490
Currently, his daughter Goo Eun Hye is running the agency.

349
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,190
She's working with Kang Hae Ra on recent cases.

350
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,310
The dad is digging into the fire incident from eleven years ago.

351
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:46,200
The daughter is digging current cases with Kang Hae Ra?

352
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,130
Where did you say Kang Hae Ra is right now?

353
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,100
All of them are together at the cafe in Yangpyeong.

354
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,350
Contact Kang.

355
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,370
He needs to finish what he started.

356
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,880
They share a long history.

357
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,620
   

358
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,600
Where is Hyun Sung?

359
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,890
He left early saying, he has to do something.

360
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,070
Geez, he should've said bye.

361
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,590
That punk does whatever he wants to do.

362
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,020
- Here. 
 - What is it?

363
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,520
Some things I've been looking into recently.

364
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,670
I didn't work alone. My friends helped me out.

365
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:35,080
This is that place.

366
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,680
Yeah. I went there recently.

367
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,860
It's still the same as it was after the fire.

368
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,810
I thought they had you pay for the repairs.

369
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,940
Yeah.

370
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,040
Then even after getting the repair money,

371
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,840
they left it like that?

372
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,410
Actually...

373
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,040
I did pay off the debt accrued due to the fire,

374
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,260
but I kept going there because I felt uneasy.

375
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,550
What were you feeling uneasy about?

376
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,920
From what I remember, the warehouse was empty.

377
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,600
What did they deal with that

378
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,860
they requested so much money for the damages.

379
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,210
Oh, Kang was leasing that building

380
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,600
and there's a different owner.

381
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,270
Here.

382
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,980
Look here.

383
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,000
 

384
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,230
He owns quite a few warehouses.

385
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,490
Yeah.

386
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,320
I wonder if he leases warehouses for business.

387
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,520
I'm looking into him at the moment.

388
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,120
I'll get some info on him today or tomorrow.

389
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,410
Ahjussi, this looks suspicious to you, too, right?

390
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,300
I told you it's fishy.

391
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,130
The way I see it,

392
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,380
there wasn't anything worth 2 billion won in this warehouse.

393
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,510
And I don't think my dad is the only victim out there.

394
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,120
We should take a look, huh?

395
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,560
    
 The latest video clip is...

396
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,240
the one of Kang Dae Shik at the site of the insurance agents' accident.

397
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,870
- That Kang Dae Shik? 
 - Yes.

398
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,040
And this was also noted in my research on Kang Hae Ra.

399
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,500
Kang Hae Ra's ex-husband was

400
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,810
Lee Hoon Seok, who had a scandal with Director Kim.

401
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,600
Lee Hoon Seok?

402
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,290
Kang Hae Ra's exposé was

403
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,720
aimed at Tae On to begin with?

404
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,640
No.

405
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,590
 My office is on the third floor of this building. 

406
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,560
Find out what kind of relationship Cha Min Joon and Kang Hae Ra have.

407
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,740
Starting with how those two met.

408
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,270
Yes, sir.

409
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,310
 Your current position... 

410
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,860
 If you want, Chairman... 

411
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,550
 I'll set it up for you so that you can maintain that. 

412
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,770
Cha Min Joon...

413
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:04,230
Did you come here to take me down and FB Group?

414
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,400
What?

415
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,810
In front of Director Kim Tae On and Chairman Kim,

416
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,660
you brought up the fire at the warehouse?

417
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,880
Yeah.

418
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,760
Then you must think that Director Kim started the fire

419
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,490
to eliminate your sunbae and Ga On, huh?

420
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,870
Yi Hyeon sunbae was definitely on the run.

421
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,430
I never thought that it would be the case

422
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,290
because of having Chairman Kim's child.

423
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,200
But if Director Kim ordered the fire in that warehouse,

424
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,900
I thought Chairman Kim needs to know.

425
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,560
So that he will protect Ga On more tightly.

426
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,480
But Ga On may be safer, but

427
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,110
I think Director Kim must be determined to get you.

428
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,280
We were already ill-fated.

429
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,610
From the time when she brought up

430
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,160
Ga On to silence her scandal with Lee Hoon Seok.

431
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,980
As if starting the fire wasn't enough,

432
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,750
he sued your father for the right of indemnity.

433
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,650
This is clearly an insurance fraud.

434
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,540
It's possible that Kang wasn't working alone on Mr. Hong's accident.

435
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,890
We have one more reason to catch Kang.

436
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,760
Yes, I got it.

437
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,670
What did she say?

438
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,070
Is she going to take care of the police?

439
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,920
That's not the problem here.

440
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,370
Chairman Kim...

441
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,470
found out about the warehouse fire with Cha Yi Hyeon from eleven years ago.

442
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,750
Wait...

443
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,240
How did Chairman Kim find out about that?

444
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,410
I think Kang Hae Ra told him.

445
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,840
How did Kang Hae Ra find out about that?

446
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,240
And now Director Kim knows about it.

447
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,290
Knows what?

448
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:45,190
The fact that I sued Goo Sung Chul over that fire.

449
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:49,820
I guess Goo Sung Chul has been digging into that warehouse incident.

450
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,460
Then what do we need to do now?

451
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,350
Kang Hae Ra and that lawyer.

452
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:59,480
If we get rid of everyone, including P.I. father and daughter,

453
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,340
Director Kim says she'll help us escape to China.

454
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,660
More than that,

455
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,390
we're both dead if Chairman Kim catches us.

456
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,250
The lawyer and Kang Hae Ra?

457
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,340
The P.I. father and daughter.

458
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,910
I know how we can get all of them at once.

459
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,160
 There's a law firm upstairs of your office, right? 

460
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,830
 Find out a weakness you can use to get that lawyer to come out, 

461
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,510
 and he must have files on us that he's investigated. 

462
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,850
 Get all that for me. 

463
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,530
 Why should I? 

464
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,290
 Just end it here. 

465
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,990
 Why bother to meet again? 

466
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,130
 We don't want to become friends, do we? 

467
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,590
 Should I go and get Goo Eun Hye? 

468
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,030
 Don't you dare! 

469
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,410
 What do you mean? 

470
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,850
 I just said it since you two are always together. 

471
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,540
 What the...? 

472
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,880
 Be sure to answer my calls. 

473
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,030
 I'm giving you this week. 

474
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,560
   

475
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,520
Hello.

476
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,580
Mr. Cha isn't in right now.

477
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,230
Where is Do Yoon hyung?

478
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,850
He's out of the office.

479
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,750
Then I'll wait.

480
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,550
But didn't Mr. Goo say...

481
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,520
this place is open for business?

482
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,920
Yeah.

483
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,900
There's another warehouse about ten minutes away.

484
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,790
- Let's check out there, too. 
 - Okay.

485
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,120
He must be a manager here.

486
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,360
I'll go and ask him.

487
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,660
Go to the warehouse by yourself.

488
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,360
- I'll see you later. 
 - Okay.

489
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,100
Hello.

490
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,440
Is this place open for business?

491
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,530
I have never seen any person nor car

492
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,590
coming into this place.

493
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,370
Then I guess...

494
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:56,160
you've never met the warehouse owner, right?

495
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,380
Well? The doors are always locked.

496
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,820
I've never met him.

497
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,400
Okay. Thank you.

498
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,710
   

499
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,980
What are you doing?

500
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,130
I thought I'd borrow some books on law basics.

501
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,880
I guess I'll just go.

502
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,090
   

503
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,170
How was that place?

504
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,620
It wasn't in use, either.

505
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,560
Did you talk to the manager?

506
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,230
I was going to ask him about Kang,

507
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,840
but he didn't seem to know anything at all.

508
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,640
Never mind the owner. He's never seen anyone working there.

509
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,510
How come the warehouse owner owns so many when he's not even using them?

510
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,190
I'm not sure.

511
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,900
- Hi, Dad. I was going to... 
  - Eun Hye, don't come! 

512
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,560
 You can't come! 

513
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,260
 I told you not to say anything! 

514
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
- Dad... 
  - I told you... 

515
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,590
I won't sit back if you keep following me around.

516
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,970
And now, you're even digging into the warehouse fire case?

517
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,960
If you touch a hair on my dad's body,

518
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,300
I'll kill you.

519
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,950
Eun Hye, what's going on?

520
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,000
Did something happen to your dad?

521
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:55,850
I have to go to the cafe right now.

522
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,400
Kang found out Dad and I are investigating the warehouse fire.

523
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,450
He went to Dad.

524
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,600
Hey, let's call the police first.

525
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,000
He says not to call the police but come right now.

526
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,400
I have to go to Dad.

527
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
You should go back to Seoul.

528
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,310
What are you saying?

529
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,950
If you don't want to call the police,

530
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,060
let's call Prosecutor Jang and...

531
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,880
Then...

532
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,310
could we tell Mr. Cha?

533
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,780
If they see the police around the cafe,

534
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,070
he said he'll hurt Dad.

535
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,500
All right. I'll do that.

536
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,140
I'll call Mr. Cha first.

537
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,750
Dad!

538
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,610
Dad!

539
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,570
Mr. Goo!

540
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,300
Where is Mr. Goo?

541
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,840
We're looking for him.

542
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,130
Are you sure he told you to come to the cafe?

543
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,530
Yeah.

544
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,550
There's an empty lot behind the cafe.

545
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,930
I'll go look for him there.

546
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,100
Please look in the basement.

547
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,180
I'll check out the basement.

548
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,760
I'll go with you.

549
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,700
Eun Hye! Goo Eun Hye!

550
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,780
I'm sorry, Hae Ra.

551
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,610
 Bring Kang Hae Ra and that lawyer punk 

552
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,700
 and come to your dad's cafe. 

553
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,690
 If you don't, the lunch you had earlier 

554
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,180
 will be the last meal with your dad. 

555
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,250
I'm sorry.

556
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Cha.

557
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,190
I did what you told me to do. So tell me.

558
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,210
Tell me where my dad is!

559
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,750
You're not done yet.

560
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,330
You have to finish them off.

561
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,730
What are you talking about?

562
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,210
You said all I have to do is bring them here.

563
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,040
Yeah.

564
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,700
How is Goo Sung Chul doing right now?

565
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,120
What?

566
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,030
He's bleeding a lot...

567
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,350
and has to go to the hospital quickly?

568
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,890
It looks like he has to go to the hospital right now.

569
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,670
Since you decided to turn a blind eye,

570
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,880
just close your eyes once more.

571
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,310
You and your dad suffered tremendously because of Kang Hae Ra.

572
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,850
Isn't that right?

573
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,810
Eun Hye!

574
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:02,220
Let's find your dad together!

575
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,200
Eun Hye...

576
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,260
You can't listen to Kang.

577
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,260
Open the door now!

578
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,460
Light it.

579
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,110
Let me ask you one thing.

580
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,120
That warehouse fire...

581
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,470
It wasn't my dad's fault, right?

582
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,230
Just like now, you guys started the fire

583
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,710
and framed my dad, right?

584
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,520
That's why...

585
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,300
your dad should've never shown up there.

586
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,400
You shouldn't have been close to Kang Hae Ra.

587
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:18,130
All this happened because you were close to Kang Hae Ra.

588
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:21,860
If you want to blame someone, blame her.

589
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I asked a short question, but your answer is damn long.

590
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,760
So the conclusion is that...

591
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,540
my dad didn't start that fire.

592
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,800
Yup.

593
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,350
That's right.

594
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,120
Hey!

595
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,400
Let go!

596
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,920
Stay down!

597
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,220
   

598
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,130
Are you okay?

599
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,400
Yes.

600
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,670
I think my dad is in the empty lot behind the cafe.

601
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,860
Stop!

602
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,690
Let's go!

603
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,170
- Dad! 
 - Get him!

604
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,560
- Dad! 
 - Stop!

605
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,400
- Stop right there! 
 - Dad!

606
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,920
Dad!

607
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,780
Dad, are you okay?

608
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,560
Eun Hye...

609
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,200
- Eun Hye... 
 - Dad...

610
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,250
Dad!

611
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,500
It's okay.

612
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,070
 Get off. 

613
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:36,870
 Tell Mr. Cha not to come. 

614
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,770
 He threatened me. 

615
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:45,040
 Kang said if I bring you and Mr. Cha with me, 

616
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,390
 he'll let my dad go. 

617
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:52,140
 If I call the police or if I show up alone, 

618
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,400
 he said I'll never see my dad again. 

619
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:57,830
 But... 

620
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,980
 But that's not right. 

621
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,430
 Just so my dad and I can live. 

622
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:13,230
 Do what Kang told you to do. 

623
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:17,350
 What Kang is after is... 

624
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:20,150
 Mr. Cha and me. 

625
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,250
 We must get Kang this time. 

626
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,310
 Even if Mr. Cha and I become the bait. 

627
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,420
I was so scared this time.

628
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,260
What if I make a mistake and...

629
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,910
drop the lighter...

630
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,400
Then you, Mr. Cha, and even the cafe...

631
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,510
Everything worked out.

632
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,910
You did well.

633
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,690
Mr. Goo, let's get you up.

634
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,330
Are you okay?

635
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,080
Yeah, I'm okay.

636
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:17,960
I'll go to bed now.

637
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,430
Okay.

638
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:21,180
All right.

639
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,940
But...

640
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,460
What?

641
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,930
Why?

642
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:34,280
You had promised me that you'll let me see my mom.

643
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,800
Once I get to meet my mom,

644
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,530
I'll study harder...

645
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,140
- and... 
 - Okay.

646
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,490
Of course, we will.

647
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,950
Let's call her and set a date.

648
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,620
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

649
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,520
Okay, it's getting late.

650
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,270
Let's go upstairs and go to sleep.

651
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:58,770
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

652
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:09,730
   

653
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,510
Yeah.

654
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,480
 Kang just got arrested. 

655
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,300
What?

656
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,240
Kang Dae Shik just got arrested.

657
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,380
I got a call from Eunseo Police Station.

658
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,300
If you tell me who's behind the truck accident,

659
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,580
the person who ordered the warehouse fire,

660
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,500
and if you tell me where my sister is,

661
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,720
I'll help you, so you only pay for what you did.

662
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,640
If you take the fall for everything,

663
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,550
I'll guarantee you that you'll rot in prison for over thirty years.

664
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,630
Think it through.

665
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,400
    
 The way I see it...

666
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,300
I think they're finished with you.

667
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,350
Let me know if you need a lawyer.

668
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,820
   

669
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:28,340
Hyung.

670
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,710
Prosecutor Jang just called me.

671
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:32,750
Kang was transferred to ER.

672
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,650
Why?

673
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,810
He got into a fight with another detainee.

674
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:38,750
- He injured Kang... 
 - Which hospital is he at?

675
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,290
   

676
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,710
 He got into a fight with another detainee. 

677
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:56,460
 That detainee slashed Kang Dae Shik's throat with a broken dish. 

678
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:08,230
   

679
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,690
Yes, Mr. Ko.

680
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,620
 The chairman is asking for you. 

681
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,060
Yes, I got it.

682
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,130
   

683
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:35,230
Chairman wants to see you.

684
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,380
Why did you want to see me?

685
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,750
Yeah...

686
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,170
I think you should move up

687
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:09,310
your plan to go to China.

688
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:12,160
I thought that plan was called off back then.

689
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,560
Seung Woo oppa didn't get to join the company.

690
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,720
No.

691
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,120
As your father...

692
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,810
and the leader of this group, I'm giving you an order.

693
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,860
And...

694
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,930
at the upcoming company anniversary,

695
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,510
I plan to introduce Ga On to the public.

696
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,310
Your son out of wedlock...

697
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,520
You'll introduce him on the company anniversary?

698
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,260
It'd be shameful even if you raised him quietly and got caught later.

699
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,250
I don't think I should raise him quietly.

700
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,240
Then are you saying you'll make a big fuss over him?

701
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,880
Once my son is made public,

702
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,060
no one would dare...

703
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,280
mess with this Kim Sang Goo's son.

704
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,200
Is that why you tried to get rid of Kang?

705
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,340
I can't get rid of my daughter...

706
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:15,000
who is blinded by jealousy.

707
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,900
You know the paperwork you worked on for the vessels?

708
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,660
They're at the Port of Gunsan.

709
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:54,720
How about you wrap up everything, including the customs?

710
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,150
I thought you said...

711
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:01,100
you had someone else overseeing the customs.

712
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:06,290
I think someone I trust should take care of it.

713
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:10,590
You and I are a family now, after all.

714
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:16,990
And after Tae On leaves for China,

715
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,150
for the next personnel appointment,

716
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,820
I'm considering putting you as a president.

717
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,140
Then, should I be in charge of the shipping business from now on?

718
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,680
I think that'd be efficient.

719
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:41,540
Meet the department personnel with Mr. Ko and familiarize yourself.

720
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,890
And get to work as soon as you can.

721
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,100
Okay.

722
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:51,400
And you know Kang Hae Ra...

723
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:54,060
No matter how much I think about it,

724
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,740
she really bothers me.

725
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,470
I'd like you...

726
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,900
to get rid of her.

727
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:15,480
   

728
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,070
I turned over all the relevant files to Mr. Cha.

729
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:27,290
Starting with importing vessels, customs, and...

730
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:31,430
all the files on the shipping business. Put them all under Cha Min Joon.

731
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,020
After everything is done,

732
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,790
I'll take care of it all at once.

733
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,890
Yes, sir.

734
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,900
How dare he comes working for me with the intent to

735
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,830
bring down the FB Group...

736
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,710
 You're not planning on exposing the shipping industry scandal, are you? 

737
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:09,040
 There's a reason why Mom and aunts are turning a blind eye. 

738
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,590
Yes?

739
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:20,970
 It's me. 

740
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:24,580
The shipping business insurance scandal I mentioned last time.

741
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,200
Are you preparing it?

742
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:31,240
Yes, I'm waiting for Chairman Kim to release his PR materials.

743
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,110
There's an article to release right after that news.

744
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:35,580
What?

745
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,040
Nonsense.

746
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,710
He had emergency surgery early this morning and is still unconscious.

747
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:42,100
So he can't be interrogated for now.

748
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,650
He was in a holding cell. How could this happen overnight?

749
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,770
That's what I'm saying.

750
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:51,130
He was trying to kill us just last night.

751
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,160
How could this happen within a few hours?

752
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,630
I guess you just never know.

753
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:59,790
Where are you going?

754
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:03,870
I don't think the fight in the holding cell was just a fight.

755
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,390
I know.

756
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:07,410
Where to? Who are you going to meet?

757
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:09,900
To someone who wants to shut Kang up.

758
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:33,350
Don't you dare touch even a hair on Ga On.

759
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:35,620
I'll kill you.

760
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,630
I'm watching you.

761
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,420
I know that you hired Kang

762
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:49,350
to eliminate Yi Hyeon sunbae and Ga On.

763
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,230
Now that the truth might come to light,

764
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:53,940
I know you tried to kill Kang this time.

765
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,200
Kang Hae Ra.

766
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:12,020
- What brings you here? 
 - Mr. Cha.

767
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,180
You trained your hunting dog very poorly.

768
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:21,140
So Kang Hae Ra still doesn't know?

769
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:28,920
That you had her next to you to use her as your hunting dog.

770
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,540
Director Kim.

771
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,200
I don't know what you're talking about right now.

772
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:39,250
What are you talking about?

773
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,850
Talk with me.

774
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,960
So you don't know that, either?

775
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,810
That Mr. Cha is Cha Yi Hyeon's younger brother.

776
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:59,500
To Cha Min Joon, Kang Hae Ra is his target for his revenge

777
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:03,380
as well as his hunting dog necessary to perfect his revenge.

778
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,630
Know your place.

779
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,920
Don't mess around. You're merely a hunting dog.

780
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,890
You're...

781
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,500
Yi Hyeon sunbae's younger brother?

782
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,530
Did you use me all this time?

783
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:56,590
♫  I have no confidence  ♫

784
00:58:56,590 --> 00:59:01,400
♫  My heart is pumping fast  ♫

785
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,200
♫  My lips are dry  ♫

786
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,400
♫  I can't say anything  ♫

787
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,140
♫  You disappeared all of a sudden  ♫

788
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,560
♫  All the love I shared with you  ♫

789
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,330
♫  I can't believe it  ♫

790
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:29,120
   

791
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:47,600
