1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,950
 

2
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,130
 

3
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,200
 
 Kang Hae Ra received the award for the Power Influencer. 

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,400
    
 "Unceasing Life" placed on the bestseller list this month. 

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,290
 Hey, just because you wrote a book and are starting a show, 

6
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,750
 you think you're all that, huh? 

7
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,150
 Is it true you've had an inappropriate relationship with a former idol reporter ten years younger? 

8
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,320
 This is me? 

9
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,150
    
 He got you. 

10
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,300
 What do you mean? 

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,560
 Since you quit being a reporter, did you completely lose your touch? 

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,870
 An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. 

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,300
 A hidden camera for a hidden camera. 

14
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,080
 Isn't this Lee Hoon Seok? 

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,050
 Daebak. 

16
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,490
   

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,200
 It was Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency's new episode. 

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,260
 Mom, are you okay? 

19
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,370
 Can't you tell? 

20
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,350
 I'm totally fine. 

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,340
   

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,300
 Ahjumma. 

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,600
    
 Ga On's father's attorney came by and took Ga On. 

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,370
 I was wondering if you settled things with his father. 

25
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,500
 To Incheon Airport, please. 

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,750
 Noona! 

27
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,030
 I'm on-site to meet entertainer Cha Yi Hyeon 

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,800
    
 who is shrouded in a prostitution scandal.  

29
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,100
 Kang Hae Ra hit it big ever since Mi Yeon sunbae's scandal. 

30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,390
 I heard Mi Yeon sunbae took care of Kang Hae Ra 

31
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,480
 since she was her college hoobae. 

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,560
 Cha Yi Hyeon? 

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,360
 There's no one here by that name. 

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,290
 If you want, Chairman... 

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,630
 I'll set it up for you, 

36
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,560
 so that you can maintain that. 

37
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,950
 I guess you didn't know, either. 

38
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,850
    
 Your sister gave birth to... 

39
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,530
 my son. 

40
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,080
 That's why you need a son. 

41
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,920
 Whether it's our son, 

42
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,630
 or my son. 

43
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,690
 Is she the emcee for today's event? 

44
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,590
 Yes, she's Cha Yi Hyeon. 

45
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,010
 She had so many opportunities to step down with applause, 

46
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,700
 but she insisted on staying on just a little longer. 

47
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,120
 It was really an ugly sight to behold. 

48
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,970
Ma'am, breathe in and out.

49
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,160
Breathe in with your nose and breathe out with your mouth.

50
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,300
Slowly. You have to breathe.

51
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,740
Push a little more.

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,950
I can see the head.

53
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,170
A little more.

54
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,040
Breathe in...

55
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,000
You've paid for everything.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,710
 
 Here is your receipt and the birth certificate.

57
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,260
Thank you.

58
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,240
   

59
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,460
All right. Wait just a minute.

60
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,900
Let's drink milk.

61
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,410
Oh, why are you so hot?

62
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,890
Are you sick?

63
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,240
Oh, no.

64
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,260
I have to get out.

65
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,420
Oh, no.

66
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,630
Hey!

67
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,580
Hey! Is anyone out there?

68
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,020
Save me!

69
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,950
Ga On.

70
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,950
Ga On!

71
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,530
Mom!

72
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,940
It's the DNA test...

73
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,500
and a form to request a change of paternity rights.

74
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,200
Change of paternity rights?

75
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,890
Ga On is Chairman Kim Sang Goo's son,

76
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,290
so from now on, I'll make sure

77
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,330
Chairman Kim has all the paternal rights and custody.

78
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,830
All right.

79
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,140
This is where you'll live from now on.

80
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,860
You must be tired from the trip.

81
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,100
Rest for the night.

82
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,710
Okay.

83
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,030
See you in the morning.

84
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,000
When do I get to see my mom?

85
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,390
 Who do I live with starting now? 

86
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,460
 I don't get to see my mom anymore? 

87
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,680
 You'll get to see your mom. 

88
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,420
 But let's meet your dad before then. 

89
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,020
 Adults need to hash out some things. 

90
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,720
 Is my birth dad a good person? 

91
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,410
 If I behave, 

92
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,520
 do I get to see my mom often? 

93
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,970
I'm...

94
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,230
meeting your mom tomorrow to talk.

95
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,330
Don't worry, and get some sleep.

96
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,420
Okay.

97
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,950
Ga On just used this.

98
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,210
Is Dr. Park on his way?

99
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,860
He'll arrive in ten minutes.

100
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,000
About asking Dr. Park to run a DNA test...

101
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,880
Make sure he watches his mouth.

102
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,060
Yes, sir.

103
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,330
   

104
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,430
Is that the woman who raised Ga On?

105
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,700
Yes.

106
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,920
Do you think that woman will step back quietly?

107
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,210
For raising a child for a short time,

108
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,790
will she make noise and drag it...

109
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,060
No, no...

110
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,580
I'll personally meet that woman.

111
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,000
Why don't you figure out what's going on

112
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,990
and think about how you should wrap things up?

113
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,930
Chairman.

114
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,110
How come you only got to...

115
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,910
find out about him now?

116
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,510
Mi Yeon...

117
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,890
I knew she was the one the first time I saw her.

118
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,960
But it wasn't right timing.

119
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,460
My wife was gravely ill.

120
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,360
Many eyes were on me.

121
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,430
But she had a child...

122
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,730
and the fact that her hoobae was raising him.

123
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,400
I only found out recently.

124
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,260
The letter that Mi Yeon wrote me 11 years ago

125
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,920
had arrived just now.

126
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,290
 I heard she's adopted. 

127
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,510
 What do you want? 

128
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,780
 I wanted to ask you something. 

129
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,420
 I read this in a science book. 

130
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,640
 If your mom and dad are both type O blood, 

131
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,730
 - the kid can't be AB... 
- Get to the point. 

132
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,160
 Then... 

133
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,420
 it must mean that the kid isn't their real son, right? 

134
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,950
 Are you adopted, too? 

135
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,560
 No, no. 

136
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,820
 I never said that kid was me. 

137
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,770
 You asked whether he's a "real son" or not. 

138
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,450
 But one day out of the blue, 

139
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,760
 if your birth parents come to you, 

140
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,240
 you'd have to part with your current parents, huh? 

141
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,560
 That will never happen. 

142
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,500
 If they abandoned you, there's no way they'd look for you. 

143
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,750
 Really? 

144
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,300
 That must be, right? 

145
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,350
 Then I get to live with my mom. 

146
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
That does happen, though.

147
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,030
   

148
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,700
Did this person ever come looking for Ga On?

149
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,980
No, never.

150
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,590
   

151
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,020
  The call is not going through.  

152
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,120
 After the beep...  

153
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,750
   

154
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,910
Ga On.

155
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,590
Will you go with this ahjussi for a minute?

156
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,980
What is going on here?

157
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,390
And what's with all this paperwork?

158
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,380
If we go to trial,

159
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,160
you'll be at a disadvantage.

160
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,090
For Ga On's sake,

161
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,760
you should go home.

162
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,810
I'll call you tomorrow.

163
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,140
Why would Mr. Cha...

164
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,290
 As for FB Life and Kang... 

165
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,620
 I'll deal with them from now on. 

166
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,220
   

167
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,440
   

168
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,680
   

169
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,150
His real name is Kang Dae Shik.

170
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,230
He's a thug who used to work in the Jeonnam area.

171
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,310
He worked under Chairman Kim at FB Distribution

172
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,640
but got fired two years ago for embezzlement.

173
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,850
He recently started working in the credit agency field.

174
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,300
But it's linked to FB Life.

175
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,670
What's definite is that

176
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,920
it was one of Kang Dae Shik's guys.

177
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,110
Here.

178
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,260
It's a list of OB/GYNs in that area and medical staff who worked there

179
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,230
based on Mi Yeon's whereabouts.

180
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,600
Thanks.

181
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,060
You're the only one I can ask for help.

182
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,120
Just as the child appeared, let's think that

183
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,560
Mi Yeon is alive and well somewhere.

184
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,600
    
Dr. Song from Pureum Hospital stopped by?

185
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,720
Not only last night but also this morning,

186
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,830
he stopped by the Chairman's residence before heading to the hospital.

187
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,480
Did he pass out or something?

188
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,690
Ever since Dr. Park stopped by, the security at the Chairman's residence is tighter.

189
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,000
But seeing how Dr. Park or his hospital staff aren't doing anything particularly

190
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,880
means I don't think the Chairman is in a critical condition.

191
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,930
How about the press?

192
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,120
On the SNS...

193
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,240
as well as porter sites are featuring relevant news.

194
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,480
They're posting faster than the correction articles that our PR team is putting out.

195
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,360
   

196
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,270
 If risk owner issues are repeated for Chairman Kim, 

197
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,290
 the shareholders won't let that slide. 

198
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,490
No need to expose everything.

199
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,690
Just bring up a few issues in the press.

200
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,450
Are you following Cha Min Joon's move?

201
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,380
Yes.

202
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,080
Not only Chairman Kim, but

203
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,960
make sure not to miss anything on Cha Min Joon and report to me.

204
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,140
Yes, ma'am.

205
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,930
Is something the matter?

206
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,880
Where is Mr. Cha?

207
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,650
He's not back from his business trip.

208
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,740
Okay.

209
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,790
The follow-up reporting will be on Mr. Hong's accident, right?

210
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,120
Geez, I'm going nuts here.

211
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,070
Hey.

212
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,000
The reporters keep calling me when you'll post a follow-up episode.

213
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,300
What should I tell them?

214
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,160
Hae Ra.

215
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,500
Kang Hae Ra!

216
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,250
Yeah.

217
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,250
I keep getting calls asking why we're not uploading

218
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,650
a follow-up report. What are you going to do?

219
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,410
Everyone is interested in the car accident.

220
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,400
    
 You really don't know who that was? 

221
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,890
No.

222
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,720
Who is it that she followed him out right away?

223
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,290
Yes, hello.

224
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,300
Okay. All right. I'll be right there.

225
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,530
Okay.

226
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,840
Who was it?

227
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,880
The police station.

228
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,080
They want me to pick up Mr. Hong's belongings.

229
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,800
I'll go with you.

230
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,800
Well...

231
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,940
I hear you're a VTuber?

232
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,060
Do you create video clips and post them

233
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,480
and when lots of people watch them and like them,

234
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,810
you get a profit from advertising.

235
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,610
Is that what it is?

236
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,950
Is that why you keep poking around?

237
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,460
"I raised FB Group's chairman Kim Sang Goo's son

238
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,080
and you should show appropriate appreciation.

239
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,440
If you don't, I'll keep poking around."

240
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,140
But...

241
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,680
if it goes beyond this,

242
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,350
all the effort you put into it

243
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,700
will diminish.

244
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,830
That's what I'm worried about.

245
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,400
Well, you know, people would love to hear about this.

246
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,100
Isn't that right, Kang Hae Ra?

247
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,490
Unless you want people to

248
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,180
talk about Ga On and

249
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,280
want the child's life to get messy,

250
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,120
move to a quiet place

251
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,010
and open up a cafe.

252
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,900
It was tough for you to raise someone else's child.

253
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,580
You should live your own life now.

254
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,480
I'm sure you can tell

255
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,950
by looking at the request to change the paternity rights yesterday.

256
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,520
By chance...

257
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,230
if you keep making an issue out of this,

258
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,830
for you to maintain your marriage,

259
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,440
in the place of your stillborn baby,

260
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,410
you took a child with perfectly good parents

261
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,870
and made him suffer through

262
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,030
abuse that he didn't have to suffer through.

263
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,140
While the child was being abused,

264
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,860
you neglected that situation.

265
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,630
You'll be held accountable.

266
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,620
Does such a young child...

267
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,520
have to get dragged to a courthouse and whatnot

268
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,930
and bring up painful memories

269
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,410
all over again?

270
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,370
That is if you don't care about that.

271
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,390
Why are you...

272
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,660
doing this now?

273
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,160
Were you even interested in

274
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,610
Mi Yeon sunbae or Ga On all this time?

275
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,310
If you were...

276
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,700
how could someone like you

277
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,850
not know that...

278
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,150
Ga On even existed for the last 11 years?

279
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:11,890
You have never even called all this time, but now...

280
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,680
you toss a few documents

281
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,370
and tell me to give up the child?

282
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,900
I can't do that.

283
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,610
Because Ga On is my son.

284
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,320
Where is Ga On right now?

285
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,480
Ga On!

286
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,490
Ga On!

287
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,090
Ga On...

288
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,370
thinks that...

289
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,430
he was abandoned in Canada.

290
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,670
   

291
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,420
   

292
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,390
   

293
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,660
   

294
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,230
   

295
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,980
   

296
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,210
 Who is my birth mother? 

297
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,500
 Why did she abandon me? 

298
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,000
 

299
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,970
 

300
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,450
Ga On.

301
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,500
Mom!

302
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,100
Mom, I missed you.

303
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,100
I missed you, too.

304
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,480
Ga On.

305
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,860
I guess your birth dad...

306
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,750
wanted to talk to you

307
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,580
so much and...

308
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,770
do so many things with you.

309
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,600
Also, I'm staying at a friend's house right now.

310
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,460
Her place is too small.

311
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,740
Yeah, Mom.

312
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,140
I'll be fine here.

313
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,430
Don't worry.

314
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,990
I'm so sorry, Ga On.

315
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,040
Instead...

316
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,230
we're in Korea.

317
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,670
You'll visit me often, right?

318
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,790
Of course.

319
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,990
But how come...

320
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,130
Mr. Cha got to bring back Ga On?

321
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,010
In any case...

322
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,710
I wanted to tell you about it.

323
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,570
As you know, Ga On will...

324
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,800
inherit FB Group in the future.

325
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,840
But...

326
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,530
my daughter Tae On

327
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,360
who grew up as an only daughter...

328
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
I don't know if she will embrace

329
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,250
her brother, who appeared out of the blue,

330
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,730
as an older sister.

331
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,640
So that...

332
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,320
my Ga On...

333
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,240
can live safely...

334
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,430
I'd like you to keep a distance.

335
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,370
In the future, I hope that...

336
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,200
you behave in consideration of Ga On in many ways.

337
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,870
 Are you kidding me? 

338
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,880
 All the scripts and files got switched out. 

339
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,410
 Who planned this? 

340
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,020
 I should at least know... 

341
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,450
 whose game I'm playing. 

342
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,360
 I'll call you in the morning. 

343
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,330
 Come then. 

344
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,620
Say hello. Managing Director Kim Tae On.

345
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,670
You know her, right?

346
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,180
Press Director Kwon recommended you.

347
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,000
He said you have strong journalistic integrity.

348
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,720
You should continue to move up.

349
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,530
   

350
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,390
I believe it's meaningful to broadcast our group's endless internal voice

351
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:12,240
as one of the affiliated television stations.

352
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,070
When the water...

353
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,290
stays still too long, it goes bad.

354
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,320
When it comes to water...

355
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,720
it doesn't go bad in small portions.

356
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,200
Would it be possible to cut out only the rotten part?

357
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:44,090
You want to cut out Chairman Kim only using the press.

358
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,550
That's how I should take it, right?

359
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,730
Isn't that what the news is?

360
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:55,540
You have a goal and agenda...

361
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,700
and if you determine there's a person or a group that is beneficial to the society,

362
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,290
you're a tool to spread that to the public, so they can filter that information.

363
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,690
The target may change, but...

364
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,480
I understand news to be playing that type of role.

365
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,010
I'll discuss it with Ms. Jung.

366
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,480
There are more than enough reporters who are full of a sense of justice.

367
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,600
 Ask my mother to help persuade the shareholders? 

368
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,410
Chairman Kim will try harder to pay attention to

369
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,220
where I go and who I meet.

370
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,890
That is true, but...

371
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,860
I don't think the old man is over what you did to him last time.

372
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,580
Now that all the shareholders know what we're thinking about,

373
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,850
I don't know where we'll get another chance if we miss this one.

374
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,170
If we fail,

375
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,480
not only me,

376
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,780
Chairman Kim will try to attack everyone on Mother's side.

377
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,780
Right.

378
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,440
I'll talk to her.

379
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,360
As soon as we get rid of Chairman Kim,

380
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,890
I'll talk to the Prosecutors' Office

381
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,480
and allow you to leave the country and whatnot.

382
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,180
Just endure a little longer.

383
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,250
I remember her.

384
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,380
She came through someone I know.

385
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,940
But this person...

386
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,690
came alone to give birth and left.

387
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,760
After that...

388
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,860
do you happen to know where she went?

389
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,370
It's my older sister.

390
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,260
I lost touch for over ten years.

391
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,590
I just found out that she gave birth.

392
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,350
I haven't seen her ever since that day.

393
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,200
Then can I meet the person who introduced the hospital to her?

394
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,450
   

395
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,770
You're her younger brother?

396
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:19,360
I'm trying to find her whereabouts after giving birth.

397
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,400
I did recommend her to the hospital,

398
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,810
but she didn't come back after that.

399
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,900
But the thing I remember about her is that

400
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,880
she asked if she can borrow

401
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,690
an unsuspecting identity from among the women who come here

402
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,420
and give birth.

403
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,850
She seemed to be on the run.

404
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,020
That's why I recommended the hospital to her.

405
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,900
A lot of foreigners go to that hospital.

406
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,110
I thought it would be less stressful.

407
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,280
After that...

408
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,910
some men who were looking for this woman came by.

409
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,490
By chance...

410
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,600
was it him?

411
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,340
I'm not sure.

412
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,720
I don't remember his face.

413
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,170
The men left a terrible impression on me,

414
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,800
so I said I didn't know her.

415
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,960
On the back of the neck of one of the men

416
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,800
had a tattoo.

417
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,750
 A tattoo on his neck? 

418
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:46,560
Is Mr. Cha not back yet?

419
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,580
No.

420
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,330
Do you need to talk to him urgently?

421
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,330
Why is Mr. Cha...

422
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:58,010
working with Chairman Kim?

423
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,130
Well...

424
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,890
Up until now,

425
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,410
lots of people were victimized by FB Life.

426
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,060
But Chairman Kim has a broad network in the political and business world.

427
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,100
Not one lawsuit against him would go through.

428
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,910
So Mr. Cha joined FB Life personally

429
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,960
and decided to get proof of Chairman Kim's corruption.

430
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,210
Thank you.

431
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,480
I think this is Hae Ra sunbae's.

432
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,590
Yeah, you're right.

433
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,840
Good job. Get some rest and see you in the morning.

434
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,500
If Hae Ra sunbae's camera...

435
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,070
was in the accident vehicle...

436
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,690
When did you get home?

437
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,290
You didn't answer your phone all day.

438
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,240
Do you know how worried I was?

439
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:03,430
Did you drink all that alone?

440
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,860
Is something wrong?

441
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,580
Who was that man earlier?

442
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,370
What's wrong?

443
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,630
Eun Hye...

444
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,130
Why didn't I know?

445
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:32,830
That Ga On was thinking that...

446
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,070
He was so lonely...

447
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,590
They say you never know, but how could that be...

448
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,510
Get some fresh air.

449
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,250
I'll get some medicine for you to sober up.

450
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,230
It's okay.

451
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,690
If you sleep this way, you'll suffer tomorrow.

452
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,210
I'll be right back.

453
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,970
Does Kang Hae Ra know now?

454
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,050
That you're Mi Yeon's younger brother?

455
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,740
I don't think she knows yet.

456
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,960
I told Chairman Kim...

457
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,410
that I'd tell her myself.

458
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,700
 Instead, we're in Korea. 

459
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,700
 You'll visit me often, right? 

460
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,000
Gosh, you really did come back quickly.

461
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,490
Then...

462
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,140
you should've told me.

463
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,700
I heard.

464
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,150
The reason you joined FB Life,

465
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,650
and because Director Kim Tae On had to be in the dark,

466
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,990
you brought back Ga On yourself from Canada.

467
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,440
When I heard that Chairman Kim's son was in Canada,

468
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,590
and the person who raised the child

469
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,770
was you, Hae Ra...

470
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,520
I couldn't believe it.

471
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,320
I had to confirm with my own eyes.

472
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,510
Is he truly Chairman Kim's son?

473
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,700
- Whether that child is... 
- He's a son of a sunbae...

474
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,510
who genuinely reached out to me

475
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,350
while I was struggling badly.

476
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,570
I exposed that sunbae's scandal...

477
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,640
on the air.

478
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,040
I was worse of a person back then.

479
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,960
When I realized that her helping hand

480
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,780
was not meant to help me,

481
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,980
I wanted to pay her back.

482
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,420
I went to that extent, yet...

483
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,760
I was in a marriage worse off than hell,

484
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,840
and I even lost my child while pregnant.

485
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,710
I wanted to ask that sunbae again.

486
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,710
Why did she recommend me for that position

487
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,750
and throw me into such hell?

488
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,480
Whether I blamed her or forgave her,

489
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,050
I had to do something to survive.

490
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,120
So I went to visit that sunbae.

491
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,440
The moment I saw Ga On that she was holding,

492
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,620
I thought he was an unwelcome baby.

493
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,080
Just like the baby I had lost.

494
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,980
Even though I was in a terrible situation,

495
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,510
I thought it'd be better than for the baby to be on the run.

496
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:57,710
But I was mistaken.

497
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,360
He said it was like hell.

498
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,790
It was so hard for him.

499
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,880
So, I...

500
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,300
couldn't say anything to him.

501
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:23,190
♫  I'm facing the end of our endless relationship  ♫

502
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:30,730
♫  Carrying the memories of us together to bridge the gap  ♫

503
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:33,870
♫  As you go away  ♫

504
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:42,200
♫  I let go of your hand that I held tightly as I turn around  ♫

505
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,540
♫  At the edge where I can't touch you any more  ♫

506
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,840
I really want to...

507
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,260
tell him this.

508
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,480
"Ga On...

509
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,830
you were not abandoned.

510
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,550
That his birth mom nor I...

511
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,210
abandoned you."

512
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,140
From now on,

513
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:36,720
don't bring up FB Life and Chairman Kim with Hae Ra.

514
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,300
I found it!

515
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,760
Gosh, scared me.

516
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,870
What did you find?

517
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,400
Hey!

518
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,990
Sunbae, you said you know where Kang Hae Ra is, right?

519
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,390
Thank you.

520
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,000
After you came on, the viewer response was great

521
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,460
and there is a big interest in follow-up reporting.

522
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,640
If you're having a difficult time investigating...

523
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,240
I'm sorry.

524
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,830
I won't be able to report on...

525
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,160
new regarding FB Life.

526
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,440
Was there a threat?

527
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,430
Director Kim Tae On came to me.

528
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:24,880
She gave me evidence of corruption on Chairman Kim.

529
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,340
Up until now,

530
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,680
because I'm an FBC reporter,

531
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,900
I knew of the illegal actions by FB Life,

532
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:39,320
but had to turn a blind eye.

533
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,740
 Does such a young child... 

534
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,610
 have to get dragged to a courthouse and whatnot 

535
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,560
 and bring up painful memories 

536
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,490
 all over again? 

537
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,290
I'm not in a place...

538
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,500
where I can be neutral about this incident.

539
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,530
I won't be able to get involved further.

540
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,460
Then that spark...

541
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,150
Would it be okay if I turned up the heat?

542
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,450
To see it die down this way...

543
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,450
is too much of a waste.

544
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,400
 Noona. 

545
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,940
 Hi, you're here. 

546
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,060
 What are you doing? 

547
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,000
 - Do you need my help? 
- No, I'm finished. 

548
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,200
 What did you plant? 

549
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,510
 Well, chrysanthemums, 

550
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,840
 Siberian chrysanthemum, geumjeongwha. 

551
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,590
 This reminds me of when Mom used to be alive. 

552
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,250
 I'll plant peonies next spring. 

553
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,780
 We wouldn't have to go look for flowers. 

554
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,100
 Just like when we were little, 

555
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,090
 let's put a table here, 

556
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:05,180
 and drink tea and read, looking at the flowers. 

557
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,450
 Nice. 

558
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,630
 Aren't they pretty? 

559
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,550
 He's a son of a sunbae... 

560
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,600
 who genuinely reached out to me while I was struggling badly. 

561
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,160
 I exposed that sunbae's scandal... 

562
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,870
 on the air. 

563
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:25,030
 When I realized that her helping hand 

564
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,480
 was not meant to help me, 

565
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,870
 I wanted to pay her back. 

566
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,020
 What exactly happened? 

567
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,850
Yes.

568
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,610
   

569
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:33,350
Do you think we'd get something out of following him around?

570
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,440
We managed to find the evidence.

571
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,040
But with only that video clip,

572
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,920
I don't think we can put away Kang.

573
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:43,090
Oh, yeah.

574
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:44,880
I have another work request.

575
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,200
Let's finish up here and go back to the office.

576
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,750
You'll find out when we get back.

577
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,690
 

578
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,410
Why isn't the follow-up episode posting?

579
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,010
Hyung!

580
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,470
Why couldn't I reach you?

581
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,970
Did you see it?

582
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:11,440
Kang Hae Ra's FB Life exposé.

583
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,360
People's reactions are no joke.

584
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,720
If she posts a follow-up video with Chairman Kim's corruption...

585
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,060
We're here.

586
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,780
He didn't go anywhere else besides his home and office.

587
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,310
The car gum...

588
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:33,530
I mean...

589
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,700
We put a GPS tracker.

590
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,120
As for Kang's recording from the accident site,

591
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,120
back it up just in case.

592
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,200
Please keep following Kang for now.

593
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,130
Okay, will do.

594
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,930
Mr. Cha asked us to follow Kang?

595
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,000
Yeah.

596
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,670
Let's go.

597
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,900
Good evening.

598
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,400
Hyung, what's going on?

599
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,960
Why are you asking them to follow Kang?

600
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,160
I went to...

601
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,080
Canada during the business trip.

602
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,430
Canada?

603
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,940
Kang Hae Ra's son...

604
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,600
You went to meet Kang Hae Ra's son?

605
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,980
That child...

606
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,980
is my sister's child.

607
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,690
What?

608
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:26,840
What do you mean?

609
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,780
Then the child that Kang Hae Ra raised after

610
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,420
giving stillbirth is...

611
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,370
your sister's child?

612
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,620
She went to my sister, hearing that she and the baby were being chased.

613
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,000
How could this be...

614
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:43,230
By chance...

615
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,630
does Kang Hae Ra know where your sister is?

616
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,030
They haven't kept in touch since.

617
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,840
Kang Hae Ra raised Mi Yeon noona's...

618
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,650
- child all this time?
- And Kang...

619
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:00,820
He works for Director Kim Tae On.

620
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,560
Then the truck accident that the insurance agents were involved in...

621
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,230
Goo Eun Hye called me after finding out that

622
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,980
Kang was involved in Mr. Hong's accident.

623
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,920
I asked her to follow him.

624
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,670
 

625
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:23,330
 Then that spark... 

626
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:25,990
 Would it be okay if I turned up the heat? 

627
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,450
 To see it die down this way... 

628
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,360
 is too much of a waste. 

629
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,280
 It's snowing. 

630
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:46,870
 It's snowing. 

631
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:49,680
 Oh, my. Isn't this the first snow of the season? 

632
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,290
 It's the first snow. 

633
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:53,320
 Wow, it's so beautiful. 

634
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,440
 My gosh. 

635
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,620
On the day of the accident...

636
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,860
The camera I had in the car

637
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,340
could have recorded the accident.

638
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:24,240
If I have that recording...

639
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,970
- we can get Kang. 
- We'll wrap up...

640
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,370
that accident on our side.

641
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:33,460
Kang is dangerous.

642
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,130
I can't let you...

643
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,290
get mixed up in this anymore.

644
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,280
And quit your...

645
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,350
revenge channel now.

646
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,370
No.

647
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,070
No matter how it got started,

648
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,180
I started with my name on it.

649
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:00,910
I'll wrap it up as well.

650
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,100
   

651
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,530
Then go to the insurance agents' union office.

652
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,440
Due to my channel's nature,

653
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,770
I focused on exposing an individual.

654
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,230
But as TV news,

655
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,850
you can treat it from a broader point of view.

656
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,110
I looked into it and...

657
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:34,060
besides this abuse of power incident,

658
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,950
insurance agents were treated unreasonably quite a lot.

659
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:58,480
   

660
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:13,850
Maybe Kang Hae Ra got scared this late in the game.

661
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:18,090
I don't think she wants to expose more about FB Life.

662
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:21,680
These are documents that Kang Hae Ra had gathered in order to expose.

663
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,560
If I report this,

664
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,480
Chairman Kim's ability as a CEO of FB Life will be an issue

665
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,790
and will negatively impact his leadership.

666
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,390
   

667
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:40,450
Please give me...

668
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,240
the press director position.

669
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:50,650
The press director position?

670
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,690
They say you put new wine in new a wineskin.

671
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,130
Press Director Kwon is already water gone bad.

672
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,960
You're well aware that you can't drag down

673
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,590
Chairman Kim with this once.

674
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,640
   

675
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,740
FB Life, drop the lawsuits against the agents!

676
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,700
 Drop the lawsuits! Drop the lawsuits! 

677
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,900
The government should guarantee labor rights to insurance agents!

678
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,200
 Guaranee! Guarantee! 

679
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,310
FB Life, apologize to insurance agents

680
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,580
- and drop the lawsuits! 
- Next news.

681
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:31,010
The insurance agents' union started protests

682
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,670
against FB Life's abuse of power.

683
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:37,540
Let's speak to the reporter on the ground.

684
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,970
 The insurance agents' union 

685
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,360
 insist that this incident isn't exclusive to certain agents. 

686
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,330
 They emphasized that their labor rights must be guaranteed. 

687
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,700
 One of the bills that were on hold in the Assembly 

688
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,970
 that guarantees rights of the workers for special hires 

689
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,290
 is in focus as to whether or not it will be passed due to the latest issue. 

690
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,520
   

691
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,960
What's this?

692
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,080
It's an airline reservation.

693
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,660
Mr. Cha went to Canada recently.

694
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,810
He came back with a child.

695
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,700
- A child? 
- Yes.

696
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,250
Did you find out about that child?

697
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:18,120
It's Kang Hae Ra's child.

698
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,850
Kang Hae Ra?

699
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:23,230
Yes.

700
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:29,650
Find out more about that child.

701
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:30,700
Okay.

702
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:40,040
FB Life, apologize to insurance agents

703
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,120
and drop the lawsuits!

704
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,090
 Drop the lawsuits! Drop the lawsuits! 

705
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:47,870
The government should guarantee labor rights to insurance agents!

706
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:50,400
The company is in such disarray.

707
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,870
Yet, the Chairman doesn't say anything to resolve the issue.

708
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,800
Other insurance companies are going crazy, too.

709
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,070
If the rights of the workers are granted for insurance agents over this,

710
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,680
they'll all come to us and hold us responsible.

711
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,130
The Chairman will hold a press conference soon.

712
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,280
He said the press conference

713
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,180
will replace today's meeting.

714
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,500
 What is he talking about? 

715
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,700
Will he announce his resignation or something?

716
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:20,470
He should resolve the problem

717
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,830
before he resigns.

718
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:24,140
 - What's going on? 
- What? 

719
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,470
 What is he thinking? 

720
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,480
- Geez. 
- What's he doing?

721
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,350
In a moment, Chairman Kim Sang Goo will hold a press conference.

722
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:35,090
Reporters, please take your seats.

723
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:37,520
   

724
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:44,940
 I'm here today... 

725
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:46,330
 to say... 

726
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:50,320
 something very important 

727
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,600
 to everyone who treasures FB Life. 

728
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,880
 To get to the point, 

729
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,050
I take full responsibility for the current situation

730
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,050
and like recent incident,

731
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:06,730
when the source company's faults have been publicized

732
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:11,550
 I'd like to reduce the chain reaction of damages on the entire group. 

733
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,800
 As we have discussed numerous times in the past, 

734
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,610
I'd like to transform the FB Group's system into

735
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:21,740
a holding company.

736
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:26,080
 The Chairman will stop here. 

737
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,810
 If you have any questions, 

738
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:29,930
 please ask Director Cha Min Joon. 

739
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,320
Kang Hae Ra's child you asked me to look into.

740
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:42,060
Kang Hae Ra's baby actually died during labor.

741
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,140
And...

742
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:47,040
the Chairman's office purchased Mr. Cha's airline ticket to Canada.

743
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,180
What are you talking about?

744
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,840
 Due to responsible management, I believe 

745
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,150
 profit and efficiency will be maximized. 

746
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:07,680
 I'll take the next question. 

747
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:13,020
 Director Kim Tae On... 

748
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,020
 must be pissed off at Chairman Kim and you. 

749
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,260
What are you going to do now?

750
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,120
Now that Director Kim is fuming,

751
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,660
she'll loosen up her dogs.

752
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,090
I'll catch that dog then.

753
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,380
There's trouble.

754
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:32,730
Hae Ra saw Mr. Hong's accident video clip

755
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,480
and went to meet Kang.

756
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,190
   

757
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:12,570
   

758
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,150
I...

759
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,420
recorded you.

760
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:25,850
   

761
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,470
Damn it!

762
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,460
It's no use.

763
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,880
I'll tell the world that you killed Mr. Hong.

764
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:46,060
I should've...

765
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,440
finished you off then.

766
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,410
Crazy bastard.

767
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,860
Are you okay?

768
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,470
Kang...

769
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:32,840
I'm sure it's all recorded on the CCTV.

770
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,580
Before he gets rid of it first,

771
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,220
hurry up and get the recording.

772
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:44,700
Why are you so reckless?

773
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:48,740
What if something happens to you? How about Ga On?

774
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,760
I said...

775
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,310
I said I'd wrap up everything!

776
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:11,500
♫  I will walk through rough life  ♫

777
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:18,690
♫  You and I will stand in the midst of it all  ♫

778
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:25,570
♫  I will not forget our promises  ♫

779
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:32,320
♫  I have it engraved in my heart  ♫

780
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:36,640
♫  I desperately wish  ♫

781
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:47,520
 

782
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:56,340
