1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,840
 

2
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,010
 

3
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,660
 

4
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,430
 I'll be with you to the end. 

5
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,200
 FB Life. 

6
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,430
 This is our next product. Ta-da! 

7
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,580
 I'm so fond of this product these days. 

8
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,100
When you put this on, it moisturizes your skin,

9
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,360
and the coloring is so nice.

10
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,800
It's called "Chic Brick."

11
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,400
For those of you with dry lips,

12
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,330
if you put this on, it will take care of the dryness.

13
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,460
I ordered this, so I can put it on today.

14
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,330
Should I try putting it on?

15
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,170
 

16
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,480
Well, we're not recording today. We're just meeting.

17
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,590
I don't know how they record these days.

18
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,910
 

19
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,320
"Ask Hoon what it's like."

20
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,590
I've been pestering him for the last few days.

21
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,240
But he won't tell me.

22
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,260
 

23
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,610
I almost forgot to tell you.

24
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,360
It's 7 p.m. tonight, okay?

25
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,700
Then see you later at 7 p.m.

26
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,310
 
 Kang Hae Ra received the award for the Power Influencer. 

27
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,370
 
 "Unceasing Life" placed on the bestseller list this month. 

28
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,720
 
 Kim Hae Ra has been... 

29
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,990
 

30
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,640
 

31
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,760
Who's your dermatologist?

32
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,900
How can they do this to your face?

33
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm very thin-skinned.

34
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,380
True.

35
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,070
Your complexion is so thin and transparent.

36
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,850
So when is your afternoon appointment?

37
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,200
- At 7 p.m. 
 - 7 p.m.

38
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,740
Then stop by around 5 p.m.

39
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,400
Oh, I'll go where you are.

40
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,570
Will you have the time?

41
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,040
What if I don't?

42
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,090
I'm making a living thanks to you.

43
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,130
Put in a good word to the director.

44
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,510
Unni, you made it because of your talent.

45
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,320
No matter how well I speak of you,

46
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,390
young people wouldn't come here if you weren't good.

47
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,600
My gosh! Thanks anyway.

48
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,530
 Was she ever a reporter or an anchor? 

49
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,960
She's a third-grade reporter who 
breaks the news of celebrity affairs.

50
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,670
A book, my foot.

51
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,810
If you call that a book, I would've written tons of them already.

52
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,860
An influencer?

53
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,830
She uses her husband's name to get more followers and clicks.

54
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,630
If it weren't for her husband,

55
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,750
who'd remember her as a reporter?

56
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,840
Do you even have any followers?

57
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,510
My gosh!

58
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,210
Having a successful husband says I'm capable.

59
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,710
Better than marrying an incompetent man,

60
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,850
then get a divorce without any alimony...

61
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,070
and mooching off of a show.

62
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,050
Are you...

63
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,860
talking to me?

64
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,080
Is there anyone else in here who mooches off her work?

65
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,890
What the...

66
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,470
Me?

67
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,740
Hey, you. Have we ever been close?

68
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,930
How dare you talk down to me?

69
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,530
Of course, we're not close.

70
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,740
We have to be on a similar level to be friends.

71
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,540
On top of that, I was never an anchor nor a reporter.

72
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,610
I'm not even your hoobae or anything.

73
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,120
Whether we compare our ages

74
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,790
or our positions in our future program,

75
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,580
I can speak down to you.

76
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,000
Of course, you can't.

77
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,070
Don't you...

78
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,740
dare speak down to me whether I'm around or not.

79
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,920
If you want to keep telling your jokes

80
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,280
on TV with your cheap smile.

81
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,000
- I'm finished, right? 
 - Yeah.

82
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,320
- Then come by at 5 p.m. 
 - Okay, I'll be there.

83
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,460
 

84
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,270
How have you been during the week, everyone?

85
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,130
- I'm Lee Hoon Seok of Entertainment News. 
 - I'm Lee Hae Bin.

86
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,200
Hoon Seok, congratulations.

87
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,300
Last week at the Daehan Arts Awards,

88
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,180
you received the Best Male Entertainer Award on TV.

89
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,650
I have all of you to thank for the honor.

90
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,440
I'd like to thank all of you again.

91
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,400
Congratulations.

92
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,180
In my opinion, the photos and the logo look good.

93
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,490
What do you think?

94
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,290
I think it's great that we get to start out together like this.

95
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,230
Ms. Kim is here.

96
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,890
My gosh! Ms. Kim!

97
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,970
How have you been? I missed you so much.

98
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,610
I know. It's been so long.

99
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,030
- Is Hoon Seok well? 
 - Of course.

100
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,060
Ms. Kim, give me a moment.

101
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,660
I got this from the New York jewelry collection last month.

102
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,370
- I thought of you. 
 - Oh, my.

103
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,600
What in the world?

104
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,790
You didn't have to.

105
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,700
But this is so pretty.

106
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,080
I don't know what's inside, but...

107
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,010
the wrapping itself is a gift.

108
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,650
How can I open this?

109
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,580
It's a necklace with a pendant.

110
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,760
You like to wear knit tops.

111
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,200
I thought it'd look nice if you wear it with that.

112
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,480
Gosh, you're too much, honey.

113
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
How sweet and keen of you.

114
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,980
My goodness...

115
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,150
But Ms. Kim, I prepared a gift only for you.

116
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,480
I got it.

117
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,000
Then I'll just have to zip my mouth.

118
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,290
Yes.

119
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,520
Thanks.

120
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,700
Hi.

121
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,860
- Hello! 
  - Hi! 

122
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,550
You guys are here. Come here.

123
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,900
- Have you been well? 
 - Yes.

124
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,060
I'll explain the program to you.

125
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,740
The "Latest Talk" under number three...

126
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,060
We'll have a male guest come in for this.

127
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,230
Let's take a look.

128
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,090
 

129
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,850
 All these behaviors 

130
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,050
 have mislead the defendant. 

131
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,280
Also, the victim reported the sexual assault

132
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,940
by the defendant after one week of the incident.

133
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,220
Usually, the rape victims...

134
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,690
report it right away or the next day at the latest.

135
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,750
Isn't that right?

136
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,140
 
 Witness, after misleading the defendant,

137
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,510
you had a sexual relationship with him.

138
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,380
And since the defendant is your superior at work

139
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,160
  
 and knowing that he's also a well-known businessman,

140
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,700
you asked him for money in return for sexual favors.

141
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,120
When he didn't accept your request as you had planned,

142
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,990
you reported him for rape.

143
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,840
You had prepared, just in case...

144
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,390
your undergarment.

145
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,670
Objection.

146
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,390
  
 The defense is blurring the core of the issue by his guesswork.

147
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,620
It's a highly deducible hypothesis.

148
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,830
Overruled.

149
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,850
The witness kept the undergarment
 she wore at the time for over a week.

150
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,930
- And the intention of keeping it... 
 - I had a fiancé.

151
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,140
So that night...

152
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,850
I clearly rejected that man.

153
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,470
Because I was pregnant...

154
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,720
I begged him to let me go.

155
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,370
But that night...

156
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,020
I lost my baby...

157
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,600
and even lost the man I love...

158
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,910
What aspect of...

159
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,250
my behavior exactly...

160
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,630
made him think that I was his lover?

161
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,080
I don't understand that at all.

162
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,050
Yes, Seung Joo came into work with that purse for a while.

163
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,640
I asked her if it was a real name brand, and she said probably.

164
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,270
Did she say that her fiancé gave it to her?

165
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,900
I asked her if it was from her fiancé, but she just mumbled.

166
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,530
So I just thought she got a rich boyfriend.

167
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,610
Is there a reason you thought that?

168
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,490
Well, I heard that her fiancé was still looking for a job,

169
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,130
and she could barely afford a cup of coffee.

170
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,390
I didn't think that he could buy her a purse
 that's more than 10 million won.

171
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,100
And when I asked her if a guy gave it to her, she said yes.

172
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,190
Your Honor.

173
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,800
The relationship between a boss and an employee.

174
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,050
And apart from their age gap,

175
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,080
they are a man and a woman.

176
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,330
When the man buys her an expensive purse showing interest,

177
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,660
if the woman accepts that gift and agrees to see him,

178
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,800
wouldn't anyone say that the feelings

179
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,610
are mutual?

180
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,200
That's because...

181
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,710
I had no idea that the purse cost more than 10 million won.

182
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,580
He said that...

183
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,760
since I had to work late a lot that month

184
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,090
and since I excelled at my job...

185
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,380
And the reason I couldn't say that he had bought me the purse

186
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,520
is because if other employees find out...

187
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,900
That will be all.

188
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,970
 

189
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,150
The sexual assault charge was dropped
 in two months. How do you feel?

190
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,370
I heard you've suffered a massive loss due to this case.

191
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,980
What will you do about the secretary who sued you?

192
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,910
 What are your plans for the future? 

193
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,410
First, I apologize for...

194
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,450
all the troubles I've caused.

195
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,220
Geez, why are you doing this again?

196
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,100
You devil.

197
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,230
Scumbag lawyers like you are worse than rich worms like him.

198
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,900
You're worse than worms.

199
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,770
Do you like money that much?

200
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,150
Hyung, go in first.

201
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,190
Please don't do this.

202
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,830
Do you think it would've been different with other lawyers?

203
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,240
They would've been worse.

204
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,810
Please leave.

205
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,450
Geez.

206
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,820
 After two months of long dispute, 

207
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,920
 the court sided with Song who was 

208
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,890
 accused of sexually assautling his secretary. 

209
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,610
 Considering the circumstances before and after the sexual act, 

210
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,270
 the court ruled that Choi's claim was
 not enough to rule it as a crime  

211
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,350
  
  and reached the decision. 

212
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,730
 You devil. 

213
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,430
 Scumbag lawyers like you are worse than 

214
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,530
  rich worms like him. 

215
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,680
 I lost my baby... 

216
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,400
 and even lost the man I love... 

217
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,490
Who are you?

218
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,820
Choi Seung Joo will know what it is.

219
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,250
Oh, my gosh.

220
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,720
Oh, no...

221
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,570
Wait!

222
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,030
Hyung.

223
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,090
Choi Seung Joo got home okay.

224
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,500
I also dropped that off with her mother.

225
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,450
Another lawyer would've done the same.

226
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,220
Do you think so?

227
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,620
Go home and rest for the day.

228
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,710
No.

229
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,150
Did you say Daeheung Bookstore?

230
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,390
Yes.

231
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,670
I'll feel better when I see her.

232
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,790
Don't worry.

233
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,690
It will be okay once we pass this area.

234
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,730
All this trouble because of me.

235
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,090
Don't mention it.

236
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,860
The director said that the photoshoot will end after midnight.

237
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,470
He asked me to wait until you're finished and drive you home.

238
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,180
Okay.

239
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,500
Are you okay?

240
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,930
Yes.

241
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,260
 What's going on here? 

242
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,570
 You cut me off! 

243
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,670
 Look at the black box then! 

244
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,900
 Let me make a phone call. 

245
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,290
I think this is going to take a while. What should I do?

246
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,050
Then I'll take the subway.

247
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,200
Please call me after you're done.

248
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,510
But the subway is too...

249
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,800
- I'll call a taxi for you. 
 - No.

250
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,350
I think the subway will be faster. It's rush hour.

251
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,820
- I'll see you later then. 
 - Okay.

252
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,930
Sunbaenim.

253
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,590
- Hello. 
 - I'm Hyun Sung.

254
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,960
Kim Hyun Sung.

255
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,590
That's right.

256
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,380
Do you take the subway?

257
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,520
I don't belong to an agency.

258
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,630
But why are you...

259
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,700
My van got into an accident. I was running late.

260
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,770
I'm in a rush.

261
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,180
Your heel...

262
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,580
It's okay.

263
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,910
I can't help it.

264
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,400
Thanks anyway.

265
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,960
Sunbae, wait a minute.

266
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,600
Wait a moment.

267
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,610
I fixed it for now. Try walking.

268
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,820
Thanks.

269
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,850
I really have to go now.

270
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,030
Oh, yes.

271
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,040
- Go ahead. 
 - See you again.

272
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,740
 

273
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,900
 

274
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,280
 Our meeting with the author of "Unceasing Life," 

275
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,730
  Kang Hae Ra, will begin in the event hall soon. 

276
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,620
 

277
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,790
  
 A reporter, a wife, an influencer, and now an author.

278
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,490
What is your limit, Ms. Kang Hae Ra?

279
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,220
I heard you'll appear on a new variety show as well.

280
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,300
Yes.

281
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,450
Just like your book title, you continue 
to challenge yourself without ceasing.

282
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,260
I'm sure you've had times of 
disappointment and struggles, right?

283
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,200
Yes, of course.

284
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,860
As you all know,

285
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,390
since my husband is a popular entertainer,

286
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,330
I got to enjoy lots of perks.

287
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,580
But after I stopped working to support him,

288
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,790
I wasn't really myself at some point

289
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,310
but living only as entertainerLee Hoon Seok's wife.

290
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,580
And whatever I do, I had to consider my husband's image.

291
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,130
I had to limit myself.

292
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,530
Hyung.

293
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,950
I bought everything, including all the books that came in today.

294
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,500
Good job.

295
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,570
 I never dreamed that all those thoughts 

296
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,400
would be published in a book.

297
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,270
Congratulations on your book.

298
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,710
Gosh, thank you.

299
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,860
 

300
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,980
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you!

301
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,750
All the books in the bookstore are sold out.

302
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,370
Other branches as well.

303
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,670
It's already on its third-reprinting.

304
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,380
- Thank you. 
 - Thanks.

305
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,920
Your name?

306
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,420
It's Kim Hyun Sung.

307
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm your fan.

308
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,890
This is a gift.

309
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,360
You scraped your heel.

310
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,860
You were like that earlier, too.

311
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,970
I didn't think you had the time to change your shoes.

312
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,030
They're only 10,000 won. Don't be burdened.

313
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:37,450
Just buy me a meal if we run into each other at the TV station.

314
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,920
Here you go.

315
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,180
Go home comfortably.

316
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,830
Goodbye.

317
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:36,760
 

318
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,990
 Thank you! 

319
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,530
Ms. Kang, you worked so hard tonight.

320
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,710
You, too.

321
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,300
Grab a celebratory drink tonight.

322
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,520
Okay.

323
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,980
 

324
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,530
 

325
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,170
Hey.

326
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,920
Payback.

327
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,390
I don't need a handkerchief.

328
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,450
Buy me some food, Sunbae.

329
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,440
 We love you! 

330
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,350
 Congratulations! 

331
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,150
 We love your show! 

332
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,100
Thank you!

333
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,490
Thank you!

334
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,960
Thank you!

335
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,440
When does the taping begin?

336
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,120
Mid next month.

337
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,390
They filmed today's meeting as well.

338
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,790
Her book is selling well also.

339
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,760
She's getting lots of offers from everywhere.

340
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,480
Who's on the show with her?

341
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,900
Moon Ji Soo.

342
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,360
She became a freelancer last year. She's from TBC.

343
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,100
She doesn't have an agency yet.

344
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,810
No, thanks.

345
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,490
Are you uncomfortable?

346
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:03,200
You feel obligated to buy me food 
since you're wearing the shoes,

347
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,360
but how did I know about this place?

348
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,430
I'm a regular here, too.

349
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,280
Although I come only on special days.

350
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,690
Just a moment.

351
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,350
While reading a book,

352
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,920
I learned that you were a regular 
here since your reporter days.

353
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,590
I always wanted to come here with you.

354
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,960
Dig in.

355
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,060
Order if you want more.

356
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,990
Aren't you going to ask me who those men are?

357
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,400
They're loan sharks.

358
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,490
I came to Seoul at the age of 17 to succeed.

359
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,530
I've done all kinds of things.

360
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,900
At first, my cellphone got disconnected,

361
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,890
then I ran out of rent money...

362
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,340
Then my mom got hurt and asked to send a hospital fee.

363
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,240
While doing all that,

364
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,750
I found myself on the ground when I came to.

365
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,420
Like tonight.

366
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,020
What do I need to do?

367
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,110
What do I need to do to be like you?

368
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,070
Do I look like I'm successful?

369
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,990
At least...

370
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,060
you don't have any debt.

371
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,920
I heard all the books at the bookstores are sold out.

372
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,330
And you'll soon appear on a variety
 show with your name on it.

373
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,040
You're right.

374
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,360
I guess I'm successful by that measure.

375
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,520
Yes. You are successful,

376
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,830
and you're a role model for all the reporters.

377
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,220
Have a drink.

378
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,410
Although I butted in on such a wonderful day,

379
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,250
I want to congratulate you.

380
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,510
All right.

381
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,770
Celebrate me.

382
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:22,350
I truly wanted to be congratulated today.

383
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,120
Congratulations, Sunbaenim.

384
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,760
Cheers.

385
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,820
When I become successful later on, 
let's come back here together.

386
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,090
I'll treat you big then.

387
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,650
Whoa...

388
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,790
But only skirt meat when you're that successful?

389
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,450
Gosh, this will be our first stop.

390
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,680
One more glass?

391
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,600
Cheers.

392
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,710
 I don't think she'll come out. 

393
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,670
 Oh, it's Kang Hae Ra! 

394
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,230
 - Really? 
 - Yeah, it's her! 

395
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,000
 - It's her! 
 - Kang Hae Ra! 

396
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,380
 Hae Ra! 

397
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,720
Is it true you've had an inappropriate relationship with

398
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,730
a former idol reporter ten years younger?

399
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,000
Did you offer him a regular appearance on your show?

400
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,020
Were you enjoying such relationships 
behind your husband's back?

401
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,250
 What are your thoughts? 

402
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,390
 Kang Hae Ra, tell us. 

403
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,490
 One word, please! 

404
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,520
 

405
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,960
 

406
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,330
 

407
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:26,380
 

408
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,820
 

409
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,290
- Yes. 
  - Ms. Kang. 

410
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,850
 We started printing 100,000 copies
 for our third-reprints yesterday. 

411
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:52,430
 But the bookstores canceled all the quantities they ordered. 

412
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,900
 And the customers who bought the books
 are asking for refunds at the bookstores. 

413
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,200
 Hae Ra! Hae Ra! 

414
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,110
 Your comments, please! 

415
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,740
 One word, please! 

416
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,490
 Hae Ra! 

417
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,060
 Hae Ra, please say something! 

418
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,950
 Hae Ra! 

419
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,760
 

420
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,590
I'm telling you, he's not here.

421
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,370
- When did he leave? 
 - Hae Ra.

422
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,600
What happened?

423
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,990
That's what I want to ask you.

424
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,530
Because of you, the Director
 had to issue an apology

425
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,460
- and at the TV station... 
 - I didn't do it.

426
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,450
While those articles were released,
 what were you doing?

427
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,940
You should've stopped 
such baseless articles.

428
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:10,340
From last night until this morning,

429
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,500
the agency and I were all over
 the place to stop your video.

430
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,980
This...

431
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,030
is me?

432
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,160
Director went to the TV station
 to take care of this.

433
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,790
And...

434
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,500
he asked me to give it to you.

435
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:37,170
 

436
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,110
 

437
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,760
 Isn't she embarrassed? 

438
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,060
 I heard there are many men. 

439
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,350
 Isn't she ashamed, in front of her child? 

440
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,710
 What a nerve... 

441
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,750
 Look how brazen she is. 

442
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,310
 I heard she was always so brazen. 

443
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:03,430
 She sure stepped all over the people. 

444
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,730
 It's over for her, too. 

445
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,590
 I knew it would catch up to her. 

446
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,900
 

447
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,750
What happened?

448
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,600
You heard the news, right?

449
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,080
I'm taking over your role.

450
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,480
The part you appeared...

451
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,550
will be edited out. I think 
that's what they decided.

452
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,490
I felt a bit uneasy...

453
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:53,380
but because the director and 
your husband were pleading.

454
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,840
Your husband is having a hard time.

455
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,240
I wouldn't know since I don't 
have such a successful husband.

456
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,000
But your husband that 
you were bragging about

457
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,900
was asking, so I couldn't refuse.

458
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,020
And...

459
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,970
you did well.

460
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:22,170
It's not only men who 
can do that, right?

461
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,190
Anyway, I guess we won't
 be seeing each other.

462
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:31,360
Because you're so low in class.

463
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,640
Hey.

464
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,550
Hey...

465
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,850
 You got what you wanted. 

466
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,970
You're smart, so I thought
 you'd destroy only me.

467
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,510
It's unexpected.

468
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,430
You chose to destroy both of us.

469
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,000
That's...

470
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,420
Thanks to you...

471
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,900
I'm bowing my head for the first time
 at all the TV stations.

472
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,130
- He's really... 
 - Shut up.

473
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,460
Do you think that's all?

474
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,570
When my wife cheated on me
 in front of the whole world,

475
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:45,680
how can I go on a variety show 
and laugh like a fool?

476
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,210
They don't know if they should leave
 me on or take me off the show.

477
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,030
Listen up.

478
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,900
The only thing I'm helping 
with is the variety show

479
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,260
my agency signed on to do.

480
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:01,330
I'll go on my way...

481
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,530
so you go on your way.

482
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,400
Sign the paperwork from 
Mr. Kim and send it to my office.

483
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,940
Oh, also...

484
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,530
get out of my sight this minute.

485
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,140
 

486
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,570
 

487
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,190
 This week, this person's scandal
 heated up the entertainment world. 

488
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,240
 Kang Hae Ra. 

489
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,210
 At the moment, on behalf of Kang Hae Ra, 

490
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:42,250
 our fav host, Lee Hoon Seok,
 is having to explain the situation. 

491
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,870
 It is totally expected, 

492
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,190
 and he submitted divorce 
papers to the court. 

493
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,820
 On the other hand, FBC's 
new variety show "She's Back" team 

494
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,110
 confirmed former 
TBC anchor Moon Ji Soo 

495
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,350
  
  as the new emcee. 

496
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,460
 The production team says 
previously cast Kang Hae Ra 

497
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,470
 has nothing to do with the program. 

498
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:03,570
 They're denying any previous involvement. 

499
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,480
The card isn't going through.

500
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,660
Pardon?

501
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,000
Do you have another card?

502
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,680
- Here. 
 - Okay, I got your card.

503
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,490
This one isn't working, either.

504
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,570
  
 The account is under my name.

505
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,380
Why does it say I can't withdraw any money?

506
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,520
The account has been seized.

507
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,570
How can you do this to me?

508
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,430
Don't do this to me.

509
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,740
Do you think we run on nothing?

510
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,590
 We lost more than the first half
 a year's sale because of you. 

511
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,450
 Our payroll, promo cost, and canceling the third reprints. 

512
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,810
 The damages are enormous. 

513
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,920
 

514
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,410
 I'm selling the house. 

515
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,660
 Move your stuff today. 

516
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,350
 

517
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,560
Yes, this is Cha Min Joon.

518
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,830
 It's me. 

519
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,660
 I came to Gunsan to look into something. 

520
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:58,260
 She does have a 12-year-old girl. 

521
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,010
But I think it's Cha Yi Hyeon.

522
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,370
Text me the address there.

523
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:52,200
 

524
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,620
 

525
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,050
 Cha Yi Hyeon? 

526
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,470
 There's no one by that name. 

527
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,460
 

528
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,570
 

529
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:38,420
I told you I'd get you

530
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,360
if you touch my food.

531
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,030
Open the door.

532
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,640
Open the door!

533
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,190
 Be quiet. Take care of it outside. 

534
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,470
You be quiet!

535
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,160
I know you're in there.

536
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,580
Hurry up and come out!

537
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,150
Hurry up!

538
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:01,180
I moved in last night.

539
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,600
Seriously! When did she move out?

540
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,370
 Hae Ra! Hae Ra! 

541
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:34,810
 Kang Hae Ra! 

542
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:38,110
 Is it true you've had an 
inappropriate relationship with 

543
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,200
 a former idol reporter ten years younger? 

544
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,300
This is me?

545
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,780
 He asked me to give it to you. 

546
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:49,820
 

547
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:54,850
 

548
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,840
 

549
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,130
 Are you okay? 

550
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:09,090
 Call me whenever if you need my help. 

551
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,300
Gusan Agency.

552
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,740
 

553
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,290
Ahjussi, stop here, please.

554
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,270
 

555
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,430
 

556
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:05,100
 

557
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,220
Gosh, damn scared me.

558
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,500
Okay, have some coffee.

559
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,580
Where is Mr. Goo?

560
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,190
Father retired a while ago

561
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,150
and is running a cafe with his friend.

562
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,100
I took over this place, and well...

563
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,800
as you can see...

564
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,310
A cafe...

565
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,540
So...

566
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,640
don't you remember me?

567
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,020
Excuse me?

568
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,530
"Excuse me"?

569
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,770
You're Reporter Kang Hae Ra, aren't you?

570
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,390
I am, but...

571
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,030
Gosh, scared me!

572
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,000
What the heck?

573
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:12,780
That's right.

574
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,400
Hey!

575
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:20,890
Wait for me!

576
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,070
Oh...

577
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:28,370
- The one who used the flash. 
 - Right.

578
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:32,520
It was my first case as a part-timer helping out my dad.

579
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,150
Well...

580
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:38,710
but did we decide to speak casually?

581
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:40,240
What the heck?

582
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,200
Didn't we decide to be casual back then?

583
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,790
We're the same age. You said we should be friends.

584
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:47,950
As far as prying on celebrities having affairs,

585
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:52,440
I remember Reporter Kang Hae Ra was the best at it.

586
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,130
I guess you're not who you used to be.

587
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:57,810
You got caught.

588
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,970
I even thought this.

589
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:03,470
Someone like you would be so perfect at having an affair.

590
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,560
My gosh.

591
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,530
Wait, I'm sorry.

592
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,530
So...

593
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,300
why did you come here?

594
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,450
I don't remember anything from that night after I drank,

595
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,870
but one definite fact is that I wasn't wearing those shoes.

596
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:33,290
 I'm sure I was wearing flats at the restaurant. 

597
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,270
 And when I was wasted and couldn't control myself, 

598
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,740
there's no way I would've put on the heels again.

599
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:43,740
So you're saying you couldn't have done that with this guy, right?

600
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,590
You don't have a relationship with him, either.

601
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,280
By chance, are you frigid?

602
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,730
I mean...

603
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,440
at times, your basic instinct...

604
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,040
presses down on your reason.

605
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:09,010
Gosh, I should look into this guy first, then.

606
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,000
He smells fishy.

607
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,170
Put down one million won first.

608
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,980
What?

609
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,010
Two million won at job completion.

610
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,450
It's too much for you to take on alone.

611
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,400
If he went after you on purpose, he'd surely recognize you.

612
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,950
 

613
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:22,140
You said I don't have to move out right away, right?

614
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,450
Then I'll send you the money.

615
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,030
It worked out that way.

616
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,890
It's all I know how to do. I can't quit easily.

617
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,920
So where is she now?

618
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,220
  
 It's tough for her to find a job since she's so famous.

619
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,010
She's back where she started.

620
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,330
 

621
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:03,630
 

622
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,270
Gusan Agency?

623
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,480
Find out about Gusan Agency.

624
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,510
Okay.

625
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,300
 

626
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,440
 

627
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,220
Gosh.

628
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,890
- How are you? 
 - Good.

629
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:16,190
 

630
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,980
Gosh...

631
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,600
Gosh...

632
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,660
Geez.

633
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,230
Gosh, come on.

634
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,940
I'm sorry.

635
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,180
I drank too much.

636
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:16,990
 

637
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,600
 

638
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:37,060
 

639
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,230
That's right!

640
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,690
Yup.

641
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,230
Yes!

642
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,700
What the heck?

643
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,390
 

644
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:17,830
Two million won won't be enough.

645
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,080
He got you.

646
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,370
What do you mean?

647
01:01:35,370 --> 01:01:37,770
Since you quit being a reporter, 
did you completely lose your touch?

648
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:40,300
What do you think that means in this situation?

649
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,980
Why do you think...

650
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,890
that man met Kim Hyun Sung 
and your husband at the same time?

651
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:47,390
What do they have anything to do with each other?

652
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,310
And this woman.

653
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:52,660
Don't you know this woman?

654
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,740
She's Managing Director Kim Tae On of FB Life.

655
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:00,400
The one where your husband is the model in the ad.

656
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,470
  
 It looks like they were college classmates.

657
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,530
  
 Studied economics at Columbia University.

658
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:08,550
Why do you think those two left the hotel together?

659
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:17,590
 

660
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,620
 Since then, they intentionally... 

661
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,680
Do you get it now?

662
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,390
You got owned by your husband.

663
01:02:57,490 --> 01:03:00,820
  
 What the heck? Does she still do Instagram?

664
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,380
Crazy. Who'd follow her?

665
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,590
Daebak, look at this.

666
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,960
What is it?

667
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,270
Whoa.

668
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,140
Daebak.

669
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,910
Who's this woman?

670
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:17,580
I don't think it's Kang Hae Ra.

671
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:09,470
Hey, just because you wrote a book and are starting a show,

672
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:11,790
you think you're all that, huh?

673
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:20,390
I told you I won't stay put if you hit me one more time.

674
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:21,940
And if you don't?

675
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:24,850
I'll make sure you can't go around with your head held up.

676
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:30,430
Are you crazy?

677
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:35,840
"Korea's fav emcee, Lee Hoon Seok. 
  (T/N: emcee is a master of ceremonies) 

678
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,110
Slept around with tons of women.

679
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:41,210
A scumbag who beats up his wife."

680
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,910
You think I can't do it?

681
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:52,530
 If you try to stomp me, 

682
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:54,220
 I'll also... 

683
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,870
 do my best... 

684
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:01,130
 to stomp you. 

685
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:15,000
♫  I had no idea of your change of heart  ♫

686
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:23,790
♫  I couldn't catch on nor know of it  ♫

687
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:26,560
 

688
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:31,120
   
 It's up to you how things will turn out from now on. 

689
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,130
 Move! 

690
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,430
 Something great happened for me today. 

691
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,420
 Look at these guys. 

692
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,980
 Then you should've handled it better! 

693
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:41,460
 I'll sue Lee Hoon Seok and the woman. 

694
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:44,510
 Can you deal with all those people alone? 

695
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:46,920
 It's game over before midnight! 

696
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,920
 An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. 

697
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,780
 A hidden camera for a hidden camera. 

698
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,640
 Please continue with that revenge channel. 

699
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:58,170
 

700
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:05,800
