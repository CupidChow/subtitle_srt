1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,870
  			 

2
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,260
   

3
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,440
   

4
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,590
   

5
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,270
 As the first broadcaster currently on air, 

6
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,480
 I'm on site to meet  

7
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,800
  entertainer Cha Yi Hyeon who is shrouded in prostitution scandal. 

8
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,350
   

9
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,530
Don't you dare touch even a hair on Ga On.

10
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,610
I'll kill you.

11
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,530
I know that you hired Kang

12
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,360
to eliminate Yi Hyeon sunbae and Ga On.

13
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,500
Now that the truth might come to light,

14
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,860
I know you tried to kill Kang this time.

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,030
Kang Hae Ra.

16
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,300
What brings you here?

17
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,110
Mr. Cha.

18
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,260
You trained your hunting dog very poorly.

19
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,180
So Kang Hae Ra still doesn't know?

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,100
That you had her next to you to use her as your hunting dog.

21
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,720
Director Kim.

22
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I don't know what you're talking about right now.

23
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,300
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,920
Talk with me.

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,520
So you don't know that, either?

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,950
That Mr. Cha is Cha Yi Hyeon's younger brother.

27
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,260
To Cha Min Joon, Kang Hae Ra is

28
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,630
his target for his revenge

29
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,930
as well as his hunting dog necessary to perfect his revenge.

30
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,450
Know your place.

31
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,750
Don't mess around. You're merely a hunting dog.

32
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,970
You're...

33
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,060
Yi Hyeon sunbae's younger brother?

34
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,470
Did you use me all this time?

35
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,290
Cha Yi Hyeon...

36
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,920
is my older sister.

37
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,100
It's true that I used you all this time

38
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,050
to take revenge on Chairman Kim and Director Kim, who abused my sister.

39
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,530
Because I exposed her scandal?

40
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,130
I guess you two are similar.

41
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,330
You approach people with goodwill

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,400
then stab them in the back.

43
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,500
What exactly...

44
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,000
happened between you two?

45
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,390
After I found out that you exposed

46
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,270
my sister's scandal falsely for your success,

47
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,770
I fostered thought of revenge.

48
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,010
I felt sorry for my sister, who was betrayed after helping you out.

49
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,820
But the more I got to know you,

50
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,180
the more confused I got.

51
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,510
The person I saw...

52
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,460
wasn't someone who'd trample others for no reason.

53
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,840
 What exactly... 

54
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,400
 happened between you two? 

55
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,470
 You had to take a break from school because of your mom's medical bill? 

56
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,190
 It reminds me that I was asked 

57
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,870
 to introduce a good hoobae as a tutor. 

58
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,230
 Let me ask if they're still looking. 

59
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,910
 Give me a second. 

60
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,430
   

61
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,570
 Oh, yeah. 

62
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,400
 Do you want to try working as a reporter? 

63
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,640
 A reporter? 

64
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,020
 She's your school sunbae? 

65
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,230
 She put you in your position when she's your sunbae? 

66
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,530
When did this happen?

67
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,810
They bumped into each other at the lobby moments ago.

68
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,750
 And you know Kang Hae Ra... 

69
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,780
 I'd like you to get rid of her. 

70
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,250
 What do you mean "get rid of her?" 

71
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,210
 I'd like her not to show up 

72
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,720
 in front of Ga On or me 

73
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,480
 in the future. 

74
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,550
 If something happens to her suddenly, 

75
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,320
 Ga On might become anxious. 

76
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,730
 I think it'd be good... 

77
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,900
 if you take your time and think it over. 

78
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,720
Not only Kang Hae Ra, but

79
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,570
keep an eye on Kang Hae Ra's people

80
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,990
and Mr. Cha's people.

81
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,710
Yes, sir.

82
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,120
   

83
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,720
   

84
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,890
 So what if you're dead? 

85
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,660
 Bring back my son! 

86
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,770
   

87
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,260
Let's talk.

88
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,850
Talk about what?

89
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,760
I don't have anything to say.

90
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,640
But I do.

91
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,010
"It's a misunderstanding. It's not like that."

92
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,870
Are you going to say stuff like that?

93
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,260
Then I don't want to hear it.

94
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,300
I have to know what you're thinking

95
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,020
to determine if that's a misunderstanding or not.

96
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,280
You still want to act like a know-it-all even in this situation?

97
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,440
Hae Ra sunbae exposed Cha Yi Hyeon's scandal

98
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,980
and her brother Cha Min Joon

99
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,050
approached Hae Ra sunbae to take revenge.

100
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,510
Isn't that right?

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,970
What's that supposed to mean?

102
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,360
Mr. Cha approached Hae Ra sunbae to take revenge.

103
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,200
Mr. Cha and Do Yoon hyung moving in here

104
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,460
and hiring her cases to work on

105
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,670
was all to use her and take revenge.

106
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,640
What?

107
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,730
What do you mean revenge?

108
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,210
It's been twelve years.

109
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,490
He's been looking for his missing sister for twelve years

110
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,390
and had to watch the culprits who did that to her on TV.

111
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,240
So why is that Hae Ra sunbae's fault?

112
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,870
Kang Hae Ra started that scandal.

113
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,090
She didn't even confirm facts and exposed them.

114
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,540
And Kang Hae Ra...

115
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,290
was Mr. Cha's sister's college hoobae that she cared for.

116
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,520
His sister recommended that reporter position to her, too.

117
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,260
To Mr. Cha, his sister was his only family.

118
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,630
He endured twelve years, not knowing whether she died or not.

119
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,860
Where are you going?

120
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,320
Just...

121
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,680
to cool off.

122
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,200
Hyun Sung.

123
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,850
Let's pretend that we don't know in front of Hae Ra.

124
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,520
If Do Yoon tells Mr. Cha that we found out,

125
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,710
he could tell Hae Ra.

126
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,850
If she hears it from someone else,

127
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,140
it will be too tough on Hae Ra.

128
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,100
   

129
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,740
   

130
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,350
What are you doing? You're young, and you're down and out.

131
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,820
I was just feeling disturbed.

132
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,930
What's there to be disturbed about at your age?

133
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,500
- Are you leaving? 
 - Of course, I should.

134
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,180
I'm feeling much better now.

135
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,600
I can't leave my store empty too long.

136
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,180
See you again.

137
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,670
Okay. Have a safe trip back.

138
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,420
Ahjussi.

139
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,900
What do you do when you can't seem to get your thoughts together?

140
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,200
Me?

141
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,620
I go fishing.

142
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,590
- Fishing? 
 - Yeah.

143
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,080
Do you feel better if you catch fish?

144
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,100
Nah.

145
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,910
It's more stressful if you go wanting to catch fish.

146
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,510
You just sit there spaced out

147
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,720
and enjoy the scenery.

148
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,060
After a while of that, my thoughts are settled.

149
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,760
And if something bites,

150
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,820
that's such a sweet moment.

151
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,220
I see.

152
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,900
But you're always spaced out.

153
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,530
I don't think you need to go to a fishing spot.

154
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,990
Excuse me?

155
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,590
I'll leave now.

156
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,060
Bye.

157
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,020
A fishing spot?

158
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,150
 You're Yi Hyeon sunbae's younger brother? 

159
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,230
 Did you use me all this time? 

160
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,170
Aigoo, you're here.

161
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,800
Are you feeling better now?

162
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,700
Yes. I'm fine, so I'm going home now.

163
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,930
I stopped by to say bye before I took off.

164
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,060
I'm glad that I got to see you.

165
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,960
You can speak down to me.

166
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,890
I'll do that next time.

167
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,190
Thank you so much for everything that day.

168
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,130
- See you again. 
 - Okay.

169
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,680
Sir.

170
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,320
If you have some time, would you like to have some tea with me?

171
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,280
Thank you.

172
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,700
Hae Ra...

173
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,760
didn't marry Lee Hoon Seok out of love.

174
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,700
As soon as she started working as a reporter,

175
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,610
it seems that Lee Hoon Seok had raped her.

176
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,130
Because of that incident, she got pregnant and married him.

177
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,940
He started tormenting Hae Ra soon after getting married.

178
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,720
Because of that, she lost her unborn child.

179
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,370
That's that, but...

180
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,310
what Hae Ra struggled with is that

181
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,510
the person who referred her to that reporter position

182
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,740
was a close college sunbae.

183
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,520
She struggled much more because of that betrayal.

184
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,580
Hae Ra was looking for a job at the time.

185
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,280
Isn't that why she referred Hae Ra to that position?

186
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,540
No, no...

187
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,180
I heard that position

188
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,430
was meant for that sunbae.

189
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,390
Hae Ra had no experience working in a TV station

190
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,320
and the PD and emcee there

191
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,920
were infamous in that field.

192
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,870
Even still, she referred Hae Ra to that position.

193
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,350
And that sunbae interviewed a famous public figure.

194
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,880
The rumor is that she became even more successful after that.

195
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,260
 I guess you two are similar. 

196
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,800
 You approach people with goodwill 

197
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,000
 then stab them in the back. 

198
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,410
    
  When patient Kang Dae Shik 

199
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,760
 is conscious, we'll begin our investigation right away. 

200
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,280
 So Kang Hae Ra still doesn't know? 

201
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,710
 That you had her next to you to use her as your hunting dog. 

202
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,590
 Why don't you... 

203
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,070
 look after yourself? 

204
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,170
You have mail.

205
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,440
Thank you.

206
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,680
   

207
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,630
   

208
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:45,070
   

209
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,020
The family that is responsible for the accident...

210
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,620
and the family of the missing?

211
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,800
What's going on?

212
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,400
The news on the insurance scandal Chairman Kim is involved in is ready.

213
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,750
Once Chairman Kim releases the promo material,

214
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,290
we'll report right away.

215
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,040
Along with the insurance scandal,

216
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,610
I'd like you to expose the shipping company scandal at the same time.

217
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,130
Here's the information on the ship involved in the accident

218
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,210
and the evidence that Chairman Kim worked with

219
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,310
the official to close the case quickly after the accident.

220
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,810
They hid the ship's defect, and it's illegal expansion,

221
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,180
and closed the case putting the entire blame on the captain.

222
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,300
But...

223
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,850
it's been more than eleven years since the accident happened.

224
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,640
Chairman Kim controlled the media at the time.

225
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,400
To try people's attention once again is...

226
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,520
Are you saying it's unreasonable?

227
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,670
No.

228
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,310
I think the tabloids and SNS should circulate this scandal simultaneously.

229
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,170
That makes our reporting on it more natural.

230
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,750
Let's set things up on tabloids and SNS with the insurance story

231
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,480
and report that the shipping company responsible for an accident

232
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,660
eleven years ago is importing vessels once again.

233
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,150
People will connect the dots.

234
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,690
- But as for tabloids— 
 - We'll come up with something

235
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,160
for tabloids and SNS.

236
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,090
What the...?

237
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,780
They keep taking the bait.

238
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,740
Geez.

239
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,440
What are you doing in a place like this?

240
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,510
Did you catch any?

241
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,940
I'm not sitting here to catch fish.

242
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,710
I heard you just complain that

243
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,450
the fish took off with only the bait.

244
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,410
Why are you picking a fight with me all the way here?

245
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,780
Look at you talking to your noona.

246
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,300
Geez, I have a lot on my mind, too.

247
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,030
After hearing all that from Do Yoon this morning,

248
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,760
I feel like someone stabbed me in the back. It's so disturbing.

249
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,190
And you know my professionalism.

250
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,400
So I looked into Do Yoon.

251
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,570
Also, about Mr. Cha's sister.

252
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,770
And that's what's so weird.

253
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,300
I found out that...

254
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,390
Do Yoon's father was in charge of the ship

255
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,570
that sunk eleven years ago.

256
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,370
Do Yoon's father was the captain of that ferry.

257
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,170
They're saying the accident occurred because

258
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,010
the captain took a bribe and loaded extra cargo.

259
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,000
And Mr. Cha's sister

260
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,990
was on that ferry.

261
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,890
She's one of the missing people who were on that ferry.

262
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,170
They still haven't found her body yet.

263
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,190
- What did you say? 
 - Right?

264
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,340
Something's off in your mind, too, right?

265
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,130
In such a relationship, they should be like enemies.

266
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,820
But they're not like that at all.

267
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,480
Forget being enemies.

268
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,740
Do Yoon treats Mr. Cha with respect,

269
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,370
and Mr. Cha treats Do Yoon like his brother.

270
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,070
Like they're family.

271
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,850
This won't do.

272
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,890
I'm too curious. I can't hold back.

273
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,820
I'll ask him myself.

274
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,850
 I heard that position was meant for that sunbae. 

275
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,250
 Even still, she referred Hae Ra to that position. 

276
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,820
There is no way.

277
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,500
There has to be a misunderstanding.

278
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,950
Hyung.

279
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,520
I'm glad you're here.

280
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,020
- I have to tell you something. 
 - I'm sorry.

281
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,850
I'm in a rush to go somewhere.

282
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,890
Let's talk later.

283
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,650
Mr. Cha.

284
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,850
Mr. Cha!

285
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,390
Geez...

286
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,930
I came in because it's cold.

287
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,420
I'll get to the point.

288
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,170
Because of my job,

289
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,570
I looked into Mr. Cha's sister and your background.

290
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,110
In any case,

291
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,070
after hearing you two approached Hae Ra with that motive,

292
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,640
I couldn't just sit back.

293
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,560
But there's one thing I don't understand.

294
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,580
Based on my investigation, you're...

295
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,300
the family responsible for the accident

296
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,910
and he's the family of the victim.

297
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:22,500
If that's true,

298
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,420
it would be more than enough that you two remain enemies.

299
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,720
How could you be working together?

300
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,220
My father was not...

301
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,160
the captain of Key Ferry.

302
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,890
He worked as a crewman for over twenty years

303
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,600
and got his license later in his years to become a captain.

304
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,370
He didn't get to operate the ferry that much.

305
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,540
And he got a call from the owner that Key Ferry's captain

306
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,060
had to quit all of a sudden.

307
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,050
That was...

308
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,940
his first and last voyage as a captain.

309
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,920
 I ought to spill that he put all the blame on Captain Choi. 

310
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,630
 Be quiet! 

311
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,160
 The moment I realized he was framed for everything, 

312
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,830
 I went to the shipping company's owner 

313
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,980
 and ended up in jail. 

314
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,570
 That's... 

315
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,970
 when Min Joon hyung came to me 

316
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,120
 and told me that Chairman Kim is responsible for everything. 

317
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,030
This is such a terrible situation!

318
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,230
What a messed up world!

319
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,660
It really makes me want to take revenge.

320
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,490
I'm sure you wanted to go to him and kill him right there.

321
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,710
How did you hold yourself back?

322
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,440
Wait, wait, wait.

323
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,190
So is it true that

324
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,900
Mr. Cha's sister went missing because of that accident?

325
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,440
Mr. Cha's sister's name was on the passenger list,

326
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,860
but she contacted him right after the accident.

327
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,300
And that was the last call from her

328
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,170
went missing for over ten years...

329
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,200
Let's help him out.

330
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,900
Let's help him, so Do Yoon can have his revenge.

331
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,300
 What should I do first? 

332
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,960
 What do I need to do first? 

333
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,080
I don't know if Cha Yi Hyeon referred Kang Hae Ra

334
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,660
to that position knowing everything.

335
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,020
So is it true about that position?

336
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,500
I'm sure things have changed now, but

337
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,790
there was trash like that back then.

338
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,280
Lee Hoon Seok was one of them.

339
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,770
People in the industry all knew.

340
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,340
It wasn't soon after Cha Yi Hyeon became a freelancer.

341
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,350
She probably accepted the position to start a new career.

342
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,290
Anyway, it's true that

343
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,160
people in the industry tried to avoid that position.

344
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,410
It's just that people pretended not to know.

345
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,370
But after she went through that

346
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,640
and struggling while living with Lee Hoon Seok...

347
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,080
Everyone in the field knew.

348
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,500
She couldn't divorce him because of the child.

349
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,780
Lee Hoon Seok appeared on variety shows with the child

350
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,900
showing what the kid looked like.

351
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,890
People said that the child will suffer if they got divorced.

352
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,740
That's why Kang Hae Ra is putting up with it.

353
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,370
That's what people said.

354
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,230
I looked into it...

355
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,540
and there isn't a lot of information on it.

356
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,740
It's been eleven years since the accident.

357
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,550
So it won't be easy to find relevant proof.

358
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,660
Let me take a look at that.

359
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,770
    
 So I keep visiting the people who used to work

360
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,540
at the shipping company and persuading them.

361
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,560
I'm also looking for people who worked on the disassembling of the ship.

362
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,130
So should we find those people?

363
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,470
Then, go ahead and look into it.

364
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,100
Hae Ra.

365
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,690
Can you talk for a minute?

366
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,530
Shouldn't you go with them?

367
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,320
I heard everything by the door.

368
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,820
You heard?

369
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,650
About Mr. Cha, too?

370
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,220
I found out about that from him this morning.

371
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,240
Hyun Sung found out about that somehow,

372
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,750
and that's how I found out.

373
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,390
The minute I heard it, I was so worried about you.

374
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,230
Wondering how you must feel.

375
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,740
So I looked into their background.

376
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,930
But there's something that I don't understand about their relationship.

377
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,110
So we were asking Do Yoon about it.

378
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:07,880
But I couldn't ignore Do Yoon's situation, either.

379
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,880
Gosh, I'm so all over the place.

380
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,470
Help him if you want to.

381
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,130
I just feel bad toward you.

382
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,880
Don't mind me.

383
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,150
I'll think it through on my end.

384
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,600
Okay.

385
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,070
Call me if you need to talk.

386
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,000
I'll be back.

387
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,910
   

388
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,780
- Yes, Chairman. 
 - Hi.

389
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,990
How far did you get with the customs procedure?

390
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,030
I'm meeting the person in charge soon.

391
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,530
 Okay, move right along without any issues. 

392
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,180
After your meeting, come back to the office.

393
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,950
Yes, will do.

394
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,140
   

395
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,690
   

396
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,810
Circulate the prepared press release.

397
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,090
 Yes, sir. 

398
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,330
   

399
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,720
Chairman.

400
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,630
Do you have a reason for

401
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,090
needing that money by taking such a risk?

402
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,230
In your opinion,

403
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:21,080
do you think I'm doing this to make money?

404
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,900
I have more than enough money.

405
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,990
But as you know,

406
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,280
money isn't everything.

407
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,030
Right now,

408
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,040
I'm in the process of establishing relationships.

409
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,320
In the world, there are people who need money

410
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,610
and people who are greedy for money.

411
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,740
There are lots of different people.

412
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,250
Among those people,

413
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,820
I'll pick those who will be beneficial to me

414
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,400
and tie them up with the money.

415
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,280
Then what happens?

416
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,700
Whenever I need those people,

417
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,860
they'll take care of things according to their use.

418
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,830
Loyalty...

419
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,290
or affection...

420
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,970
Those things don't matter.

421
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,770
There's nothing tighter than

422
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,410
relationships connected by money.

423
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,950
FB Fire Insurance signed a shipping contract worth 100 billion won.

424
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,220
This marks a maximum performance in the profit and sales

425
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,110
for the latter half of the year.

426
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,460
 FB Fire Insurance made over  

427
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,100
 600 billion won in profit in the latter half of the year. 

428
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,730
 The company achieve earning surprise that surpassed the market forecast. 

429
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,750
 This is a 158% increase from last year. 

430
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,590
Release the tabloid news.

431
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,400
Also, post on SNS.

432
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,040
Emphasize the fact that the owner of the

433
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,640
shipping company has deep ties to Chairman Kim.

434
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,920
Yes, ma'am.

435
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,000
It's me.

436
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,450
The tabloid news will circulate soon.

437
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,290
If the news is reported on top of it, Chairman Kim won't sit back.

438
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:16,150
Are you ready for the aftermath?

439
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,420
Don't worry.

440
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,620
In case Chairman Kim tries to apply pressure,

441
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,910
I also have other options in line.

442
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,520
 As you mentioned, 

443
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,900
 there are many reporters with a sense of justice. 

444
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,260
 If we package the news nicely, 

445
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,610
it will be quite helpful for bringing down Chairman Kim.

446
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,560
In the end, he'll step down in shame.

447
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,750
Come in.

448
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,970
How long have you been with the station?

449
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,520
Four years.

450
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,220
Four years...

451
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,590
Do you want to be cut as a reporter

452
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,300
or do you want to be let go as an office worker?

453
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,940
Excuse me?

454
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,010
Are you pretending not to get it

455
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,930
or do you really not get it?

456
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:17,110
I'd like to remain a reporter for a very long time.

457
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,010
Then follow me.

458
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,320
This is where your father's colleague works?

459
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,690
Yes, that's right.

460
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,120
I hope we get a lead today.

461
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,740
Yesterday was a waste.

462
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,520
Let's go in first.

463
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,100
   

464
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,890
   

465
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,330
 Of course. 

466
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,550
FB Life and FB Fire Insurance are

467
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,510
our group's core corporations.

468
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:03,160
Even if we convert to a holding company,

469
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,630
we'll take care of our roots.

470
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,900
Don't worry. Yeah.

471
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,350
Then see you at our company anniversary.

472
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,710
After the event,

473
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,590
I'll treat the shareholders separately.

474
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,340
Yes.

475
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,800
Just don't tell us if you don't want to.

476
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,290
Accusing us of interfering with their work?

477
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,420
You said there are other places, right?

478
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,570
Yes.

479
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,000
- Let's try there. 
 - Okay.

480
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,870
Chairman, something terrible happened.

481
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,170
What?

482
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,770
 During the investigation at the time, they reported that the  

483
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:19,000
 accident was caused by the overweight of the cargo on this ferry. 

484
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,250
However, a former employee of this shipping company

485
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,530
tells a different story.

486
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,800
 The engine was too old to begin with. 

487
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,000
 The ship was so worn down. 

488
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,850
 It was soldered all over the place. 

489
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,110
    
  I have no idea how a ferry like that was permitted to operate. 

490
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,790
After eleven years,

491
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,780
the company changed its name and started to import more vessels.

492
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,690
 They'll soon begin to transport passengers and cargo. 

493
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,650
 Do they remember the accident from eleven years ago? 

494
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,300
 For them to not repeat the same mistake, 

495
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,200
 what kind of actions could officials take? 

496
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,580
Take this document to Deputy Chief Ahn right now.

497
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,930
Yes, ma'am.

498
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,670
It's me, Deputy Chief Ahn.

499
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,260
I just sent Ms. Yeon

500
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,280
with the shipping document related to the news that aired.

501
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,520
You'll have to move quickly before Chairman Kim does.

502
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,440
Of course.

503
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,680
Of course, I'll take good care of you.

504
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,130
After this is over, you'll have to

505
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,450
move up higher.

506
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,350
It's true, right?

507
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,080
That news is related to Do Yoon hyung's case.

508
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,990
I think so.

509
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,620
I'll go see Do Yoon hyung.

510
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,640
Wait for me.

511
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,450
We'll be back.

512
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,210
   

513
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,660
Hi, Ga On.

514
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,950
Hi, Mom. It's true.

515
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,170
He said he'll let me meet you.

516
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,130
 When we meet this weekend, let's go eat tteokboki. 

517
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,700
 I want to go to the place I went with you last year. 

518
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,920
I'll call you back after I ask him.

519
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,750
Okay, Ga On.

520
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:22,940
The man on the news. He's your father's colleague, right?

521
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,870
- Yes. 
 - Where are you going?

522
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,300
I contacted the person who disassembled the ship.

523
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,540
Really? Let's go together then.

524
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,690
I'll go, too.

525
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,660
Let's go.

526
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,010
What does the tabloid close to the news say?

527
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:44,190
The insurance company that paid the shipping company with the accident

528
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,760
and the owner of that shipping company is you.

529
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,520
The insurance money that FB Fire Insurance paid out

530
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,610
is ultimately your slush fund.

531
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,220
Who says?

532
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,380
So who said that?

533
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,000
They came by Seomyeong Shipping a few days ago.

534
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,060
They visited a Key Ferry's warehouse employee today.

535
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,310
Are they reporters?

536
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,590
One of them is the son of Key Ferry's captain,

537
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,960
and the other two are from Gusan Agency.

538
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,150
Gusan Agency?

539
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,110
Where Kang Hae Ra is?

540
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,000
Yes.

541
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,920
Kang Hae Ra...

542
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,840
Kang Hae Ra...

543
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,880
Excuse me...

544
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,570
You said you'd let me see my mom.

545
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:46,310
I just spoke to my mom on the phone.

546
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,140
I was wondering if I can meet her this weekend.

547
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,030
Ms. Min!

548
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,960
Ms. Min!

549
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,130
Take the child outside.

550
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,440
How are you managing the child?

551
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,600
Where did he get a cellphone,

552
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,100
and why are you letting him talk to anyone?

553
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,860
My apologies.

554
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,590
Tae On noona gave me the cellphone...

555
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,400
As for meeting your mom...

556
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,950
I don't think it's going to happen.

557
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,350
You'll have to cut the ties with her at some point anyway.

558
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:43,200
Just know that.

559
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,530
Are you okay?

560
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,140
You'll have to...

561
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,000
give me your cellphone.

562
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,470
- Yes. 
  - What's going on? 

563
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,470
I just saw it myself.

564
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,430
Not only the news, but

565
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,350
the gossips about vessels and insurance fraud are circulating.

566
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,150
Did Do Yoon do that?

567
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,070
Do Yoon wouldn't have done that.

568
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,680
I'll check if the victims' family did that, and I'll call you back.

569
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,740
Okay.

570
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,010
Hi, Do Yoon.

571
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,170
What?

572
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,510
Someone who disassembled the ship?

573
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,360
  The call is not going through. After the beep...  

574
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,450
 Ga On. 

575
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:14,630
 Don't pester the chairman if he says no. 

576
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,660
 I'll talk to him. 

577
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,930
  The call is not going through. After the beep...  

578
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,840
Ga On!

579
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,110
How did you come here at this hour?

580
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,290
Mom...

581
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,170
Mom...

582
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,310
Can't I live here with you, Mom?

583
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,670
Ga On.

584
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,480
Did something happen? Huh?

585
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,190
I just...

586
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:03,090
want to live with you, Mom.

587
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:07,130
Mom, can I do that?

588
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,760
Okay, Ga On.

589
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,750
I'll ask the chairman. Okay?

590
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,510
Ms. Kang Hae Ra?

591
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:34,020
You're under arrest for kidnapping a minor.

592
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,600
What?

593
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,330
Mom!

594
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,080
Mom!

595
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,570
Ga On.

596
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,910
Go home with Mr. Ko.

597
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,340
I'm okay.

598
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,600
Ahjussi!

599
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,820
Why is the police taking away my mom?

600
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,440
Why are they taking my mom?

601
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,340
What's going on?

602
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,090
Ahjussi, please help my mom.

603
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,080
Please...

604
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,250
don't let the police take away my mom.

605
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,650
Please?

606
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,770
   

607
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,400
Mr. Cha Min Joon?

608
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,000
Yes.

609
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,550
She says she never hired you as her lawyer. She says to leave.

610
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,980
 I'll never sneak away... 

611
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,260
to see my mom without telling you.

612
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,210
I'll never do that again.

613
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:22,740
Please let my mom go.

614
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,210
I'll never do that again.

615
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,120
Please let my mom go.

616
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,550
Please?

617
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,750
I'll never do that again.

618
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,350
Ms. Min.

619
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,660
 Mom! 

620
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,050
 Mom! 

621
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,580
He's still a kid.

622
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,290
To Ga On, Kang Hae Ra is still his mom.

623
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:41,520
That's why I told you before.

624
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,680
To get rid of that Kang Hae Ra.

625
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,640
Since she's still around,

626
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,860
Ga On can't settle down.

627
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,380
Are you doing this for that reason?

628
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,960
Fine.

629
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,900
Choi Do Yoon working under you

630
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,670
and Gusan Agency people

631
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:07,600
are digging into a shipping company accident

632
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,050
from eleven years ago. Did you know that?

633
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:14,090
If that accident comes to light,

634
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:16,660
including the work you're currently doing

635
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,750
and even you are at risk.

636
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,720
Release Kang Hae Ra.

637
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,750
You need to understand the child first.

638
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,630
The only person Ga On considers family is Kang Hae Ra.

639
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,900
Chairman.

640
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,670
If there was an unsettled matter, you should've wrapped it up.

641
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:43,080
Regarding the shipping company scandal,

642
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,920
I'll take care of everything without a problem.

643
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,270
Ga On.

644
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,270
Mom...

645
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:28,570
spoke to the cops

646
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,610
and went home safely.

647
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:32,940
You don't have to worry anymore.

648
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,900
Since you left...

649
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,350
without saying a word...

650
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:44,070
Chairman got so scared.

651
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,260
From now on, if you want to see your mom,

652
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,690
tell this uncle first.

653
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,000
Okay?

654
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,590
Goodnight.

655
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,310
Kang Hae Ra.

656
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,080
I heard from...

657
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,390
Mr. Goo what happened

658
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,840
between you and my sister.

659
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,120
If my sister...

660
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,410
wronged you, Hae Ra,

661
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,350
and if that's true...

662
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,860
I'll apologize.

663
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:17,620
I'll compensate you for everything that has happened.

664
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:22,110
I hope that you don't get involved with me and my sister's matter.

665
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,230
And I know it will be hard, but

666
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:28,480
- regarding Ga On... 
 - Did you forget...

667
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,400
everything I've been telling you?

668
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,320
Ga On is my son.

669
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,780
I have never...

670
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:41,690
thought that Ga On was someone else's child.

671
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,890
There's only one reason I left Ga On there.

672
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,750
I thought living with Chairman Kim

673
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,080
might make him happier than living with me.

674
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,970
If he's not happy living with Chairman Kim,

675
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:58,470
there's no reason Ga On has to live there.

676
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,720
So you'll compensate me...

677
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,910
for everything that happened?

678
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,050
Then stand on my side

679
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,240
and help me...

680
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,050
so I can get Ga On back.

681
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,140
   

682
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,720
 At the upcoming company anniversary, 

683
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,390
 I plan to introduce Ga On to the public. 

684
00:49:56,230 --> 00:50:00,570
 So you'll compensate me for everything that happened? 

685
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,380
 Then stand on my side 

686
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,420
 and help me, so I can get Ga On back. 

687
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,830
   

688
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,490
Yes.

689
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,870
 I just heard this from Deputy Chief Ahn's people. 

690
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:21,160
Deputy Chief Ahn ordered the investigation on

691
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,060
the ferry accident and Chairman Kim's insurance fraud.

692
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,950
- Deputy Chief Ahn... 
  - He's on Director Kim's side. 

693
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,000
Okay, I got it. I'll call you back.

694
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,390
- Did you meet him? 
 - Yes.

695
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,020
Here's the recording.

696
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:38,100
Someone from Seoul paid extra

697
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,250
and asked for quick disassembly of the ship.

698
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,000
 Is Mr. Choi Do Yoon here? 

699
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,910
Are you Mr. Choi Do Yoon?

700
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,800
Yes, it's me.

701
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,240
What's this about?

702
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,510
Mr. Choi Do Yoon, did you spread a false statement that the Key Ferry accident

703
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,460
was caused by the shipping company owner's corruption?

704
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,950
You visited an employee at Seomyeong Shipping and

705
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,790
harassed him continually to reveal relevant information.

706
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,440
You're under arrest for spreading false information and business interference.

707
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,330
    
 Here's a warrant for your arrest.

708
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,770
What in the world?

709
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:08,800
No, wait...

710
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,840
Wait.

711
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,570
Who filed the complaint?

712
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,330
The owner of Seomyeong Shipping Company filed a complaint.

713
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,010
Chairman Kim.

714
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,950
What took you so long? Did everyone forget about our meeting?

715
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,130
The news department is chaotic right now.

716
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:44,180
The higher-ups are saying they'll change everyone.

717
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,610
Jeong is assigned to the deliberation room,

718
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,000
and Park to the transmission room.

719
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,060
Department Head was kicked out to Sales.

720
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:53,700
Did the CEO do this?

721
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,470
The CEO was summoned to Chairman's office, and all hell broke loose.

722
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:58,670
If FB Group doesn't clean up the newsroom,

723
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,490
they'll pull all their advertisements.

724
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,430
All right. Leave for now.

725
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:15,340
 If they get rid of my people, 

726
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,830
 we can't get Chairman Kim. 

727
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,380
 The plan I came up with 

728
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,370
 was to bring down Chairman Kim through TV. 

729
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,110
 All the articles on the ferry accident and  

730
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,800
 insurance fraud on SNS and the internet got all yanked. 

731
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,070
 Let's talk later. 

732
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,910
I'll give it some thought, too.

733
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:47,450
Chairman's secretary office is asking for

734
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:50,470
the list of guests for the anniversary event.

735
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:51,770
What should I do?

736
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:07,350
Okay, let's go.

737
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,500
Where are we going?

738
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,250
To our company.

739
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,590
To our company?

740
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,360
From now on,

741
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,660
you'll be the heir to FB Group.

742
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,070
If I become the heir,

743
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,940
what's so good about it?

744
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:34,440
Well, many people in a big building

745
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:37,650
will be under your control

746
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,020
with one word from you.

747
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,720
Being under one's control...

748
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,100
What's good about that?

749
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,550
I like it when people smile at me

750
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:52,220
and ask me to play together.

751
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,160
And...

752
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,480
I'm fine as long as the person I like listens to what I say.

753
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:04,350
I hope that person doesn't cry.

754
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,360
You're still young.

755
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,840
You don't know the way of the world yet.

756
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,850
To prevent your loved ones from crying,

757
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:19,610
you need power.

758
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:21,290
Okay?

759
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:35,330
Here.

760
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,580
Mom!

761
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,510
I'm here to take Ga On with me.

762
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,150
Mr. Ko.

763
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:27,480
What are you doing in front of the child?

764
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,080
Don't scare him this way.

765
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,260
Let go of Ga On now.

766
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,690
More than anything,

767
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:38,320
Ga On says he doesn't want to live with you.

768
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:43,540
I guess you didn't quite understand what I said last time.

769
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,200
If you upset me over Ga On ever again,

770
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,120
I believe I said I won't just sit back.

771
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:58,020
So will you call the police again?

772
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,450
Did you invite Kang Hae Ra to our anniversary event?

773
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,930
Why don't you clean up this place?

774
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:29,650
Chairman Kim Sang Goo.

775
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,690
I'm Prosecutor Jang Sun Ho of the Anti-Corruption Team

776
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,030
at Central District Prosecutors' Office.

777
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,300
A complaint was submitted on a shipping accident from eleven years ago.

778
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,200
You'll have to go with us.

779
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,890
Eleven years ago...

780
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:54,810
Another complaint has been filed on embezzlement and

781
00:56:54,810 --> 00:56:57,950
forgery of documents relating to Seomyeong Shipping.

782
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:02,140
I'll be investigated as a witness as well.

783
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,680
Cha Min Joon...

784
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:25,430
So Ga On will have to live with me.

785
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:31,880
Does this mean you can't attend the anniversary event today, Father?

786
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,760
- Go easy. 
 - Yes, sir.

787
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,300
 You sent the document relating to the shipping accident 

788
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,310
 to the prosecution, right? 

789
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,450
 You can't bring down Chairman Kim with that case. 

790
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,450
 The politicians and legislators who covered up that incident 

791
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:38,140
 are still currently in office. 

792
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,510
 So... 

793
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:43,820
 did you want to see me to tell me that? 

794
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:49,440
 Chairman Kim is currently importing secondhand ships. 

795
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,010
 Of course, they're not in good condition. 

796
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:55,330
 I have all the fabricated documents on that. 

797
00:58:55,330 --> 00:59:00,010
 With Chairman Kim's past crimes that you submitted to the Prosecutors' Office 

798
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:02,880
 and his current crime are combined, 

799
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,780
 you'll be able to drag him down this time. 

800
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,360
 But how would I believe you? 

801
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:14,500
 You already stabbed me in the back. 

802
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,390
 How about this? 

803
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:28,720
 I heard that Chairman Kim will introduce Ga On at the anniversary event. 

804
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,260
 If that happens, 

805
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,860
 Ga On will be announced as Chairman Kim's son. 

806
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,490
 I don't want that to happen. 

807
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,910
 Ga On doesn't look happy living with Chairman Kim. 

808
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,830
 I'll take back Ga On. 

809
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:51,250
 Letting the world know that Ga On is Chairman Kim's son... 

810
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,960
 You don't want that, either. 

811
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:02,520
Ga On, you'll have to stay with me.

812
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,720
What are you talking about?

813
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,800
Ga On is part of my family now.

814
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,780
While Father is away,

815
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,560
I think it's right that his older sister takes care of him.

816
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,470
Ga On, stay with me from now on.

817
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,500
I think people will start coming soon.

818
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,300
Do you want to talk here?

819
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,470
Why we're all standing here like this?

820
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,800
You didn't want to have Ga On...

821
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:40,010
be revealed to the world.

822
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,860
You can't take Ga On anymore.

823
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,860
I'll protect him.

824
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:08,800
♫  Can't you hear my heart 
that is covered with pain?  ♫

825
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:18,300
  			 

826
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,110
   

827
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,560
 Are you doing this... 

828
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,540
 because your sister went missing due to that ferry accident? 

829
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:28,730
 I'm desperately praying that my sister is still alive. 

830
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,420
 I must know even after all this time. 

831
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,290
 How could you do this? 

832
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:36,050
 Get Kang Hae Ra using her own method? 

833
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:38,850
 Where is Cha Yi Hyeon? 

834
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,820
 What more do I need to do... 

835
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,560
 Kang is awake. 

836
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,500
 Kang Dae Shik, where is my sister? 

837
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,390
 It's all my fault. 

838
01:01:54,380 --> 01:02:00,200
