1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,950
 

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,960
 

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,600
 

4
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,900
 
 Kang Hae Ra...

5
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,920
you should pay back what you owe!

6
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,760
If you're late on your payment, you should answer your phone, at least.

7
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,070
Rookie!

8
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,630
Wow, great, great.

9
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,070
Whoa...

10
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,760
Kang Hae Ra!

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,500
I'm from Happy Credit.

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,130
Geez, what the hell?

13
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,800
Crap...

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,260
You should've answered your phone.

15
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,640
Geez...

16
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,360
I'll be seeing you often.

17
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,530
When you're making a threat, do it right the first time.

18
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,640
Once you entered the world of pros,

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,110
you should act like a pro.

20
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,740
If an older brother doesn't act like one,

21
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,290
your younger brother will have to carry the weight of the family.

22
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,500
You know it, right?

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,310
Hyun Sung.

24
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,490
Are you okay?

25
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,260
My gosh.

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,990
The ambulance.

27
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,380
   

28
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,430
Yes.

29
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,620
A person got stabbed.

30
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,300
The address is...

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,470
It's a noisy neighborhood.

32
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,460
Mr. Cha Min Joon.

33
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,230
Come to your senses, Han Jung Woo!

34
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,810
Eun Hye...

35
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,290
You're not...

36
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,610
my target, Director Kim.

37
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,230
Your deal with Moa Mirae Welfare Foundation's Director Song.

38
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,080
The Prosecutors' Office was

39
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,520
already conducting an internal investigation.

40
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,560
   

41
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,070
    
 If Kang Hae Ra didn't expose him that night,

42
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,800
you probably couldn't even come to see me.

43
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,600
So you're saying I should be grateful to Kang Hae Ra?

44
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,800
Who do you think leaked the information to the prosecution?

45
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,600
 Chairman Kim? 

46
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,700
My target is...

47
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,710
Chairman Kim.

48
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,810
Kang Hae Ra is my hunting dog to use to get Chairman Kim.

49
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,350
You want me to leave you alone

50
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,330
while you're hunting down my father?

51
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,100
Don't you want someone to do that for you?

52
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,880
More than anyone else in the world?

53
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,550
Whether it's my father or a hunting dog,

54
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,370
I don't let someone else take care of my problems.

55
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,590
I don't like to owe anyone any favors, either.

56
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,360
If you go up against Chairman Kim under the circumstances,

57
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,100
you have more to lose.

58
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,800
FB Life, Financial,

59
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,850
hotels, distribution, broadcasting company.

60
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,150
They're all businesses where a clean image is valuable.

61
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,870
A daughter who attacks her father and takes the throne.

62
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,550
Not only to restore the tarnished corporate image,

63
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,650
but your image as the leader of FB.

64
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,570
It will cost you quite a fortune to restore your image.

65
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,470
Why should you have to...

66
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,360
handle that yourself, Director?

67
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,240
As if Chairman Kim was the only one who thought existed in FB,

68
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,260
I'll cut him out.

69
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,350
He's much cockier than

70
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,800
what I heard from Director Song.

71
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,690
 It won't be enough even if you focused entirely on your treatment. 

72
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,630
Lying on a bed, and you're still looking after me.

73
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,800
Of course, you're not improving.

74
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,780
The more you do that,

75
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,690
the more I wish for a son.

76
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,710
Our business is too much for a woman to handle alone.

77
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,220
Do you think Tae On would be any different?

78
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,340
In the end, she'll be controlled by some guy.

79
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,440
That's why you need a son.

80
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,270
Whether it's our son,

81
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,380
or my son.

82
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,520
I'll have to watch him more.

83
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,100
I sure am curious as to how he's going to

84
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,970
corner the sly old fox.

85
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,090
 

86
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,250
 Eun Hye! 

87
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,400
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

88
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,560
- Dad! 
 - Aigoo...

89
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
Dad.

90
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,540
My goodness!

91
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,630
Look at your hand!

92
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,390
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

93
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,390
Put it down.

94
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,960
- It hurts! 
 - Just set it down.

95
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,890
- How did you know? 
 - That's not important.

96
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,050
He kept calling in the early morning while I was packing.

97
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,030
Is it possible that you can't use your hand at all?

98
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,480
They bandaged it up, so I won't move it.

99
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,300
Don't worry. I'm fine.

100
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,590
Is that so?

101
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,120
You're okay?

102
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,340
Yes.

103
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,880
Aigoo, seriously.

104
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,230
What happened exactly?

105
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,910
Are you hurting anywhere else?

106
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,120
I'm fine.

107
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,280
And I'll stay here from now on.

108
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,720
Go on.

109
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,380
It's okay.

110
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,260
No.

111
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,430
I'll stay with Dad. You go on.

112
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,670
And you have to see him, too.

113
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,190
Right. Go on.

114
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,720
Do you want to lie down?

115
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah.

116
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,220
Okay, careful, careful.

117
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,020
Ow...

118
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,170
Do Yoon.

119
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,350
Hello.

120
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,920
What brings you here?

121
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,990
Mr. Cha was here until this morning.

122
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,360
I just got here.

123
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,820
He fell asleep as soon as he ate.

124
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,400
Don't worry about him. I'll stay here.

125
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,010
I'll call you right away if anything urgent comes up.

126
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,990
You sold your car not too long ago.

127
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,260
Yes.

128
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,830
Do you know how you sold your car?

129
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,070
It comes up in the system, you know.

130
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,620
So the party who had your bond turned it over to us.

131
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,150
Bond?

132
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,680
My gosh...

133
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,110
    
 Hara Publishing.

134
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,420
Hara?

135
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,630
This is a publishing company. Is that right?

136
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,820
The insurance company paid for the damages that

137
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,790
the publishing company incurred because of you.

138
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,630
It looks like the insurance company was going to

139
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,030
request a claim for indemnity to you.

140
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,240
But you didn't contact them

141
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,600
and they didn't get any feedback from you,

142
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,570
yet you sold your car during that time.

143
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,000
So they got pissed off,

144
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,030
and they turned over the bond to us.

145
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,690
That's probably what happened.

146
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,220
Then...

147
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,430
did the publishing company turn over the bond to you?

148
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,300
No, no.

149
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,200
Not the publishing company, but the insurance company.

150
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,330
The publishing company's insurance company.

151
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,060
A third party took over a claim of indemnity that they had.

152
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,070
This went around like this and ended up here.

153
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,510
When it came, aigoo...

154
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,540
    
 It was flagged as a bad bond from the beginning.

155
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,710
When you sold your car, I think

156
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,750
they thought you were playing tricks.

157
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,160
Why did you do that?

158
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,720
Anyway...

159
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,180
you're quite overdue on the principal and interest.

160
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,550
Well, I...

161
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,190
had to move in a rush.

162
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,320
If that's the case...

163
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,230
you should've answered your phone.

164
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,100
You're flagged as a delinquent debtor.

165
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,560
Of all people,

166
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,750
you're assigned to Mr. Choi's team.

167
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,800
Stay strong.

168
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,050
 

169
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,960
   

170
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,270
If I do what you say,

171
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,770
you said you won't bother my brother anymore.

172
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,350
Geez, come on, man.

173
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,370
I helped you pay your debt.

174
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,600
You should blame your parents who left a debt behind.

175
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,300
Please let my brother go. Please?

176
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,400
It's not like you have parents...

177
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,650
or have any assets...

178
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,150
that you can study without any worries.

179
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,760
For kids like you,

180
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,090
your path has already been decided.

181
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,890
In the end, you're destined to crawl in this field.

182
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,910
Take him and put him to work.

183
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,140
 Yes, sir. 

184
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,080
Let go of me!

185
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,050
Let go!

186
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,220
 It's not because they borrowed money and won't pay it back 

187
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,190
 for them to suffer under loan sharks. 

188
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,110
 There has to be a story to this. 

189
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,390
Excuse me.

190
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,190
Seung Joo.

191
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,970
Are you feeling better?

192
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,780
Yes.

193
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,530
By chance...

194
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,220
is something the matter?

195
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,810
You look down since earlier.

196
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,500
If I said I'd take this case,

197
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,070
things wouldn't have gotten this bad.

198
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,820
It's not your fault, Unni.

199
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,030
Back then...

200
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,510
I felt like it was all my fault

201
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,550
that I wasn't treated like a human.

202
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,030
Just as even if I didn't make it back then,

203
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,110
it's not your fault...

204
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,310
you didn't do anything wrong regarding this case.

205
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,120
But...

206
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,720
having a desire to live

207
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,280
is all thanks to you.

208
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,990
Thanks to you,

209
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,250
I got to learn that a person should be

210
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,160
treated like a human.

211
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,560
 

212
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,130
Please make it short.

213
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,090
Unni.

214
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,650
Thank you...

215
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,980
for giving me the courage to live again.

216
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,260
You decide.

217
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,590
Whether you'll be used like this

218
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,390
and throw your life down into a sewer

219
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,430
or if you'll reach out.

220
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,760
Are you going to ruin your life like this?

221
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,090
What happened to...

222
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,450
that hyung?

223
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,180
And Eun Hye noona?

224
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,490
If I ask for help now,

225
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,420
do my actions disappear?

226
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,570
If that could happen,

227
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,950
only if I can put...

228
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,740
things back...

229
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,580
 Please help me. 

230
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,360
 Please help me. 

231
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,230
 

232
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,900
   

233
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,930
Is this all you have on Jung Woo's case?

234
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,220
For now.

235
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,770
If you need any additional info,

236
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,400
let me know anytime.

237
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,390
Okay.

238
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,210
 

239
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,870
   

240
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,230
   

241
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,340
   

242
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,380
Here.

243
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,620
I look into it...

244
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,690
InBank Credit Reporting Agency that took over Kang Hae Ra's bonds.

245
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,520
It was sold to Happy Credit last month.

246
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,880
More than 50% of the bonds that came into InBank

247
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,250
got turned over to Happy Credit.

248
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,910
    
 Happy Credit says...

249
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,620
they're a credit agency, to put it nicely.

250
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,390
But they work like loan sharks. Exactly the same way.

251
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,010
And that picture.

252
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,710
It's Choi.

253
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,030
He's the most vicious one of them all.

254
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,320
Would she be okay?

255
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,400
Kang Hae Ra.

256
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,910
Whether this is a coincidence

257
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,970
or it's Chairman Kim's intention.

258
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,610
I'll have to look into that first.

259
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,190
Oh, yeah.

260
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,790
How did Director Kim Tae On come to you?

261
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,970
I expected her from the time I placed Kang Hae Ra in Director Song's office.

262
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Thanks to the documents you gave me, I was able to get past it.

263
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,800
I have to watch how things go.

264
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,840
Trust isn't important anyway.

265
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,670
How far that Director Kim's ambition goes

266
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,940
is what's important.

267
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,220
That's right.

268
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,020
Only if...

269
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,420
she'll stay quiet and watch you destroy her father.

270
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,630
Oh, that has been arranged.

271
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,860
It's Friday night.

272
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,130
The other victim is on the 8th floor?

273
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,120
Yes, I think it's room 807.

274
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,780
Ow!

275
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,380
Why, why?

276
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,030
My back, my back.

277
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,430
Hey, does your back hurt?

278
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,310
My back is itchy like crazy.

279
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,710
Scratch my back for me.

280
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,750
Oh, okay.

281
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,060
- Where? 
 - Here.

282
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,400
- Here? 
 - Yeah.

283
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,730
To the right.

284
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,370
Right, there.

285
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,410
Right.

286
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,510
That feels good.

287
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,840
Eun Hye, if you need anything...

288
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,420
No!

289
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,150
What do you mean, no?

290
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,710
That night...

291
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,060
I bought gopchang to eat with you.

292
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,800
I was shocked and dropped it in the hallway.

293
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,970
We couldn't eat that anymore, huh?

294
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,510
That's beef gopchang.

295
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,100
You're all better now.

296
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,310
Sorry.

297
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,900
My dad told me.

298
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,950
You must've been so distressed...

299
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,950
I just spat out whatever came to my mind.

300
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,210
Forget it.

301
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,260
Where is Mr. Goo? He should eat.

302
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,920
I told him to go home.

303
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,410
I'm feeling better,

304
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,050
and he lets his presence known too well.

305
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,480
Gosh, come on.

306
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,880
Gosh, Dad...

307
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,330
Please.

308
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,990
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,130
Dad, Dad.

310
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,480
Dad...

311
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,750
Come on...

312
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,890
That's good.

313
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,620
I can stay with you.

314
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,900
Geez.

315
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,270
Right on.

316
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,700
I should've said I'd take the case from the get-go.

317
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,680
Then you and Hyun Sung both wouldn't be...

318
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,190
It's okay.

319
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,030
You "should've"?

320
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,300
I decided to take Jung Woo's case.

321
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,670
Oh, my...

322
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,900
It's okay.

323
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,370
If you're doing it because of what I said, you don't have to.

324
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,520
And after what we went through,

325
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,440
they're much more dangerous than I thought.

326
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,220
That's why I decided to take it.

327
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,550
Because they're more vicious than I expected.

328
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,930
And...

329
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,710
whatever relationship you're in,

330
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,710
I don't want to meddle.

331
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,680
But I don't think Jung Woo is right for you.

332
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,970
What?

333
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,820
Even before this case got resolved,

334
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,440
I don't want you to get hurt.

335
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,490
I saw you two coming out of a motel together.

336
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,240
What is she saying...

337
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,560
What are you talking about?

338
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,220
By chance...

339
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,900
Did you misunderstand Jung Woo and I to be in that kind of a relationship?

340
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,750
Gosh, this is nuts.

341
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,710
What do you take me for?

342
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,540
You know...

343
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,460
after you two walked out of a motel,

344
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,630
you gave Jung Woo a money envelope.

345
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,820
And when it comes to Jung Woo's matter, you go all out.

346
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,720
What if I take this case on

347
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,960
and your relationship with Jung Woo is exposed?

348
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,200
Hey!

349
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,210
That's because I went to a motel to catch a cheating couple,

350
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,460
and that guy happened to be working there.

351
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,140
I was thanking him for helping me install recorders

352
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,590
and paid him...

353
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,530
And the reason I'm helping out Jung Woo is

354
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,500
for him to pay off his debt, the kid is

355
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,000
- working all over... 
 - You told me you were going on a date.

356
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,730
That's because...

357
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,710
going to a motel to catch cheaters

358
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,440
is too, too, too...

359
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,280
embarrassing for me!

360
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,260
Gosh, dang it!

361
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,520
Is that really...

362
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,950
what you think of me?

363
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,770
Hey, those two people...

364
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:23,520
- Why did they come? 
 - I'm not done talking.

365
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,850
Hey, don't change the subject.

366
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,720
I think they'll say something to Hyun Sung.

367
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,630
Hey, hey. I'm not finished.

368
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,870
You're running off.

369
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,930
All this isn't important.

370
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,560
We can clear up misunderstandings.

371
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,210
Hey, don't you care about Jung Woo?

372
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,060
Jung Woo was transferred to the Prosecutors' Office.

373
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,960
What if Hyun Sung testifies against Jung Woo?

374
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,770
Geez...

375
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,870
What did you tell them?

376
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,270
I think you two should say the same thing.

377
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,930
I said it was a mistake.

378
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,860
I don't know what that jerk will say.

379
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,330
But no matter how I think about it,

380
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,670
I think it's too dangerous for you to take this case on.

381
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,990
They made a kid do such a thing.

382
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,580
So I looked into it...

383
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,960
You know that Choi who came with Jung Woo that night?

384
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,930
He's infamous in that field.

385
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,340
Geez, if I didn't hurt my hand...

386
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,170
Gosh, I'll just...

387
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,120
Then I can join in.

388
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,420
I'll join you.

389
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,120
Let me join you.

390
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,500
You getting stabbed is partly my fault.

391
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,820
So don't worry about the hospital bill.

392
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,600
You said you need someone.

393
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,560
No matter how desperate I am for someone,

394
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,120
I can't work with someone I can't trust, like you.

395
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,840
It's true when I said I want to be like you, Sunbae.

396
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
You can teach me.

397
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,200
How I can live like a human being...

398
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,720
How I can endure well.

399
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,010
Damn it! What do I do then?

400
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,180
Living is harder than dying.

401
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,500
Don't you think I've done everything to survive?

402
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,070
Working at construction sites, making deliveries, there's nothing I haven't done!

403
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,580
This gas tank.

404
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,120
Carrying this heavy tank,

405
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,790
I went up and down four, five-story buildings without an elevator so many times.

406
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,100
But!

407
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,530
They told me not to do even that.

408
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,880
A woman who recognized me called my work,

409
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,600
and she doesn't want someone like me making deliveries.

410
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
Are you saying...

411
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,530
that's my fault?

412
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,990
How should I live in the future?

413
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,900
Don't do it. Don't! Don't!

414
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,480
If you let me join in,

415
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,690
I'll testify in favor of that kid Jung Woo.

416
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,840
I'll even settle if I have to.

417
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,770
But if you don't let me in,

418
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,200
forget testifying in his favor.

419
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,990
And as for my pay...

420
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,720
He asks for pay?

421
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,320
He's such a thug.

422
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,080
Give me food and lodging.

423
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,130
The sofa in your office looked pretty big.

424
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,820
Just let me sleep there for now.

425
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,850
How about it? Deal?

426
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,910
As for illegal actions while collecting,

427
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,390
since I'm flagged as a delinquent debtor,

428
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,990
I can use my case.

429
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,790
It'd be good to have

430
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,610
more delinquent debtor cases due to the right to indemnify.

431
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,860
I wish we can get some insider information.

432
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,000
Could there be more victims who will testify?

433
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,920
I'll look into that.

434
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,250
You will? How?

435
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,370
I used to be a scandal reporter.

436
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,490
I'll go inside Happy Credit

437
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,300
and find the info you're looking for.

438
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,090
You'll go in yourself?

439
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,330
I can go in as an employee.

440
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,000
I looked it up. They're hiring.

441
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,540
   

442
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,390
Would that be okay?

443
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,950
When you got stabbed last time...

444
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,050
Gosh, I'm in my twenties.

445
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,750
I can even run a marathon all the way.

446
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,900
But wait.

447
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,090
Why do you use honorifics with Hae Ra

448
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,440
but speak down to me?

449
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,760
Me?

450
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,160
See? Just now.

451
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,430
Don't worry, Sunbae.

452
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,140
I'm confident I can do a good job.

453
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,360
See? See?

454
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,930
I can't work with a guy like this.

455
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,480
He treats me so unfairly.

456
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,050
Don't worry about me.

457
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,230
That's not it.

458
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,320
I wonder if one of them will recognize you.

459
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,810
Don't worry about that.

460
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,770
I have a way.

461
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,510
Whoa.

462
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,870
Just by changing the hair color,

463
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,620
you look like a different person.

464
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,100
But I think I'm making it look streaky.

465
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,400
That's the point.

466
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,100
It has to look cheap to look like a thug.

467
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,520
What?

468
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,590
It's not like he looks all that refined as is anyway.

469
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,060
Maybe we should take it in the opposite direction.

470
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,030
Geez, come on now.

471
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,210
Hey.

472
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,920
Trust your noonas.

473
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,080
It's going to look great.

474
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,070
More, more, more, more...

475
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,550
Right, right, right.

476
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,990
Straight up. Whoa!

477
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,040
We got your style.

478
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,780
It's totally your style.

479
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,020
Drink.

480
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,690
He was top of his class throughout the training institute.

481
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,430
All the cases he took on,

482
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,600
he has never lost whether they were civil or criminal cases.

483
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,860
So...

484
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,780
the trial prosecutors want to avoid him in court.

485
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,180
You could go to the Supreme Court or Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

486
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,790
Why didn't you?

487
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,880
I think I was immature then.

488
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,450
Back then, I didn't feel I needed

489
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,500
honor, experience, or network.

490
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,280
But you need them now?

491
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,700
Why?

492
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,950
I'm interested in politics.

493
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,850
I thought money would take care of everything.

494
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,920
But I learned that...

495
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,180
that's not everything in Korea.

496
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Since you're so capable, you made enough money.

497
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,820
But you came to me for lacking connections.

498
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,150
But what can I tell you?

499
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,870
The only thing I lack is

500
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,350
the youth you possess.

501
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:30,410
Your current position...

502
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,420
If you want, Chairman...

503
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,890
I'll set it up for you,

504
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,040
so that you can maintain that.

505
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,020
Get me company credit card details from every department

506
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,770
in the last ten years, internal accounting

507
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,990
audit reports, and files on all executives.

508
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,160
Yes, sir.

509
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,050
Mr. Park from the finance team.

510
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,660
Set up a meeting with him in the morning.

511
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,790
Understood.

512
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,300
 

513
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,560
 

514
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,240
Risk management has been handled very poorly.

515
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,820
I'm sure you're aware that you avoided

516
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,250
an inadequate opinion in the internal audit.

517
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,420
At this rate, if we're unqualified next year,

518
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,760
we have no reason to keep you around.

519
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,760
The financial records you have, Mr. Park...

520
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,110
Please send them to me before noon.

521
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,900
You don't need to volunteer to take on the blame.

522
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,860
For someone like you, Mr. Park.

523
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,210
Since he's got the looks already,

524
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,700
- if we touch up a bit... 
 - With all this,

525
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,500
even King Arthur looks like a thug.

526
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,580
Come on...

527
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,790
Let's not bring up kings into this.

528
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,720
Just let me know when the files are coming over and the time.

529
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,140
That's it.

530
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,950
Don't do anything alone.

531
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,500
   

532
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,930
Don't worry.

533
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,620
I won't screw this up.

534
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,810
The resume is just a formality.

535
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,900
It seems that the field needs more workers.

536
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,900
If I work hard, I can become a team leader in no time.

537
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,090
Geez.

538
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,430
Don't act like you know me if we bump into each other.

539
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,800
And be careful.

540
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,330
That guy. He sure is easy to dislike,

541
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,740
but I'm worried. Aren't you?

542
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,190
Hello, welcome.

543
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,080
How can I help you?

544
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,920
Where is Mr. Choi's team?

545
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,480
That way.

546
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,870
You're very tall.

547
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,350
Nice.

548
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,150
Excuse me...

549
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,890
- You! 
 - Geez...

550
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,510
Are you a newbie?

551
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,350
I can put you on the ground right away.

552
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,970
Have you stabbed someone?

553
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,290
Pardon?

554
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,160
Let me see...

555
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,610
I usually let you make some phone calls,

556
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,050
but it's odd timing.

557
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,750
Looking good.

558
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,240
Let's go on the field.

559
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,790
Come.

560
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,350
Hello!

561
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,900
Have a good day!

562
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,550
Hello.

563
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,690
Hello!

564
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,800
Alrighty.

565
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,340
I have no money, even if it kills me.

566
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,070
Come back next week.

567
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,700
Sit down.

568
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,120
Daughter!

569
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,080
Coming home from school?

570
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,670
Your mom is suffering so much because of the debt.

571
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,650
And you're her daughter.

572
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,000
Here, give me a business card.

573
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,100
Hey, here.

574
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,830
Take it.

575
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,270
Take it.

576
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:42,080
My office is hiring right now.

577
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,710
After school tomorrow,

578
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,710
come by.

579
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,810
I'll teach you the ropes.

580
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,990
No.

581
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,160
Starting tomorrow, I'll...

582
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,820
  
 yeah, Seomyeon Girls High...

583
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,720
I'll wait for you in front of your school.

584
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,700
Leave now.

585
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,790
Cut the crap with my kid.

586
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,720
Aigoo.

587
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,760
Thank you, ma'am.

588
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,980
Thank you.

589
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,220
Let's go.

590
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,580
Go to your art academy

591
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,090
and tell them you'll be out for a month.

592
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,250
 

593
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,790
 

594
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,540
 Until the job is finished, 

595
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,100
 you should stay in a motel in the area. 

596
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,880
We got rid of the finance team leader.

597
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,370
Okay.

598
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,680
   

599
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,290
 It won't take that long. 

600
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,670
Three months.

601
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,520
Please stay quiet while the FB protection system

602
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,280
protection frees the firm.

603
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,190
To inherit the share your mother left with the foundation,

604
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,790
I believe you need about 500 billion won.

605
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,860
That's why you pushed for

606
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,240
unreasonable business collaboration with J &amp; Cell.

607
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,690
If you try to touch the foundation,

608
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,450
Chairman Kim won't stand back

609
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,380
like this time.

610
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,990
Don't fight over shares with less than 1% difference.

611
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,400
Turn FB Financial into a holding company.

612
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,570
Then the rest of the subsidiaries will take care of itself.

613
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,680
- Turn into a holding company? 
 - Except...

614
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,040
to wrap everything up at once,

615
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,300
you must convince Chairman Kim that he is dominating FB Life.

616
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,090
I'll start cleaning up your maternal side of the family.

617
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,840
I'm not sure if you should just sit back and watch.

618
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,100
Since the sly old fox made up his mind,

619
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,500
I don't think he'll just step down.

620
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,480
I'll have to let him bite into rotten meat.

621
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,310
After sinking his teeth into the meat,

622
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,660
if it's full of maggots,

623
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,220
aren't you curious to see his facial expression?

624
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,200
Newbie.

625
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,470
See you later.

626
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:13,800
The client here is quite something.

627
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,560
Before she sells stuff she's hiding,

628
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,560
why don't you try to squeeze her?

629
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,440
What are you doing?

630
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,170
What are you doing?

631
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,730
 Don't add or take away. 

632
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,830
 Do it the way you do in other places. 

633
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,220
I won't end with warning you alone, ahjumma.

634
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,740
Next time...

635
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,200
I'll go find your friends in these pictures and your kid.

636
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,960
And I'll say this.

637
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,250
I'll tell your friends...

638
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,300
that you hid everything without creditors' knowledge

639
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,350
and you won't pay off your debt.

640
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,560
Bravo!

641
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,860
Bravo!

642
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,120
I'm off.

643
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,430
Aigoo...

644
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,710
I happened to hear this.

645
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,890
I think tonight is the D-day.

646
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,700
   

647
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,240
Eat.

648
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,730
Yes, yes.

649
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,890
Yes.

650
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,470
Good job.

651
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,070
Get your treatment now.

652
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,720
 

653
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,860
 Midnight tonight? 

654
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,760
 Of course. 

655
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,620
 
 They come at a good price from there. 

656
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,940
 Yes, got it. I'll see you then. 

657
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,000
 Yes. 

658
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,400
He doesn't clearly say that the bonds are coming over at midnight.

659
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,560
We'll find out once we check.

660
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,340
Geez, only if my hand was okay.

661
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,710
Geez, I'm so nervous.

662
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,010
Don't worry.

663
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,270
I'll be back.

664
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,060
Hey.

665
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,260
I'm worried about you. Take this.

666
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,300
Hey! Kang Hae Ra!

667
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,350
Geez...

668
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:26,410
That girl needs to watch out.

669
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,240
 It's the end office on the second floor. 

670
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,690
 The entrance passcode is 1212. 

671
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,350
 

672
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,500
 One of the cabinets have a lock. 

673
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,720
 I didn't get to see the last two digits. 

674
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,620
 The first two digits are 03. 

675
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,000
 I'm sure. 

676
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,130
 03... 

677
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,750
0324...

678
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,870
Got it.

679
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,830
   

680
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,100
Yeah.

681
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,580
Choi and a man just went up.

682
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,600
- Get out of there. 
 - Okay.

683
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,900
 Did you check what came over from the life insurance company? 

684
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,470
Yes, I checked.

685
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,920
Make sure no one finds out that the

686
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,470
bonds came from FB Life.

687
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:01,470
Yes.

688
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,560
And...

689
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,490
the ones you can't squeeze more out of.

690
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,230
Send them to the fish market.

691
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:09,530
 Yes. 

692
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,240
- The fish market... 
  - From the ones that came over tonight... 

693
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,290
and among all the people I've been pushing around,

694
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,050
I'll come up with a few.

695
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,570
They were asking...

696
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,350
when we're holding another auction.

697
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,740
Make sure your guys stay quiet.

698
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,100
Yes.

699
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,210
Hey, get her!

700
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,220
Hurry, get on.

701
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,000
Damn it!

702
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,590
Ouch...

703
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,000
You don't know who it is?

704
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,230
Yes.

705
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,190
I asked for CCTV clips from Detective Lee.

706
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,020
If it's not a cop,

707
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,560
let her to the fish market.

708
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,050
Okay.

709
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:58,040
I thought this is better than in front of your house.

710
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,250
Thanks to that hyung, Eun Hye noona,

711
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,800
and lawyer, I got community service.

712
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,750
Please tell them I said thank you.

713
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,550
And that I'm sorry.

714
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:09,380
Eun Hye is very worried about you.

715
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,980
She says she's fine, so you don't have to worry.

716
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,210
And we're thinking of a way to help you.

717
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:42,550
Just wait a little longer.

718
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,840
You've done enough.

719
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,620
This won't end until I pay off everything.

720
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,790
If you have a debt, you should pay back.

721
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:53,940
All we're saying is that there shouldn't be

722
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,650
any criminal exploitations

723
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:58,100
against weak people like you.

724
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,660
And...

725
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:03,000
for those who lend without thinking,

726
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,170
I want to let them know how dangerous that is.

727
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,290
I might need your help soon.

728
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,050
 

729
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:19,100
These people here...

730
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,120
Please find out who took over their bonds.

731
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,930
    
 They're credit agencies...

732
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,050
that don't come up on the internet.

733
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:26,620
I guess looking into it as an individual has its limits.

734
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,760
I'll call you after I look through them.

735
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,740
Okay.

736
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,800
So...

737
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,310
can I ask you how you got

738
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,950
all these documents?

739
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:45,810
I didn't obtain them through proper channels.

740
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,710
Do you want to know more?

741
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,720
Oh, yeah.

742
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,770
Do you know anyone in the police department or Prosecutors' Office?

743
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,900
Preferably someone without any connections to Happy Credit.

744
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,330
The police in the area...

745
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,290
I know a sunbae in the Prosecutors' Office.

746
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,060
If you tell me the D-day,

747
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,260
I'll call him, so he can come through when you need his help.

748
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,240
Okay.

749
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,720
I'll call you when the time has been set.

750
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,190
Kang Hae Ra.

751
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,530
When things get dangerous,

752
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:16,050
you don't have to put yourself out there.

753
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,860
When I said I'd take care of things,

754
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,980
those assistances were included.

755
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,750
What should I do?

756
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,980
He's been there for 30 minutes now.

757
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,120
Why?

758
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,210
You won't even bring out tea for me?

759
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,650
I don't remember inviting you.

760
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,550
- What? 
 - I told you to wait.

761
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,960
Geez, dang it!

762
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,390
Hey, am I your mutt to kick around?

763
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,730
This is no fun.

764
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,980
Bring him some tea.

765
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,390
After you ruined everything, you say what now?

766
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,050
It's no fun?

767
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,880
How can you say I ruined everything?

768
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,960
You didn't want to live with that woman,

769
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,240
so you pulled the stunt.

770
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,880
You got what you wanted. What's the problem here?

771
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:10,070
What?

772
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,900
I got what I wanted?

773
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,760
If it weren't for you to start with,

774
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,740
I wouldn't be in this situation.

775
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,100
Put everything back the way it was.

776
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,650
If you get a drug abuse charge on top of that,

777
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:33,620
you won't even have the freedom you enjoy now.

778
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,810
As expected.

779
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,860
 You know what will happen if I admit our relationship to him. 

780
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:54,010
 He won't sign the divorce papers and stand his ground. 

781
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,630
 What's the point of a DNA test? 

782
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,410
 If it's too hard for you, 

783
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,850
 I'll help you bring the child and run the DNA test. 

784
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,520
I heard your husband is asking for several billion won

785
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,760
for alimony and division of assets?

786
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,620
I wondered if I should take this to your husband

787
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:19,100
or to Kang Hae Ra.

788
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,640
And...

789
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,140
I thought of people who'd be ecstatic if I tossed this to them.

790
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,830
The reporters who are like hyenas

791
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:32,090
who are ready to bite off any day.

792
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,340
 Jung Hoon! 

793
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,530
Hyung...

794
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,980
Hey.

795
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,540
Crap...

796
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,000
What happened?

797
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:21,790
I'm sorry.

798
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:23,670
Due to some issues at the bar,

799
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,960
it won't be available.

800
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,670
We came to hear the music.

801
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,780
Please use the sky lounge. Thank you.

802
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,940
I'm Cha Min Joon.

803
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,660
This way, please.

804
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,250
Hello.

805
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:08,110
All right. What can I get you?

806
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,630
I'll take what you're having.

807
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:12,520
Okay.

808
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,700
Same thing.

809
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,040
The music is nice here.

810
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,010
The drinks taste the same, too.

811
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,400
Hey, look.

812
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,300
If you were wound up real tight all day,

813
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,990
you should have some time to let loose.

814
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,100
Isn't that right?

815
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,220
Thank you.

816
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,690
All right.

817
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,870
Drink.

818
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:57,300
The atmosphere has changed here.

819
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,440
Yes.

820
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,210
The new manager reworked the interior.

821
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,530
I see.

822
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:05,350
You have a new general manager?

823
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:06,270
No.

824
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:09,120
We have a new assistant manager.

825
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,100
What's the use in changing the interior?

826
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,190
People should change.

827
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:14,440
Don't you think so?

828
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,740
Look at this old man standing here.

829
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:19,830
I like it better for that reason.

830
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:21,830
If you focused on being trendy,

831
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:24,590
it's no different from other bars.

832
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:26,540
Thanks to you, I feel relaxed

833
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,090
and can feel the refined style.

834
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:31,720
People can change,

835
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,390
but you don't like it when drinks taste different.

836
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:35,780
Of course not.

837
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,850
I don't like it when drinks taste different.

838
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:42,710
Excuse me.

839
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,810
This is the assistant manager I mentioned.

840
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,910
It's my honor to serve you.

841
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,670
Have a nice time.

842
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,560
She looks young.

843
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,400
The general manager was in Las Vegas on a business trip

844
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,800
and scouted her.

845
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,420
She has a master's degree from an Ivy League,

846
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,280
and people speak highly of her.

847
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,830
What do you think about her?

848
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,310
Pardon?

849
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,410
Geez.

850
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:30,290
He's naive when it comes to women.

851
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:33,340
Should I teach you a thing or two?

852
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:06,020
   

853
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,380
I'd...

854
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:18,500
like to have some fun.

855
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,300
Hey! Hey!

856
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,900
 You know, people have desires. 

857
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,160
A desire to have more.

858
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,510
When you think you've got enough,

859
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,060
you have the desire to let go of yourself.

860
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:30,550
For someone who looks so straight-laced like her,

861
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,380
in her heart...

862
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:36,130
there are lots of suppressed issues.

863
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:40,550
What could let someone like her let go of herself?

864
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,660
Money.

865
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,460
It's money.

866
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:50,000
When there's money left over even after spending so much,

867
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,620
when you let go of yourself,

868
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:54,840
you don't even know...

869
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,530
what you did wrong or what's broken.

870
00:58:58,530 --> 00:58:59,980
That's...

871
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,610
the power of money.

872
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:16,530
 Fifty million won out of the blue? 

873
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,990
 Since you live here already, 

874
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:21,090
the owner raised only that much.

875
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:23,790
I understand.

876
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:25,320
I'll get going.

877
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,530
Bye.

878
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:40,750
Leaving now?

879
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,810
Call me when you get back to your unit.

880
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,690
Just now...

881
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,890
she raised our deposit, right?

882
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:48,990
Min Joon.

883
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:52,000
I'll take care of it. Don't worry about that.

884
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:54,100
Go now.

885
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,620
You'll miss the last bus.

886
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,320
- Still, where would you get that much...
- I said, don't worry.

887
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:04,750
Don't worry.

888
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:38,070
 I got it. 

889
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:40,100
 Next one, four! 

890
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,910
I'll start now.

891
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,090
All right then.

892
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,780
Mr. Kim and Mr. Ahn took the kidneys.

893
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,070
Okay.

894
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,100
Today's highlight.

895
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,370
Hey.

896
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:46,350
What the hell are you guys doing right now?

897
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:49,050
 Mr. Choi! 

898
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,720
 Mr. Choi! 

899
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,270
 Mr. Choi! 

900
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:53,970
 Mr. Choi! 

901
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:55,680
 Mr. Choi! 

902
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,900
Okay.

903
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,530
Yes, next...

904
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:01,850
Hey, the mic...

905
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:03,190
Hey.

906
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:05,260
Geez. Sorry, sorry.

907
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,390
Okay, next...

908
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,940
Let's get started...

909
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:12,370
with our organ auction!

910
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,520
All right.

911
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,540
Mr. Kim and Mr. Ahn...

912
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,410
took kidneys.

913
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:23,850
Let's get down to business.

914
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,210
A heart.

915
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,750
Let's go with heart!

916
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,090
 - All right! 
 - Great! 

917
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:33,630
For a heart...

918
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,900
it's usually two big ones. (200 million won)

919
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,130
Today, as a special...

920
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,420
we'll start with one big one! (100 million won)

921
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,930
Raise your hands!

922
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:43,580
 Me! 

923
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:45,350
 Me! 

924
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,490
Wait, wait, wait!

925
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:55,220
No, do it again.

926
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,250
Okay, we usually go with two big ones.

927
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,200
We'll start with one and a half.

928
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,950
We'll go again! Raise your hand!

929
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:03,090
You damn bastards!

930
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,810
What the hell are you guys doing?

931
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,940
"You damn bastards."

932
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:22,200
What the hell?

933
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,400
- What's going on? 
 - A blackout?

934
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,370
 What the heck is that? 

935
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,680
   

936
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,650
 Stay still! 

937
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,060
 It's hard to believe even after seeing with your own eyes. 

938
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,530
A site of organ auction.

939
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,030
It was Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency's

940
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:33,380
new episode.

941
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:45,210
♫  I'll go in slow speed  ♫

942
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:49,240
♫  It's too far of a distance  ♫

943
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,990
♫  There's no despair, tell me  ♫

944
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:59,140
 

945
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:02,130
 

946
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:03,900
   	 
  Did you fact check this? 

947
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,260
 Who took this? 

948
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:08,010
 Ironically, this is all thanks to Kang Hae Ra. 

949
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:10,320
 She was effective as a cheat key. 

950
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,420
 So you're saying the principal was five million won? 

951
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,880
 We have to cover it first. 

952
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,870
 I'd like you to get rid of a woman. 

953
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:22,460
 He'll show that he's a perfect leader without any flaws to the end? 

954
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,950
 Next item is connected to Chairman Kim, too, right? 

955
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:27,030
 I have to link him with all the crimes 

956
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:28,640
 he has committed. 

957
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:41,000
