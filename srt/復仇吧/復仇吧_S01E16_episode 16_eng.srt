1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,880
  			 

2
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,080
   

3
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,710
   

4
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,890
Who the hell are they?

5
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,120
Hey, you!

6
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,990
I'm the only one who can beat up the newbie!

7
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,690
- Get them! 
 - Yes, sir!

8
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,530
We're at the parking structure at the Moa nursing hospital.

9
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,340
Come as fast as you can! Hurry!

10
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,230
Do Yoon hyung said he left it in here.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,400
As soon as I get out, lock the door.

12
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,700
Got it?

13
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,310
It's about time.

14
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,150
Why? I came just in time.

15
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,760
 Hi. 

16
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,270
 How can I help you? 

17
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,680
 Choi. 

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,030
 We still have a business to take care of. 

19
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,520
 What? 

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,220
 I still hurt where you beat me last time. 

21
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,090
 I even have a doctor's note. 

22
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,270
 You jerk... 

23
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,790
 I felt generous enough to help you guys out. 

24
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,540
 While you're at it, why don't you show off your skills? 

25
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,780
 My skills? 

26
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,490
 We're going to get Hae Ra sunbae's son at the hospital. 

27
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,270
 I'm asking you to help us. 

28
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,600
 We might get into a fight with the guards there. 

29
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,230
 I don't want to get beat up in front of a girl. 

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,200
Hey!

31
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,190
I'll go out and see what's going on.

32
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,990
Don't ever come outside.

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,300
Hey!

34
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,850
Why did you come out?

35
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,290
It's scarier in there!

36
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,560
True. It is.

37
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,390
You can't go in there unless you kill me.

38
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,600
Come!

39
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,320
Gosh.

40
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,190
Whatever!

41
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,540
Damn it!

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,060
You! Get lost!

43
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,490
Don't come! Don't come!

44
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,670
Hey!

45
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,100
Hey, you punk!

46
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,920
They're here. You...

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,340
You guys are all dead.

48
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,350
Are you okay?

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,670
Are you okay?

50
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,510
Them.

51
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,860
Why are you arresting us? You should get them.

52
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,080
Wait, it's not us.

53
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,130
It's them! The men in suits!

54
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,350
You guys are Chairman Kim Sang Goo's kidnappers.

55
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,890
What?

56
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,280
Kim Tae On and these people locked up

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,000
Chairman Kim and the kid here and will set it on fire.

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,750
So we're getting them out of here!

59
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,470
Why are you arresting us?

60
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,620
Hey.

61
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,200
You said you can get Kim Tae On.

62
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,490
Geez...

63
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,920
Take them!

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,700
- Wait! 
 - Wait a minute!

65
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,450
 Wait! Wait a minute! 

66
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,730
 Geez! 

67
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,850
Kim Tae On?

68
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,420
How come you're here?

69
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,700
You thought I'd be prepping for broadcast. Why am I here?

70
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,920
One of Director Jung's reporters

71
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,010
looking into the right of indemnity lawsuits by FB Life

72
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,370
and the warehouse fire from the past.

73
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,230
This is why you shouldn't be too smart.

74
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,880
You tend to trust your brain

75
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,200
and become conceited, thinking you could deceive the other person.

76
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,720
What's the situation at the hospital?

77
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,140
I checked with an employee who let Goo Eun Hye in.

78
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,340
While you're on TV,

79
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,410
they plan to take the child out of there.

80
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,340
Call FBC's programming team

81
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,710
and tell them to put a special right after Jung Joo Yeon's show.

82
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,080
I was going to use Ms. Jung just for that purpose

83
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,780
and that's why I kept her close.

84
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,990
Thanks to her, I get to take care of all of you at once.

85
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,470
Get rid of all three of them in front of me for good.

86
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,770
Try moving your finger.

87
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,100
What are you doing?

88
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,620
Take them.

89
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,410
Kim Tae On, you'll have to come with us.

90
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,820
Me?

91
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,720
With what charge?

92
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,520
Do you have a warrant?

93
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,010
If I can determine that the suspect committed a crime

94
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,630
facing three years of prison time or committed bribery,

95
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,820
I can arrest you without a warrant.

96
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,010
Your instigation of their murder just now

97
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,620
falls under that category.

98
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,510
She was trying to kidnap my father.

99
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,660
I was only trying to protect my father.

100
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,240
You tried to protect Chairman Kim?

101
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,450
You tried to kill your father after locking him in the hospital.

102
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,910
That's nonsense...

103
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,380
Can you prove what you just said?

104
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,460
 If you're that worried about that child, 

105
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,220
 I'll send you off with him. 

106
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,580
 Since it's winter, 

107
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,380
 a fire from electrical problems will seem most natural. 

108
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,470
Can you prove that's my voice?

109
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,080
Kidnapping and manipulation of my voice?

110
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,900
Ms. Yeom, call Attorney Choi right now.

111
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,220
Yes, ma'am.

112
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,580
You locked up your father and half-brother in a hospital room

113
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,870
and tried to kill them disguised as a fire.

114
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,700
We found out that fact and tried to get both of them out.

115
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,670
You're watching the scene where she tried to stop us with her guards.

116
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,440
On this episode of Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency,

117
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,920
we're exposing the bare face of FB Life's Director Kim Tae On

118
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,050
who betrayed her father to take

119
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,090
    
  his position as CEO. 

120
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,260
   

121
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,120
How am I going to prove it?

122
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,200
From the moment I got into this ambulance,

123
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,490
I've been broadcasting it live.

124
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,990
Deputy Chief Prosecutor Ahn won't be able to help you anymore.

125
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,430
This came directly from the Attorney General.

126
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,170
So don't try to get out of this.

127
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,720
You're not that smart.

128
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,420
I'm Prosecutor Jang Sun Ho.

129
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,290
You're under arrest for accepting bribes and falsifying testimony.

130
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,730
Take him away quietly.

131
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,190
What the heck?

132
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,240
Reporter Jung Joo Yeon just got released as well.

133
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,730
We have to go to the nursing hospital right away.

134
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,700
You'll try to put me away with this entrapment?

135
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,210
It's not entrapment.

136
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,640
You fell into a grave you dug yourself.

137
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,940
We knew about it in advance. Ms. Jung, Choi...

138
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,130
and the hospital staff were all in this together.

139
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,770
 Do you have anything on Director Kim that we can blackmail her with? 

140
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,360
 I have a burn phone that Kang used to record 

141
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,230
 all the conversations with Kim Tae On. 

142
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,990
 There's a recording of her giving orders 

143
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,480
 to turn over the right of indemnity files to credit companies. 

144
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,950
 What if you hand that phone over to her with a spy app? 

145
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,710
 A spy app? 

146
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,350
 It's like giving her a phone with a bug. 

147
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,160
 Like putting a bell around a cat's neck. 

148
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,800
 Send more guards to the hospital who will get the job done right. 

149
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,940
 Yes, ma'am. 

150
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,380
 Will you take care of Ms. Jung yourself? 

151
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,690
 Send over the cops to her. 

152
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,840
 I'll go to the nursing hospital. 

153
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,870
 I'll see it for myself if they take care of them this time. 

154
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,870
Oh, yeah.

155
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,340
I was so worried...

156
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,500
that you wouldn't show up here.

157
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,650
Thank you so much for showing up.

158
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,100
Let go!

159
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,260
I'm in a parking lot of a nursing facility in Seoul.

160
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,420
Just moments ago, a group of people who tried to get

161
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,710
Chairman K of a corporation who was locked up in the facility

162
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,490
and K's daughter's men who tried to stop them

163
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,110
got into a violent fight.

164
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,200
Fortunately, the SWAT Team was able to control

165
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,130
the situation without any casualties.

166
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,120
But the weapons that were used during the fight

167
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,140
and the damaged ambulance show

168
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,660
how brutal the situation was at the time.

169
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,260
I'll come with some tofu when you get out.

170
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,880
You don't have to.

171
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,140
With this, we're even.

172
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,440
Okay.

173
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,920
Is Ga On okay?

174
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,160
I don't know why he's not waking up.

175
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,060
It's probably the stabilizer.

176
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,230
An ambulance is on its way over.

177
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,060
He should get a complete exam when he arrives at the hospital.

178
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,900
Is everyone okay?

179
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,540
Yeah.

180
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,410
You all did great.

181
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,900
Thank you.

182
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,740
Thank you, Min Joon.

183
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,420
   

184
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,670
I have to expose Kim Tae On's insurance fraud

185
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,880
and what she did to Yi Hyeon sunbae.

186
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,090
That's the only way she can't get out of this.

187
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,360
Don't worry.

188
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,000
No matter what happens, we'll protect Ga On this time.

189
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,620
Come with us.

190
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,900
We have to compile a list of Kim Tae On's charges

191
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,150
and hand it over to Prosecutor Jang.

192
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,950
I'll bring the car to the front.

193
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,100
Please take care of Ga On.

194
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,790
Okay.

195
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,240
   

196
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,050
Receiving wrongful insurance payouts.

197
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,550
Extortion using the right of indemnity.

198
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,280
Abuse of power against insurance agents and false accusations.

199
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,240
These are crimes committed by a family that has

200
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,100
vast knowledge of insurance legislation.

201
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,930
When there were obstacles for her succession,

202
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,410
she tried to commit the sin of killing

203
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,000
her father and half-brother.

204
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,260
She committed the crime, but

205
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,280
she brazenly insisted that victims provide proof.

206
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,280
FB Life's Director Kim Tae On who thinks she can cover-up

207
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,630
her wrongdoings with money and power.

208
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,820
What could unmask Director Kim Tae On's

209
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,280
brazen actions?

210
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,680
   

211
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,530
Ga On, are you awake?

212
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,000
Where is Mom?

213
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,730
Are you okay?

214
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,350
Are you hurting anywhere?

215
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,060
I'm okay.

216
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,420
Mom went to work for a minute.

217
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,060
She'll be right back.

218
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,470
So...

219
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,580
Mom did come to get me yesterday, right?

220
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,820
Yeah, that's right.

221
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,400
I guess it wasn't a dream.

222
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,860
   

223
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,390
Hyung.

224
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,600
Kang Hae Ra's VTube videos on Kim Tae On's exposé

225
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,580
both got more than 500K views.

226
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,190
After I get back from giving Prosecutor Jang the files,

227
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,260
I'll file an annulment of Mr. Goo's right of indemnity lawsuit

228
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,600
and request a refund simultaneously.

229
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,160
Get the files ready for me.

230
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,460
Prepare the files on Jung Woo, too.

231
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,730
Okay.

232
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,630
   

233
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,320
Yes. I was about to leave.

234
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,580
What?

235
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,280
Is Ga On awake?

236
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,330
Yeah, but he fell asleep again.

237
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,600
He looked for you.

238
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,960
When are you coming?

239
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,360
I'm going to post an apology video

240
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,760
about exposing Yi Hyeon sunbae.

241
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,530
 I'll come after I post that. 

242
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,740
Okay. Be careful.

243
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,550
You were still here.

244
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,720
Yes. Is something the matter?

245
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,840
Regarding instigating Kang's murder Chairman Kim's accident, Ms. Yeom

246
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,660
confessed, saying it was all her doing.

247
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,830
What are you saying?

248
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,450
Where is Mr. Cha?

249
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,080
He'll go to the Prosecutors' Office,

250
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,140
then go to the hospital where Chairman Kim is.

251
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,820
If Kim Tae On is released due to Ms. Yeom's confession,

252
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,390
All we have is locking up Chairman Kim and Ga On in the hospital.

253
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,920
To convince Chairman Kim.

254
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,470
If you want to go to Chairman Kim, I'll take you.

255
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,910
Let's go together.

256
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,300
You did all this?

257
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,590
Yes.

258
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,460
I did it voluntarily for the Director.

259
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,850
How did it go?

260
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,920
The arrested nurse and the guy who tampered with the car.

261
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,030
Ms. Yeom did make contact with them.

262
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,500
    
  If she's released now, 

263
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,780
you don't know what she'll do again.

264
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,880
But as a father...

265
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,720
I can't sell out my child.

266
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,680
How about Ga On?

267
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,810
Ga On is also...

268
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,530
precious to me.

269
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,980
But...

270
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,900
the only person who can protect FB Group

271
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,420
is Tae On.

272
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,700
In order to protect FB,

273
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,370
you'll cover up your daughter's crimes?

274
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,120
I need a place to return to

275
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,420
for me to have a reason to live.

276
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,780
She tried to kill you!

277
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,940
Unless you're that strong and vicious,

278
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,010
you can't protect that position.

279
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,180
I was wondering who Kim Tae On took after.

280
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,610
I guess it was you.

281
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,950
Do you think Ga On would be any different?

282
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,100
Let's go.

283
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,590
Look.

284
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,620
You still must not know your place.

285
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,640
You're...

286
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,500
just a nanny who raised my son

287
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,680
temporarily.

288
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,970
Stop provoking me any longer...

289
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,620
and go away.

290
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Don't you dare mention Ga On's name.

291
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,340
I'll never leave Ga On with someone like you.

292
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,120
It looks...

293
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,410
different from the earlier one.

294
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,700
Your daughter prepared it, especially for you.

295
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,400
Tae On?

296
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,100
Nurse!

297
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,350
Nurse!

298
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,700
Nurse!

299
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,270
Nurse!

300
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,780
   

301
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,550
His doctor ordered to change his fluid.

302
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,240
The fluid?

303
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,870
I see.

304
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,240
You don't need to give him any more fluids.

305
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,700
He's leaving.

306
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,210
He's getting discharged?

307
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,800
Kim Tae On has been released.

308
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,930
Ms. Yeom confessed everything as her doing.

309
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,410
What?

310
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,510
We must take Ga On to a safer place.

311
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,890
Min Joon is taking care of the discharge procedures.

312
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,300
Will you help me?

313
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,820
Yes, sure.

314
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,410
He's ready to go.

315
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,530
Choi asked for a meeting.

316
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,470
I'll go see him.

317
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,100
Please take care of Hae Ra and Ga On.

318
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,190
- Okay. 
 - Sure.

319
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,350
   

320
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,270
   

321
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,830
Yes?

322
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,190
There's a promo saying that Kim Tae On's CEO installation ceremony

323
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,820
will take place this afternoon.

324
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,660
The CEO?

325
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,930
 Yes. 

326
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,360
 And Director Kim Tae On 

327
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,150
requested correction on the news saying

328
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,370
what occurred at the hospital isn't true.

329
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,320
Is there anything we can do about her?

330
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,970
If she's left alone, my Ga On will be...

331
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,470
Let me see if I can come up with a way.

332
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,690
   

333
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,500
Ms. Yeom, should I have worn something fancier?

334
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,370
Ms. Yeom is...

335
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,390
    
 As you mentioned before you enter,

336
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,610
a video of FB Group's beginning and growth featuring the

337
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,460
previous chairman and your mother's accomplishments will be played.

338
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,050
Yes.

339
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,300
Yes.

340
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,100
They started. You can go down now.

341
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,540
 For the last 50 years, the previous Chairman Kim Sun Dong 

342
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,100
 and Ms. Kim Young Sook... 

343
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,900
 have led the efforts to flourish FB Group. 

344
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,490
 Backed by the history of the company... 

345
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,280
 For the next 100 years, 

346
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,050
 our challenge to become a global corporation will continue. 

347
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,960
Our new leader who will lead FB Group into the future.

348
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,300
Let's welcome CEO Kim Tae On to the stage.

349
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,890
   

350
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,820
Congratulations on your installation, CEO Kim Tae On.

351
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,590
But I guess the employees don't feel the same.

352
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,380
Or...

353
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,150
perhaps they don't accept someone like you

354
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,210
as their CEO.

355
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,980
Mr. Nam.

356
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,430
Drag her out of here now.

357
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,130
Kim Tae On.

358
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,020
You're under arrest for instigating Cha Yi Hyeon's murder.

359
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,910
This time, it's instigating Cha Yi Hyeon's murder?

360
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,410
Do you have evidence?

361
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,340
Choi confessed to everything.

362
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,510
You ordered him to kidnap her,

363
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,280
and he threw her into the ocean.

364
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,990
 I heard Director Kim Tae On was released. 

365
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,240
 I haven't given up yet. 

366
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,540
 If you don't... 

367
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,500
 do you have a way? 

368
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,330
 Would it work if I confess now? 

369
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,910
 Instigating a murder is the same as committing murder, right? 

370
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,310
 There is no statute of limitations, right? 

371
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,750
 I threw her over. 

372
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,380
 Your sister, Cha Yi Hyeon. 

373
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,810
 I threw her into the ocean. 

374
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,370
 I saw Cha Yi Hyeon's son... 

375
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,330
 at the nursing hospital. 

376
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,220
 When I saw him, 

377
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:42,070
 I felt guilty about killing Cha Yi Hyeon. 

378
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,780
 I'm sorry. 

379
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,340
 I was wrong. 

380
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,470
It's over for you now.

381
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
Kang Hae Ra...

382
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,990
   

383
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,400
This is all your fault!

384
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,160
Kang Hae Ra!

385
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,080
Min Joon...

386
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,490
Kang Hae Ra...

387
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,880
How dare you butt into my life and ruin me?

388
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,370
You think I'll just take this?

389
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,840
Let go!

390
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,700
- Let go! 
 - Min Joon, stay with me.

391
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,430
Min Joon!

392
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,870
Min Joon!

393
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,810
Noona...

394
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,550
Where did you throw her?

395
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,960
The day after the ferry accident,

396
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,750
off the coast of Gunsan.

397
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,260
Near the motel where Cha Yi Hyeon was staying.

398
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,990
She was talking to someone on a payphone.

399
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,530
 I'm fine. 

400
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,220
 Don't worry too much. 

401
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,010
 I'll call you again. 

402
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,490
 Noona, don't hang up. Noona! Noona! 

403
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,250
Min Joon!

404
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,210
Min Joon, wake up!

405
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,020
Min Joon!

406
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,040
 Are you awake? 

407
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,730
 I just came up with your name. 

408
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,770
 Ga On. 

409
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,920
 What do you think? 

410
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,870
 We're in hiding for now. 

411
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,110
 But when you grow up, my baby... 

412
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,590
 I hope you become someone who is loved by all 

413
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:41,020
 and also love others. 

414
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,680
 And... 

415
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,640
 I wish... 

416
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,880
 you'll pass on... 

417
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,620
 kindness and warmth to others. 

418
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,190
 Ga On. 

419
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,240
 Ga On. 

420
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,370
 Mom! 

421
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,110
Are you ready?

422
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,970
Let me see you.

423
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,700
Shall we go?

424
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,410
Yes, Mom.

425
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,060
All right.

426
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,760
What's this?

427
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,880
Since I'm the office owner,

428
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,440
I thought I'd welcome you.

429
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,270
And for a newspaper CEO desk,

430
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,160
I think orchid should be there.

431
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,760
Thank you.

432
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,100
Make lots of money and open up an office.

433
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,600
I'll buy you a huge planter then.

434
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,310
Okay. I'll do that.

435
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,130
Oh, yeah. Where is Hae Ra?

436
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,280
   

437
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,170
Ga On, say hello.

438
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,190
Hello.

439
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,540
I'm Ga On.

440
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,950
   

441
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,120
This is Ga On.

442
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,700
He's all grown up, huh?

443
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,680
I thought you might want to see him.

444
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,680
The promise I made to you

445
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,800
saying I'll protect him...

446
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,180
I'll keep it to the end.

447
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,660
    
 And...

448
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,740
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

449
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,400
Mom, don't cry.

450
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,000
Let's go see the lawyer ahjussi.

451
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,440
Okay.

452
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,990
   

453
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,760
I guess it was her remains that were discovered.

454
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,300
I think she drifted to where others drowned.

455
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,160
I'm glad they found her remains, at least.

456
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,790
Oh, how is Mr. Cha doing?

457
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,590
Here we are.

458
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,870
When is Ahjussi going to wake up?

459
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,420
I guess he wants to rest more.

460
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,480
I think he rested long enough.

461
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,340
He's had it tough all this time.

462
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,150
He wants to rest longer.

463
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,900
And Ga On.

464
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,600
He's not "ahjussi." He's your uncle.

465
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,180
Can't I just call him "lawyer ahjussi?"

466
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,580
You must be hungry, Ga On.

467
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,570
Let's go after I put the flowers in the vase.

468
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,100
Sit.

469
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,610
Dear God.

470
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,940
Please let lawyer ahjussi

471
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,780
be with my mom and me

472
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,770
at the Gusan building.

473
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:14,830
Please let him wake up soon.

474
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,750
Let your blessings

475
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,780
be with ahjussi.

476
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,690
Amen.

477
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,180
Ahjussi.

478
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,540
Please wake up soon.

479
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,950
You have to wake up so that

480
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:41,720
my mom can smile more than she does now.

481
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,690
You can give it to me.

482
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,060
How did it go?

483
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,340
Kim Tae On claims that she had a mental breakdown during the crime.

484
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,440
She turned in her doctor's report medical record.

485
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,310
That's nonsense.

486
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,490
Prosecutor Jang said he'd do his best to the end.

487
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,120
But I don't think...

488
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,900
Hello.

489
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,490
Mom, I'm hungry.

490
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,720
Okay.

491
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,590
Then I'll see you in court tomorrow.

492
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,780
Call me if anything comes up.

493
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,110
Okay.

494
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,870
Let's go.

495
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,130
   

496
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,990
    
  In a moment... 

497
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,830
FB Life's CEO Kim Tae On's trial will take place here.

498
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:13,380
Kim's lawyers say...

499
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,610
Kim has a history of mental illness in the past

500
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,630
and her symptoms reoccurred during the act of crime.

501
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,630
That she was in a fragile state of mind.

502
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,800
We'll have to see what kind of ruling

503
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,940
the court will make.

504
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,800
Considering the medical certificate submitted by the defendant

505
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,630
and the defendant's state of mind at the time,

506
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,290
due to tremendous stress

507
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,570
with schizophrenia relapse is admissible.

508
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,520
This court...

509
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,320
sentences defendant Kim Tae On to seven years in prison.

510
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,440
   

511
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,450
 That doesn't seem right... 

512
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,550
Unbelievable.

513
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,530
Yes.

514
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,140
Hyung?

515
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,410
What's going on?

516
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,000
Hyung disappeared!

517
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,690
I have to look for him.

518
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,400
You woke up.

519
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,290
A mental breakdown.

520
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,980
Continue to insist on the claim.

521
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:54,300
Chairman Kim recently gave some of his shares to Ga On.

522
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,160
Under the circumstances, I'm his only family.

523
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,430
So I'll be Ga On's guardian.

524
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,700
Chairman Kim is in a coma, and you have

525
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,040
schizophrenia once again.

526
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,030
I'll call for an emergency board meeting

527
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,720
and vote for your dismissal.

528
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,470
While you serve your sentence,

529
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,770
I'll move to start giving FB Group to society.

530
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,590
That means your FB Group

531
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,870
will no longer exist.

532
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,070
Cha Min Joon...

533
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,700
Cha Min Joon!

534
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,440
Hey!

535
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,650
♫  I didn't even say a word of kindness to you  ♫

536
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:39,780
♫  I only hurt your feelings  ♫

537
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:52,500
♫  Even so, you never changed and gave me love   ♫

538
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:56,860
   

539
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,730
♫  How precious you are   ♫

540
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:05,760
♫  I cry thinking of the past  ♫

541
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,900
   

542
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:17,990
♫  I'm sorry, I'm sorry about everything  ♫

543
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,680
Noona...

544
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,370
♫  I made you struggle  ♫

545
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:30,610
♫  Tears are coming down as if to speak for my heart  ♫

546
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,910
Noona...

547
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:40,480
♫  I will only look at you  ♫

548
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:03,090
   

549
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,590
You haven't found him?

550
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:07,740
No.

551
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:12,160
Hyun Sung and I looked through Mr. Cha's old neighborhood.

552
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,600
But we couldn't find him.

553
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,860
No sign of Min Joon yet?

554
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,940
No. I looked everywhere, but I couldn't find him.

555
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:26,080
Where could he be?

556
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,190
I'd like to give you a case, Kang Hae Ra.

557
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:35,590
Hyung.

558
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,030
Once you decide, I'll back you up.

559
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:54,840
I don't think I can decide so easily.

560
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:59,460
I have to see what kind of case it is.

561
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,990
Please give me some time to think it over.

562
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,090
   

563
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,540
   

564
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,000
Hyung, a call from the bereaved family rep. Line 1.

565
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,400
Yes.

566
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,300
I'm reviewing the settlement right now.

567
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,200
I'll call you after I look it over.

568
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,460
Okay.

569
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,680
I'm meeting the bereaved family rep

570
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,420
and FB Life legal team to finalize the agreement.

571
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,450
- I'll call you after. 
 - Okay.

572
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:47,950
And someone is coming in for a secretary interview.

573
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:50,090
If you're okay, hire the person.

574
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,280
Okay.

575
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,080
Don't be picky.

576
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,700
Hyung, is it a woman?

577
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,130
Are you going somewhere?

578
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,360
Yeah, to travel the world.

579
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,070
To travel the world?

580
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,300
By yourself? For how long?

581
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,190
How many days will you be gone?

582
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,470
I'm traveling the world. What do you mean days?

583
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:17,850
Around two years.

584
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,340
Two years?

585
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,740
With whom?

586
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,160
Who are you going with?

587
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,500
Who would I go with? I'm going alone.

588
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,270
It's on my bucket list.

589
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:29,630
You're going to travel alone for two years?

590
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,470
No, you can't. Don't go.

591
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,910
Who are you to tell me not to go? My dad won't even stop me.

592
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,980
Since your dad won't, I will.

593
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,360
Geez, Mr. Goo is so...

594
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,400
inattentive to her daughter.

595
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,620
Are you dissing my dad in front of me?

596
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:46,250
I'm not dissing him.

597
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,110
How about money?

598
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,810
You haven't gotten the building back yet.

599
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:54,620
You have to make money to pay rent.

600
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,770
Ta-da!

601
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,870
I withdrew my installment savings.

602
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,110
I've been saving for ten years to travel the world.

603
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,540
I reached the deadline.

604
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,900
I'll pay rent and pay for my travels with this.

605
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,580
Oh, you have mail. Look there.

606
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:33,930
Sunbae.

607
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:38,740
Did you say two years?

608
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,170
Huh? Yeah.

609
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,870
Go ahead.

610
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,600
What is he saying?

611
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,320
Even if you told me not to go, I was going to.

612
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,200
I got my draft notice.

613
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,570
What?

614
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,900
What in the world?

615
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,830
You didn't serve in the army yet?

616
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,120
Hey, let me see that.

617
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,760
   

618
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,750
Whoa, you really didn't go yet.

619
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,210
Are you happy?

620
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,750
Now that I'm drafted?

621
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,670
No. I mean...

622
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:24,290
If you haven't gone to the army, just go.

623
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,400
Damn it.

624
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,000
Geez.

625
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,000
What's wrong with him?

626
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,870
Hey, are you mad?

627
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:50,850
You go to the army for less than two years.

628
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:54,110
You'll be back in no time. Come on.

629
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,730
♫  This is me, I didn't know it before  ♫

630
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,500
♫  I just went with the flow  ♫

631
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,850
♫  That’s about to stir up trouble  ♫

632
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,020
Are you crazy?

633
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,360
Hey, are you crazy?

634
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,710
Now that you're drafted,

635
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,190
do you want to do that with anyone?

636
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,100
You did it first at that time.

637
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,680
That time?

638
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,710
At the nightclub.

639
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,160
- I was undercover... 
 - My heart was about to burst.

640
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,320
Since then, whenever I see you,

641
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,660
I was going crazy with my nervous heart.

642
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,710
Wait...

643
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:47,990
- why would your heart... 
 - So wait for me.

644
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,270
While I'm in the army, you can travel the world or whatever.

645
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:55,320
Just don't date anyone.

646
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,030
Wait for me.

647
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,370
And this.

648
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,680
If you put it on, I'll assume it's a yes.

649
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,140
If not, I'll assume it's a no.

650

♫  So simple  ♫

651

00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,270

Geez.

661
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:44,630
Going to the army is no big deal.

662
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:46,380
People live there, too.

663
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,670
After you're done, you'll realize time passed quickly.

664
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:50,330
That's not why I'm anxious.

665
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,200
Then why are you so anxious?

666
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,090
Why does it have to be now?

667
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:55,620
Geez.

668
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,550
I haven't done anything yet.

669
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,400
I thought you told her your feelings.

670
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,250
Would she accept me?

671
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:04,840
Well, if I were a woman...

672
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,400
What do you have to show for?

673
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,380
What's wrong with me?

674
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:15,640
Excuse me. I heard you're hiring a secretary.

675
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,680
By chance...

676
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,220
do you work here?

677
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,770
- Yes. You're here for an interview... 
 - Do you have a girlfriend?

678
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,400
- No. 
 - Okay. Pass.

679
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:33,210
- What? 
 - Okay, I'll work here.

680
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:35,090
- Excuse me. 
 - Ah, no.

681
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,800
I don't care for this style anymore.

682
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,260
I had to quit my job all of a sudden, and

683
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,830
my philosophy about my job has changed.

684
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,700
From now on...

685
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,920
I'll work for a company that doesn't break the law.

686
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,370
On top of that,

687
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,940
a colleague who can live without the law

688
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,300
and someone who has a high potential to flirt with me.

689
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,960
Okay!

690
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,430
You pass.

691
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,580
    
 You changed your job quite often.

692
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,850
Twenty places in seven years.

693
00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:11,400
It's one company.

694
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,720
One company.

695
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,070
I worked for seven years.

696
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,790
They just changed their name often.

697
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,260
Oh, I see.

698
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,900
It says, "H Company" and "S Company."

699
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,750
You only put the first letter. What kind of company was it?

700
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,060
H Company stands for Happy Credit.

701
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,280
S Company stands for Saebit Credit Information Company.

702
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,440
The company just changed their name very often.

703
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,650
Well, I have no issues dealing with people and money.

704
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,050
So you don't have to worry about that.

705
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,600
Let's say I'm an expert on financial fraud issues.

706
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,600
You're lucky to have me.

707
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,490
Excuse me?

708
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:45,000
You're my ideal type.

709
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,000
Congrats.

710
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,520
 My heart was about to burst. 

711
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,860
Gosh. Geez!

712
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:03,050
What does he want me to do?

713
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:05,780
Geez, this is nuts.

714
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,390
Why don't you accept his feelings?

715
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:20,280
You're going to travel the world while he's in the army anyway.

716
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,900
Well...

717
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,010
the army isn't the problem.

718
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,290
He and I have a huge age gap.

719
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,580
What are you saying? You're friends.

720
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:30,640
Friends who are twelve years apart.

721
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,200
Geez, you.

722
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,500
Go to sleep. Sleep!

723
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,200
You're terrible. You even have a son.

724
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,500
    
 Confirm the cause of exemption.

725
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,610
Okay.

726
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,460
Ms. Seo.

727
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,110
Photocopy this, please.

728
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,160
Okay.

729
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,530
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

730
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,540
What was it earlier?

731
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:34,170
Ex... exemption cause?

732
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,470
Hello.

733
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,000
Did you want us to look at a case? Have a seat.

734
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,120
    
 Cheers.

735
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,210
Time sure flies.

736
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:19,740
You two are leaving tomorrow.

737
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,650
Are you both ready?

738
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,300
I was already packed.

739
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,080
How about you, Hyun Sung? Did you pack everything you need?

740
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,740
Well, you know.

741
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:32,530
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

742
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,110
Hey, hey. Stop sighing.

743
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:39,360
Geez, I should've just left then.

744
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,980
I shouldn't have postponed another month.

745
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,900
All I heard was his sighs.

746
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,820
This is habitual.

747
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:47,860
If you do that in the army, they'll pick on you.

748
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,860
Was I too harsh?

749
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,470
He must be perturbed as is.

750
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:59,840
Go after him.

751
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,980
Oh, all right.

752
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,690
Kim Hyun Sung.

753
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,730
Are you angry?

754
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:21,810
I'm sorry.

755
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:24,790
I just feel at ease around you.

756
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:29,450
And you did sigh all last month.

757
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:38,070
You have nothing else to say besides that?

758
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:39,840
What?

759
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,130
Be well.

760
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,190
I'll be fine, too.

761
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,350
Wait.

762
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,380
Will this be okay?

763
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:08,280
♫  You protected me while I was struggling  ♫

764
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,280
But do you even know how old I am?

765
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:18,350
♫  Now I will embrace you  ♫

766
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:25,560
♫  Even when I call your name  ♫

767
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:30,510
♫  My heart is trembling  ♫

768
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,330
That's not important.

769
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:34,840
There's only one Goo Eun Hye in this world.

770
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:41,250
♫  So that you can feel my love  ♫

771
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:47,210
♫  I will embrace you  ♫

772
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:55,290
Yes.

773
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:57,400
The testimony is missing?

774
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,320
I'll fax it over.

775
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,780
Okay.

776
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:04,280
I'll go to the office and fax something.

777
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,840
Do Yoon.

778
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,890
Be careful on your way out.

779
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:09,380
What?

780
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,230
You might get hit if you go out now.

781
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,160
I don't think they'll notice me pass by.

782
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:32,790
How long do you think we have to wait for them here?

783
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,430
I'm not sure.

784
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,780
But...

785
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,830
are you going to continue with your work?

786
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,040
It's one thing if I don't get any cases.

787
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,830
But I should as long as I have cases.

788
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:58,100
Had I known you were like this,

789
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,700
I would've never hired you for revenge.

790
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,600
Don't worry.

791
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,740
I am worried...

792
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,190
that I'll worry for the rest of my life.

793
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,400
Then there's only one solution.

794
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,910
For no one to want revenge?

795
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,060
But...

796
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,510
will there be such a day?

797
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,020
Until that day comes,

798
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:38,000
I'll back you up.

799
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:53,550
Did you two talk things over?

800
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,370
Where was my passport?

801
01:00:57,370 --> 01:01:00,140
There's not much to talk about.

802
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:03,200
Gosh, I waited a long time at the end of the hallway.

803
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,370
   

804
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:15,090
Is it a client?

805
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:17,650
Yes.

806
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,280
She's a kindergarten teacher.

807
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,570
She's sure a child is being abused by her adoptive parents.

808
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,560
So she reported them to the police, but

809
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,470
the child went back to the adoptive parents.

810
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:31,400
She was so worried that she went to the child's house.

811
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,500
And she can hear the child crying inside.

812
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,830
Are you going to go now?

813
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:40,940
I think I should go now.

814
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:44,050
For a child like this, a few seconds inside the house

815
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:46,450
could be either life or death.

816
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:47,830
Let's go together then.

817
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:50,980
The adoptive parents could deny or become violent.

818
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:54,240
I'll go with you.

819
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,790
Me, too.

820
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,250
You two are leaving tomorrow. Get some rest.

821
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,930
Min Joon and I can go.

822
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,300
What are you saying?

823
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,780
Hey, I'd rather not go traveling.

824
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:05,990
Same here.

825
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:07,890
I don't think I can leave like this.

826
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,920
Then I'll go to the police.

827
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,860
Then...

828
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,130
let's all go together.

829
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,930
 There are people 

830
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:25,280
 who can't even express pain and injustice. 

831
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,230
 Until the day when these people are loved and respected. 

832
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,820
 Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency is 

833
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,890
 about to prepare a new episode. 

834
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:54,050
♫  I will run as fast as I can  ♫

835
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:57,910
♫  Even though I struggle a hundred times over  ♫

836
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:59,940
♫  There is no despair  ♫

837
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,900
♫  I am staying strong and determined  ♫

838
