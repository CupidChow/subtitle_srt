1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,200
 

2
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,130
 

3
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,730
   

4
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,740
   

5
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,600
 

6
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,510
What the heck?

7
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,630
Why meet at a spot like this?

8
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,820
   

9
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,330
   

10
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,320
Are you on your way to meet Lee Hoon Seok?

11
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,810
It's about Ga On. I should go.

12
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,030
In this situation,

13
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,920
don't you know how dangerous it is to meet him alone?

14
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,340
Kang Hae Ra.

15
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,800
Why don't you...

16
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,440
look after yourself?

17
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,170
   

18
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,110
  The call is not going through. After the beep...  

19
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
    
  you'll be connected to the voicemail.  

20
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,110
 Well? 

21
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,780
 I don't know what I'm capable of at this point.
 

22
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,220
   

23
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,150
Hi, Ga On.

24
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,510
 What's up, Mom? 

25
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,290
I was just wondering if there's anything wrong.

26
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,160
 Something is wrong. 

27
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,360
 I overslept. 

28
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,050
 So I can miss my school bus. 

29
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,300
 Mom, can I call you back after school? 

30
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,030
Yeah, of course.

31
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,170
Ga On, be careful going to school.

32
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,180
 Okay. I'll hang up now. Bye! 

33
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,710
   

34
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,540
Would it be tough to find out Lee Hoon Seok's airline reservation

35
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,010
or whether he left the country?

36
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,150
 That's right. 

37
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,760
Unless there's a warrant out for him.

38
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,600
What's going on with Happy Credit?

39
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,150
Well, it looks like...

40
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,990
things will wrap up by getting those guys who were arrested at the scene.

41
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,370
 But they're all underlings. 

42
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,900
Okay, I got it.

43
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,000
Oh, yeah. I'd like you to get rid of a woman.

44
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,900
Yes, I understand.

45
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,200
Please get rid of Lee Hoon Seok.

46
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,950
You were abandoned by my father,

47
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,670
but I put you in charge of a business.

48
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,570
Why do you think I have you working for me?

49
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,160
Your urgency and desperation in trying to

50
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,550
take care of your children somehow.

51
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,370
That's what moved my heart.

52
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,140
Would I need to keep an employee

53
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,950
who lost his initial focus any longer?

54
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,170
If you give me one more chance...

55
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,800
Where are your kids attending school, Mr. Kang?

56
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,330
In Florida.

57
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,530
In the US.

58
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,220
No wonder you couldn't give up on your side job.

59
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,790
Because of the money.

60
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,020
Ms. Yeon, about two years ago...

61
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,780
wasn't there a shooting incident there?

62
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,460
Well...

63
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,350
It's not that shocking to hear of a shooting in the streets there.

64
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,590
It's so nice there, but there are so many accidents.

65
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,510
Right, Mr. Kang?

66
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,690
My apologies!

67
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,010
This will never happen again!

68
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,250
Please, please give me one more chance.

69
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,730
The old fox isn't even thinking about going into his burrow.

70
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,970
You know, that kind of ruins my mood.

71
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,960
I'm irritated that a hunting dog is running wild

72
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,860
not knowing his place.

73
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,330
 A package that Cha Yi Hyeon sent you 11 years ago. 

74
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,540
 What's this? 

75
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,540
 You have a child, Chairman. 

76
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,400
 I asked my hoobae to take care of him for now. 

77
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,080
 But the child... 

78
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,440
 is yours, Chairman. 

79
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,830
   

80
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,270
    
 Please... 

81
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,500
 find and protect him. 

82
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,790
 Wow, Cha Yi Hyeon had this side to her? 

83
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,550
   

84
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,900
Mr. Ko is here, Chairman.

85
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,150
Okay.

86
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,370
The cellphone number that was in the letter

87
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,390
is not in service.

88
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,130
We're tracking down past owners.

89
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,290
Around the time the package was delivered,

90
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,600
Director Kim was at a law firm in the States.

91
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,010
It's highly likely that Director Kim doesn't know about the child.

92
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,450
Tae On can be a little dense.

93
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,650
Anyway, it's because she was an only child.

94
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,620
What if she had siblings?

95
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,580
You'd have to kiss up to your parents,

96
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,490
being cautious with each other

97
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,300
and compete.

98
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,060
If that happened, she would be incredibly sharp.

99
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,440
   

100
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,460
Hyun Sung, it's time to get up.

101
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,870
 Why don't you... 

102
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,180
 look after yourself?
 

103
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,450
Did you see something you shouldn't have?

104
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,600
Are there still flashers out there nowadays?

105
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,110
No, it was microdust.

106
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,190
There's lots of microdust.

107
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,670
I see.

108
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,420
Hyung.

109
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,580
Kang Hae Ra is meeting Hong Seung Ki this morning.

110
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,090
For her to review on the way,

111
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,940
get the paperwork ready on Mr. Hong's wife.

112
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,980
Okay.

113
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,830
Huh?

114
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,660
Didn't you leave earlier?

115
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,590
I'm supposed to meet a client.

116
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,120
I looked too messy.

117
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,190
I see.

118
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,970
Hey, what's that?

119
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,460
It looks so easy.

120
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,390
I received this request for service via direct message.

121
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,880
- Would you look at it? 
- For our service?

122
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,210
But most of them are marital affairs.

123
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,060
You don't have to take them if you don't want to.

124
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,980
What are you talking about?

125
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,490
Does a professional get choosy?

126
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,050
They must've been very desperate to come to us.

127
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,540
Wow.

128
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,690
Hey, there are quite a few.

129
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,570
Thanks.

130
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,460
Oh, yeah.

131
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,170
Your new client is...

132
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,560
an insurance agent who got sued by the company for rights of indemnity?

133
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,710
Well, not exactly the agent.

134
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,320
- The agent's husband. 
- The husband?

135
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,290
The wife passed away from cancer recently.

136
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,270
I see.

137
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,690
Well, it's not an agent, but

138
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,120
I know someone who went through a similar situation.

139
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,690
Really? Which insurance company?

140
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,750
I'm not sure about that.

141
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,120
Should I find out?

142
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,280
I'd be grateful if you would.

143
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,860
Did you bring it here to review them?

144
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,350
Whoa, working hard.

145
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,400
I think he came to me since

146
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,210
no one would listen to him.

147
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,140
It fits our Revenge Agency episode concept, too.

148
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,860
I don't think this is about increasing the number of views.

149
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,710
I'm glad to see that.

150
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,670
At first,

151
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,810
to relieve the injustice I feel,

152
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,700
I started it since I had no idea how I'd move on.

153
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,550
It's true that I'm empathizing more

154
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,870
with the injustice that the clients feel.

155
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,000
What if I hesitate and it turns out like Jung Woo's case?

156
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,580
It's good that you get to do good work,

157
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,800
and I benefit, too.

158
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,470
On top of that, you get to date.

159
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,320
Date?

160
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,280
I saw you on the rooftop last night.

161
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,590
With Mr. Cha. The two of you.

162
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,510
Gosh, who cares?

163
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,500
It's not like you're having an affair or you're minors.

164
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,800
You only held hands.

165
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,720
Wait. That's because...

166
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,440
of the wound that I have on my arm.

167
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,350
Gosh, that's how it starts!

168
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,290
You start worrying, and that turns into love.

169
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,790
You start at the wrist and little by little...

170
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,350
- My gosh! 
- Hey! Aren't you leaving?

171
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,970
Go if you're leaving. I can't stand it anymore.

172
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,980
Okay.

173
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,590
I'm off.

174
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,410
I wonder how far you'll go...

175
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,710
Good luck!

176
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,680
- My gosh! 
- Geez.

177
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,900
   

178
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,290
   

179
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,340
She was diagnosed with cancer while working for the insurance company.

180
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,500
She had surgery and chemo.

181
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,860
But cancer recurred when she went back to work.

182
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,510
If you compare the date of the diagnosis,

183
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,770
her medical records, and date of her insurance policy,

184
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,880
you'll have an easier time understanding the case.

185
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,930
Okay.

186
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,040
Oh, and this is...

187
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,310
a request for a restraining order form,

188
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,380
so Lee Hoon Seok can't approach Ga On.

189
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,040
If there is evidence of the abuse,

190
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,600
the court will speed it up.

191
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,700
Like a photo or medical records.

192
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,350
Once you get the restraining order,

193
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,310
you can take action in Canada right away.

194
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,730
You don't have to worry about the child.

195
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,740
I'm Hong Seung Ki.

196
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,750
Hi.

197
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,200
I'm Kang Hae Ra.

198
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,030
   

199
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,300
    
These are insurance policies that my wife signed up for

200
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,940
six months before her cancer diagnosis.

201
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,770
But your wife...

202
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,610
signed up for many insurances right around that time.

203
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,250
It's not far from the time she was diagnosed with cancer.

204
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,610
I think the insurance company is making an issue out of this.

205
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,890
You've never sold insurance, right?

206
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,000
When you join an insurance company,

207
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,890
you have no choice but to

208
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,340
sell it to your family and relatives for a while

209
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,550
to raise your performance.

210
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,940
So you even sign up yourself.

211
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,920
I have lots of insurances I signed up right around that time.

212
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,230
And her cancer recurred soon after

213
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,820
the insurance company filed rights of indemnity lawsuit against her.

214
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,480
She should've focused on her treatment.

215
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,160
 At the product training, they said 

216
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,800
  they can sell them as capital protected products. 

217
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,600
 I looked into it. 

218
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,890
 The company says they never trained you that way. 

219
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,940
 When more clients complained about losing their capital... 

220
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 To produce results, you failed to explain it to them. 

221
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,230
 Hello? 

222
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,430
 What? 

223
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,140
 A complaint from the Financial Supervisory Service? 

224
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,770
 Her clients filed complaints at the FSS. 

225
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,850
 So we refunded all the payments. 

226
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,070
 - Honey! 
- We even paid the contract cancellation fees. 

227
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,330
The insurance company filed the right of indemnity against my wife.

228
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,120
But an insurance agent is an employee.

229
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,520
How could they place all the blame on your wife?

230
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,960
Agents don't get any company benefits.

231
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,610
If there are disputes with the client,

232
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,510
the company abandons you

233
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,470
and the clients turn away.

234
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,470
From that point on, you have to fight alone.

235
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,830
On top of that,

236
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,050
they even sued her, saying the policies she signed up

237
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,180
while working there were fraudulent.

238
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,800
By chance...

239
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,250
may I see outpatient medical records

240
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,970
before she signed up for the insurance policies?

241
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,110
She just went to the hospital for the flu.

242
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,250
They're making an issue out of this.

243
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,710
She took a leave of absence for her cancer treatment,

244
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,080
yet they made her take complaints from her clients.

245
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,160
Mommy?

246
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,900
Mommy!

247
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,820
Thank you.

248
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,190
I'm sorry. It's because of me.

249
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,320
We should've met elsewhere.

250
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,370
Gosh, no.

251
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,240
Thank you in advance.

252
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,820
Don't worry too much.

253
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,390
Mother and I will console her.

254
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,630
How old is Eun Ji?

255
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,310
She's six years old.

256
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,640
Before Eun Ji started school,

257
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,070
she wanted to move

258
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,010
to a bigger house and make a study for her.

259
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,970
She wanted to help out

260
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,650
so she joined the insurance company.

261
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,590
Only if I were more capable...

262
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,670
It's unfair that she died this way.

263
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,900
With the right of indemnity lawsuit and

264
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,120
being framed as an insurance fraudster...

265
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,600
I can't let that stand.

266
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,790
But...

267
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,340
if the insurance company

268
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,420
trained saying they're capital protected products,

269
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,970
besides your wife,

270
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,790
aren't there other agents who are victimized?

271
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,360
For the right of indemnity lawsuit,

272
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,760
how about working with them?

273
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,470
Actually...

274
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,110
agents who were similarly victimized

275
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,770
are protesting in front of the FSS building.

276
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,620
- Protest? 
 - Eun Ji! 

277
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,820
 What's wrong with you? 

278
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,160
 Seung Ki! Seung Ki! 

279
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,190
She became weak all of a sudden

280
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,520
and threw up everything she ate.

281
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,420
Gosh.

282
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,720
Eun Ji.

283
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,490
She has a high fever.

284
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,280
Take her to a hospital fast.

285
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,320
I'll go to the FSS building by myself.

286
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,620
Please rush.

287
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,460
    
We'll begin the first half of 2020

288
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,800
Grand Prize Award ceremony.

289
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,160
Before I announce the winners,

290
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,960
Chairman Kim Sang Goo will say a word of congratulations.

291
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,400
A round of applause, please.

292
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,480
   

293
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,270
I'm very well aware

294
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,440
that due to domestic and global matters,

295
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,320
not only business sectors,

296
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,500
but our sales employees

297
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,740
have had a tough year so far.

298
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,780
Despite that,

299
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,250
the reason FB Life had a firm standing

300
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,120
is because...

301
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,870
of our sales team who are

302
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,740
working with passion day and night.

303
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,900
I will never forget that you all are...

304
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,280
our FB Life's true partners for growth

305
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,600
and most important client.

306
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,240
Once again,

307
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,260
thank you so much from the bottom of my heart.

308
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,520
FB Life, drop the lawsuits against the agents!

309
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,280
 Drop the lawsuits! Drop the lawsuits! 

310
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,160
We did what we were told!

311
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,080
The right of indemnity is nonsense!

312
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,830
 Nonsense! Nonsense! 

313
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,440
Withdraw insurance policies that destroy agents!

314
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,380
 Withdraw! Withdraw! 

315
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,770
Managing Director Kim Tae On will award the outstanding employees.

316
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,050
Hello.

317
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,760
Congratulations.

318
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,950
- Here you go. 
- Thank you.

319
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,750
   

320
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,400
Withdraw insurance policies that destroy agents!

321
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,530
 Withdraw! Withdraw! 

322
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,580
 They're protesting? 

323
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,970
 Since when? 

324
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,270
 It's been about three months. 

325
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,810
 FB Life, drop the lawsuits... 

326
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:36,450
 - against the agents!  
- Unbelievable. For three months...

327
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,690
Geez.

328
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,050
- Geez.
- Geez...

329
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,400
As someone working with the law,

330
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,860
don't you know the "Keep to the left" rule?

331
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,420
As of July 1, 2010,

332
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,370
it was changed to "Keep to the right"

333
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,210
for driving and walking.

334
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,960
That's what you're talking about, right?

335
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,660
That's what I mean.

336
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,590
- Keep to the right. 
- Right on.

337
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,620
Geez.

338
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,300
 Can you find some articles on insurance claims and frauds 

339
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,250
 as well as articles on National Assembly Law? 

340
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,720
 If you go to the National Assembly Library, 

341
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,600
 there will be lots of references. 

342
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,000
Geez...

343
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,300
Why did I blurt out "Keep to the left"?

344
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,910
I'm not that old.

345
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,680
Geez, how should I settle the score with him?

346
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,410
Sir, I'll get off here.

347
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,900
I'm here.

348
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,000
Hi, you're here.

349
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,000
How is your hand?

350
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,990
Ta-da!

351
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,540
Ta-da!

352
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,950
It's all healed.

353
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,200
- Your favorite. 
- What is it?

354
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,570
Huh?

355
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,430
Enjoy.

356
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,730
What brings you here without even calling me?

357
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,660
I'll get busy real soon.

358
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,100
Hae Ra gave me jobs that came through the VTube DM.

359
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,250
There's quite a bit.

360
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,240
Then you should rest. Why bother coming here?

361
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,060
I think I'll be energized only if I see you, Dad.

362
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,100
And I have something to ask you, too.

363
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,200
It's okay. Don't give me anymore.

364
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,730
So, what do you want to ask me?

365
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,440
Well...

366
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,410
Do you know the insurance company that sued you?

367
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,120
What company was that?

368
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,990
The case Hae Ra is working on

369
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,400
is a right of indemnity suit with an insurance company.

370
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,500
An insurance company also sued you for the right of indemnity.

371
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,770
I'm sure that the insurance company no longer exists.

372
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,830
There was lots of talk of merging or something.

373
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,300
Really?

374
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,470
I should've asked you after you finished eating.

375
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,470
Eat more.

376
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,920
Please eat more.

377
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,400
 Mr. Goo Sung Chul? 

378
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,610
 We're here to conduct compulsory execution. 

379
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,980
 - Begin. 
- Yes. 

380
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,040
 Excuse me. 

381
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,670
 Dad, what's going on? 

382
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,890
 Who are these people? 

383
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,460
 Dad. 

384
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,400
 What's wrong? 

385
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,090
 Ahjussi. 

386
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,500
   

387
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,470
 Stop drinking. 

388
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,790
 What if you damage your health? 

389
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,460
 What's going on here? 

390
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,610
 How did this happen? 

391
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,800
 I stopped by a warehouse for a case, and there was a fire. 

392
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:25,730
 They said a cigarette butt that I tossed 

393
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,270
 in the area is the cause of that fire. 

394
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,540
 So... 

395
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,420
 All the materials that were in there and the building... 

396
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,720
 The insurance company is asking me 

397
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,690
 for the cost of the damages. 

398
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,780
 They're saying you started that fire? 

399
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,690
 How could that be? 

400
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,520
 Who is it? 

401
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,300
 Who came to you with the case? 

402
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,740
 He should know about this! 

403
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,120
 How will you pay off this much money? 

404
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,150
 Dad. If you feel uneasy telling him, 

405
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,770
 I'll tell him. Please? 

406
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,610
 Dad! 

407
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,400
 What do we do, Dad? 

408
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,260
   

409
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,400
Dad, I put the sushi in the refrigerator.

410
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,880
Make sure you eat it today.

411
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,500
I'm leaving.

412
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,010
I'll call you.

413
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,010
What's next on my schedule?

414
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,870
After the "Sharing Briquettes," Economy Alliance meeting.

415
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,710
I can go to the Sharing Briquettes event alone.

416
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,130
Won't you be too tired if you go there, too?

417
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,380
Wouldn't it look nice if a father and daughter

418
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,010
go to events like that?

419
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,890
I'd be glad if you're okay to go.

420
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,140
It's getting busy now that the year-end is approaching.

421
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,660
It's always like that.

422
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,070
Aigoo...

423
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,590
All right...

424
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,980
Okay.

425
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,420
Please try some.

426
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,310
Thank you.

427
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,330
- A college student? 
- Yes.

428
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,920
- What year? 
- Freshman.

429
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,230
You're working hard.

430
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,110
Not at all.

431
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,010
I'm okay.

432
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,790
What time is the next event?

433
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,670
We should get going now.

434
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,930
I'll wrap up here.

435
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,550
You go ahead, Dad.

436
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,120
Would you?

437
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,740
Let's do that then.

438
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,910
Aigoo...

439
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,340
Who plans things like this?

440
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,890
Initially, this event was in two days.

441
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,200
But Director Kim couldn't make it then.

442
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,280
We can get there on time if we rush.

443
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,460
What's going on?

444
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,520
 One word, please. 

445
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,800
We'll meet about Chairman Kim here for now.

446
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,300
If Kang Hae Ra exposes Hong Seung Ki's wife's

447
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,610
case on her VTube,

448
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,620
for all the insurance frauds that Chairman Kim committed,

449
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,670
I'll file an indictment right away.

450
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,050
This time,

451
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:29,410
I won't let it slide like last time.

452
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,700
   

453
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,600
These are cases that were filed against FB Life in the past five years.

454
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,120
I left out older cases due to the statute of limitation.

455
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,620
Copy them and give them back.

456
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,100
Hyung.

457
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,670
Will you be okay?

458
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,860
I'm already knee-deep in this.

459
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,200
Besides, we have to attack from all sides,

460
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,320
so they're shell-shocked.

461
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,170
For a case like this, victims must unite.

462
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,830
I'll put this file with automobile accidents.

463
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,600
Put warehouse and shipment cases here.

464
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,100
Okay.

465
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,300
Do Yoon.

466
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,450
Yes.

467
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,430
Hyung, we'll go and meet Kang Hae Ra.

468
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,100
Let's go.

469
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,350
- See you. 
- See you.

470
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,700
Hello! Wait! Just a moment!

471
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,000
You're going up to Gusan Agency, right?

472
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,930
Please help me with these.

473
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,230
Mr. Cha.

474
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,500
No, Do Yoon, here.

475
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,660
- What? 
- There's more.

476
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,720
It's heavy.

477
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,410
Be careful.

478
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,800
Okay, let's go up.

479
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,950
Scalpel.

480
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,070
Scalpel.

481
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,500
Gosh, step aside.

482
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,110
I feel like he's staring at me.

483
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,350
Gosh.

484
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,890
Aigoo, I hear this is great...

485
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,710
for lovers starting out.

486
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,510
It's good for your health.

487
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,300
You look so serious.

488
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,680
Hey, they gave you this on top of your pay?

489
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,420
They were about to kill each other.

490
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,290
The woman felt something was up,

491
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,960
but her husband totally denied it.

492
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,200
So she couldn't do anything about it.

493
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,640
But when I gave her the proof,

494
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,080
she felt so relieved.

495
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,700
Of course. Thanks to you, we get to drink this.

496
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,420
Whoa, here you go, Do Yoon.

497
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,920
No, I have to drive.

498
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,490
This is fine for me.

499
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,030
Drink. I'll drive.

500
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,550
It's okay. That makes me feel uncomfortable.

501
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,580
Then, Hae Ra.

502
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:25,880
Pour, pour, pour, pour.

503
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,730
Hey, I'll pour you some for you and Hyun Sung.

504
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,010
Oh, yeah?

505
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,260
Here.

506
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,650
Are you miffed again?

507
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,280
What did I do?

508
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,710
I saw you give me the stink eye.

509
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,760
I didn't.

510
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,790
My eyes are slanted, to begin with.

511
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,180
No wonder. I thought they were.

512
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,690
They're actually not that slanted.

513
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,870
You just said they were.

514
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,520
Have some.

515
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,870
You take it first before it gets cold.

516
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,600
Thank you.

517
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,300
- Give it to me. 
- Okay.

518
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,580
    
  Prime Minister Ahn visited the "Sharing Briquette" event today. 

519
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,250
 He met Managing Director Kim Tae On of FB Life 

520
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,720
 who was volunteering earlier in the day. 

521
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,060
 After volunteering together, 

522
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,410
 they offered warm and comforting words 

523
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,430
 and a message of hope. 

524
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,740
One of the college volunteers at the event

525
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,490
was Prime Minister Ahn's youngest daughter.

526
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,130
Oh, and...

527
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,140
this is President Park from FB Financial.

528
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,550
- FB Financial? 
 - Yes.

529
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,410
Last month and this month,

530
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,310
they're meeting often lately.

531
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,940
What's going on with FB Financial?

532
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,770
Check on FB Financial's equity structure

533
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,890
and Director Kim's shares.

534
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,250
All right.

535
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,570
That's right.

536
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,360
I thought you were quiet lately.

537
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,880
Three months?

538
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,470
They protested for three months,

539
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,320
yet nothing has been done?

540
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,290
Do what for three months?

541
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Earlier today, I met people protesting in front of the FSS.

542
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,900
Since the agents aren't consumers but part of the company,

543
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,810
I'm sure there were some complex issues to deal with them.

544
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:49,850
The disputes with the consumers aren't over yet,

545
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,610
and FSS doesn't give out executive orders.

546
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:57,210
If so, can't they go to the insurance company and protest

547
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,000
since they sued the agents?

548
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,410
That's right!

549
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:03,500
Change the focus of the protest to the insurance policy.

550
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,190
Honestly, I can't understand the fine prints on the insurance contract.

551
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,850
I'm sure the agents are no different.

552
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,010
Those fine prints

553
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,750
fooled not only the clients but also agents.

554
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,400
That's right.

555
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,190
Before they can deceive consumers,

556
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,050
they deceived agents first.

557
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,240
Then are we going to FB Life to protest?

558
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,180
What do you think of the idea?

559
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,570
If we let the public know that there were issues

560
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,080
from the training stage,

561
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,190
wouldn't the insurance company acknowledge their wrongdoing

562
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,160
or suggest a solution?

563
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,330
And what if FB Life

564
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,760
are more forceful with the agents?

565
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:45,000
The fact that they ignored them for three months

566
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,770
means they're waiting until

567
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,500
they exhaust themselves.

568
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,000
Let's not make them suffer longer.

569
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,210
Wouldn't it be better to go head-on?

570
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,850
Do we have to request a permit to protest?

571
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:03,730
Do Yoon, I can get that at the district police station, right?

572
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:04,900
Yes.

573
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,160
If you request a permit to protest,

574
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,450
you can protest after 48 hours.

575
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,820
I see.

576
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,570
There are only 15 people now,

577
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:15,510
but I heard at the beginning of the protest,

578
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,350
there were about 50 people.

579
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,460
They have the same story.

580
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,910
The right of indemnity lawsuits for damages

581
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,500
and interest piling up.

582
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,140
I think we should contact them as well.

583
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,490
We'll look into that part.

584
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,060
Check on that.

585
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,340
Okay.

586
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,690
We have a meeting tomorrow.

587
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,190
We'll get going now.

588
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,820
Already?

589
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,390
If you need anything, let us know anytime.

590
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,300
- Let's go. 
- Okay.

591
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:49,930
Good night.

592
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,050
Did you make them uncomfortable?

593
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,190
What?

594
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,420
During dinner, you were giving Mr. Cha a stink eye

595
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,040
and making Do Yoon uncomfortable.

596
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,320
I did?

597
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,740
I just looked at them.

598
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,810
You said your eyes are slanted.

599
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,830
If so, when you look at people,

600
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:13,780
you should look like this.

601
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,990
Didn't you look at them like this?

602
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,860
Do you know the pettiest thing in the world?

603
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,860
When you're petty with food.

604
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,540
What did I do?

605
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,400
Anyway, you act like a kid.

606
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,250
Geez!

607
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,700
Kang Hae Ra is working hard.

608
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,990
It might get cold in the early morning.

609
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:06,490
Thank you.

610
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,590
Oh, yeah.

611
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:10,840
Did anyone follow you or hang around you

612
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,560
recently?

613
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:17,830
I thought I saw Kang earlier today in the area.

614
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:24,370
That worried me as well.

615
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:26,160
Let's move together from now on.

616
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,090
It's dangerous...

617
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,340
and it's not like you're going around alone filming documentaries.

618
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,540
You need someone to hold the camera during the interview.

619
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,110
Are you good with that?

620
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,290
Sure.

621
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:37,720
I'd love that, but...

622
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,880
do you guys have the time?

623
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,770
You know, I'm busy only at night.

624
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,700
Go down to the office and rest.

625
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,660
Okay. Goodnight.

626
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,070
Is something the matter?

627
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,310
You seem down.

628
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,480
Psychic.

629
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,440
You know how I told you I know someone with a similar case?

630
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,830
That's...

631
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,440
about my dad.

632
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,300
Is that why he lost this building?

633
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,720
Yeah.

634
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,060
I was curious about that.

635
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,890
Mr. Goo owned this building before.

636
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,580
Was it about ten years ago?

637
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,580
When a huge lawsuit landed on him,

638
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:41,170
he lost this building and our house.

639
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:45,930
It took only a moment for that energetic man to crumble.

640
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,910
He has finally settled down,

641
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:52,340
brews coffee, and hangs around people.

642
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,690
But we lived like hell for a while.

643
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,860
We still had a debt to pay off after losing this building.

644
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,550
We recently paid it all off.

645
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,510
He used to get in everyone's business all the time.

646
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,070
But when times got tough,

647
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,710
no one came to help us out.

648
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,340
Even the incident...

649
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,670
He says it was a mistake while working on a case.

650
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,570
But there are no records,

651
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:16,180
and he won't tell me what really happened.

652
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,100
Mr. Goo is an affectionate man.

653
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,350
I envied you for that.

654
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:28,020
For having a dad like him.

655
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,210
Hey, being affectionate...

656
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,690
is no good in life.

657
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:36,780
Why are you laughing?

658
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,700
That "no good" thing about him...

659
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,910
You take after him so much.

660
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,570
Thanks to that, I'm doing well relying on you.

661
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:54,830
Gosh, why did all the old feelings resurface?

662
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,510
I feel bad because I feel like it's my fault.

663
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,140
Why feel bad?

664
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,630
Hey, how could we live laughing all the time?

665
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,370
We have days like this, too.

666
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,730
Gosh, every now and then,

667
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:13,260
you have to bring up things that bother you deep down,

668
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,730
so you can sort them out.

669
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,110
Gosh, I pushed them deep down too much.

670
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,260
   

671
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,340
Ow.

672
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,150
My apologies.

673
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,610
Gosh.

674
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:44,370
Then we'll go there.

675
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:47,040
Including your move to the new protest location,

676
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,950
I wanted to record it.

677
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:50,430
Okay.

678
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,750
They're in front of the FSS?

679
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,880
Yeah, I guess they didn't get the message.

680
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,340
Let's go there.

681
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,010
Okay. I heard you.

682
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,560
Look at him.

683
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:05,080
I was wondering when you'd become useful.

684
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,660
Now, you're starting to be useful.

685
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,690
Stop it.

686
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,810
You can say he's finally becoming human.

687
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,870
- Ouch! 
- Aigoo, aigoo.

688
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,180
- Aigoo. 
- I'm a beginner driver.

689
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,740
Hey, you, you...

690
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,040
Hello.

691
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,960
I meant to tell you about the change of location,

692
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,830
but I was so out of it because of Eun Ji over the weekend.

693
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,480
It's okay.

694
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,900
Oh, yeah. They're my team members.

695
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,760
 Hello. 

696
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,640
I heard. So we're taking off now, right?

697
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,490
Yes, we'll help you.

698
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,020
Thank you.

699
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,670
Just put everything in the car, right?

700
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:42,890
 Yes. 

701
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,750
 Thank you! 

702
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,890
In her car,

703
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,780
there's room for three people.

704
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,900
Two of you ride in Mr. Hong's car,

705
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,170
and go while I interview you.

706
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,770
And the rest of you can take the cab.

707
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:58,450
Okay, then you and I will get in Mr. Hong's car.

708
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,420
You three, ride in her car.

709
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,760
The rest of you can take cabs.

710
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,250
 Okay. 

711
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,700
Come this way.

712
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,600
Use this for your cab fare.

713
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,480
It was my mistake for not relaying the message.

714
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,670
It's okay.

715
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:11,960
We can share.

716
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,470
It's like riding the subway

717
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,780
if the four of us share the cab fare.

718
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,890
That's right. We'll go ahead.

719
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,140
It's okay.

720
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,430
- Let's go. 
- Bye.

721
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,230
- We're off. 
- See you.

722
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,860
Is Eun Ji doing better?

723
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,660
She has acute enteritis.

724
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,780
She's hydrated, so she's hospitalized for a few days.

725
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,640
I had no idea she was so sick.

726
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,610
Kids that age get sick like that.

727
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,580
It's not your fault.

728
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,570
So don't be too upset.

729
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:52,290
Her dad has to stay strong for her to do so.

730
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:55,710
Kids know when their parents are struggling.

731
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:57,190
Okay.

732
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,280
Thank you for everything.

733
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,420
- Open. 
- Okay.

734
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,210
- Open. 
- Yes.

735
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,640
I'll sit in the back

736
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,070
and film while we're on the way.

737
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,460
Do you want to do the interview?

738
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,310
I don't want to. You know I'm not good with words.

739
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:17,890
Then sit in the front.

740
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,190
Aigoo, get in.

741
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,600
Wow, it looks good.

742
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,130
It's snowing.

743
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,660
Isn't this the first snow of the season?

744
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,730
Yeah, you're right.

745
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,520
On a day like today,

746
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,160
we should get snowed on a little bit

747
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,660
and grab a drink in a place with ambiance.

748
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:46,410
Do you want a glass of soju?

749
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:47,830
Why not?

750
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:51,380
Don't you have to go into FB Life today?

751
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,230
I went to a meeting in the morning.

752
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,950
It's snowing.

753
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,770
Oh, my. Isn't this the first snow of the season?

754
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,290
It's the first snow.

755
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,650
Wow, it's so beautiful.

756
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,500
While we eat,

757
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,360
let's see what's going on in the world.

758
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,680
What's the use?

759
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,610
I don't have time to read a newspaper or watch the news these days.

760
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:21,640
Let's listen while we're eating.

761
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:31,060
I think only good things will happen from now on.

762
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,540
I know.

763
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,630
Seeing how the snow is welcoming us,

764
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,500
I think everything will be fine.

765
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,870
Right. Of course.

766
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,070
Aigoo, of course.

767
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,680
Gosh, so pretty.

768
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,060
The light changed.

769
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,840
I'm taking off.

770
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,370
 Breaking news. 

771
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:16,600
 Around 2 p.m., 

772
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,560
    
 at the three-way street in front of Gamyeongdong tunnel, 

773
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,160
    
 a truck slipped in the snowy road 

774
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,980
 and hit a sedan overturning the car. 

775
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:27,120
    
 Because of the accident, the driver Hong, 

776
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,500
 VTuber Kang Hae Ra, and two women in the car  

777
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,120
 were transferred to a nearby hospital for severe injuries. 

778
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,050
 There is heavy traffice due to this accident. 

779
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,450
Hyung!

780
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:46,250
Taxi!

781
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,200
To Hyehyun Hospital, please.

782
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,280
Emergency patient!

783
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,440
- Other patients will arrive soon. 
- Okay.

784
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,960
Please rush in this patient!

785
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,340
Ma'am, can you hear me?

786
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,450
Wake up!

787
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:24,360
Patient!

788
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,140
Sir, I'll get off here.

789
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,360
What's taking them so long?

790
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,200
 Charge 150 joules. 

791
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:14,380
Clear. Shoot!

792
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,720
Charge 200 joules.

793
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,080
- Ready. 
- Clear!

794
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,300
Shoot!

795
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,490
- Her blood pressure is dropping. 
- Charge 200 joules.

796
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:53,300
♫  I'm sorry, I'm sorry about everything  ♫

797
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,900
♫  I couldn't make you smile  ♫

798
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,650
♫  I made you struggle  ♫

799
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:04,400
♫  The tears are coming down as if telling you how I feel  ♫

800
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,160
 

801
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,380
 Nothing is going to change. 

802
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:12,090
 The fact that Chairman Kim harrassed my sister 

803
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,760
 doesn't change. 

804
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,390
 It's tough to tell if the accident was intentional by looking at the 

805
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:18,920
  black box footage from Mr. Hong's car. 

806
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,860
 Eun Hye found out that Kang was involved 

807
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,130
 in Mr. Hong's accident and called me. 

808
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:24,690
 So I asked her to follow him. 

809
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:27,800
 I needed to confirm if he was working for Kim Tae On. 

810
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,240
 What are you going to do with Kang Hae Ra now? 

811
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,650
 I'll make both of them pay for what they did. 

812
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:37,800
 

813
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:46,290
