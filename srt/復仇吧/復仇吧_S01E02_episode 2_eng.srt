1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,910
 

2
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,240
 

3
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,990
 

4
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,630
I knew it.

5
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,470
I knew you'd pretend not to be inside.

6
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,200
I don't need anything. Just get out.

7
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,990
Get out!

8
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,320
I wanted to live in peace 
and just collect rent.

9
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,700
Why did I get such unlucky tenants?

10
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,970
Aigoo...

11
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,010
Here. Get out! Hurry up and get out!

12
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,370
 

13
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,380
I wanted to...

14
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,000
last until...

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,860
my Hae Ra makes it into college.

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,870
What are you saying?

17
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,060
Right?

18
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,080
That's too early, huh?

19
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,880
I should last...

20
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,400
until you get married, huh?

21
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,170
So that...

22
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,120
your in-laws...

23
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,570
wouldn't call you an orphan...

24
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,740
and look down on you.

25
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,160
 Mom... 

26
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,780
 Just because you're alive, 

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,470
 just because I'm not an orphan, 

28
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,730
 it's not like the world treats me like a human. 

29
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,380
You need an advance 
because your mother is ill?

30
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,610
Yes.

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,260
 I think people already know. 

32
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,390
 Whether they can look down
 on a certain person 

33
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,040
 or not. 

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,580
 Whether they can stomp on her 

35
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,400
 or not. 

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,670
Fine.

37
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,360
Sure, why not.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,600
Usually, I never give advance payment to highschoolers like you,

39
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,750
I'll give you special treatment.

40
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,360
Thank you.

41
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,400
 And... 

42
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,780
 those people's generosity... 

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
 always... 

44
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,310
 comes... 

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,150
 at a price. 

46
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,350
- What are you doing? 
 - Stay still!

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,320
Damn...

48
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,140
 

49
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,520
What are you doing?

50
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,060
Why should I go with you?

51
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,300
Hey.

52
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,160
Hey, crap!

53
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,410
 So... 

54
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,150
 - with people like that...  
 - Crap...

55
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,750
 I try harder... 

56
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,600
 not to get stomped on. 

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,400
Aigoo, she could be his daughter.

58
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,600
- What a jerk. 
 - Never mind.

59
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,750
His business is over now.

60
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,370
 How can he try to do such a dirty deed... 

61
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,690
 If anyone tries to trample on me, 

62
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,370
 I'll also... 

63
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,510
 do my very best... 

64
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,140
 to trample them. 

65
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,070
 

66
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,780
Do you get it now?

67
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,100
You got owned by your husband.

68
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,920
 

69
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,930
 

70
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,220
 

71
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,250
Now...

72
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,820
after his group dismantled and working as a reporter,

73
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,010
he used to live on ramen and soju.

74
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,370
After your incident, he spends money like water.

75
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,770
Where do you think he got that money?

76
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,620
 Have a drink. 

77
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,300
 I want to congratulate you. 

78
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,950
An additional payment of 10 million won.

79
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,710
So, should I proceed or not?

80
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,330
If yes, I'll go get that sly bastard and make him fess up.

81
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,940
I got this in New York early this year and paid over $20K.

82
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,370
- If you fail... 
 - Gosh.

83
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,090
Of course, I'll give it back.

84
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,930
Okay, shall we get started?

85
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,900
I'll bring out that sly bastard in ten minutes.

86
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,720
I'll see you then.

87
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,370
Something to lift our mood.

88
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,900
Hey, is he intoxicated?

89
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,600
You could say that.

90
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,440
Hey, wake up. Come on!

91
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,940
Hey. This guy can't wake up.

92
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,780
Okay.

93
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,440
Who the hell are you?

94
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,760
Who are you?

95
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,950
You're damn crazy.

96
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,260
Untie this. Let me loose.

97
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,920
Damn! Untie this!

98
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,820
It's up to you how things will 
turn out from now on.

99
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,520
Who are you?

100
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,960
Why are you doing this?

101
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,190
I heard you asked for more money.

102
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,730
If you got that much money after
 a one-night stand with an ahjumma,

103
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,150
a young guy like you should go and start a small business.

104
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,810
You must've thought you got lucky, huh?

105
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,790
Who ordered you to ask for more money?

106
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,680
Did you plot it with Kang Hae Ra?

107
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,730
Did she tell you to get more money out of him?

108
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,210
Hey.

109
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:37,500
Do you think Kang Hae Ra and a kid like 
you would hold one over me?

110
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,290
"A former idol who took drugs and alcohol...

111
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,370
commits suicide in a motel after his scandal breaks out."

112
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,820
Or "An entertainer K who took drugs

113
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,600
slips into a tub while&gt; drying his hair and

114
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,950
accidentally electrocutes himself." Is that better?

115
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,580
I didn't take advantage of both of them.

116
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,250
Kang Hae Ra didn't tell me to, either.

117
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,690
I never saw that woman ever since that night.

118
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,090
How would I know that?

119
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,860
Maybe you two fell in love afterward.

120
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,480
I didn't sleep with her!

121
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,330
Nothing happened that night.

122
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,500
I just added something in her drink,

123
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,130
and she fainted right away.

124
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,650
I couldn't capture a video.

125
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,390
He said I had to film it like we were having an affair.

126
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,250
So I just took Kang Hae Ra to a hotel.

127
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,290
And the girl in the video is just a friend.

128
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,590
I made her dress in Kang Hae Ra's clothes and shoes.

129
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,370
Why would I believe you?

130
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,710
I can let you confirm it with the girl in the video.

131
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,920
 Help me! 

132
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,390
 Help me! 

133
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,190
 Is anyone out there? 

134
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,700
He's not dead, is he?

135
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,170
I've never met anyone who died of losing his voice.

136
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,640
You're in no position to worry about someone else.

137
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,390
Especially a scumbag like him.

138
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,270
Starting now,

139
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,590
just think about how you'll get 
your husband and that woman.

140
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,180
 

141
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,090
Oh, just a moment.

142
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,470
Oh, my.

143
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,580
Gosh.

144
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,540
Are you okay?

145
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,530
I left something here.

146
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,980
Here it is.

147
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,340
- I'm sorry. I left my wallet behind. 
 - Okay.

148
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,280
- Have a good day. 
 - Thank you.

149
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,190
Oh, yeah...

150
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,980
Here you go.

151
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,580
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

152
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,930
Mission complete.

153
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,970
 

154
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,610
 K works as a reporter on the entertainment show I host. 

155
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,140
 He was hired... 

156
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,240
 by the show producer through an audition. 

157
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,570
 The rumor that he was signed on 

158
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,060
 due to my wife's introduction is not true. 

159
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,390
 I also... 

160
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,890
 found out through the articles 

161
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,840
 that my wife and K have a relationship. 

162
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,860
 Whether that's true or not, 

163
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,080
 I'm extremely sorry that my wife 

164
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
 caused such trouble. 

165
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,400
 
So...

166
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,060
to reflect upon our errors for a while,

167
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,590
I'd like to announce here that

168
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,700
my wife and I will stop working

169
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,860
 on air indefinitely. 

170
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,800
 I offer... 

171
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,380
  my sincere apology. 

172
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,240
Hey.

173
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,000
 

174
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,860
 

175
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,130
 

176
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,910
 

177
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,240
A law firm?

178
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,330
Did you decide how you'll take revenge on him?

179
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,970
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

180
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,200
A hidden camera for a hidden camera.

181
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,120
Where will you post it?

182
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,000
There's one place.

183
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,550
A place where I can get him online live.

184
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,210
Then we just have to wait for them to be on screen together.

185
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,630
Daebak, look at this.

186
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,710
What is it?

187
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,380
Hey, isn't he Lee Hoon Seok?

188
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,570
  
 Daebak. Who's this woman?

189
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,020
I don't think it's Kang Hae Ra.

190
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,940
Hey, I heard Kang Hae Ra created a VTube channel.

191
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,220
It's a revenge channel.

192
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,460
Where? Where?

193
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,420
If you search for Kang Hae Ra on VTube, you'll find it.

194
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,030
Oh? There's one more video.

195
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,020
- She just posted it. 
 - I'm watching it.

196
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,070
Daebak.

197
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,890
What's with Lee Hoon Seok?

198
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,630
 He's Korea's dirtiest trash. 

199
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,640
 
 Whoa, there was Lee Hoon Seok's video? 

200
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,280
 
 So Lee Hoon Seok has been cheating on her. 

201
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,200
 He hired someone to get rid of his wife and is doing that. 

202
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,630
 I didn't sleep with her! 

203
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,430
 Nothing happened that night! 

204
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,620
 

205
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,000
 Wow, the articles are posted online already. 

206
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,900
 Of course. Korea has strong online presence. 

207
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,060
 Shocking! Korea's fav emcee Lee Hoon Seok's secret sex video. 

208
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,480
 Lee Hoon Seok's lover is A-Group's only daughter... 

209
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,990
 Korea's fav emcee Lee Hoon Seok.  
  (T/N: emcee is a master of ceremonies) 

210
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,490
 Will he leave the entertainment world? 

211
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,530
All right. We did it.

212
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,580
The articles are posting.

213
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,620
I sent the link to Issue Patch.

214
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,260
By tomorrow morning...

215
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,910
It's game over before midnight!

216
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,040
 

217
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,760
- Hi. 
  - Hyung. 

218
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,320
Go online right now.

219
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,110
 Articles on Lee Hoon Seok were posted. Hurry up and look. 

220
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,490
I'm looking at it. I'll call you later.

221
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,900
 

222
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,820
 

223
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,630
 

224
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,000
Mr. Kim...

225
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,580
The calls are coming in from

226
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,820
TV stations and newspapers looking for Director.

227
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,310
What should I do?

228
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,940
 

229
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,620
Ms. Kim, give me your cellphone.

230
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,330
 

231
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,390
Wait.

232
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,610
Geez.

233
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,110
Answer it.

234
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,130
It could be urgent.

235
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,180
Yeah?

236
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,550
- Consult Mr. Kim for now... 
  - Director. 

237
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,790
 We're in trouble. 

238
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,530
 You should check the internet right away. 

239
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,690
I can't ignore this topic right now.

240
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,640
Since last night and this morning...

241
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,800
all the internet, VTube, and SNS...

242
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,550
have been going crazy.

243
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,330
In a matter of a few days,

244
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,800
he became Korea's fav emcee to Korea's dirtiest trash.

245
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,320
You know, I'm a man, too. But how could he do that?

246
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,540
Lee Hoon Seok wanted to divorce Kang Hae Ra,

247
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,970
so he hired someone and did all that.

248
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,400
And he came on TV and apologized and what not...

249
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,700
He put on quite a show.

250
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,050
That's what's making the people angry.

251
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,520
But you know, what's more shocking is

252
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,280
how Kang Hae Ra brought all these things to light.

253
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,670
 Didn't you know? 

254
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,550
 Kang Hae Ra used to be a great reporter in the past. 

255
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,550
 I see. 

256
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:28,610
 She used to host her own entertainment report show. 

257
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,860
Is this radio?

258
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,240
No, it's a podcast.

259
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,610
That's good then.

260
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,530
Kim Tae On and Kang Hae Ra.

261
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,510
Do you think it's a coincidence?

262
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,330
I'm not sure.

263
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,490
I guess we'll see how it turns out.

264
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,270
 

265
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,380
 

266
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,610
Look at these guys.

267
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,170
 We cannot trust FB Life anymore! 

268
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,390
  
 Resign! Resign! 

269
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,440
Managing Director Kim Tae On should resign!

270
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,780
 Resign! Resign! 

271
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,430
 Chairman is here. 

272
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,650
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

273
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,970
You were working.

274
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,650
All right.

275
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,550
Okay...

276
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,460
Use this tea.

277
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,010
I got some very nice tea. Try some.

278
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,610
Teas are all pretty much the same.

279
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,500
What brings you here out of the blue?

280
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,560
Well...

281
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,060
I was curious to know how things were going.

282
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:21,730
My only daughter is working on a huge project.

283
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,080
As a father, I didn't want to just sit back and watch.

284
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,700
I was wondering if you needed any help.

285
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,200
You don't have to worry.

286
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,410
The project that J &amp; Cell is working on

287
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,410
has been approved by KFDA.

288
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,570
Our board of directors has approved as well.

289
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,600
If there aren't any issues, it will wrap up this month.

290
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,170
I see. That's good.

291
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,470
The board of directors has high hopes for you with this project.

292
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,220
I feel the same way.

293
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,390
If you finish this project successfully,

294
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,620
I think I'll leave it all to you and go on a cruise.

295
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,720
That'd be so nice.

296
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,640
That's a great idea.

297
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,730
Try some.

298
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,320
Oh, yeah.

299
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,280
There's quite a commotion in front of our building.

300
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,950
I know.

301
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,510
I don't know why they're doing that here.

302
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,830
Just because I look like her, they won't let it go.

303
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,550
Maybe I need to tattoo my name on my forehead.

304
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,710
So I'll take a firm stance as a company this time.

305
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,310
Yeah, right.

306
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,900
Mosquitos that buzz around early in the evening

307
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,980
should be killed before the sun goes down.

308
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,670
Or else they'll keep you up all night.

309
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,300
All right, I'll get going now.

310
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,280
Thanks for the tea...

311
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,050
but it's not for me.

312
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,510
It's too bland.

313
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,000
Sneaky old man.

314
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,940
Lee Hoon Seok is on the phone.

315
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,630
What did you do without even discussing it with me?

316
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,170
I told you.

317
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,850
You had agreed, too.

318
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,620
Then you should've handled it better!

319
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,950
 I have nothing to do with this. 

320
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,820
 You know I'm not doing this for myself, right? 

321
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,700
When people find out that

322
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,110
you were involved with the FB Group heiress,

323
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,980
who do you think they'll criticize?

324
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,790
Think carefully.

325
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,670
Damn it!

326
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,160
Crap.

327
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,800
 He's here! 

328
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,120
 He's here! 

329
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,240
What the hell?

330
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,640
 Hey, here! 

331
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,350
You crazy bastards!

332
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,870
Move!

333
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,420
Hell!

334
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,200
Call the police on them.

335
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,220
What?

336
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,030
Call the police on all those bastards out there!

337
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,570
That's not important right now.

338
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,710
The advertisers want to cancel the contracts,

339
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,330
and they're asking for compensations

340
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,310
for damages and ruining their image and products.

341
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,670
I got a call from China, too, this morning.

342
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,260
They're canceling the project we were working on together.

343
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,400
- Anyway, the biggest issue is... 
 - Kang Hae Ra...

344
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,500
Report her to the police.

345
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,540
What?

346
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,460
Hey, didn't you hear me?

347
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,500
Report that witch Kang Hae Ra to the police!

348
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,940
And...

349
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,810
call Attorney Lim right now

350
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,270
and tell him to figure out all the damages

351
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,400
my company and I suffered through this.

352
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,890
The maximum amount.

353
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,550
The maximum, damn it!

354
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,900
Yes.

355
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,490
Kang Hae Ra...

356
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,400
How dare you...

357
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,330
Hyung, here.

358
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,590
They're articles and replies.

359
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,320
 

360
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,970
 

361
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,090
She'll need a lawyer soon.

362
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,400
Where is she staying right now?

363
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,250
Cheers!

364
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,400
I told you to get out of the country.

365
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,780
Why should I?

366
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,110
Would you be okay? I don't think he'll stay put.

367
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,530
Can you afford a lawyer?

368
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,110
Well, for now...

369
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,210
I'll fight as far as I can,

370
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,570
and I'll just have to go to jail.

371
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,130
You're kidding, right?

372
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,680
It's the same. Out here or in jail.

373
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,940
Hey.

374
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,060
But I feel great, though.

375
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,300
With this feeling, it won't be too bad to go to jail.

376
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,090
How about your son?

377
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,510
For my Ga On, I thought...

378
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,330
nothing would be worse than having a mom

379
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:38,120
who is labeled a divorcée who committed infidelity.

380
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,620
But an ex-convict of a mom?

381
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,780
Actually, up until a few days ago,

382
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,710
I wondered why you sent away a child overseas.

383
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,090
But I think you had the foresight and did the right thing.

384
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,790
What if he was in Korea in this situation?

385
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,800
The reporters would go to his school and cause chaos.

386
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,280
You're right.

387
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,720
If I had let him go through that,

388
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:12,060
I'm not even a mom.

389
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,760
Open.

390
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,180
Open it!

391
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,590
When I open this door,

392
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,820
you two are dead.

393
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,330
Open!

394
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,800
Open it!

395
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,980
Damn it!

396
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,720
Put it away.

397
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,820
You'll need it in the future.

398
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,970
You won't find work any time soon.

399
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,370
It's okay.

400
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,840
This is enough for me.

401
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,560
While working on a good project for the first time in a while,

402
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,760
I realized what I need to do in the future.

403
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,110
Gosh, I think I'm perfect for this work.

404
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,600
Hey.

405
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,850
You made sure you won't get mixed up in this, right?

406
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,390
- Gosh, well, you know. 
 - The hotel CCTV?

407
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,000
I have a connection there.

408
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,530
Now.

409
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,170
 You have to finish in ten minutes. 

410
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,360
Okay.

411
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,840
Mission complete.

412
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,130
Okay.

413
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,350
 

414
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,880
Gosh, it's okay. No need between us.

415
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,380
I've been staring at the screen all the time.

416
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,810
I got to do something so thrilling.

417
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,550
Call me if anything comes up.

418
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,890
No.

419
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,670
Guys like him deserve it.

420
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,260
If you need my help next time, call me anytime.

421
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,100
Okay.

422
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,270
What?

423
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,690
Geez.

424
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,720
Excuse me.

425
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,690
A 10,000 won bill doesn't work on that.

426
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,230
Oh, really?

427
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,280
Geez, I don't have any change.

428
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,010
Do you have any change?

429
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,600
- Here you go. 
 - Okay.

430
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,950
  
 Here.

431
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,980
It's okay.

432
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,430
Just keep it.

433
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,180
What?

434
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,700
Something great happened for me today.

435
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,920
Just think that you lucked out,

436
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,610
and it's worth 500 won.

437
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,090
Ms. Kang Hae Ra!

438
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,100
Kang Hae Ra, you need to come with us.

439
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,200
Let's go.

440
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,620
  
 Why do you keep repeating yourself?

441
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,170
I did post it online out of anger,

442
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,690
but I didn't film it.

443
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,230
I received that video.

444
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,510
Do you have any proof that I filmed that?

445
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,800
They could've filmed it themselves, and it was leaked.

446
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,860
Let's say you didn't film that.

447
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,820
You're guilty of a crime just for spreading it online.

448
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,930
The two victims are suing you for defamation.

449
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,680
The compensations for damages are enormous.

450
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,820
For illegal recording,

451
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,100
in the case of the hidden camera crimes,

452
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,900
according to the Sexual Violence Punishment Act,

453
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,510
under Article 14,

454
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,380
she can get up to seven years in prison

455
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,450
or fined up to 50 million won.

456
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,600
Then we'll also sue Lee Hoon Seok and the woman.

457
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,150
Who are you?

458
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,490
I'm Kang Hae Ra's attorney.

459
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,840
Kang Hae Ra is really the victim of 
the hidden camera and its spread.

460
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,790
Under Article 14 of the Sexual Violence Punishment Act,

461
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,830
the crimes committed by using cameras,

462
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:28,520
defamation by spreading false information,

463
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,930
and...

464
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,430
 

465
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,760
 I just added something in her drink, 

466
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,570
 and she fainted right away. 

467
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,390
To fabricate the situation,

468
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,040
they forced psychotropic drug on my client.

469
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:49,680
Should I file this complaint with 
the drug enforcement administration?

470
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,540
I...

471
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,230
never hired you as my attorney.

472
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,260
- And I can't afford... 
 - I got paid earlier.

473
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,100
Just now, at the vending machine.

474
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,280
I really needed to drink coffee then.

475
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,570
Just think that you lucked out,

476
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,810
and it's worth 500 won.

477
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,720
Can you deal with all those people alone?

478
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,040
 Oh, they're coming! 

479
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,260
 Take pictures! 

480
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,550
Did Lee Hoon Seok sue you?

481
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,480
- What did you say to the police? 
 - I'll let you know soon.

482
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,250
 Will you sue them as well? 

483
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,610
 Say a word, please! 

484
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,410
 One word, please! 

485
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,240
 Say something! 

486
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,460
 Stand back! 

487
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,580
Who are you?

488
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,170
I thought I told you I'm a lawyer.

489
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,710
How did you know to come here?

490
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,500
It's my office.

491
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:32,340
 

492
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,030
 

493
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,400
 Security cleared. 

494
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,360
Please come in.

495
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,330
- But... 
 - How did I know to come?

496
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,930
You're all over TV these days.

497
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:24,100
I saw what you posted on VTube.

498
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,680
But the video you exposed...

499
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,060
has lots of legal issues, although it made you feel great.

500
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,770
If left alone, you'd be rotting in jail for seven years maximum

501
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,650
as that lawyer said.

502
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,100
With an enormous amount of compensation on top of that.

503
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,690
Thank you for your help,

504
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,710
but I don't think it's any of your business.

505
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,840
As I mentioned,

506
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,930
in my line of work,

507
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,880
I meet many scumbags with money.

508
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,170
My job involves helping them

509
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,270
return to our society by legal means.

510
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,350
At one point, I felt things were unfair

511
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,470
but all I knew were using my fists.

512
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,290
I was one of the weak.

513
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,280
I realized then that...

514
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,780
I need power if I don't want to be taken advantage of.

515
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,550
And that power...

516
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,400
comes from money.

517
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,760
Fortunately, I became a lawyer,

518
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,310
and I made enough money as a result.

519
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,190
But at some point,

520
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,960
I started feeling ashamed.

521
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,380
Then you should offer your service pro bono.

522
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,850
There are limits to judging by the law.

523
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,100
So I'd like to...

524
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,350
acquire your service.

525
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,400
Please continue with that revenge channel.

526
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,990
I'll back you up.

527
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,090
What?

528
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:31,120
He asked you to take revenge for the

529
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,260
women his past clients wronged?

530
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,480
- Yeah. 
 - What the heck?

531
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,230
He gets paid for winning the cases for his clients,

532
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,450
and he helps out poor victims behind their backs?

533
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,840
Does he want to play Robin Hood?

534
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,550
Who knows.

535
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,600
And?

536
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,370
Gosh, did you tell him you would?

537
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,740
If you take that on,

538
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,760
Kang Hae Ra...

539
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,260
You can call it Revenge Agency.

540
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,060
Revenge Agency?

541
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,390
You provide revenge services.

542
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,340
Revenge plus private investigative agency.

543
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,660
Revenge Agency.

544
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,730
Going somewhere?

545
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,240
I'm going home.

546
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,660
Home?

547
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,200
That study dorm?

548
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,180
Hold it.

549
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,220
Watch out.

550
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,520
Over there.

551
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,070
After you left like that...

552
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,610
I couldn't sleep.

553
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,930
I couldn't sleep because I was worried about you.

554
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,450
So I went to the studio dorm.

555
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,810
 

556
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,420
Excuse me, I'm Hae Ra's sister.

557
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,920
Is she in?

558
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:42,450
I'm glad you're here.

559
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:43,980
Oh, okay.

560
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,000
Here.

561
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,580
I put the entire month's fee.

562
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,800
Please tell her to leave.

563
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,230
I don't think she even unpacked.

564
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,400
The detectives and reports keep coming for her.

565
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,000
They're bothering other residents tremendously.

566
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,720
Wait...

567
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,750
Everyone's sensitive with exams coming up.

568
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,040
Well...

569
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,540
Take it.

570
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,640
I'm sorry.

571
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,570
Geez...

572
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,210
 

573
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,610
I don't think you can go back there.

574
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,850
You can stay here for a few days if you'd like.

575
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:40,310
My rooftop place is better than that study dorm.

576
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:44,220
I shouldn't have gone and say I'm your sister.

577
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,690
I think that's why you have to leave...

578
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,270
I feel bad about that.

579
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,710
Hyung.

580
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,320
Do you think she'll do it?

581
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,480
I'm not sure.

582
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,810
In any case, she has to

583
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,000
continue to meet with us.

584
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:18,910
 

585
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,340
 

586
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,000
Please review this and let me know.

587
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,640
If we go to court,

588
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,650
we're at a disadvantage.

589
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,170
How are you?

590
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:09,900
I won't beat around the bush.

591
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,670
Please reconsider me for the show.

592
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,060
We prepared this program...

593
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,850
from the initial planning process through casting.

594
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,500
We have plenty of time until it broadcasts.

595
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,120
And the latest scandal...

596
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,430
everyone knows I didn't do anything wrong.

597
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:29,190
I can't let go of everything when I'm not at fault.

598
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,950
From our point of view,

599
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:34,160
everyone agrees that it's still too early for your return.

600
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,730
As you said, it's not your fault.

601
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,830
People are very interested in you.

602
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,270
So it would be effective in promoting the program.

603
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,900
But...

604
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:47,940
the TV station is chaotic because of Hoon Seok.

605
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,390
Already three programs want to get rid of him.

606
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:52,590
While all that's going on, no one can

607
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,600
bring you up to the president and director.

608
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,430
I'm sure it's not just us

609
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:58,760
but same with everywhere else.

610
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,140
Hi, my son.

611
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,370
  
  Mom, are you okay? 

612
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,740
What do you mean?

613
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,000
Can't you tell?

614
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,990
I'm perfectly fine.

615
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,020
 Should I stay by your side? 

616
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:57,090
I'm all right.

617
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,630
 I saw the articles. 

618
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:02,050
Ga On...

619
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,260
You know that...

620
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,980
those articles exaggerate the facts, right?

621
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,030
I'm doing fine.

622
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,440
Ga On, don't you worry about all that.

623
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,570
Have fun playing and eat well.

624
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,650
And when you have time,

625
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,500
try studying a little bit.

626
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,070
Just do that.

627
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,770
 But still... 

628
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,220
 If you can't work on TV, how about money? 

629
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,980
My gosh.

630
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,440
I told you kids shouldn't worry about money, right?

631
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,280
Adults should worry about money.

632
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,740
I have lots of job offers.

633
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,920
  
 I'm getting a call for a job as we speak.

634
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,460
I have to answer this call.

635
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:43,780
 Mom. 

636
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,680
 If something happens, you have to call me. 

637
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,160
I'll be fine.

638
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,660
Don't worry about me.

639
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,380
I love you, son.

640
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,220
 I love you, too. 

641
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,490
Hello?

642
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,030
Daebak.

643
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,640
I was on your Revenge Channel just now.

644
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,790
You already have 500K subscribers.

645
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,040
Over a million views on your posts.

646
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,510
They're asking when you'll post the next video.

647
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:21,660
Hey, you should just be a VTuber.

648
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,020
Hey, I'm getting a call.

649
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,860
Hang up for now, and I'll see you later.

650
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,310
 

651
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,130
 

652
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:43,680
 

653
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,620
Yes?

654
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:55,440
  
 Drop the charges?

655
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,910
Your lawyer...

656
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:59,370
I felt it that night, but I guess he's really good.

657
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,810
Lee Hoon Seok's lawyer is tough, too.

658
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:03,410
Anyway, they dropped the charges,

659
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:04,660
so you're free to go.

660
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,920
I don't know how he handled the prosecution.

661
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,300
Did you make up your mind?

662
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:19,310
He seems like a tough one.

663
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:23,510
Of all people, why a VTuber?

664
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,900
Of all people?

665
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:28,380
Are you hesitant about doing the exposing,

666
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,740
or is being a VTuber a problem for you?

667
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,560
The fact that a VTuber is doing the exposing.

668
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,250
That's unexpected.

669
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,600
The fact that it's a problem,

670
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,500
considering you're a former reporter

671
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,620
and seeing the most recent incident.

672
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:48,250
You don't wrap things the same way.

673
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,050
 When you wrap something, 

674
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:53,160
 people expect more if it's fancy and luxurious. 

675
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,820
Although it's the same type of exposure,

676
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,730
people will have different attitudes

677
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,920
of acceptance from a reporter versus a VTuber.

678
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,680
On top of that, if it's a man of this caliber,

679
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,970
it could end up as a small gossip.

680
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,590
Did you feel that way

681
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,090
when you exposed your incident?

682
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,360
Do you think people saw only your outer shell

683
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,070
and heard what you had to say?

684
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:22,050
The desperation for the truth,

685
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,000
and the new channel

686
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,980
you used to reveal that desperation.

687
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,270
I liked your resolve at the time

688
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,130
and your method.

689
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:32,900
If you want to play dress-up and act elegantly

690
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,480
as you did as Lee Hoon Seok's wife,

691
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:39,260
I'll forget about this work.

692
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,220
At the moment, whether it's working as a reporter or a VTuber,

693
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,950
I'm not in a position to be choosy.

694
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,560
I haven't given up on making a comeback on television.

695
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,090
So working as a VTuber until then

696
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,640
is not a bad idea.

697
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,780
But...

698
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,660
I can't easily make up my mind.

699
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,380
Please give me some time.

700
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,990
As long as you need.

701
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,450
Please think it through

702
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,770
and let me know when you decide.

703
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,360
 

704
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:40,140
Why? Things didn't go over well?

705
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,130
What's this?

706
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,460
 

707
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:49,090
Now that you said yes, is he asking for something ridiculous?

708
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,700
No.

709
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:53,570
I can't make up my mind.

710
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,590
I'm not sincerely putting myself in the victim's shoes

711
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,710
and taking on their case,

712
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,090
but since I can't be on TV anymore...

713
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:03,490
I have no choice but to become a VTuber

714
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:04,810
to expose ordinary people's cases

715
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,940
and not even celebrities'. I'm not sure if that's right.

716
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,890
For my benefit,

717
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,280
I feel like I'd be using the victim's struggles.

718
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,640
I guess you can feel that way.

719
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,460
On top of that, pieces of evidence aren't firm.

720
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,800
I don't know if people would be interested.

721
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,750
That's too much pressure.

722
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,290
At this moment,

723
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,930
if some morning show called

724
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:30,990
and said there's an opening for a reporter,

725
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:32,680
I'd take that.

726
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,540
When my life is in shambles,

727
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,520
it's too mind-boggling to look at other people's lives.

728
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:45,520
Gosh, what the heck? It's all that bastard Lee Hoon Seok's fault.

729
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:49,420
Just do whatever you want. That's your answer.

730
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,730
 

731
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:30,770
 

732
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,510
 

733
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,560
 

734
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,650
- Yes? 
  - Unni... 

735
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,300
I was going to let this go, but...

736
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,510
this seems so wrong.

737
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:55,590
 

738
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:16,240
 

739
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:19,500
- Hyung, Kang Hae Ra... 
 - I know.

740
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,660
 

741
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,530
TV station director has no power these days.

742
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,890
  
 You know how it is.

743
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,680
Yeah.

744
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,050
You can't barge in like this.

745
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:44,530
If you continue this,

746
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:47,150
I'll request for a broadcast's suspension.

747
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:54,060
Are you going to let her be?

748
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,080
No.

749
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,570
For her to do better at what she's good at,

750
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,740
I'll put her on higher ground.

751
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,380
I have to strengthen her power

752
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,850
so I can order her to hunt.

753
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,640
I think Kang Hae Ra will be our shortcut to our plan.

754
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,920
 

755
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,550
The problem is that...

756
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:33,270
she'll have many more enemies.

757
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:37,850
 

758
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,600
 That's what Kang Hae Ra... 

759
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:13,070
 will get back from those she trampled. 

760
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,820
The weight of the cross.

761
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:33,800
♫  Can't you hear my heart 
that is covered with pain?  ♫

762
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:42,500
♫  I don't even remember the moment 
we were in love anymore  ♫

763
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,980
 

764
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,000
    
 She might be of help to you by your side. 

765
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,660
 What are you trying to do? 

766
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,850
 You should've never butted into my life to begin with. 

767
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,270
 It's this guy? 

768
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:59,000
 Please take revenge on the bastard who did that to my girl. 

769
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:02,670
 You knew everything when you gave me that case, right? 

770
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,230
 Find out about Kang Hae Ra and her son. 

771
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:07,530
 You should trample on them once and for all. 

772
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:08,660
 Hae Ra! 

773
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,220
 I have to let people know. 

774
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,660
 The ugly and dirty bare face. 

775
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,010
 

776
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:24,500
