1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:06,940
 

2
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,870
 

3
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,160
 
  If you put this on, it will take care of the dryness. 

4
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,530
 
 Kang Hae Ra received the award for the Power Influencer. 

5
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,790
 
 "Unceasing Life" placed... 

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,900
 A reporter, a wife, an influencer, and now an author. 

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,390
 All the books in the bookstore are sold out. 

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,700
 - Your name? 
- It's Kim Hyun Sung. 

9
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,970
 Cheers. 

10
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,290
 One more glass? 

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,420
 What happened, Kang Hae Ra!  

12
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,160
 Please tell us! 

13
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,580
 

14
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,640
 Do you think we run on nothing? 

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,870
 We lost more than the first half a year's sale because of you. 

16
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,050
 I'm selling the house. 

17
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,970
 Move your stuff today. 

18
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,750
 I know you're in there. 

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,330
 Hurry up and come out! 

20
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,230
 Hurry up! 

21
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,340
 I moved in last night. 

22
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,750
 Hae Ra! Hae Ra! 

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,030
 Kang Hae Ra! 

24
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,620
 Is it true you've had aninappropriate relationship with 

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,940
 a former idol reporter ten years younger? 

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,560
 Is this me? 

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,230
 
 He asked me to give it to you. 

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,510
 

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,080
 
  Are you okay? 

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,310
 Call me whenever if you need my help. 

31
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,090
 You got owned by your husband. 

32
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,110
 Why would he meet Kim Hyun Sung and your husband at the same time? 

33
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,180
 What for? 

34
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,840
 I didn't sleep with her! 

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,310
 He said I had to film it like we were having an affair. 

36
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,990
 Korea's fav emcee Lee Hoon Seok. 

37
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,180
 Slept around with tons of women. 

38
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,840
 A scumbag who beats up his wife. 

39
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,160
 Wow, the articles are posted online already. 

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,940
 Of course. Korea has strong online presence. 

41
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,550
 You crazy bastards! 

42
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,250
 Move! 

43
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,050
 You're guilty of a crime just for spreading it online. 

44
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,100
 The two victims are suing you for defamation. 

45
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,430
 Then we'll also sue Lee Hoon Seok and the woman. 

46
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,350
 Who are you? 

47
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,630
 I'm Kang Hae Ra's attorney. 

48
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,670
 Kang Hae Ra is really the victim of the hidden camera and its spread. 

49
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,260
 Defamation by spreading false information 

50
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,290
 and... 

51
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,820
 I just added something in her drink, 

52
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,600
 they forced psychotropic drug on my client. 

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,690
 Should I file this complaint with the drug enforcement administration? 

54
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,050
 So I'd like to acquire your service. 

55
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,600
 Please continue with that revenge channel. 

56
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,360
 I was going to let this go, but... 

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,560
 this seems so wrong. 

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,580
 Are you going to let her be? 

59
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,000
 That's what Kang Hae Ra... 

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,360
 will get back from those she trampled. 

61
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
 The weight of the cross. 

62
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,970
 

63
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,890
- Can I make a call? 
- Aigoo.

64
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,270
That's too much money.

65
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,370
Go ahead.

66
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,100
Lieutenant Cha Min Joon speaking.

67
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,160
 Min Joon! 

68
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,750
 I'm near a warehouse in Gunsan. 

69
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,010
If...

70
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,200
If something happens to me...

71
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,590
Noona.

72
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,990
Noona?

73
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,760
 Hey, hello? 

74
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,860
A woman just called me...

75
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,990
The young woman's husband...

76
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,560
just took her.

77
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,830
- What?
  - I think they fought. 

78
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,050
I think they had a huge fight.

79
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,740
 Min Joon, help me! 

80
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,090
 As the first broadcaster currently on air, 

81
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,290
 I'm on site to meet  

82
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,700
 entertainer Cha Yi Hyeon who is shrouded in 

83
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,200
 prostitution scandal.  

84
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,420
 
  According to a financial record provided by the source  

85
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,000
 who is an executive at an agency, 

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,060
 whenever Cha Yi Hyeon visited this location, 

87
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,730
 a large amount of around 10 million won 

88
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,180
 was confirmed to be deposited into her account. 

89
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,730
What's going on?

90
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,180
 

91
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,080
I can't make up my mind.

92
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm not sincerely putting myself in the victim's shoes

93
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,980
and taking on their case,

94
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,490
but since I can't be on TV anymore...

95
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,940
I have no choice but to become a VTuber

96
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,660
to expose ordinary people's cases

97
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,480
and not even celebrities'. I'm not sure if that's right.

98
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,670
I feel like I'd be using the victim's struggles for my benefit.

99
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,560
I guess you can feel that way.

100
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,220
And...

101
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,920
The defendant's image has been positive.

102
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,400
But by exposing without firm evidence...

103
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,950
I don't know if people would be interested.

104
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,890
That's too much pressure.

105
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,550
At this moment,

106
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,130
if some morning show called

107
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,220
and said there's an opening for a reporter,

108
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
I'd take that.

109
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,390
When my life is in shambles,

110
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,740
it's too mind-boggling to look at other people's lives.

111
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,730
Gosh, what the heck? It's all that bastard Lee Hoon Seok's fault.

112
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,100
Just do whatever you want. That's your answer.

113
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,780
Yes?

114
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,260
It's already that time?

115
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,300
Nothing has changed.

116
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,060
I'll call you after I make the deposit.

117
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,380
Yes, thank you.

118
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,240
 

119
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,490
What's wrong?

120
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,260
Where are you going?

121
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,420
Hey, get in.

122
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,820
Do you even know how much this car is worth?

123
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,430
I know. That's why I'm offering you that price.

124
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,190
And everyone thinks about cost-effectiveness now.

125
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,010
Even if I purchase this car,

126
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,560
I can't sell it quickly enough.

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,150
You'll get the same result elsewhere.

128
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,490
If you want to get a better price,

129
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,430
post it on a used car site and sell it yourself.

130
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,600
That's why we're here. To sell it right away.

131
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,440
Sir, don't be like that and just give us 5 million won more.

132
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,130
5 million won?

133
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,310
Aigoo.

134
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,990
If you don't want to, I'll post it on a club site.

135
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,650
Even if I add 10 million won to your price,

136
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,400
I'll have ten people lined up right away.

137
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,500
Hey, what should I do?

138
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,560
A friend of mine is the chairman of this car's fan club.

139
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,880
Should I call him?

140
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,640
 
 Gosh, so hard...

141
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,700
 

142
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,500
Hi, Oppa, it's me.

143
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,970
- I want to post a car on your site.
 - All right, all right!

144
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,050
I'll give you 5 million won more.

145
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,390
Deal?

146
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,930
No, I'll call you back.

147
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,190
 

148
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,600
 Oppa? Oppa? 

149
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,360
Come on, we're both players.

150
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,840
Appa is like oppa. Oppa is like appa. 
  (T/N: Appa means dad, Oppa means older brother) 

151
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,100
It's like that, you know.

152
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,690
If you caught on, let's just go with the flow.

153
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,360
Listen to how you talk.

154
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,620
Come home some time.

155
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,870
Yes, sir.

156
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,010
Dad, I'll talk to you again.

157
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,270
Why don't you come up with a real oppa? 
  (T/N: Oppa also means boyfriend) 

158
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,230
By chance...

159
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,700
does she have a boyfriend?

160
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,370
You got 5 million won more thanks to me.

161
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,120
What are you going to do with the rest?

162
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,440
Should we hit the nightclubs?

163
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,940
I have to send more out next month.

164
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,950
But as for that moron...

165
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,670
he doesn't care about child support or education cost?

166
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,240
You're struggling all alone,

167
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,250
yet the dad has so much money.

168
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,160
Forget it.

169
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,340
I can afford chicken and beer.

170
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,060
Chicken and beer?

171
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,640
Chicken and beer tonight sound good.

172
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,330
Shall we go?

173
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,210
They're here.

174
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,820
I told her to come.

175
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,690
Have a seat over there.

176
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,300
Will you go on like this?

177
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,590
You said this has nothing to do with you, Director.

178
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,760
I told you.

179
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,670
Until Chairman Kim steps down completely,

180
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,500
I can't create any noise.

181
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,180
That's right. Why argue over that?

182
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,880
As for people talking,

183
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,740
other news will cover it up in no time if you ignore it.

184
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,690
President of FBC.

185
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,200
Would that make you feel better?

186
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,650
Under one condition, though.

187
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,840
There will be personnel changes in the presidential board in three weeks.

188
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,050
Within three weeks,

189
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,130
restore your image as it was before.

190
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,770
 

191
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,430
Geez...

192
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,440
Hae Ra, are you in the bathroom?

193
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,800
I was going to make breakfast.

194
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,390
Whoa, bulgogi.

195
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,830
Yum, nice.

196
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,140
 

197
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,500
Yes?

198
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,700
Unni, I was going to let this go, but...

199
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,690
 this seems so wrong. 

200
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,180
Yoo Jung unni and I said you should come back.

201
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,060
 It was your idea to start with. 

202
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,960
 You planned the whole show. 

203
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,710
But the director said...

204
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:25,460
you absolutely cannot make a comeback.

205
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,320
It's probably because of Lee Hoon Seok stepping down from the show.

206
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,390
Unni, haven't you heard?

207
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,920
 

208
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,540
 After the current president moves onto another network, 

209
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,260
Lee Hoon Seok is taking over that position.

210
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,930
Are you going to let Kang Hae Ra be?

211
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,260
No.

212
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,350
For her to do better at what she's good at,

213
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,580
I'll put her on higher ground.

214
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,350
I have to strengthen her power

215
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,460
so I can order her to hunt.

216
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,330
I think Kang Hae Ra will be our shortcut to our plan.

217
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,930
 

218
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,580
The problem is that...

219
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,410
she'll have many more enemies.

220
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,710
That's...

221
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,460
what Kang Hae Ra will get back from those she trampled.

222
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,530
The weight of the cross.

223
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,720
You can't barge in like this.

224
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,550
Okay, I'll call you back later.

225
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,090
The writers and staff members are not at fault.

226
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,920
They only follow their orders from the top.

227
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,630
Sit down.

228
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,170
You know it well.

229
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,690
How about me?

230
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,980
Am I the head of this TV station?

231
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,540
If Lee Hoon Seok doesn't get to leave,

232
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,380
I have no reason to leave, either.

233
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,540
I mean...

234
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,820
it's not like high-handed hiring like a parachute.

235
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,910
She's putting him in there like dropping a missile.

236
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,070
What power do I have?

237
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,360
Who?

238
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,060
These guys. I thought they took care of it all.

239
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,580
Tell PD Choi and Ms. Lee to come in.

240
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,150
 

241
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,220
By chance...

242
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,990
is this about our conversation at the cafe?

243
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,300
But the mood was really like that back then.

244
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,790
I had no idea things would turn out like this.

245
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,350
That's what I'm saying.

246
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,300
Things have changed,

247
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,310
so I want to take back my rights.

248
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,420
Can't you understand our situation?

249
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,890
How about my situation?

250
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,760
No one is considering my situation,

251
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,580
why should I...

252
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,480
consider someone else's situation? Especially Lee Hoon Seok?

253
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,880
If you continue this way, it will be tough for you to get back on TV.

254
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,430
If you stay quiet for a while,

255
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,120
- we'd consider you for later...
 - Please decide now.

256
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,530
If you continue this way,

257
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,990
I'll request for a broadcast's suspension.

258
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,480
 
 More than 80% of this show

259
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,920
came from my plan and my ideas.

260
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,080
And I haven't done anything wrong

261
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,420
that a cast shouldn't have done.

262
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,790
Hae Ra...

263
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,750
Let's not get upset with each other.

264
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,180
We never know how and when we'll get to work together.

265
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,610
That's what I mean.

266
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,750
Let's not get more upset with each other.

267
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,760
If you insist,

268
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,630
talk to the president.

269
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,820
Actually, the president wasn't entirely opposed to your comeback.

270
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,290
If the show airs before the new president arrives,

271
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,180
then...

272
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,600
Gosh, whatever.

273
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,500
You take care of it then.

274
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,420
Either we have a lawsuit for suspension of the broadcast

275
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,100
or we stop the show in the middle.

276
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,690
 President just left. 

277
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,820
 He said he'd head home after tending to his matter. 

278
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,820
 
 Are you sure you don't need a further examination?

279
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,730
Yes, I think I'm fine.

280
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,080
 Emergency patient! 

281
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,720
 Coming through! 

282
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,750
 Seung Joo... 

283
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,050
The patient is unconscious, and her vitals are unstable.

284
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,610
Load up on 1 liter of saline and

285
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,410
put intubation, and we'll perform gastric lavage.

286
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,910
Yes.

287
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,780
Please move her.

288
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,040
Why did you save me?

289
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,660
Why did you?

290
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,670
You should've let me die.

291
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,200
What are you saying?

292
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,390
Why are you doing this?

293
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,360
I want to stop everything now.

294
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,530
It's too hard for me.

295
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,450
Seung Joo...

296
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,050
Seung Joo, talk to me.

297
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,540
Talk to mommy.

298
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,740
Talk to me!

299
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,260
What's wrong?

300
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,360
Why did you do that?

301
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,080
What's wrong?

302
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,480
 Why did you do it? 

303
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,870
 Next news. 

304
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,990
 Next month, FB Life will 

305
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,820
 select two startup companies that will codevelop 

306
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,500
 a business model based on their healthcare platform. 

307
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,740
 The market experts believe that 

308
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,190
 this aggressive investment by FB Life  

309
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,970
 is to heighten the internal control by  

310
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,440
 Managing Director Kim Tae On who is considered to be 

311
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,280
 the next successor. 

312
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,360
 That is their cautious projection. 

313
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,540
 

314
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,680
Hyung.

315
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,970
What? She's not here, either.

316
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,490
Where did she go?

317
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,960
Gosh.

318
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,400
 The good deeds by Moa Mirae Welfare Foundation 

319
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,890
 who pays for nursing home care for familyless seniors 

320
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,490
 continue this year as well. 

321
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,290
 The defendant's image has been positive. 

322
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,530
 But by exposing without firm evidence... 

323
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,070
I don't know if people would be interested.

324
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,510
That's too much pressure.

325
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,510
Who is it exactly that she feels the pressure from his positive image?

326
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,440
 Director Song visited nursing homes throughout the country 

327
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,140
 and donated medical equipments and supplies. 

328
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,930
 - He personally...  
- It was this guy?

329
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,340
 participates in volunteering efforts 

330
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,460
 and said they'll increase number of beneficiaries 

331
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,470
  
 and will do his best to spread love to 

332
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,150
  
 various parts of our society. 

333
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,180
That bastard!

334
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,590
 

335
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Oh, yeah, you know the foundation?

336
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,310
Did Director Song's matter wrap up okay?

337
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,090
Yes. I believe auntie took care of it.

338
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,640
Geez, that's awkward for your aunt.

339
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,510
No matter how it turned out,

340
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,010
a clean image is crucial for the foundation work.

341
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,770
People have lots to say about our family-run business anyhow.

342
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,350
He received a not guilty verdict in trial.

343
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,050
Did he?

344
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,350
Well, then...

345
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,920
It's fine as long as people think that.

346
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,930
I just thought you'd be in a bind...

347
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,820
because of your mother's side of the family.

348
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
 Welcome. 

349
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,240
I would've come to you.

350
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,540
No, it's okay.

351
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,820
You're busy with not only managing the foundation

352
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,410
but with fundraising.

353
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,320
You know about our work inside out as well.

354
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,950
Oh, Director.

355
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,510
Here you go.

356
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,100
You were more generous with my fee than what I had initially quoted you.

357
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,450
I thought you'd have to sign lots of documents.

358
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,740
- Have some. 
- Thank you.

359
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,800
You have no intention of reconsidering my offer?

360
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,670
I'm not in sync with my current legal team leader.

361
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,170
The cases I'm working on right now

362
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,670
may be small, but...

363
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,070
they chose me with their trust.

364
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,900
For me to disregard them and quit

365
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,600
will be too difficult.

366
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,690
Do you prefer trust over money?

367
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,170
I really love the fact that money can't buy you.

368
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,540
But if you have any problems in the future,

369
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,460
I'll come to you in person and offer my advice.

370
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,570
Well, only if I had another daughter...

371
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,490
I heard your daughter is getting married soon.

372
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,020
I'd like to have her by my side longer,

373
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,060
but they say they're "into each other."

374
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,500
What can I do?

375
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,480
I heard your future in-law works in government.

376
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,660
That's why I need someone like you,

377
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,590
who can clean up things nicely.

378
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,210
These people are all about saving face.

379
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,600
Director, here.

380
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,650
Her name is Kang Hae Ra.

381
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:55,720
She's Lee Hoon Seok's ex-wife.

382
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,120
The one who had a scandal with Director Kim Tae On recently.

383
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,560
Ah!

384
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:04,650
I heard you're looking for a replacement for Ms. Choi.

385
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,860
How do you know her?

386
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,300
We met a few times to discuss her divorce case.

387
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,300
She came by recently looking for a job.

388
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,820
If you keep her by your side,

389
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,530
I thought she might be of help to you at some point.

390
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,130
Never mind her competency, but

391
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,030
more than anything, it might be good to hold the reins

392
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,870
on Director Kim.

393
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,900
Yeah.

394
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,150
Director Kim is on her way up.

395
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,250
I'll give that a thought.

396
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,350
I'll get going then.

397
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,640
Okay, let's get together again soon.

398
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,970
Yes.

399
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,270
 

400
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,120
Good job.

401
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,520
Here.

402
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,580
- J &amp; Cell papers are good, right? 
- Yeah.

403
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,260
Until the development funds are in,

404
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,000
the fact that J &amp; Cell and you are connected...

405
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,670
my father's people should never find out about it.

406
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,380
No need to worry.

407
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,110
Let's wrap up MOU without any issues.

408
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,100
That one just needs the board of directors' approval.

409
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,430
What are you so worried about?

410
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,650
After this project wraps up,

411
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,170
your shots are fully loaded.

412
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:49,470
The stockholders prefer your aggressive management style.

413
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,300
My sneaky old man.

414
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,620
I have a bad feeling.

415
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,130
Considering forming a company in Belgium without my knowledge,

416
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,940
I wonder if he knows something, he's been...

417
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,950
He's always dragged himself around, taking his time.

418
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,640
Before my father's people make their move,

419
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,690
we have to obtain the shares firmly.

420
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,380
Most of the executives are

421
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,710
on your side and aunt.

422
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,390
It's been over ten years since Mom passed away.

423
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,320
Half of them turned their backs on us.

424
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,530
Don't worry.

425
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,070
When we obtain the shares that are tied to the foundation,

426
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,030
FB Group is all yours.

427
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,660
 

428
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:50,190
But isn't the president's position too much for him?

429
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,750
I thought you'd get rid of him after playing for a while.

430
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,560
That guy, Lee Hoon Seok...

431
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,360
He's going around telling everyone about the FBC president position.

432
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,730
How could just anyone...

433
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,490
Anyone?

434
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,990
  
Oppa, do you think you're something special for that position?

435
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,310
If you have time to worry about stuff like that,

436
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:26,580
pay attention, so I don't hear about your mess in the future.

437
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,780
What do you mean by a mess?

438
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:39,060
If a dirty mess like last time happens again,

439
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,800
I'm saying I can no longer turn a blind eye.

440
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,240
Did Kang Hae Ra say she'll take it on?

441
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,690
Not yet.

442
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,570
In any case, I have to know what kind of play

443
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,610
Director Song and Director Kim will play.

444
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,950
Bye.

445
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,650
Here you go.

446
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,000
She can't even take care of herself.

447
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,430
 

448
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,060
 

449
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,690
  The call is not going through.  

450
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,430
  You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep...  

451
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,840
Both of them at the same time?

452
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,500
 

453
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,430
 

454
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,370
 

455
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:12,170
 more than anything, it might be good to hold the reins 

456
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,570
 on Director Kim. 

457
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,170
 

458
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,010
 

459
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,630
Excuse me.

460
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,400
Back then...

461
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:02,330
she should've never quit that agency.

462
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,030
An agency?

463
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,850
Yes.

464
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,620
It was called Haega Entertainment.

465
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,830
She worked there as a secretary.

466
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,590
Haega Entertainment?

467
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,630
Soon after...

468
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,060
some corporation president...

469
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,880
thought well of my Seung Joo

470
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,500
and wanted to scout her.

471
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,650
Since they offered much more in salary at a corporation...

472
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,730
She got scouted by a corporation,

473
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,780
so I thought everything went well.

474
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,330
But I have no idea why...

475
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,080
Gosh, why...

476
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,550
 Mr. Hwang, I heard you have news on Kang Hae Ra. 

477
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,080
 Back then, she enticed me first... 

478
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,980
  
 and after taking the money... 

479
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:55,020
 she reported me to the police treating me like a criminal. 

480
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,630
 I'm not so sure, but I'm sure Lee Hoon Seok was mistreated like me. 

481
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,370
 Who is that again? 

482
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,780
 He's the owner of a restaurant she worked at 

483
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,520
 when Kang Hae Ra was in high school. 

484
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,510
 He heard about the recent scandal regarding Kang Hae Ra and Lee Hoon Seok 

485
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,790
  
 and requested an interview with us. 

486
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:12,750
  
 I see... 

487
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,760
  
 In the meantime, I hear Lee Hoon Seok is holding a press conference. 

488
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,810
 According to my sources, 

489
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,290
 I hear he will clarify rumors regarding 

490
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,520
 Lee Hoon Seok and his son Lee Ga On. 

491
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,350
  
 If it's about rumors regarding his son, 

492
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:27,970
 it must be about Ga On who had appeared on variety shows. 

493
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:28,830
 Yes. 

494
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,530
 In a moment, he will... 

495
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:33,030
 reveal facts about his family 

496
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,800
 that he couldn't reveal all this time. 

497
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,450
 I will report it to you as soon as I hear. 

498
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,280
Ma'am.

499
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,960
Here you go.

500
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,180
Something urgent came up.

501
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,770
Please call me at this number if anything comes up.

502
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,200
- Please. 
- Okay...

503
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,470
All right.

504
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,940
 

505
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,680
Hae...

506
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,280
 

507
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,000
Is something the matter?

508
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,190
- I'll borrow your car. 
- Okay.

509
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,600
Hae Ra!

510
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,860
It's me, Kang Hae Ra.

511
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,430
Where is Lee Hoon Seok's press conference?

512
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,660
 

513
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,270
Hae Ra! Hae Ra...

514
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,670
Hae Ra!

515
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,310
Gosh.

516
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,850
Gosh...

517
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,770
We're ready.

518
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,590
What are you doing?

519
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,580
It's okay.

520
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,820
What are you trying to do?

521
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,720
I couldn't bear to take it all on myself.

522
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,280
Can't you see me right now?

523
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,480
Do I look all right to you?

524
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,090
You lived in luxury's lap thanks to me,

525
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,220
- and your son... 
- Why are you taking it this far?

526
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,580
You wouldn't even give me a divorce.

527
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,810
You tormented me as much as you could.

528
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,450
You should've never butted into my life, to begin with.

529
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,110
Don't mess with Ga On.

530
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,240
 To make money, you dragged him everywhere, 

531
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,830
 and everyone knows what he looks like. 

532
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,510
 - If you mess with Ga On... 
- So... 

533
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,980
 if you hadn't lied about him being my son, 

534
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,150
 this would've never happened. 

535
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,240
Did you think you could hide it forever?

536
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,180
What are you trying to do?

537
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,870
When you said you had my baby,

538
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,370
I did my best to protect you and the baby. But...

539
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,520
what did I get in return?

540
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,350
You deceived me,

541
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,780
and it wasn't enough to cheat on me with that young punk.

542
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,390
When your despicable nature was revealed,

543
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,730
you even entrapped me.

544
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,240
What nonsense are you spewing?

545
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,670
You bastard.

546
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,220
I'll ask you one more thing while we're at it.

547
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,420
 Who is the child's father? 

548
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,180
 Who is it that he won't take back his kid for 12 years 

549
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,020
 and turn me into an idiot? 

550
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,020
 By chance, was it the guy you were in a scandal with? 

551
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,560
Wait, how old was he then...

552
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,780
Crazy bastard.

553
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,270
Ga On is our son.

554
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,900
Geez...

555
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,370
You mean, your son.

556
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,000
You already deceived many people, including me.

557
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,960
Just because you hold a press conference,

558
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,210
do you think people would believe you?

559
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,810
There's a DNA test.

560
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,320
Play a trick on me again.

561
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,680
Then I'll bring your son

562
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,120
and run the DNA test in front of people.

563
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,190
The DNA test wouldn't lie.

564
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,650
Why? Do you want to go in with me?

565
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:36,330
Would you explain to them who the kid's father is?

566
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,600
We can go in there and explain.

567
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,020
Gold digging highschooler.

568
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:48,920
Let go, damn it.

569
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,410
Geez.

570
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:09,970
 They were together. 

571
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,090
Let go! I have to stop him!

572
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:19,220
I can't let him speak ill of Ga On.

573
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,530
He's just a child.

574
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:23,090
- He's only 12 years old. 
- Come to your senses.

575
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,900
Reporters are all over the place.

576
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,320
- There are tons of cameras. 
- That's why...

577
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,280
That's why I have to stop him.

578
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,100
I can't let him trample on Ga On, too.

579
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,230
And if you go to jail?

580
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,730
And if he sees the news of his mom getting arrested for attempted murder?

581
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:40,580
Don't you care about that?

582
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,910
Don't you think about what happens after?

583
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,240
If you're telling the truth,

584
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,350
you just have to argue back.

585
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,210
 

586
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,340
What's going on exactly?

587
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:47,900
Lee Hoon Seok is hastening Kang Hae Ra unexpectedly.

588
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:52,300
Look into Kang Hae Ra and her son.

589
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,790
Okay.

590
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,390
Noona.

591
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,010
Hi, you're here.

592
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,340
What are you doing?

593
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,250
- Do you need my help? 
- No, I'm finished.

594
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:13,390
What did you plant?

595
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,670
Well, chrysanthemums,

596
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,870
Siberian chrysanthemum, geumjeongwha.

597
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:21,020
This reminds me of when Mom used to be alive.

598
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:23,760
I'll plant peonies next spring.

599
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,440
We wouldn't have to go look for flowers.

600
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,500
Just like when we were little,

601
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,060
let's put a table here,

602
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,590
and drink tea and read, looking at the flowers.

603
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,840
Gosh...

604
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,760
I don't know what's going on,

605
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,910
but I don't know if I should be telling you this now.

606
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:55,630
 I told you Choi Seung Joo would be different from others. 

607
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:58,110
 She was hired as a secretary. 

608
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:00,230
 I didn't know she'd take it that far. 

609
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,750
 I thought she'd be innocent and obedient. 

610
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:09,510
 Listen to the rest. 

611
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,260
I told her to come.

612
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,140
Have a seat over there.

613
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,970
There will be personnel changes in the presidential board in three weeks.

614
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,870
Within three weeks,

615
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,660
 restore your image as it was before. 

616
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,030
 Don't make it so difficult. 

617
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:40,050
 You hold a card to finish up everything at once. 

618
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,490
 Kang Hae Ra's son. 

619
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:44,560
 Say he's not your son. 

620
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,390
 Ga On? 

621
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,170
A Korean fav emcee who is at his peak

622
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,920
marries a high school grad reporter.

623
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,140
You made a mistake while drunk.

624
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,510
And if that child is another man's child?

625
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,480
If I reveal it now, people would say...

626
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,780
Say you just found out. What's the problem there?

627
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,960
If you say Kang Hae Ra plotted all this to hide that,

628
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,200
the story fits perfectly.

629
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,810
She won't admit it easily.

630
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,560
She's obsessive about the child...

631
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,840
What's the point of a DNA test?

632
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,730
If it's too hard for you,

633
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:17,850
I'll help you bring the child and run the DNA test.

634
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,770
You should trample her for good, while you're at it.

635
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,970
So that she can't rebuild.

636
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,950
The spy app I installed on Lee Hoon Seok's cellphone.

637
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,530
 

638
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,990
Then this woman is...

639
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,460
Director Kim Tae On?

640
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,160
Ma'am.

641
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,270
Did something happen to Seung Joo...

642
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:32,860
I had no idea whom I should go to...

643
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,830
 

644
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,870
The police came by...

645
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:44,300
and gave her this.

646
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,130
 

647
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,830
A complaint?

648
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:50,450
Why would they do that to a patient?

649
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,660
For making a false accusation or something.

650
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,680
The director is suing my Seung Joo.

651
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,290
Seung Joo, is she by chance...

652
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:02,420
Isn't she the victim of the case Mr. Cha defended?

653
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:13,170
I had no idea that my daughter suffered through all that.

654
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,670
I had no idea that's why she's been like that...

655
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,290
Director Song, that bastard.

656
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,750
After ruining her like that, now what?

657
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,400
For making a false accusation?

658
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,350
I should rip him up into shreds.

659
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,510
How could he do that...

660
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:36,170
Take revenge for us.

661
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:39,270
Take revenge on the guy...

662
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,540
who did that to my child.

663
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:52,470
But why is this case the first case?

664
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:56,530
Director Song is preparing for a libel suit to restore his image.

665
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,620
If he pushes that far,

666
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,240
the victim wouldn't survive it.

667
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,020
 

668
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,740
 

669
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,460
Where are you going?

670
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,890
I have to let people know.

671
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,580
Taking this far trying to hide

672
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,960
that ugly and dirty bare face.

673
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:46,360
 

674
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:00,730
You knew everything already when you gave me this case, right?

675
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,510
Lee Hoon Seok, Director Song,

676
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,280
and even Director Kim Tae On.

677
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,420
You knew that...

678
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,250
everyone was involved, right?

679
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,850
Where should I begin?

680
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:57,340
 Kang Hae Ra and Lee Hoon Seok's explosive fight 

681
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,780
 is turning into a mud fight. 

682
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,050
 Our reporters... 

683
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,500
 have obtained evidence pertaining to 

684
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,490
 the fact that Lee Hoon Seok has been 

685
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,610
  
 physically abusing Kang Hae Ra as soon as they got married. 

686
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:09,880
Hyung.

687
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,650
You should see this.

688
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:12,980
I saw it.

689
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,070
All the articles are refuting his press conference,

690
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,690
and they're criticizing Lee Hoon Seok.

691
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:21,040
If all the public opinions side with Kang Hae Ra...

692
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:26,840
Find out where Kang Hae Ra is.

693
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,930
More than that, look at this document.

694
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:39,960
It's Kang Hae Ra's ob/gyn records from 11 years ago.

695
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,350
Where is the kid?

696
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,900
Where is he?

697
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:34,730
 

698
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:38,140
 

699
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,200
 Push one more time. 

700
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:01,590
 It's a record on Kang Hae Ra 

701
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:03,510
 who arrived in an ambulance. 

702
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,940
Before she arrived at the hospital,

703
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,210
  
the unborn baby was already dead.

704
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,210
The baby was Lee Hoon Seok's baby.

705
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:17,090
While she was pregnant,

706
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:19,230
Lee Hoon Seok requested a DNA test.

707
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,770
Here is the test result.

708
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,810
 

709
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,170
Wait.

710
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,770
Then...

711
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,650
to maintain her marriage,

712
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,700
she brought in a child to replace her dead child?

713
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,330
At the time, Lee Hoon Seok was out of the country.

714
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:49,510
If she believed that Lee Hoon Seok had killed her unborn child,

715
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:52,490
no revenge would be worse than

716
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,350
having him raise someone else's child

717
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,700
as if he was his.

718
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,320
 

719
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,680
Why now...

720
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:27,120
Why are you curious about that now?

721
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,340
The world should know...

722
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,910
what you did to me, shrew.

723
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,820
Where did you hide him?

724
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,960
Tell me!

725
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,710
Ready.

726
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,200
Ga On! Come!

727
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,630
Let's take a picture.

728
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,410
Here. Come.

729
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:02,800
Okay.

730
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:04,950
There.

731
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,890
 I'll protect him. 

732
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,670
Let's take the picture.

733
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:15,690
 I'll protect him this time. 

734
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:27,280
♫  Can't you hear my heart 
that is covered with pain?  ♫

735
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:35,590
 

736
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,310
 

737
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:40,830
    
 When the public feels betrayed, 

738
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:42,620
 they feel twice, no, they feel much angrier. 

739
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,720
 How come everyone is on your side? 

740
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,480
 First, I need the dual agreement that Director Song received. 

741
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,190
 I'll try it. 

742
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:54,130
 What kind of life have you been living? 

743
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,950
 I don't think it was a card key or fingerprints. 

744
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:59,040
 He'll arrive in less than five minutes. 

745
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,280
 You must leave now, Kang Hae Ra. 

746
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,320
 I won't let him get me like he did last time. 

747
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:09,170
♫  I will show you  ♫

748
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:17,520
