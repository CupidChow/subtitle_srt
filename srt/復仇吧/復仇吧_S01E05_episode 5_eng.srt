1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,230
 

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,180
 

3
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,550
  
Here.

4
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,160
Great.

5
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,590
I called you out at the last minute.

6
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,630
Since it was a rush, I put it a little more.

7
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,880
Aigoo.

8
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,340
What's this?

9
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,470
Aigoo!

10
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,010
What's going on?

11
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,500
What's going on here?

12
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,370
Are you okay?

13
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,020
What's going on here?

14
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,680
Gosh...

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,130
Wait...

16
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,160
No!

17
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,380
- Pretend you didn't see me. 
 - What?

18
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,490
I won't say anything.

19
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,140
Please.

20
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,900
If you let me go,

21
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,430
I'll live quietly as though I'm dead.

22
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,930
Wait...

23
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,120
Gosh...

24
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,180
Come down for now. Come down.

25
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,450
Please pretend not to have seen me.

26
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,420
Please?

27
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,400
Please.

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,120
Thank you.

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,000
Please pretend you didn't see me.

30
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,390
It will be an accidental death

31
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,590
due to bad brakes.

32
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,800
What's wrong with this?

33
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,590
Crap!

34
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,260
Crap!

35
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,210
Crap!

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,230
Are you awake now?

37
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,900
Now that I think about it,

38
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,600
Mr. Cha introduced you to me.

39
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,730
Why did Mr. Cha place you here,

40
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,380
and what exactly did you try to do?

41
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,070
I have so many questions...

42
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,480
but I'll have to teach a cat burglar a lesson.

43
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,900
If you're that curious, you should've told me sooner.

44
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,300
I'd welcome you anytime.

45
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,120
Playing in that room, you know?

46
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,590
 When I woke up, 

47
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,490
 he... 

48
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,950
 That devil dragged me into that room. 

49
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,320
 He treated me like an animal in there. 

50
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,440
 I wasn't human in there. 

51
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,130
How could a place like this exist?

52
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,030
I was going to give you a nice shot.

53
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,880
But if you're okay,

54
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,230
staying sober won't be so bad.

55
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,570
I'll give you special treatment.

56
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,530
Let go of me!

57
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,340
What the hell are you doing?

58
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,030
If you don't let me go, you'll regret this!

59
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,190
Don't waste your energy already.

60
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,200
If you waste your energy like this,

61
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,040
how will you play in there?

62
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,260
This is the scene...

63
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,950
where he raped his secretary

64
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,910
and used his money and power

65
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,880
to turn the victim into an assailant.

66
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,920
This is Director Song Seung Woo's

67
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,360
sexual assault scene.

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,470
This is...

69
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,860
as you all know...

70
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,900
Moa Mirae Welfare Foundation's

71
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,890
Director Song Seung Woo's

72
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,620
bare face!

73
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,970
 

74
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,170
Stay still, stay still.

75
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,110
Hey, what are you doing?

76
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,460
Let me go!

77
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,100
Go ahead and make some noise.

78
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,810
It arouses me.

79
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,520
I'm telling you, you're finished.

80
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,730
You're finished, you crazy bastard!

81
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,620
Oh, Hyung.

82
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,600
This is from Kang Hae Ra.

83
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,020
Well, I blacked out.

84
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,630
 The Prosecutors' Office placed a ban on overseas travel  

85
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,140
 and launched investigations for 

86
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,420
   Director Song Seung Woo of Moa Mirae Welfare Foundation 

87
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,260
 who tried to rape his secretary 

88
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,630
 and ran away when the police were dispatched. 

89
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,660
 The Prosecutors' Office sought 

90
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,090
 validity of the video clips saved on 

91
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,420
 Song's laptop found in his office. 

92
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,400
 They are focusing their investigation on looking for additional crimes 

93
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,270
 relevant to rape of his secretaries. 

94
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,560
 Besides the sexual assault charges, 

95
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,460
 Song is facing lawsuits for accounting fraud 

96
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,360
  and other fraud charges from FB Life. 

97
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,560
   

98
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,470
Yes.

99
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,190
Wow, at this rate,

100
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,560
not just Director Song, but even Director Kim Tae On

101
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,980
 can get an arrest warrant served. 

102
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,740
I'll call you back.

103
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,800
 

104
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,620
   
 Don't miss it. 

105
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,750
Of course, we're in sync.

106
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,310
You can buy beer.

107
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,330
Let's go.

108
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,550
Do you need a bag?

109
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,380
You work here, too?

110
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,640
Yes.

111
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,120
I see.

112
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,730
Bye.

113
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,500
Take care.

114
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,590
You must be tired.

115
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,090
Yeah.

116
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,920
I fell asleep.

117
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,530
Do you want another one?

118
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,350
All right.

119
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,860
I wonder how the weather will be tomorrow.

120
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,880
 

121
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,760
Crap.

122
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,870
Why did you hit him?

123
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,240
Look at this punk.

124
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,140
You should say hello to an elder.

125
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,720
What's this?

126
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,410
Looks like you have the money to buy these.

127
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,710
You know?

128
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,550
It's because you won't pay off your debt, man!

129
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,450
Take it.

130
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,130
Are you playing house?

131
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,320
Do you think I came all the way here

132
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,960
to get chump change like this?

133
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,060
Bastard.

134
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,510
I'll get paid again next week.

135
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,550
- I'll come to you then. 
 - Punk...

136
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,860
You just don't get it.

137
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,280
- There's an easy way out. 
 - I said no!

138
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,520
I'll pay you back somehow.

139
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,690
Just leave us alone.

140
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,080
Fine.

141
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,740
Fine.

142
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,880
Let's see how much longer you endure.

143
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,750
If not you...

144
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,950
there's your younger brother.

145
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,730
Let's go.

146
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,890
Let's go...

147
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,190
- Jung Hoon. 
 - Huh?

148
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,780
Go and buy some ramen and rice.

149
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,280
I'll clean up here.

150
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,820
You had money?

151
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,000
I kept money to buy food.

152
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,660
I'll be right back.

153
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,350
Watch out for the cars.

154
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,550
 You'll have to drive all night. 

155
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,400
Won't you be tired?

156
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,270
I guess it's a super rush.

157
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,600
Because of that,

158
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,930
he says he'll pay me triple.

159
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,900
Aigoo, Jung Woo. Are you awake?

160
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,280
Daddy, are you going to work?

161
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,200
How about the amusement park?

162
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,980
I'll be home tomorrow morning.

163
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,930
Don't you worry.

164
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,160
Aigoo, Jung Won...

165
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,070
If you get sleepy,

166
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,550
take a quick nap before you drive again.

167
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,260
We can go to the amusement park next time. Okay?

168
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,060
I'll take care of it.

169
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,910
I'll be back.

170
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,270
I'm off, Honey.

171
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,420
 

172
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,800
Yes, Deputy Chief.

173
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,450
Yes.

174
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,690
I didn't know Director Song would go to that extent.

175
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,400
Yes, of course.

176
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,590
I already changed the title to your mother's name.

177
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,730
I'll set up a time to get together real soon.

178
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,490
Take care.

179
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,860
I took care of the press.

180
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,230
Are there any changes to Chairman Kim's shares?

181
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,720
We haven't found anything yet.

182
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,010
Chairman is here.

183
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,620
Hi.

184
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,210
How is everyone?

185
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,360
Oh, boy...

186
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,690
So...

187
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,350
what were you talking about? You all look tense.

188
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,430
When you're running a business, you go through this and that.

189
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,970
All kinds of things happen.

190
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,770
More so if you're in a position to make decisions.

191
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,150
I'm not saying it because she's my daughter.

192
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,110
Director Kim...

193
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,970
got very unlucky this time.

194
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,610
Her cousin was...

195
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,500
determined to swindler her.

196
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,090
Who could stand that?

197
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,600
People...

198
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,270
They never say anything when you're doing well,

199
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,070
but they jump on you when you fall down.

200
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,380
But when you think about it,

201
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,990
this isn't a small store that I own by myself.

202
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,720
I can't make excuses and side with her because she's my daughter.

203
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,340
Geez...

204
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,100
This is why it's tough to be in this position.

205
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,120
I think I have to...

206
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,890
accept the board of directors' opinions that say

207
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,930
Managing Director Kim's control

208
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,780
over the company is still too premature.

209
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,160
If that's what the board of directors wants.

210
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
This time...

211
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,830
it was my mistake.

212
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,050
Right.

213
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,610
It's not like this position is going somewhere else.

214
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,390
Just consider it as a good experience. What can you do?

215
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,920
So don't just trust anyone

216
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,870
and be like that, okay?

217
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,950
She's still so naive.

218
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,390
Isn't that right?

219
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,470
Okay, let's end that there.

220
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,890
- What's on the next agenda?
- Yes...

221
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,090
Should I call in Ms. Kim?

222
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,490
No.

223
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,060
I'll do it.

224
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,380
I don't know why people are so greedy.

225
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,640
Greed is always a problem.

226
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,900
Don't you think so?

227
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,950
 All right... 

228
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,210
 If you can't get rid of your greed, 

229
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,200
look. I messed up again.

230
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,850
Even with firm documents in place,

231
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,650
they won't let me bring it up, starting with the chief.

232
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,910
We expected that.

233
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,090
Anyway, they put Chairman Kim at the forefront.

234
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,170
It worked according to his plan.

235
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,160
So who was it?

236
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,620
Who leaked that document?

237
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,260
It couldn't be easy.

238
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,870
The one who...

239
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,520
exposed Director Song's case.

240
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,350
I see.

241
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,240
Whoa, she's something.

242
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,920
Walking away with the document midst of all that.

243
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,370
If someone like that...

244
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,250
was determined...

245
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,430
to destroy someone?

246
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,660
An ordinary person couldn't survive it.

247
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,470
Watch out.

248
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,220
In my opinion, she's like a double-edged sword.

249
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,090
If you're not careful, she'll hurt you.

250
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,260
If she's a sword,

251
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,030
I should hold onto her to the end.

252
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,240
After I'm done using it,

253
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,940
I'll have to break it.

254
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,940
   

255
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,210
 The line is currently busy. 

256
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,320
 After the beep...  

257
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,920
When is CEO Choi's investigation over?

258
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,430
Don't worry.

259
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,580
They're supposed to end there.

260
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,770
Director Song is on the run.

261
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,080
- No one should bring you up... 
 - Excuse me.

262
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,050
Mr. Lee Hoon Seok?

263
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,760
You've been charged with the attempted murder of Kang Hae Ra.

264
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,970
Here is the draft of the agreement

265
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,630
from my client.

266
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,200
   

267
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,340
Hello, this is Kang Hae Ra's Revenge Agency.

268
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,330
Sounds too boring to just say "Revenge Agency"...

269
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,860
I'm Kang Hae Ra from Live Revenge Agency.

270
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,430
Hello, this is Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency.

271
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,880
Great.

272
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,250
The lighting is too...

273
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,120
Daebak. It's a hit.

274
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,200
Did you see?

275
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,530
So many comments say they should fund you.

276
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,560
What?

277
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,250
You did all this?

278
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,410
Yeah.

279
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,550
Hey...

280
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:25,130
It's this month's rent.

281
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,560
I'll share the rent starting this month.

282
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,300
Hey, what are you doing?

283
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,580
It's okay.

284
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,800
You let me stay at your place for free.

285
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,770
Of course, I should share the rent.

286
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,440
Thanks.

287
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,180
Oh, I have something to give you, too.

288
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,880
Open it.

289
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,880
What's this? You're scaring me.

290
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,640
Hurry.

291
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,790
   

292
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,390
See? Isn't it chic?

293
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,100
Mr. Cha's version bugged me a bit.

294
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,370
 "I'll take on your revenge." 

295
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,910
How tacky is that?

296
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,110
"I'm Kang Hae Ra from the Revenge Channel."

297
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,930
See? Isn't it trendy?

298
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,950
Hey.

299
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,730
You're missing "Live."

300
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,740
What?

301
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,180
Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency.

302
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,780
I see.

303
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,730
Is that what you decided to call it?

304
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,790
"Live Revenge Agency"?

305
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,530
All right then. I have a date.

306
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,440
I'll get going.

307
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,080
A date?

308
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,530
Hey, do you have a boyfriend?

309
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,970
Yeah.

310
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,060
Of course, I do.

311
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,900
The lively energy that comes to me at times...

312
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,650
What am I saying?

313
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,520
Are you tossing that away?

314
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,290
It's for this year.

315
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,820
I want to work hard, so the time flies by.

316
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,150
Your calendar is on your desk.

317
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,340
Okay.

318
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,250
Are you using your car?

319
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,710
No. Why?

320
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,440
I think I should buy a chromakey green backdrop and a light.

321
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,760
If you're not using it...

322
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,560
See you later.

323
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,190
A ceiling lamp?

324
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,010
Are you from the installation team?

325
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,170
I want to use it in my studio.

326
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,930
I see. For recording.

327
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,440
Then...

328
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,850
you'll only need two of these.

329
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,430
How much would that cost?

330
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,780
Let's see. Two of 1.3 million won.

331
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,410
It will be 2.6 million won.

332
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,270
Could you give me a discount?

333
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,920
Hold on.

334
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,820
I think you do have money. You're famous, too.

335
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,770
We're wholesale. What discount?

336
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,030
I really don't have any money.

337
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,170
Then...

338
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,790
take a look at pre-owned.

339
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,490
Okay.

340
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,210
   

341
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,560
We finally closed the first button.

342
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,660
Right.

343
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,460
It took...

344
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,230
way too long to close that button.

345
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,100
Shall we go ahead to close the second button?

346
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,750
What are you doing?

347
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,940
Isn't this the video from that time?

348
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,040
Additional clip by a witness.

349
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,620
I see.

350
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,020
Where did you go?

351
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,350
What?

352
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,390
Well...

353
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,280
I told you I had a date.

354
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,050
Whoa.

355
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,150
Are these the lights you bought?

356
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,340
Whoa, it does feel like a studio now.

357
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,720
What's this?

358
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,120
Whoa...

359
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,270
I don't think this case suits my channel.

360
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,870
I thought you'd be very interested.

361
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,260
What is it?

362
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,650
Can I take a look at that?

363
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,340
Of course.

364
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,030
   

365
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,310
No wonder he needed the money.

366
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,030
Hey, take this case.

367
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,650
I'll back you up fully.

368
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,150
This is about victims of

369
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,480
illegal collection.

370
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,770
They're minor at that.

371
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,620
   

372
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,090
They're so vicious.

373
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,530
It's called "illegal collection," to put it nicely.

374
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,420
It's about people who didn't pay back their debt.

375
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,430
It's about loan sharks.

376
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,080
I'm not interested.

377
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,430
It's not like I'm making a movie.

378
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,990
The theme is too stale.

379
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,950
If you don't want it,

380
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,880
I won't pressure you.

381
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,860
You think it's a stale theme?

382
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,750
What kind of grand cases do you want?

383
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,270
    
Don't you know him?

384
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,390
That's Jung Woo, who works at the convenience store.

385
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,740
It's not a movie, but things that are happening around us.

386
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,820
Don't you have any other jobs?

387
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,040
You'd help out strangers.

388
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,740
Why don't you want this case?

389
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,600
He needed the money, so he borrowed it and spent it.

390
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,700
When it's time to pay back, it's too burdensome.

391
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,470
And the creditor's demand is too tough.

392
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,990
What do we gain by exposing a case like this?

393
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,490
To cover for these guys,

394
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,060
if I expose them pulling the content together,

395
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,590
have you thought of a sense of loss

396
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,830
that other debtors would feel?

397
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,500
If you owe money, you should pay back.

398
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,760
You agree on the interest and default rate in the beginning.

399
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,280
The person should take responsibility for that.

400
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,690
And...

401
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,120
if you consider the damage that

402
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,950
the hardworking business might suffer,

403
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,350
it's better not to take on a case like this.

404
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,140
It's not because they borrowed money and won't pay it back

405
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,860
for them to suffer under loan sharks.

406
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,760
There has to be a story to this.

407
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,570
Doesn't everyone have a story to tell?

408
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,150
Does this look too trivial?

409
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,640
Like the talk shows you put on TV,

410
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,360
this isn't that high quality?

411
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,850
If they took on the responsibility,

412
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,340
I just think that they should take care of it.

413
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,960
Must you reject it so coldly?

414
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,480
Haven't you ever

415
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,820
received help from others all this time?

416
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,420
 How is your mother? 

417
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,790
Use this for the medical bills.

418
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,210
I've never.

419
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,290
It will be hard for me to decide today.

420
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,370
Okay.

421
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,900
I'll see you when you decide then.

422
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,460
 How is your mother? 

423
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,170
You know how it is.

424
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,300
Here...

425
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,490
Use this for the medical bills.

426
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,540
Gosh, it's okay.

427
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,190
I'm so grateful to you for introducing me to this job.

428
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,630
I'll get going. I have to prepare something.

429
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,010
See you again.

430
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,340
Hae Ra, stay strong.

431
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,520
I'll cheer you on always.

432
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,020
You must be close to Cha Yi Hyeon.

433
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,190
Yes. She's my sunbae from school.

434
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,100
She's your school sunbae?

435
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,780
She put you in your position when she's your sunbae?

436
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,020
Anyway, Cha Yi Hyeon is something.

437
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,930
Cha Yi Hyeon was...

438
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,460
supposed to take your position.

439
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,620
Watch out...

440
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,360
for Lee Hoon Seok and PD Jung.

441
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,920
When she put someone else in a position offered to her,

442
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,580
it means there's a reason for that.

443
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,320
And here...

444
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,450
It's a pretty big scandal. If you're interested, look it up.

445
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,790
It doesn't suit my current program.

446
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,000
 Watch out... 

447
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,120
 When she put someone else in a position offered to her, 

448
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,310
 it means there's a reason for that. 

449
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,660
So don't you know any colleagues she was close to?

450
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,630
I'm sorry.

451
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,750
I just started working here.

452
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,630
- Excuse me... 
 - I heard Kang Hae Ra is marrying Lee Hoon Seok.

453
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,090
Really?

454
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,850
She totally lucked out.

455
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,050
I heard Lee Hoon Seok comes from an amazing family.

456
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,550
Kang Hae Ra hit it big ever since Yi Hyeon sunbae's scandal.

457
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,260
But I heard that Yi Hyeon sunbae recommended her for that position.

458
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,620
I heard Yi Hyeon sunbae took care of Kang Hae Ra

459
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,950
since she was her college hoobae.

460
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,900
That's why you don't care for another human.

461
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,170
That's what I'm saying.

462
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,630
 Haven't you ever 

463
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,020
 received help from others all this time? 

464
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,560
 I've never. 

465
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,670
Do Yoon.

466
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,010
Yes?

467
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,390
If you were a lawyer,

468
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,990
when would you work the hardest?

469
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,760
I'm not sure.

470
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,860
For me, it's when...

471
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,470
I empathize with my client.

472
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,060
There's no...

473
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,410
motivation like empathy.

474
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,850
Kang Hae Ra's...

475
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,470
damages claim from the publishing company.

476
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,200
Find out how far it went.

477
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,350
Okay.

478
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,520
 

479
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,890
   

480
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,390
   

481
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,730
Wow, she really came.

482
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,160
Hey, come! She really came.

483
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,330
Whoa...

484
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,000
She's really here.

485
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,180
So what do you want to expose?

486
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,190
The bastard who owns the PC Cafe over there.

487
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,500
I asked for a refund on a prepaid flat rate.

488
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,280
He said nothing about no refunds.

489
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,920
So...

490
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,660
you're saying you don't work here.

491
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,800
Yes.

492
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,590
Anyway...

493
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,860
that prick should be exposed to come to his senses.

494
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,920
Hey, say something, crap.

495
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,740
Let's totally destroy this PC Cafe.

496
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:32,460
Noona, I'm totally your fan.

497
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,190
Look over here.

498
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,480
I got a text. Wait.

499
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,590
   

500
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,830
 

501
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,020
Hi, Mr. Yang Jin Goo.

502
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,480
You sent me a direct message about being harassed as a security guard.

503
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,500
If you give me your address, I'll come to you.

504
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,360
Gyeonggido...

505
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,180
Yangpyeonggun...

506
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,290
Gangsanmyeon...

507
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,640
I did put it together quickly.

508
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,290
What are you going to do with this?

509
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,730
I need to convince someone...

510
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,860
that I'm on her side for now.

511
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,260
Okay. Fine then.

512
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,080
I'll see you soon.

513
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,320
  The call is not going through. After the beep...  

514
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,260
  you'll be connected to the voicemail.  

515
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,180
Mr. Yang Jin Goo.

516
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,700
It took me

517
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,160
an hour and a half from Seoul to get here.

518
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,730
How can you not answer my calls?

519
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,230
I'll wait ten more minutes in front of the market near your house.

520
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,640
If you don't show up, I'm leaving.

521
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,200
 

522
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,140
   

523
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,340
   

524
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,420
Ahjussi.

525
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,510
How have you been?

526
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,850
All right.

527
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:12,120
So good.

528
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,310
When I heard from Eun Hye, I thought, "What? Cafe?"

529
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:16,890
Rather than a private detective,

530
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,110
being a cafe owner suits you better.

531
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,430
I heard you're staying with Eun Hye these days.

532
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,360
Eun Hye told me over the phone.

533
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,420
I came to meet an informant who wanted to report an issue.

534
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,580
I remembered that you run a cafe around here.

535
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,540
Of all places...

536
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,820
The informant...

537
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,870
and Ahjussi...

538
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:18,730
 

539
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,580
 

540
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,200
Ha Yul...

541
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,950
Are you well?

542
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,520
I'm sorry. I came too late.

543
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:51,190
I missed you so much, Ha Yul.

544
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,730
 

545
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,410
But I had...

546
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:04,050
too much going on lately. I'm sorry.

547
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,670
Ha Yul...

548
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,510
I couldn't even protect you.

549
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:19,260
I'm sorry, I couldn't visit you often.

550
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,450
Ha Yul...

551
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,820
Now that Ga On is older,

552
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,220
I couldn't visit on his actual memorial day.

553
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,900
I feel down for a few days after I visit here.

554
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,800
Ahjussi.

555
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,140
October is...

556
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,260
like a swamp in my life.

557
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,410
When October comes,

558
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,060
It always feels like...

559
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,050
it's pulling me down somewhere.

560
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,380
See?

561
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,590
I climbed up, struggling desperately,

562
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,060
yet I'm back here again.

563
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
It will be okay.

564
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,410
Let's hurry up and leave.

565
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,850
You've been away from your cafe for too long.

566
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:39,260
Okay.

567
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,020
   

568
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,030
Is it that child?

569
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,720
I'll answer it later.

570
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,880
Oh, yeah.

571
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:10,780
You still haven't found her, right?

572
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,070
I'm still asking around.

573
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:17,690
But gosh. I wonder if she left the country.

574
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,470
All right then. Go home safely.

575
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,590
Yes. I'll visit you with Eun Hye next time.

576
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,760
 The installation is complete. 

577
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,110
Thank you.

578
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,410
   

579
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,180
 Mom, give me your hand. 

580
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,840
While I'm away, just think this ring is me.

581
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:49,610
This ring will protect you, Mom.

582
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,670
Let's go there again.

583
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,510
- It was so tasty, huh? 
 - That's right.

584
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,940
Okay.

585
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,970
Here are my cuties.

586
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,930
Gosh.

587
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:42,340
   

588
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:58,400
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

589
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,940
My son, happy birthday!

590
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,670
 Mom, why didn't you answer the phone? 

591
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,610
Sorry, Ga On.

592
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,420
I was working. I missed your call.

593
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:12,750
I sent you a gift, Ga On.

594
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,400
 Ta-da! It arrived yesterday. 

595
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,400
 How do I look? Isn't it awesome? 

596
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,050
Wow!

597
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,520
You look so cool!

598
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,740
 Mom, I love it. 

599
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,110
 My friends say it's cool. 

600
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,290
Ga On.

601
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:31,890
Don't forget to wear your helmet and knee pads.

602
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,310
Got it?

603
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,550
 Gosh, don't worry, Mom. 

604
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,220
 I have to go to school now. 

605
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,030
 I'll call you back later. 

606
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,440
Okay. Be careful.

607
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,490
I love you, son.

608
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,380
Ga On should be celebrated today.

609
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,450
I'm the only one...

610
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,720
Ga On has.

611
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,780
Ga On is...

612
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,650
the best gift to me.

613
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,000
 I said I'll pay you back! He's only a highschooler! 

614
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,450
 It was your brother's choice. 

615
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:45,160
Why are you butting in with your brother's choice?

616
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,270
Let's go.

617
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,540
Hey, Jung Hoon.

618
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,390
If you don't come out,

619
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:50,860
the police will have

620
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:52,300
the accounts under your name.

621
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,990
Then you can forget about school.

622
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:56,350
You'll get arrested for the overdraft.

623
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,980
Come on!

624
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,640
Hyung!

625
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,120
Punk. Are you crazy?

626
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,790
Move them.

627
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,580
 What are you looking at? 

628
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,730
 Go on! 

629
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,360
 - Go on. 
 - What are you doing in front of our office? 

630
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,760
Hyung, let's go.

631
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:07,360
 For minors who are orphans, 

632
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,170
they have them overdraft and even panhandle

633
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:12,270
to make money to collect the debt.

634
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,750
Why are you doing that yourself?

635
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,460
Didn't Jung Woo come to work?

636
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,560
I don't know.

637
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,350
Jung Woo doesn't answer his phone, either.

638
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,150
Thanks for helping me with the recording setup.

639
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,820
But you're still a highschooler.

640
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,280
Must you work at a place like this?

641
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,380
Don't you have anywhere else to work?

642
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,870
Where else?

643
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,670
Where could a highschooler

644
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,120
earn this much without messing up my life?

645
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,890
 It can't be. 

646
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,200
Hi, Dad.

647
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,740
Where is this smell coming from?

648
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:43,420
On Kang Hae Ra's damages claim,

649
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,980
did you see anything unusual?

650
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,890
 I was going to tell you anyway. 

651
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,520
 The publishing company's insurance company 

652
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,080
 turned over Kang Hae Ra's claim 

653
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,540
 to InBank Credit Reporting Agency. 

654
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,880
InBank?

655
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,790
InBank...

656
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,750
 Is that a problem? 

657
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,590
Let me check it out first.

658
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,390
How did you find me here?

659
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,660
Why get scared?

660
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,580
Why?

661
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,990
Are you worried I might slash your face like a thug?

662
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,380
You're afraid that you couldn't

663
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,840
go around with that pretty face of yours?

664
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,350
Is this what you want?

665
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:04,690
To act like a thug?

666
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:36,430
A thug.

667
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,570
I can call myself a thug,

668
00:57:41,570 --> 00:57:44,420
but to hear someone else call me that

669
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:48,730
bothers the heck out of me!

670
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,290
You know what?

671
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,430
When the other person treats me like a thug,

672
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:10,410
I become a thug in front of her.

673
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:12,780
If they treat me like a human, I'm human.

674
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,780
You turned me into a thug today.

675
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,860
Let's die together.

676
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:36,170
You crazy bastard.

677
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,850
Gosh.

678
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:48,900
She should've said it's her baby's memorial day.

679
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,850
How could she have said that herself?

680
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:54,370
I should've known.

681
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:58,410
I can't go inside empty-handed.

682
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,910
Okay.

683
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,050
   

684
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:18,680
Cha Min Joon?

685
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,820
A man.

686
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:24,620
After wrecking up my life?

687
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:27,200
    
 He must really like you a lot.

688
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,950
He should give up if you don't answer.

689
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,410
So pathetic.

690
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:33,420
Just like how you're racking your brain to survive.

691
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:34,960
It shows.

692
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,530
Racking your brain.

693
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,130
You've been thinking, "How can I escape this alive?"

694
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:40,910
That's what you've been thinking.

695
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:45,530
   

696
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:56,130
Is trying to survive funny to you?

697
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,870
You say it's pathetic wanting to survive?

698
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,430
How about you?

699
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:09,020
You should die alone.

700
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:11,200
Why did you come looking for me so pathetically?

701
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,830
You didn't come here to die.

702
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:15,650
You came to relieve your anger.

703
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,830
If that's why you're here,

704
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:20,920
take it easy and do it another way.

705
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,030
If I were to end my life because I felt pathetic,

706
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,390
I would've ended it a long time ago.

707
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,280
 

708
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,580
I don't want to waste my enduring effort all this time.

709
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:58,660
I can't die.

710
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,590
I said don't move.

711
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:04,960
I'm not joking here.

712
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,270
I'll burn everything down!

713
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,660
Putting on a show like this

714
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,570
means you have no intention of dying.

715
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:59,370
Kang Hae Ra...

716
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,340
you should pay back what you owe!

717
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:04,160
If you're late on your payment, you should answer your phone, at least.

718
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:10,560
Rookie!

719
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,160
Wow, great, great.

720
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,660
Whoa...

721
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:15,230
Kang Hae Ra!

722
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,430
I'm from Happy Credit.

723
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:34,370
♫  We were passionate, facing each other  ♫

724
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:41,960
♫  Carrying the memory of being together while bridging the gap between us  ♫

725
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,620
 

726
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,550
 

727
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:49,970
   	
  My target is Chairman Kim. 

728
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:52,690
 How would he corner the old sly fox? 

729
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:57,050
 Pull it together, Han Jung Woo! 

730
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:59,460
 Are you going to ruin your life like this? 

731
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:00,940
 You decide. 

732
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,380
 It's Choi. 

733
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,650
 He's the most vicious one of all. 

734
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:07,090
 I won't warn only you, ahjumma. 

735
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:09,110
 I'll find your kid as well. 

736
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:10,970
 When things get dangerous, 

737
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,900
 you don't have to put yourself out there. 

738
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,850
 Hey, Kang Hae Ra! 

739
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:26,670
