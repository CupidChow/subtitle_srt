1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,900
 

2
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,000
 

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,010
 

4
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,740
It's 12,000 won. Your ID, please.

5
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,800
   

6
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,460
   

7
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,800
 Yeah, just for a short while. 

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,860
 Until those people forget about me. 

9
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,240
Hey, hey, stop.

10
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,410
Wait, stop.

11
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,890
I didn't hear about loading a truck today.

12
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,900
Mr. Kim, did you know about this?

13
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,030
Aigoo, I already talk to the owner.

14
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,310
Don't make a big fuss,

15
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,510
and just let him go in.

16
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,240
I told him so many times that we can't do that.

17
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,190
Are you calling your boss?

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,310
It's no use.

19
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,560
He left for a business trip to Japan today.

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,840
The engine and the ship are so old as it is.

21
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,790
Hey, come on now! What's with you?

22
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,500
People can hear you.

23
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,320
Just this once. Turn a blind eye and let him in.

24
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,100
Geez...

25
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,870
How heavy?

26
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,750
This?

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,580
It's not even that heavy.

28
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,000
You take care of this, okay?

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,410
Okay, go ahead.

30
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,190
All right, all right!

31
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,470
We'll aboard soon.

32
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,580
Have your ID and tickets ready.

33
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,550
All right.

34
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,040
Excuse me, do you still have my ticket?

35
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,520
Thank you.

36
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,000
   

37
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,550
 Around 5:40 p.m. this evening, 

38
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,330
 the ferry leaving the Gunsan Port headed to Ulmyeondo 

39
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,370
 sank underwater. 

40
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,880
 Due to this accident, among 156  

41
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,040
 crew members and passengers, 

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,950
 92 people died and 62 people are still missing. 

43
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,140
But what if...

44
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,670
something really goes wrong?

45
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,830
I won't be alone.

46
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,630
You, him...

47
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,510
Eun Hye, and Mr. Cha...

48
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,810
There are lots of helpers.

49
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,240
   

50
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,210
 I told Choi where you are, Noona. 

51
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,360
 He'll arrive soon. 

52
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,490
   

53
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,690
When you give a signal, we'll go right in.

54
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,060
Okay.

55
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,690
You must be careful.

56
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,520
Call right away if you're in danger.

57
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,080
All right.

58
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,530
 When you capture the situation, let it go live. 

59
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,750
 Don't forget to capture the scene 

60
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,790
 so anyone can tell what's going on. 

61
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,020
   

62
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,290
 Fail! 

63
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,270
 You did great! 

64
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,250
 Okay, next. Number four! 

65
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,050
Okay, I'll start.

66
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,330
All right then. Mr. Kim and Mr. Ahn took the kidneys.

67
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,730
Okay. Today's highlight.

68
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,740
 Bravo! 

69
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,100
 The ones you can't squeeze more out of. 

70
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,270
 Send them to the fish market. 

71
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,680
 The fish market... 

72
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,740
 "Fish market" is slang for the location that organ auction brokers refer to. 

73
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,150
 How about the auction? 

74
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,890
 I'm not sure about that yet. 

75
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,780
Hey.

76
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,580
What the hell are you guys doing right now?

77
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,980
 Mr. Choi! 

78
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,430
Okay.

79
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,880
Yes, next...

80
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,360
Hey, the mic...

81
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,630
Geez. Sorry, sorry.

82
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,550
Okay, next...

83
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,610
Let's get started with our organ auction!

84
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,920
All right.

85
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,560
Mr. Kim and Mr. Ahn took kidneys.

86
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,240
Let's get down to business.

87
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,570
A heart.

88
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,300
Let's go with heart!

89
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,650
 - All right! 
 - Great! 

90
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,110
For a heart, it's usually two big ones. (200 million won)

91
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,310
Today, as a special, we'll start with one big one! (100 million won)

92
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,340
Raise your hands!

93
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,820
Wait, wait, wait!

94
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,630
No, do it again.

95
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,520
Okay, we usually go with two big ones.

96
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,540
We'll start with one and a half. We'll go again!

97
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,710
- Raise your hand!
 - You damn bastards!

98
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,320
What the hell are you guys doing?

99
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,240
"What the hell are you guys doing?"

100
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,490
"You damn bastards."

101
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,300
What the hell?

102
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,890
- What's going on? 
 - A blackout?

103
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,910
I think we captured the scene pretty well.

104
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,160
Prosecutor Jang!

105
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,020
I think you can come in now.

106
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,420
 What the heck is that? 

107
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,880
Wait, wait, wait!

108
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,380
I'm a trot singer.

109
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,320
I was performing...

110
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,200
Geez!

111
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,080
   

112
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,760
 It's hard to believe even after seeing with your own eyes. 

113
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,130
A site of organ auction.

114
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,300
It was Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency's new episode.

115
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,760
 It's hard to believe even after seeing with your own eyes. 

116
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,300
 A site of organ auction. 

117
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,770
 It was Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency's new episode. 

118
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,560
   

119
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,290
It's me.

120
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,190
Where is Kang Hae Ra right now?

121
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,980
   

122
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,300
It was Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency.

123
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,480
Cut!

124
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,760
Okay!

125
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,100
You came.

126
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,680
We were able to wrap up safely, thanks to Prosecutor Jang.

127
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,070
Oh, and Jung Woo...

128
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,680
The witness protection program.

129
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,920
Please double check that.

130
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,220
Even though we pixelated the photo, you never know.

131
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,400
I uploaded the second part.

132
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,600
   

133
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,830
Hey.

134
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,980
You don't know Kang? That doesn't make sense.

135
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,440
I have nothing more to say.

136
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,910
I'll plead the fifth until my lawyer arrives.

137
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,690
I just ought to!

138
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,690
Okay.

139
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,970
 I'll keep the 50 million won that we made at the fish market tonight. 

140
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,830
 Don't forget to report to Mr. Kang minus 50 million won. 

141
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,840
 Yes, sir! 

142
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,410
I'll take 20 million won, you each get 10 million won.

143
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,210
Any complaints?

144
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,670
 No, sir. 

145
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,640
Consider yourself lucky.

146
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,930
You just joined us.

147
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,990
Anyway, I'll tell Mr. Kang the total minus 50 million won.

148
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,550
To be blunt, we do all the hard work.

149
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,300
We should have this kind of fun for us to do our business.

150
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,700
 You're right, sir. 

151
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,860
The "Mr. Kang" you mentioned here

152
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,710
is the Mr. Kang Dae Shik of Happy Credit, right?

153
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,560
Where did you get this recording?

154
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,320
If you investigated in secret, that's illegal.

155
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,400
If you obtained it illegally, you can't use it in this case.

156
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,460
And do you have proof that it's my voice in that recording?

157
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,400
If that's unfair, let's have a "four-party confrontation."

158
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,960
It's not anything new for the Korean prosecution to entrap someone.

159
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,470
"A four-party confrontation"?

160
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,590
Isn't it "a three-party confrontation?"

161
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,190
Geez, look at this guy.

162
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,260
You make me show off my knowledge all the way here at the Prosecutors' Office.

163
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,000
"A three-party confrontation" is for three people.

164
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,490
If you bring in people in the recording, there are four people, including me.

165
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,580
Doesn't that make it "a four-party confrontation"?

166
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,020
I see.

167
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,420
There were four people in the recording?

168
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,930
Geez! You're so frustrating!

169
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,760
Are you sure you passed the bar?

170
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,250
I said I'd keep a total of 50 million won.

171
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,430
I said I'd keep 20 million won of that.

172
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,760
And I said I'd give 10 million won  to each of them.

173
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,160
So how many people is that total?

174
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,730
Four people!

175
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,900
Geez, so frustrating!

176
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,140
Geez...

177
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,170
Follow me!

178
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,130
Over there.

179
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,740
Police.

180
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,940
If you don't open it, we'll break it down.

181
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,440
- What's going on?
 - Excuse us.

182
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,500
- Police.
 - What's going on?

183
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,510
Where is Mr. Cha?

184
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,190
He left early, saying he's got stuff to do for tomorrow morning.

185
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,380
See?

186
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,310
I was right.

187
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,550
He only knows how to work. He doesn't know how to have fun.

188
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,350
What happened to what I asked about?

189
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,030
Here you go.

190
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,920
What's this?

191
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,560
Who's this?

192
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,370
She looks familiar.

193
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,870
She's Cha Yi Hyeon at FBC from 12 years ago.

194
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,800
Cha Yi Hyeon...

195
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,580
Right.

196
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,910
I remember now.

197
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,200
So what about Cha Yi Hyeon?

198
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,480
Mr. Cha is Cha Yi Hyeon's younger brother.

199
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,170
So it wasn't listed on his personal profile?

200
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,520
It looks like he submitted

201
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,190
paperwork that did not list deceased or missing.

202
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,700
Cha Yi Hyeon died?

203
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,590
I don't think she's dead...

204
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,580
She's missing.

205
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,150
Missing?

206
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,400
Let me see...

207
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:21,070
I feel like I received something from Cha Yi Hyeon at some point.

208
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,350
 

209
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,690
 - What is it?
 - It's from Cha Yi Hyeon. 

210
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,760
 Put it away. 

211
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,390
That means Cha Min Joon joined us intentionally.

212
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,040
How dare he...

213
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,630
- Mr. Ko.
 - Yes?

214
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:10,260
Find out if Tae On is linked to Cha Yi Hyeon's disappearance.

215
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,140
All right, will do.

216
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,160
    
 It wasn't just the organ auction. 

217
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,630
 In the case of minors who inherited their parent's debt, 

218
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,630
 they were evil enough to pull them into their criminal activities. 

219
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,220
 Then the right of indemnity against your deceased father 

220
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,720
 was turned over to you and your younger brother. 

221
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,900
 Yes. 

222
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,340
 They bothered us since then. 

223
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,390
 They asked my brother to make illegal withdrawals and 

224
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,940
  made me stab someone saying I'm threatening a debtor. 

225
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,540
 But for minors without parents to handle... 

226
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,050
 it was too much of a burden. 

227
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:53,000
 It was Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency. 

228
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,390
   

229
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,090
- Yes?
  - What do you want to add all of a sudden? 

230
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,380
It's a clip that was posted on VTube yesterday.

231
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,110
PBS people aired it this morning real quick.

232
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,530
It looks like they aired it hurriedly.

233
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,090
This isn't that light of news.

234
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,940
I think we should cover it fully first.

235
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,560
 - Are you in the editing room? 
 - Yes.

236
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,450
I just finished editing.

237
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,250
Please come to the editing room.

238
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,900
 For not being able to pay off the debt, 

239
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,180
 the organs of live people were auctioned off at this gruesome location. 

240
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,190
 That's not all. 

241
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,520
"I can't believe there still are...

242
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,310
there still are illegal organ auction sites."

243
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,510
Who got this news?

244
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,110
Was it you, PD Shin?

245
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,930
I did.

246
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,150
PBS did air it first, but...

247
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,620
If we report it more in-depth...

248
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,550
If you want to do whatever you want, why work within an organization?

249
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,360
If you all want to keep your job, do what you need to do!

250
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,060
Here you go.

251
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,470
I wrote it like this.

252
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,990
   
 "The bonds managed by Happy Credit"

253
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,150
"originated from FB Life."

254
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,650
Good job.

255
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,570
I emailed it to you, too.

256
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,210
   

257
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,860
Done.

258
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,250
Yeah. What's this?

259
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,710
It's an article on FB Life's Chairman Kim.

260
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,440
 I even sent you a bait with it. 

261
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,460
Try to catch a big fish.

262
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,740
   

263
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,040
   

264
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,750
   

265
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,670
PBS started to air it. It's pretty viral online.

266
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,090
But Chairman hasn't made his move yet, to my knowledge.

267
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,700
Where are you?

268
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,890
Yes.

269
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,800
I'll be there soon.

270
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,390
You're running late.

271
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,940
I received a call from Dr. Choi just as I was leaving.

272
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,890
From Dr. Choi?

273
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,470
Mom's breathing got unstable all of a sudden.

274
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,160
She's better now.

275
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,970
Is that right?

276
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,970
All right.

277
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,530
Chairman.

278
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,380
Oh, yes. Good day.

279
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,090
Is she the emcee for today's event?

280
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,030
Yes, she's Cha Yi Hyeon.

281
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,900
Cha Yi Hyeon.

282
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,120
   

283
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,700
 I'm not that patient. 

284
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,480
 You have two days. 

285
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,310
 If I don't hear from you by then, 

286
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,020
 you'll see this picture on the news. 

287
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,380
Don't forget to pixelate the face

288
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,380
and silence the names and company.

289
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,740
Okay.

290
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,090
Yes?

291
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,600
Yes, Reporter Jung.

292
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,330
Of course, you can write about it.

293
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,360
You'll credit us as the source, right?

294
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,250
Yes, I'll make three parts as a series.

295
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,990
Yes, I'll talk to you later.

296
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,000
Hey.

297
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,600
Hello?

298
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,150
Yes, you saw the news.

299
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,770
Yes, that's right.

300
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,980
Yes.

301
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,900
Here.

302
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,570
Yes, yes.

303
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,430
Okay.

304
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,760
I'll see you then.

305
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,670
He saw the PBS morning news.

306
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,590
The sources are more eager to make their move now.

307
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,970
Whoa...

308
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,930
We broke the news first

309
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,630
and that's how the TV stations are reporting it.

310
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,150
I'll go and meet with the source.

311
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,750
Check the replies and direct messages.

312
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,960
You're busy, but I'm no help.

313
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,800
I wish I can drive you, at least.

314
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,660
Just get better.

315
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,950
See you.

316
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,650
So your principal was 5 million won, right?

317
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,800
Yes.

318
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,210
And that became 50 million won in a year.

319
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,450
Now, they come to my house and tell me to look after my health.

320
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,560
I'm so scared.

321
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,880
What?

322
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,060
Come on.

323
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,740
   

324
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,360
What? "Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency"?

325
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,640
Make sure...

326
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,310
our name is never mentioned.

327
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,550
Yes.

328
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,860
What's this?

329
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,620
A package that Cha Yi Hyeon sent you 11 years ago.

330
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,180
Open it.

331
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,850
 

332
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,170
What's this?

333
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,470
Cha Yi Hyeon had this side to her?

334
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,820
Wow, I miss her.

335
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,950
Where is Cha Yi Hyeon?

336
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,050
We're looking for her at the moment.

337
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,600
Over here.

338
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,790
What took you so long?

339
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,250
My meeting ran long.

340
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,840
- What do you want to drink?
 - I drank already.

341
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,600
So you're not on the scene anymore now that you're an anchor?

342
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,730
Let's get to the point.

343
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,510
We're not that friendly to catch up, you know?

344
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,740
So pushy.

345
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,280
I was trying to be polite.

346
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,740
But this is more comfortable for both of us.

347
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,230
We killed it right away.

348
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,860
You handle life and style issues, right?

349
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,530
Can't you cover it like it's a related issue and report this?

350
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,310
The response is good, but

351
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,460
I guess everyone is scared.

352
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,440
No wonder he was so furious.

353
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,010
Did you fact check this?

354
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,090
Of course. Look at the back.

355
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,170
It's not original.

356
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,170
It looks like it was taken with a cellphone.

357
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,140
Who took these?

358
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,100
As for that...

359
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,800
Anyway, the Happy Credit case mentioned in there.

360
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,560
You know Kang Hae Ra broke the news on her VTube, right?

361
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,880
Wait.

362
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,780
I should just subscribe.

363
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,550
Don't you know Kang Hae Ra?

364
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,640
She used to be at FBC, too.

365
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,100
I found it.

366
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,880
Anyway, SNS is going crazy right now.

367
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,240
Along with that, if you exposed the story in a series...

368
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,610
Got it.

369
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,880
Why? Leaving already?

370
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,310
Aren't you interested?

371
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,680
I can't decide on this alone.

372
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,660
Well, anyway, I'll talk to the higher-ups.

373
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,890
Hey.

374
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,290
   

375
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,070
I finished editing.

376
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,800
I'll upload part three.

377
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,380
 My principal was 5 million won. 

378
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,750
 Now, it multiplied to 50 million won. 

379
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,410
 If you borrowed money from someone, 

380
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,050
 you should pay. 

381
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,390
 If you damaged someone's property, 

382
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,010
 you should compensate for the damage. 

383
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,860
 It's just that it can't be illegal or unethical. 

384
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,190
 It has to be done within the law 

385
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,360
 where the lives of creditor and debtor can coexist. 

386
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,900
 I hope this serves as a warning to those 

387
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,080
 who are conducting illegal collection somewhere. 

388
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,940
 This will be it for this episode. 

389
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,000
 This is Kang Hae Ra's Live Revenge Agency. 

390
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,200
Whoa, done.

391
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,650
The number of views keeps going up.

392
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,690
You already have 700,000 subscribers.

393
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,510
Aren't you setting a record for most subscribers in the shortest amount of time?

394
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,230
We'll have to keep an eye on it.

395
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,650
Anyway, we should start getting ready.

396
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,480
I'll just sit back...

397
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,250
and reap the reward.

398
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,680
Gosh.

399
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,420
My...

400
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,820
hand is almost healed.

401
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,690
And you completed your mission.

402
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,370
Shouldn't we go out and celebrate?

403
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,500
Well, ma'am.

404
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,300
If you used us to this extent,

405
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,610
shouldn't you repay us somehow?

406
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,250
Don't you think?

407
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,970
Well...

408
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,920
True. You held out for a long time.

409
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,270
Are you allowed to drink now?

410
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,760
So I asked her while taking out my stitches.

411
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,020
By chance, could I clean out the bacteria that might have

412
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,360
entered my system with alcohol?

413
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,720
She said, do whatever I want to do.

414
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,590
You, too?

415
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,400
Fine.

416
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,750
Let's go for a drink.

417
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,380
 Yes! 

418
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,280
Dad is doing that?

419
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,740
The company is blocking all the articles

420
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,280
that are linked to FB Group.

421
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,920
He's had enough.

422
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,590
How much greedier can he get?

423
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,480
Where are we meeting the FB Financial people tomorrow?

424
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,720
At the suite in H-Hotel.

425
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,550
You contacted them without Chairman Kim's people catching on, right?

426
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:19,810
Double-check the people who are close to FB Financial people as well.

427
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,080
Okay.

428
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,570
 Turn FB Financial into a holding company.
 

429
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,550
 Then the rest of the subsidiaries will take care of itself.
 

430
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,780
He's sharp, but...

431
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,320
he doesn't know his place. Not sure about him.

432
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,960
What should I do?

433
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,600
I'd better get rid of him after everything is finished, right?

434
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,590
 Even though it's going crazy in SNS, 

435
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,200
the newspapers and the mainstream media is quiet.

436
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,800
Anyway...

437
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,400
we stopped one source of Chairman Kim's money flow.

438
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,670
If he hasn't learned, I'm sure he'll make his move soon.

439
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,660
You haven't said much in the last ten years,

440
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,750
so I thought you let go of taking revenge and decided to move on.

441
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,220
It's amazing that you've even done this much.

442
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,170
Ironically, it's all thanks to Kang Hae Ra.

443
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,370
She played a good part as a cheat key.

444
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,880
Oh, yeah.

445
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,230
You should prepare a case on her, too.

446
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,150
It was hard for me to see her

447
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,650
this time, too.

448
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,860
I don't know if...

449
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,060
Yi Hyeon is dead or alive.

450
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,820
Is it right to rescue that woman?

451
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,380
- Should I leave her there?
 - Hyung.

452
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,590
You should forget her now.

453
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,560
It's been over ten years...

454
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,350
You've done enough, and Noona knows that.

455
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,320
As for me...

456
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,510
I'm her younger brother.

457
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,760
Min Joon.

458
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,890
How can I forget her?

459
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,090
I...

460
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:21,140
couldn't have taken the bar without Yi Hyeon.

461
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,740
But...

462
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,690
that woman was quite something.

463
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,870
When the situation is progressing that way,

464
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,750
it would've been tough for me to stay focused even as a man.

465
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,340
She waited until the last moment,

466
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,330
and when she got the picture she wanted, only then...

467
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,920
"Okay."

468
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,990
"I think we captured the scene pretty well."

469
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,150
"Prosecutor Jang, I think you can come in now."

470
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,000
Whoa...

471
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,260
She's not an ordinary person for sure.

472
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,930
But I wonder...

473
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,590
if she was scared at all at that moment.

474
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,080
   

475
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,350
   

476
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,470
Hello.

477
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,650
Hello.

478
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,260
What brings you here?

479
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,280
If you two have some free time tonight,

480
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,610
I'd like to invite you to dinner.

481
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,150
It's nothing fancy.

482
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,440
We'll just eat in our office.

483
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,560
It'd be great if that prosecutor can join us, too.

484
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,620
Oh, well...

485
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,460
Aren't we going to keep working together?

486
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,790
It's like a team dinner to promote unity.

487
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,240
Don't be burdened. Join us.

488
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,890
You come, too. You like pork belly, right?

489
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,400
Oh, well...

490
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,290
Then, we'll count you in.

491
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,480
We'll prepare food accordingly.

492
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,840
Let's go.

493
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,010
Keep working together?

494
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,320
I think we should've suggested it first.

495
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,680
Won't you be uncomfortable?

496
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:38,160
 The number you dialed does not exist. 

497
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,040
   

498
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,960
   

499
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,240
  The call is not going through. After the beep...  

500
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,950
Kang Hae Ra.

501
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,750
Kang Hae Ra.

502
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,000
It's me. Cha Min Joon.

503
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,340
Yes.

504
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,870
I'm sorry.

505
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,950
It looked like the bag was heavy.

506
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,460
I see.

507
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,540
 Cheers! 

508
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,310
Now that you had your first drink to your liking,

509
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,640
let's drink the second drink for unity.

510
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,180
Let's drink soju and beer mix.

511
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,250
I have an amazing method of my own.

512
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,950
I'm fine.

513
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,460
I don't drink mixed drinks.

514
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,490
You're not a real man.

515
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:34,100
Oh, is this your first job?

516
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,660
I think you're the one without workplace experience.

517
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,670
People don't push this type of gesture anymore.

518
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,990
- I see.
 - How about you, Mr. Cha?

519
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,740
I have many cases to work on.

520
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,430
You helped us in the midst of your busy schedule.

521
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,000
I'll treat you separately another time.

522
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,610
By chance, did you experience something unfair

523
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,760
so you studied law to avoid such an experience?

524
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,900
What the heck?

525
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,930
What's so great about Mr. Cha?

526
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:07,180
If a family member was sick in your childhood,

527
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,240
you dream of becoming a doctor.

528
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,830
If you experienced an unfair situation,

529
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,950
you want to become a lawyer.

530
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,220
If neither is the case, since he's smart,

531
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,780
he chose a career that makes lots of money.

532
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,230
That sounds about right.

533
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,640
Gosh, my man.

534
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,400
Whatever the reason,

535
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,800
I'd like to get to know you better.

536
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,430
Here. Take a wrap.

537
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,690
Aigoo.

538
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,440
Let's work together for a long time.

539
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,680
The stem.

540
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,670
Aigoo, that's right.

541
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,880
Hyung?

542
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,520
Hyung.

543
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,100
Did you put spicy pepper in it?

544
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,740
- What?
 - He can't eat spicy food.

545
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,980
Hyung.

546
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,860
Spit it out.

547
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,800
Hey.

548
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,710
Is this spicy pepper?

549
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,890
I'm sorry.

550
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,330
Drink water.

551
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,960
Thank you.

552
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,130
You were trying to entice him with a wrap.

553
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,830
What the heck are you saying?

554
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,640
You got what you deserve.

555
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,600
What?

556
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,260
You want a taste of something spicy?

557
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,560
Here is some honey tea. Try it.

558
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,100
I heard it tones down the spiciness.

559
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,800
Thank you.

560
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,490
Honey tea? How about me?

561
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,280
I'll give you some later.

562
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,780
Whoa, what's going on with you two?

563
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,930
Honey tea and all...

564
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,220
Stop it. You make him feel uncomfortable.

565
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,470
You're a lawyer.

566
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,430
Why can't you defend yourself?

567
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,530
Why can't you say you can't eat spicy food?

568
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:18,790
How about me? Why don't you give me a wrap?

569
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,880
I eat spicy food very well.

570
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,810
I'm not a picky eater, either.

571
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,540
I've been waiting from earlier on.

572
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,970
Give me a wrap, too.

573
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,910
Give me a wrap, too!

574
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,920
Give me a wrap, too!

575
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,940
Here's a wrap! Gosh, so noisy.

576
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,790
Gosh. I'll get more of the honey tea.

577
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,920
- Do Yoon, do you want some?
 - No, thank you.

578
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,540
Then you'll get a beating.

579
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,250
Why did you hit me?

580
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,090
You got drunk over a glass of mixed drink.

581
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,050
If I lie down for ten minutes,

582
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,890
I'll wake up real quick.

583
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,300
What?

584
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,380
Hey.

585
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,050
You're going to sleep now?

586
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,470
Geez.

587
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,020
He's an ugly drunk.

588
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,860
 

589
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,790
Hi, Ga On.

590
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:50,530
Yeah, I'm eating dinner.

591
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,740
 With a friend? 

592
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,300
Yeah, with friends.

593
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,900
 What are you eating? 

594
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,310
Rice, meat...

595
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,780
a little bit of beer.

596
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,410
 Great, Mom! 

597
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,980
 You should meet your friends sometimes. 

598
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,170
Hey, you sound like the mom.

599
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,580
All right, Ga On.

600
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,160
I'll enjoy my dinner. Be careful at school.

601
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,240
I love you.

602
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,630
Oh, yeah.

603
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,370
I'd like you to get rid of a woman.

604
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,900
Kim Hyun Sung.

605
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,410
Hey.

606
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,860
Hey, hey, hey.

607
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,430
Hey.

608
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:15,810
You said it only takes ten minutes to wake up.

609
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,920
- Gosh, seriously.
 - Hey, hey, hey.

610
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,270
Hey, wake up!

611
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,600
Where does he live?

612
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,640
Him? He doesn't have a place.

613
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,640
He's staying with us.

614
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,560
He sleeps on this sofa.

615
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,750
I see.

616
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,780
Do Yoon.

617
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,640
Let's put him on the sofa.

618
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,440
Okay.

619
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,970
He can't handle his drinks.

620
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,510
Okay.

621
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,930
One, two, three.

622
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,540
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

623
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,850
One more time.

624
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,710
Okay.

625
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,450
   

626
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,010
You'd better answer.

627
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,630
Don't you know you can't come here anymore?

628
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,490
What?

629
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,930
The restraining order?

630
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:58,680
Then should I go to Ga On?

631
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,020
He's still my son on papers.

632
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,650
Don't you dare touch Ga On.

633
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,170
Well?

634
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,900
I don't know what I'm capable of at this point.

635
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,340
   

636
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,180
Yes.

637
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,490
 Team Leader, Chairman wants to see you. 

638
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,980
With this, I think you've done everything

639
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,850
with the audit team.

640
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:25,370
How about taking over a smaller part?

641
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,590
With your guts,

642
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,490
I think you'd do a great job

643
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:35,140
managing my personal funds.

644
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,840
   

645
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:09,770
You're in a good mood.

646
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,080
Yeah.

647
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,820
He may be braver and loyal

648
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,080
dog than I expected.

649
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,870
Yes, Reporter Jo.

650
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:29,890
 The story is killed everywhere including financial sectors and gossip columns. 

651
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,940
 If a slightly similar article posts, 

652
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,090
 they cover it up with another article right away. 

653
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,360
We can't help it.

654
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,650
 But I did all I can. 

655
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:40,290
 So if you have any more stories, 

656
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,800
 - you know, right? 
 - Yes, I got it.

657
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,180
I think it's going to be tough

658
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,540
to push Chairman Kim with bond cases.

659
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,960
The videos on Kang Hae Ra's channel

660
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,980
are getting more hits.

661
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,630
It's meaningless to keep bypassing it.

662
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,750
For now, let's focus on revealing

663
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,340
the damages the victims suffered and their pain.

664
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,920
And after that, when we get reactions...

665
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,940
we can expose Chairman Kim and FB Life then.

666
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,350
- Get me documents.
 - Okay.

667
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,630
   

668
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,880
   

669
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,960
Exactly who am I trying to expose?

670
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,230
You just have to mention the pain the client is experiencing.

671
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:58,190
It shouldn't be about merely revealing the client's suffering,

672
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,030
but we should expose the company

673
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,300
that is at the source of the pain.

674
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,400
If it's a corporation, who is it?

675
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,040
Is it a company culture issue or a management issue?

676
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,460
If your revenge channel mentions the corporation involved,

677
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,250
you become that corporation's opponent.

678
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,300
The company is too overwhelming for you to deal with.

679
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,320
Let's do it right while we're at it.

680
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,740
Hey! I know you're awake.

681
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,230
You're pretending to be sleeping out of shame. Go and wash up.

682
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,760
Get up.

683
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:07,580
Did I push it too far?

684
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,650
What's wrong with me?

685
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,650
Aigoo! Hurry.

686
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:16,020
What's this case about? You're getting started right away.

687
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,850
- Can I see that?
 - Sure.

688
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,360
So, who is the overwhelming opponent?

689
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,910
   

690
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:40,010
You're going up against this man?

691
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:49,500
   

692
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,090
After we succeed with this case and bring Chairman Kim down,

693
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,220
it's the last one working with Kang Hae Ra.

694
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,050
Do Yoon.

695
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,400
Yes?

696
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,980
If you went through such an ordeal,

697
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,600
how would you feel?

698
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:23,880
Pardon?

699
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,340
What ordeal...

700
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,890
Kidnapping...

701
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:32,560
- or...
 - Are you...

702
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,500
worried about Kang Hae Ra?

703
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,700
I'd be scared.

704
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,120
I'm not sure, but...

705
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,000
considering what she did to your sister,

706
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,670
and seeing how she exposed Director Song and Choi,

707
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:58,000
I don't think she's any different from them.

708
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:03,160
If I consider meeting such a vicious and strong woman as my enemy,

709
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,190
I'd be scared...

710
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,920
Do you think she's just strong?

711
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,490
Are you wavering?

712
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,670
About using her for your revenge?

713
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,620
Hyung.

714
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,860
You didn't forget, did you?

715
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,690
What she did to your sister,

716
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,140
and how you've lived.

717
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,910
That woman is...

718
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,550
not the victims you've met all this time.

719
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,520
Think of the people she exposed

720
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,890
and ruined because of her greed.

721
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:59,260
If she finds out we're using her now,

722
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,720
she'll come running in and strangle us.

723
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,200
Emotions like this...

724
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:12,740
are scraps that will wash away after the job is done.

725
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,030
Once we bring down Chairman Kim,

726
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:18,740
we'll never see her again.

727
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,930
Hyung.

728
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,740
It's been ten years...

729
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:31,730
that we've prepared for this.

730
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,860
You didn't forget, right?

731
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,130
The promise you made to me.

732
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,100
Don't worry.

733
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:01,200
I'll let you close the last button.

734
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,700
 Are you Cha Yi Hyeon's younger brother? 

735
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,490
 I'm calling because she was listed as a passenger. 

736
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,500
The captain got paid off

737
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,960
and loaded more cargo!

738
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,980
Let's go see those bastards!

739
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,470
Aigoo, my son!

740
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:25,090
My perfectly healthy son!

741
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:28,980
- Aigoo...
 - It's no use doing this here.

742
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,930
Let's go and talk to...

743
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,550
the captain's family.

744
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,230
Aigoo, okay.

745
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,460
I can't be here like this.

746
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,970
- Let's go.
 - Let's go.

747
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:40,490
Let's go. Let's go.

748
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:43,450
 I'll make them pay for this! 

749
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,830
    
Your husband is dead.

750
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:51,860
You take responsibility!

751
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,230
He caused the accident, and now he's dead?

752
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,400
Bring my son back!

753
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,560
Take responsibility!

754
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,290
My gosh...

755
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:17,430
I feel bad watching Captain Choi's...

756
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:19,090
family.

757
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,500
Anyway, the owner...

758
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,470
must be receiving tons of money through insurance.

759
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,780
He only paid us 50 million won. Does that make sense?

760
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,400
I ought to spill that he put all the blame on Captain Choi.

761
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,250
Be quiet!

762
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,180
   

763
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,220
    
This person will be different from any others.

764
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,630
Think it through...

765
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,640
and you can decide.

766
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:55,260
 Make sure no one finds out that the
 

767
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,920
 bonds came from FB Life.
 

768
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,610
- Or another case—  
 - You became a lawyer...

769
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,860
due to an unfair circumstance, right?

770
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,640
I wanted to become a reporter.

771
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,090
Once I become a reporter,

772
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:14,800
I thought I could take care of the unfair treatment I received.

773
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:18,800
In the end, I couldn't become a reporter.

774
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,430
And since then, I ran forward

775
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:24,800
thinking I need to succeed if I don't want to get trampled on.

776
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,400
But I keep thinking this lately.

777
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,900
Back then...

778
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:34,370
if someone could've supported me,

779
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:38,680
I might be living a different life now.

780
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,020
That person...

781
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:48,330
ended up with me since no one would listen to him.

782
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:53,760
I'd like to provide support for that person.

783
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,820
What the heck?

784
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:13,100
Why meet at a spot like this?

785
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,000
Did you go to the hospital?

786
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:23,740
What?

787
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:39,250
I don't need to go to the hospital for this.

788
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,060
Then when do you need to go?

789
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,560
   

790
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,400
   

791
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,830
   

792
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,620
Are you on your way to meet Lee Hoon Seok?

793
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,040
It's about Ga On. I should go.

794
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,130
In this situation,

795
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:24,030
don't you know how dangerous it is to meet him alone?

796
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,850
Kang Hae Ra.

797
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,590
Why don't you...

798
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:39,130
look after yourself?

799
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,830
 Emotions like this... 

800
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:56,280
 are scraps that will wash away after the job is done. 

801
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,540
 Once we bring down Chairman Kim, 

802
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:01,150
 we'll never see her again. 

803
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:13,800
♫  Would I not feel this pain if I didn't know you?  ♫

804
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:22,900
♫  I wonder if I can turn back the time  ♫

805
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:29,540
♫  I can't forget you no matter how much time goes by  ♫

806
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:34,160
♫  What do I do with my heart that I can't even understand  ♫

807
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,790
 

808
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,200
    
 Hae Ra is working on a case about insurance and the right of indemnity. 

809
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:44,610
 Dad, you were sued over the right of indemnity, too, back then. 

810
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:47,160
 The insurance fraud that Chairman Kim was involved in... 

811
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,050
 I'll file complaints right away. 

812
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,210
    
 Would I need to keep an employee 

813
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:53,240
 who lost his initial focus? 

814
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,130
 We'll meet about Chairman Kim here for now. 

815
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,950
 Kang Hae Ra is working hard. 

816
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:01,450
 I guess only good things will happen in the future. 

817
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:07,640
 

818
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:15,860
