1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:07,020
  			 

2
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,130
   

3
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,690
   

4
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:11,350
♫  If I walk along this path by the moonlight  ♫

5
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,980
♫  Would I forget about my anxious heart of mine?  ♫

6
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:25,180
♫  I can see you even if I close my eyes  ♫

7
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:32,470
♫  I cautiously send out my desperate heart  ♫

8
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:39,430
♫  I will walk through rough life  ♫

9
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:46,330
♫  You and I will stand in the midst of it all  ♫

10
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:53,180
♫  I will not forget our promises  ♫

11
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:00,300
♫  I have it engraved in my heart  ♫

12
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,110
♫  I desperately wish  ♫

13
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,380
♫  Your sad breath  ♫

14
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:15,080
♫  I wish it flies far, far away  ♫

15
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:23,060
♫  I will walk through rough life  ♫

16
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,360
   

17
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,640
Yes, I'm heading to the hospital.

18
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,980
 When I heard about the accident early this morning, 

19
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,740
 I went to the accident site just in case. 

20
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,530
 The accident was on a downhill, but there are no skid marks. 

21
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,610
 Does that mean he didn't step on the brakes? 

22
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,290
Either he didn't step on the brakes or

23
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,060
the brakes didn't work even though he stepped on it.

24
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,030
It's one of the two.

25
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,940
What do you mean by that?

26
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,320
Are you saying someone might've tampered with the brakes?

27
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,800
Ga On!

28
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,610
Ga On!

29
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,990
What happened?

30
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,730
Is he okay?

31
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,730
Where are you taking him?

32
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,810
I was told to take him

33
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,090
and Chairman to the nursing center owned by FB Foundation.

34
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,840
You can't take Ga On.

35
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,060
I have to see him get treated and get well.

36
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,500
Who are you to be doing this?

37
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,030
I'm his mom!

38
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,000
Who's doing this?

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,960
I ordered them.

40
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,780
My father and brother got hurt and are hospitalized.

41
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,580
To be a dutiful family,

42
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,290
it's only right to have them near to take care of them.

43
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,180
And to be exact...

44
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,170
you're not Ga On's mom.

45
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,150
Shut up.

46
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,000
You're crazy.

47
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,100
Director, people are watching.

48
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,800
You want to go to this extent to protect that child, huh?

49
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,160
Ms. Yeom.

50
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,750
Ga On!

51
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,040
Ga On!

52
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,590
Ga On!

53
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,780
- Must you do this... 
 - Let go of me!

54
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,210
to take over that position?

55
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,210
It's not that I want to take over that position.

56
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,180
I'm the rightful owner of that position.

57
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,470
Everyone is finding their way back to their places.

58
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,690
I can't let Ga On go like that.

59
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,160
   

60
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,400
 Mom! 

61
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,780
 Mom! 

62
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,080
 Mom, what's wrong? 

63
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,450
 Mom, what's wrong? 

64
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,840
 Dad! 

65
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,190
 Dad, wake up! Look at Mom... 

66
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,690
 Mom! 

67
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,170
 What's wrong? 

68
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,910
 Dad, call the ambulance! Please hurry! 

69
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,260
 Oh, okay! 

70
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,560
 Wake up, Mom... 

71
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,690
 Mom, are you okay? 

72
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,050
 Geez. 

73
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,390
 Dad, hurry up and call the ambulance! 

74
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,050
 Mom! 

75
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,410
 Mom, wake up... 

76
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,650
 Mom. 

77
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,140
 Mom! 

78
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,560
 Mom! 

79
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,550
 Mom, wake up! 

80
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,530
 Mom! 

81
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,400
What is the reason for bringing me here?

82
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,200
Are you conscious?

83
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,430
It's a good chance to let it be known that a nursing hospital

84
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,020
is a good place to block the outsiders

85
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,640
and focus on your treatment.

86
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,770
Your current situation is too unsuitable

87
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,430
to apply for an Adult Guardianship.

88
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,270
Because you can...

89
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,280
communicate too clearly right now.

90
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,570
You were traumatized to be brought in by the prosecution

91
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,050
and due to intense interrogation,

92
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,910
internal hemorrhage had begun.

93
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,750
Not realizing that, you were heading to a family gathering

94
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,180
and got into an accident.

95
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,740
And due to the impact of the crash,

96
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,950
a severe brain hemorrhage occurred.

97
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,070
The hospital you were taken to

98
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,880
is too far from Seoul.

99
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,310
So we brought you to our nursing hospital.

100
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,250
The best medical staff

101
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,380
is doing their best for your treatment and recovery.

102
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,750
This is what the article will say.

103
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,690
When the succession is almost wrapped up,

104
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,410
I'll release another article.

105
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,400
"We tried our best, but

106
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,890
we believe this is all we can do."

107
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,550
The car accident.

108
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,170
I guess you were behind it.

109
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,160
I think it's time you get some rest after all you've done.

110
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,430
I didn't think you could let it go on your own.

111
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,080
Then relax and rest for the remaining time you have.

112
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,220
Let me ask you something while you're still sound.

113
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,570
I've always been curious about this.

114
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,260
Who gave him the name "Ga On"?

115
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,770
I guess...

116
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,480
it must've been his mom.

117
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,110
That's what I mean.

118
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,720
I was so offended by that.

119
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,790
Tae On. Ga On.

120
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,000
She clearly had a motive when she had the child.

121
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,660
Where is the child?

122
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,070
He's in this room.

123
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,230
Excuse me!

124
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,720
Excuse me!

125
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,100
Please open the gate.

126
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,070
We don't take visitors unless you're registered guardians.

127
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,750
Yes, I know that.

128
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,650
My son got into an accident and is hospitalized here.

129
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,880
I can't confirm his condition.

130
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,350
I'll go back after I see his face.

131
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,550
If you continue, I'll call the police.

132
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,920
Please go back.

133
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,710
I confirmed Ga On's condition.

134
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,970
The doctor says he has minor bruises.

135
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,070
He was asleep from stabilizers.

136
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,410
Do Yoon will request the medical report.

137
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,550
Then I'll send that to Kim Tae On and take back his custody.

138
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,710
Kim Tae On...

139
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,110
She'll be punished this time.

140
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,550
   

141
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,230
An interview is set up right after you meet with the executives.

142
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,870
An interview?

143
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,190
 Shut up. 

144
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,330
Should I cancel the interview?

145
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,580
No.

146
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,640
Then I'll call up the makeup team.

147
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,050
You have an interview?

148
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,680
As I finish up the base,

149
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,020
I'll add an ampoule.

150
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,630
I think it will be good if you apply it before you go on air.

151
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,910
Ms. Yeom.

152
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,040
Tell Director Jung to come in right after the interview.

153
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,270
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,920
Excuse me?

155
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,930
To FB Life?

156
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,250
Okay. I got it.

157
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,720
Have a seat.

158
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,620
Is it okay to meet here?

159
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,280
People may be watching.

160
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,100
You don't have to worry about that anymore.

161
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,290
I heard about the Chairman's accident.

162
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,190
Did you summon me about the news on the accident?

163
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,890
I don't think you need to talk about the accident on the news.

164
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:02,750
About Chairman Kim's scandals on the shipping company and insurance fraud.

165
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,620
Please finalize it as a rumor spread by our competitors.

166
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,670
He was exonerated by the Prosecutors' Office anyhow.

167
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,540
The company's image was damaged

168
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,720
quite a bit to bring down Chairman Kim.

169
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,030
I'll do my best so that the company image

170
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,990
could be restored.

171
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,360
How is Chairman doing right now?

172
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,230
According to his doctor,

173
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,150
the stress factor had a worse impact than the accident.

174
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,530
While he was under investigation, the brain hemorrhage had begun.

175
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,080
And the impact of the accident made it worse.

176
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,560
Then should I bring it up in the news

177
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,560
about the intense interrogation by the Prosecutors' Office?

178
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,620
Well, no need for that.

179
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,690
How far did your plan

180
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,930
on Kang Hae Ra you had mentioned proceed?

181
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,590
First, I'll say that the materials and testimonies

182
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,120
that Kang Hae Ra posted on VTube

183
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,300
on the shipping accident were fabricated.

184
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,910
Now that Chairman Kim was exonerated as well.

185
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,420
Fabricated testimonies?

186
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,570
Yes.

187
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,000
We'll find the man who testified about disassembly of the ship

188
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,100
and mention "defamation" as we pay him off.

189
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,480
People like that will pretty much say what we want them to say.

190
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,920
If that doesn't work, we can come up with witnesses.

191
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,100
 To restore... 

192
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,710
 Chairman Kim Sang Goo's reputation that has been tainted due to shipping scandal, 

193
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,250
 FB Group will implement 

194
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,150
 emergency management with Director Kim Tae On in the center. 

195
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,800
 Will FB Group which was tarnished by scandals be able to... 

196
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,890
Does this make sense?

197
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,100
To restore the reputation stained by the shipping scandal?

198
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,300
How is Ga On?

199
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,680
I'm sorry.

200
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,500
I didn't take care of Ga On well.

201
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,660
Kim Tae On was behind this car accident.

202
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,000
You mean she caused the accident?

203
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,060
We must find the evidence quickly.

204
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,720
We have to make sure Director Kim can't get out of this one.

205
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,730
We just heard on the news that

206
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,200
FB Group is saying that the shipping accident

207
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,160
had nothing to do with Chairman Kim.

208
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,020
They're trying to focus on restoring the tainted group's image.

209
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,510
Because she thinks FB Group is hers now.

210
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,050
That's right.

211
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,600
Director Kim Tae On asked me to bring it up in the news

212
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,240
that Chairman Kim was exonerated and

213
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,100
his scandals were rumors spread by their competitors.

214
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,290
If that happens,

215
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,530
we end up riling up the victims' families.

216
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,630
I'm sure some of them wanted to forget about it and move on.

217
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,120
Before Director Kim is installed as the CEO,

218
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,040
I'll reveal everything.

219
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,570
Do you have a plan?

220
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,550
I've been preparing a subpoena against her secretly.

221
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,930
Instigating Kang Dae Shik's murder, Chairman Kim's accident...

222
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,810
I believe we have a good chance if I can connect the dots.

223
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,500
When we expose Director Kim on TV,

224
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,400
it will be more helpful.

225
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,600
An exposé?

226
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,060
All the insurance fraud Kim Tae On was involved in,

227
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,750
and Yi Hyeon sunbae's story.

228
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,050
I'm exposing it on TV with Ms. Jung.

229
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,470
Would that be possible?

230
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,510
If Director Kim finds out,

231
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,030
she'll try to pull you off the air.

232
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,680
I thought Director Kim reviews your content.

233
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,110
Yes.

234
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,190
So I will prepare two different versions.

235
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,220
The one for Director Kim's review

236
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,410
will say Kang Hae Ra fabricated testimonies.

237
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,700
And the one to expose

238
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,580
will be on Director Kim's corruption.

239
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,660
   

240
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,450
Excuse me for a moment.

241
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,500
 I got a call from the investigation team. 

242
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,250
 They located Choi. 

243
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,850
He must've turned on his cellphone just now.

244
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,420
 Find Choi... 

245
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,480
Please text me Choi's location.

246
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,210
 Okay, will do. 

247
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,360
Did you find out where Choi is?

248
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,770
I'll go with you.

249
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,210
It could be dangerous.

250
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,560
I never cared about that all this time.

251
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,300
But I really don't this time.

252
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,400
We must reveal Kim Tae On's crimes and get Ga On back.

253
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,990
   

254
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,900
Geez...

255
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,860
   

256
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,840
Geez...

257
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,350
I think we're at the right place.

258
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,390
Mr. Choi.

259
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,790
I know you're in this warehouse.

260
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,030
I can call the police right now, but

261
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,050
I won't do that.

262
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,610
That's how Kang died.

263
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,280
Kim Tae On is looking for you.

264
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,800
I know you were doing Kim Tae On's dirty work with Kang.

265
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,350
That's why she's after you.

266
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,170
She needs you dead

267
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,510
so she can bury her wrongdoings.

268
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,230
Don't run away like this

269
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,950
and get caught only to end up like Kang.

270
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,900
Work with us...

271
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,780
and make Kim Tae On pay her dues.

272
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,360
I'm sure she blocked all the smuggling routes in Incheon.

273
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,420
We're the only ones who can help you

274
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,320
in this situation.

275
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,370
We'll help you.

276
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,600
Think it over and call us.

277
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,900
Let's go.

278
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,620
How can I believe you?

279
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,810
Besides...

280
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,280
how will you put away Director Kim Tae On?

281
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,810
The police and prosecutors are

282
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,300
all under her control.

283
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,320
All the deeds that Kim Tae On has done...

284
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,870
I'll expose it on TV.

285
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,610
On TV?

286
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,420
At the same time, I'll have her arrested and interrogated.

287
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,860
To do that, I need a witness

288
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,100
who can prove her crimes.

289
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,940
Now that Kang is dead,

290
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,680
it won't be easy to prove her guilt.

291
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,940
It's not like she personally killed Kang.

292
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,970
I'll get her with instigating Kang's murder and causing Chairman Kim's accident.

293
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,410
If you can testify that she ordered you to commit crimes,

294
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,630
I can use that against her for Kang's death.

295
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,750
And Kim Tae On...

296
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,690
has my son Ga On.

297
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,300
She caused the accident...

298
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,120
and locked him up in a nursing hospital.

299
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,990
I have to get my son back!

300
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,160
Okay.

301
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,220
Give me some time to think.

302
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,560
I'll call you when I decide.

303
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,300
Okay.

304
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,700
All right.

305
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,120
If you call the police on me,

306
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,280
I won't work with you even if I get caught.

307
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,630
If he finds out I killed his sister...

308
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,030
No.

309
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,830
Kang Hae Ra wants to get his sister's son.

310
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,300
Hell! What do I do now?

311
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,330
Do you think Choi will call us?

312
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,130
He's cornered as well.

313
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,200
We have to hope that the fact Kang Dae Shik was killed

314
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,830
after being used could have a psychological effect on him.

315
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,260
Ga On should be okay, right?

316
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,910
I'm going crazy wondering if she's harming the child.

317
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,050
   

318
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,100
Hi, Eun Hye.

319
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,500
 Hae Ra, we found a way to get into that nursing hospital. 

320
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,450
You can get into the hospital?

321
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,550
Yeah.

322
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,490
Got it. We'll be right there.

323
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,120
   

324
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,190
Yes.

325
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,300
 Min Joon, Mr. Ko is conscious. 

326
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,700
Okay, got it.

327
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,580
I'll go see Mr. Ko.

328
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,380
You go to Eun Hye.

329
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,100
Okay.

330
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,490
So how can you get in there?

331
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:54,150
I went there to figure out what's going on at the hospital.

332
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,950
   

333
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,450
She's one of the insurance agents who were in the accident with you.

334
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,910
Ms. Lee Soon Young.

335
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,100
I called her and...

336
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,530
her husband supplies groceries to the hospital.

337
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,670
Ms. Lee...

338
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,920
has been distributing meals to patients recently.

339
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,230
I told her about you and Ga On.

340
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,520
She said she'll help us get inside.

341
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,670
When is she going in tomorrow?

342
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,120
Twice a day.

343
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,830
He goes in to drop off groceries in the morning.

344
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:57,430
And to pick up Ms. Lee in the evening.

345
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,400
All right.

346
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,720
Are you going in, Sunbae?

347
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,600
Wouldn't people recognize you right away if you go in?

348
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,060
According to Mr. Lee,

349
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,810
there are rooms with security guards in the front.

350
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,910
That's probably where Chairman Kim and Ga On are staying.

351
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,420
I'll go in.

352
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,980
I'll go and see if Ga On is okay.

353
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,150
I'll see how things are inside.

354
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,870
How do you feel?

355
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,080
Could you please tell me about what happened?

356
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,120
According to the investigators at the scene,

357
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,890
there was no trace of you stepping on the brakes.

358
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,950
How is the Chairman?

359
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,890
Director Kim transferred him to the nursing hospital,

360
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,770
and she's blocking all outside contact.

361
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,640
I was driving fine after picking up Ga On.

362
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,390
But when I got to the downhill,

363
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,870
I lost control of the vehicle.

364
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,060
   

365
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,860
   

366
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,220
   

367
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,170
Did you pull an all-nighter?

368
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,400
The time for my broadcast is nearing, but

369
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,610
I have no witness.

370
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,000
I thought at least my files should be perfect.

371
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,200
Are you leaving now?

372
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,590
Yeah. I'm about to take off.

373
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,380
I'll go with you.

374
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,460
Why would you go?

375
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,530
I'll look around the hospital surroundings,

376
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,160
and I'll wait for you outside.

377
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,950
Call me if anything happens.

378
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,310
Okay.

379
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,580
We'll be back.

380
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,600
- We'll be back. 
 - Be careful.

381
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,190
   

382
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,360
Wait.

383
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,910
Do you know when the security guards leave their post?

384
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,350
They take turns.

385
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,340
I don't think there's a gap during the day.

386
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,720
Then the boy inside the room.

387
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,820
Is he not feeling well?

388
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,640
Maybe they keep giving him stabilizers.

389
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,430
All he does is sleeping.

390
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,770
Is he Kang Hae Ra's son?

391
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,960
Yes.

392
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,800
My gosh. Good thing you came, Eun Hye.

393
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,430
If a mom sees him like that,

394
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,480
her heart would rip apart.

395
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,940
I'm sure it's already in shreds.

396
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,980
I have no idea how she's enduring this.

397
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,290
She can endure because she's his mom.

398
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,940
Mom has to endure...

399
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,250
to protect the child.

400
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,100
Hello. Good day.

401
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,110
Aigoo.

402
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,670
Look at the gum stuck to the floor.

403
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,020
Wow, how could people do this...

404
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,590
Look at this gum...

405
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,980
Aigoo, I can't scrape it off.

406
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,070
Gosh.

407
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,620
My gosh.

408
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,210
Aigoo.

409
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,680
Gosh, done.

410
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,130
Geez, some people.

411
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,560
   

412
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,900
A bug in front of Chairman Kim's room would be perfect.

413
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,790
Do you need my help?

414
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,250
No, thanks.

415
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,310
Where is the Chairman's meal?

416
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,600
Oh, my gosh!

417
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,310
I'm sorry. Oh, no...

418
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,720
I'll clean it up.

419
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,250
Gosh, I'm sorry.

420
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,740
Please clean it up.

421
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,540
I'm sorry.

422
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,830
Aigoo...

423
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,900
Yes!

424
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,130
 Have a seat. 

425
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,630
I thought we said everything during the meeting.

426
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,650
Do you still have more to say?

427
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,220
In concern for FB Group,

428
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,640
let me be blunt with you.

429
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,430
Our group sells an intangible value

430
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,970
that one finds dependable and trustworthy

431
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,270
when one faces a crisis.

432
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,220
For the last thirty years,

433
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,010
thanks to Chairman who valued that mindset,

434
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,110
FB Life has come thus far.

435
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:51,630
That foundation was set by my maternal grandfather and my mother.

436
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,250
My father only took all the glory.

437
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,470
That's what you think, Director.

438
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,750
Ask all the employees

439
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,150
who helped flourish FB Group to this point.

440
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,090
I went to the nursing hospital, and

441
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,270
they won't let me see the Chairman.

442
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,710
I must see the Chairman.

443
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,460
My father is still unconscious.

444
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,310
I'll visit him even if he's still unconscious.

445
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,600
That's what other executives want as well.

446
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,810
If you're not intentionally stopping visitors,

447
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:29,100
please notify the hospital,

448
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,180
so we can visit the Chairman today.

449
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,200
I'll give you a call after I discuss it with his doctor.

450
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,130
Have you heard from Choi yet?

451
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,300
No.

452
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,100
How did your meeting with Mr. Ko go?

453
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,550
Mr. Ko believes the same as we do.

454
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,550
That someone tampered with Chairman Kim's car.

455
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,680
After Chairman Kim was released from the Prosecutors' Office,

456
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,130
he went home to change

457
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,610
and picked up Ga On from here.

458
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,220
By chance...

459
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,940
did they stop by anywhere else

460
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,730
after Ga On got in the car?

461
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,690
Everything was fine on their way over here.

462
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,380
Chairman Kim's car was in front of Gusan Building

463
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,800
for less than five minutes.

464
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,790
I checked the CCTV, and

465
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,050
no one approached the car.

466
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,100
When the car started to speed up, going downhill,

467
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,050
he said the brakes stopped working all of a sudden.

468
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,870
Then...

469
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,050
One of the workers at Chairman Kim's house,

470
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,800
Min Seo Young reserved a plane ticket to Manilla leaving tonight.

471
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,190
It's Ms. Min.

472
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,880
- What time is the flight? 
 - 7 p.m.

473
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:54,140
By chance, can you find out Ms. Min's home address?

474
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,490
Presentations on Chairman's accomplishments

475
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,540
took place during new employee training and company events.

476
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,690
Most employees believe FB Group's success today

477
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:11,860
is due to the Chairman's management capability.

478
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,670
The consumer evaluation for the last ten years says the same.

479
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,540
And some people are saying...

480
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,770
What do they say?

481
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,030
That Chairman is locked up in the nursing hospital.

482
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,300
What?

483
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,050
Have a seat.

484
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,040
I think the employee perception of FB Group's

485
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,340
history and growth are incorrect.

486
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,430
It's the same for other people as well.

487
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,410
While Chairman Kim was the CEO,

488
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,760
he took credit for the businesses that my grandfather and mother built

489
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,200
and made them be his own accomplishments.

490
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,050
You're saying before you become the CEO,

491
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,300
the company needs an image makeover, right?

492
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,650
That's right.

493
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,140
To do that...

494
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,850
what if you go on a talk show

495
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:20,000
centered around a business person?

496
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,600
A talk show?

497
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,020
Yes. Since it's a new year,

498
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,760
we can make a special

499
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,660
and put it in regular programming during primetime.

500
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,560
It will help promote the company and your image.

501
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,080
Where do you think you're going?

502
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,690
Who are you?

503
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,320
You know me, don't you?

504
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,900
Chairman is at the nursing hospital

505
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,180
and so is Ga On.

506
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,390
I have nothing more to do in that big house.

507
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:12,550
Without your severance pay?

508
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,870
I don't need it.

509
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,950
You've worked for Chairman for fifteen years.

510
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,470
You don't need a severance pay worth fifteen years?

511
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,200
You must've gotten it from Director Kim Tae On already.

512
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,100
I have no idea what you're talking about.

513
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,850
You can't leave the country.

514
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,000
What do you mean?

515
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,870
Mr. Ko asked for an investigation of Chairman Kim's accident.

516
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:41,360
I'm saying you're one of the suspects for Chairman Kim's accident.

517
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,580
I don't know anything about it.

518
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,640
You know, Ms. Min.

519
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,180
Your behavior says so.

520
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,870
Until now, no one has ever

521
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:55,160
quit working for Chairman Kim's residence this way.

522
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,900
Except for you, Ms. Min.

523
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,140
I really don't know anything!

524
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,290
Then we'll find out once we ask the police to investigate.

525
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,390
Whether it's a black box or a CCTV,

526
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:09,710
or whether it's the culprit's DNA inside the car.

527
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,420
In the end, I'm sure you'll take all the blame.

528
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,430
I just...

529
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:28,250
I just let the guy in the garage and gave him the money.

530
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,590
That's all I did!

531
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,450
I did it because Ms. Yeom told me to.

532
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,130
Now that I told you, I can leave, right?

533
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,100
I just...

534
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,930
did what Ms. Yeom asked me to.

535
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:05,840
All I did was open the garage for that man!

536
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,900
You knew something terrible was about to happen.

537
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,930
You also knew Ga On will be in that car. And...

538
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,740
why wouldn't she give the money to the man directly

539
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,890
and tell you to do it?

540
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,080
They're my people from the Prosecutors' Office.

541
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,420
Under the circumstances, you'll be safer going with them.

542
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,690
We just need to hear from Choi now.

543
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,070
We'll have to wait.

544
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,620
I got a call from the hospital where Mr. Ko is.

545
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,620
Cha Min Joon came to see Mr. Ko.

546
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,330
- Cha Min Joon? 
 - Yes.

547
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,680
And someone wants to meet with you.

548
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,860
The special after the "Come to an End."

549
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,600
Is that the program Director Kim Tae On will appear on?

550
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,100
No, it's right after my show.

551
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,510
Yes, I got it.

552
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:23,230
I finished editing the two screenshots for "Come to an End"

553
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,790
that you mentioned last time.

554
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,280
Okay. Thanks.

555
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,630
I have to go out right now.

556
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,510
I'll be back before the broadcast.

557
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,330
So you're Mr. Choi?

558
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,650
Yes.

559
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:49,680
Aren't the police after you right now?

560
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,190
That's right.

561
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,420
But why are you here to see me?

562
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,110
 Get rid of Kang Hae Ra and Cha Min Joon right now. 

563
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,980
 Right now! 

564
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,350
Life is short for people like us.

565
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,240
If I drop dead, no one would think it weird.

566
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,310
Even if I die, no one will cry for me.

567
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:19,040
So people like us have a form of insurance.

568
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,050
Hyungnim must've known he'll die.

569
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,620
Before he died,

570
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,270
he left me this insurance.

571
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:44,480
You're here to blackmail me with that one recording?

572
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,560
No, this is...

573
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,270
this is just a preview.

574
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,440
For the last twelve years,

575
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,190
I have three burn phones that have recordings of

576
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:59,370
all the work we did for you

577
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:03,110
and a USB drive with the rights of indemnity files.

578
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,280
I have all that.

579
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,210
- Ms. Yeom, call the... 
 - Wait.

580
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:17,180
Cha Min Joon and Kang Hae Ra came looking for me.

581
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,460
If I testify on their behalf and help them,

582
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,280
they said they'll put you away

583
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,330
and let me live.

584
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:30,110
They're going crazy trying to put you away, Director.

585
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,420
But I really don't want to go back to prison.

586
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,950
So I was thinking, please open up the path for me

587
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:42,910
to go to either China or somewhere else.

588
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:51,250
One of my guys has the rest of the phones and the USB drive.

589
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,970
If he doesn't hear from me in thirty minutes,

590
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:59,890
I told him to hand that over to Cha Min Joon.

591
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,460
Geez, I almost died.

592
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,420
You said the Prosecutors' Office is working on Cha Yi Hyeon's murder case?

593
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,730
Yes.

594
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,310
Find out who the prosecutor is on the case.

595
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,900
The kidnapping of Cha Yi Hyeon and her death.

596
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,220
Tell him Kang did it.

597
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,020
Yes, ma'am.

598
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,070
How did it go?

599
00:46:57,070 --> 00:46:59,280
Did you catch Ms. Min?

600
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,780
We got her to confess that the man

601
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,640
Ms. Yeom sent tampered with Chairman Kim's car.

602
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,320
How was it at the hospital?

603
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,770
I installed a hidden camera in front of the room.

604
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,700
But I couldn't get into Chairman Kim's room.

605
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,950
I did throw in a but into the room.

606
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,890
But I'm not sure if it'll operate okay.

607
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:20,940
Gosh, it did go under the sofa.

608
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,950
So the only way to get into the hospital

609
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,270
is on the food supply truck?

610
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,830
There are lots of people during the day,

611
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,530
and there are guards.

612
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,600
Oh, right.

613
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,890
I think the ambulance can go in and out freely.

614
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,400
An ambulance?

615
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,290
I wonder if we can get an ambulance.

616
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:44,340
Hyung, one of our clients

617
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,150
ran a private ambulance company. Let me look into it.

618
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,280
Okay.

619
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,380
Then should we go in today and get him out?

620
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,870
Hae Ra, you have an exposé with Ms. Jung, huh?

621
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,780
I think you should go inside the hospital tonight.

622
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,290
Kim Tae On is going into the Chairman's room.

623
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:06,200
She's supposed to visit in the evening after work.

624
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,660
Why is she there in the middle of the day?

625
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,440
Let me see if the bug is working.

626
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,250
Director Kim is appearing on a program tonight.

627
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,820
While she's busy preparing to go on air,

628
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,090
I think you should bring out Ga On.

629
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,160
I have to go on a TV program tonight.

630
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,330
So I thought I'd come by early.

631
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,800
Seeing you lie down here like this

632
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,810
reminds me of when Mom was in the hospital.

633
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,160
Father, did you feel this way while watching Mom?

634
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,040
The executives want to see you, Father.

635
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,580
I guess they think they're loyal, but

636
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,740
they don't realize they're cutting your life short.

637
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,550
You'll get to see them soon.

638
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:06,650
I thought about the Adult Guardianship.

639
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:09,910
But I think the press will make a big fuss about it. So I won't do it.

640
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,420
I hate it when things get complicated and get noisy.

641
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,910
That child...

642
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,060
didn't do anything wrong.

643
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:33,200
If you're that worried about that child,

644
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,770
I'll send you off with him.

645
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,760
Listen to this!

646
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,060
That woman is crazy.

647
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,950
 The profit margin for the nursing hospital is low 

648
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,180
 and we've been losing money. So I wanted to get rid of it. 

649
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,280
 I guess I can get rid of it now. 

650
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,390
 Since it's winter, 

651
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,500
 a fire from electrical problems will seem most natural. 

652
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,870
We can rent an ambulance.

653
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,870
I'll get the ambulance and go to the nursing hospital.

654
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,590
Hyun Sung and I will go inside now,

655
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,560
look out for Ga On and get ready.

656
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,910
This may be our last chance.

657
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:23,650
Everything must happen all at once.

658
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,480
Then I'll get all the materials on Director Kim

659
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,620
and Ms. Min's confession for the exposé

660
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,850
and go in with Do Yoon in the ambulance.

661
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,800
I'll get a warrant out somehow and head over to the hospital.

662
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,380
Hae Ra.

663
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,630
Don't worry.

664
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,930
We'll get Ga On out of there, no matter what.

665
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,500
Let's go.

666
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,850
I'll go and pick up the ambulance.

667
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,220
I'll call you.

668
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:59,670
Kang Hae Ra.

669
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,400
This time...

670
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,130
you must be careful.

671
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,450
Okay. You, too, Min Joon.

672
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,910
Hyun Sung and Eun Hye, good luck!

673
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,180
Stay strong!

674
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,990
Thank you so much.

675
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,390
Go. Be careful.

676
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:04,750
- This way. 
 - Fighting!

677
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,490
   

678
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,690
Look at this.

679
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,770
When we hear that Hae Ra and Do Yoon are near,

680
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:41,680
I'll throw a smoke bomb at the end of the hallway,

681
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,090
so you set off the fire alarm.

682
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:45,400
Wouldn't that be too noisy?

683
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,470
What if the guards still don't move?

684
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,630
That was Plan B.

685
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,020
Don't people usually say Plan A first?

686
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,490
What's the Plan A?

687
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,310
As for that, I'll use a honey trap

688
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,900
I'll make them drink juice with stabilizers.

689
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,620
Telling them what a great job they're doing.

690
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,100
Whoa...

691
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,170
Honey trap won't work.

692
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:09,680
Don't you remember? I lured you out like that.

693
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,850
That's because it was too dark to see.

694
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:36,040
I got so scared!

695
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,480
I was more scared.

696
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,320
Geez, salty.

697
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,220
So dirty!

698
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,090
What are you saying?

699
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:52,510
♫  I had no idea of your change of heart  ♫

700
00:53:52,510 --> 00:54:01,090
♫  I couldn't catch on nor know of it  ♫

701
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:02,810
Geez, gross, man!

702
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,160
Geez.

703
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,860
Come on!

704
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,640
Just wait until this case is closed.

705
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,290
I'll just...

706
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,990
You.

707
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,930
Shut up. Get ready.

708
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:25,730
Yes.

709
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,200
Well...

710
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,170
before we go on  air,

711
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:31,850
I wanted to say something to you.

712
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,550
Yes.

713
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:36,430
We were always with other people, and

714
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:39,750
it's awkward to say this to you.

715
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,900
But I want to thank you.

716
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:46,420
I should be the one to thank you.

717
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,850
To be honest, I knew it wasn't right, but...

718
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,350
I compromised and justified myself

719
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:55,220
working as a professional.

720
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,690
 And one day, I saw you on VTube 

721
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:01,270
exposing Director Song

722
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:04,510
and illegal bonds.

723
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,660
It was quite a shock.

724
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:11,230
 I realized you don't have to be a reporter to voice your thoughts. 

725
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,380
But I'm actually a reporter.

726
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,630
I had more opportunities, but I didn't do it.

727
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:18,510
I was quite self-reflective.

728
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:21,410
You can do that starting now.

729
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:23,750
Yes, I plan to do that.

730
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,270
After you bring out Ga On safely,

731
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:29,430
let's wrap up our joint broadcast well.

732
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,370
Yes. Let's do that.

733
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,940
Sunbaenim.

734
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,500
Are you ready?

735
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,820
Yes.

736
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,620
Let's go.

737
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,990
Please sit over here.

738
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:13,470
Yes, Do Yoon.

739
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,550
Okay. I'll be right out.

740
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,460
Aren't you ready to record?

741
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:30,650
Jung Joo Yeon.

742
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,690
For falsifying evidence and ethics violation of gathering info,

743
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,270
you'll have to come with us.

744
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,450
   

745
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:45,080
It's based on Ms. Min's confession.

746
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,580
Review and tell me if you noticed anything unusual when you left

747
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,420
- Chairman Kim's residence. 
 - Mr. Cha Min Joon.

748
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:58,820
    
 You're under arrest for instigating Kang Dae Shik's murder.

749
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:01,820
What are you talking about?

750
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:04,310
Handcuff him.

751
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:08,290
You can acquire an attorney, and

752
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:10,040
you can remain silent.

753
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,470
Take him.

754
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:17,670
What evidence do you have to accuse me of killing Kang Dae Shik?

755
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,600
 This man came to see Kang Dae Shik often. 

756
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,690
 And I don't know how he found out, but 

757
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:33,670
 he said he knew I was stealing drugs. 

758
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,700
 He said he's an attorney. 

759
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,590
 He threatened me saying he'll report me to the hospital. 

760
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:43,100
 He gave me the drug to put it in Kang Dae Shik's IV. 

761
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,200
She's the nurse who got arrested for drugging Kang Dae Shik.

762
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,660
And someone named Choi Dong Hoon called.

763
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,830
Saying Kang Dae Shik killed your sister Cha Yi Hyeon.

764
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,040
Choi...

765
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,880
So just in case, I  showed your picture to the nurse.

766
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,820
She recognized you right away.

767
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:51,700
 - We're in the parking structure.  
 - Okay.

768
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:58,230
Where did they go?

769
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,930
Is it time for them to switch?

770
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,710
Over here.

771
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:26,300
Careful.

772
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,970
Ga On!

773
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,060
Ga On, are you okay?

774
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,620
Mom?

775
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:41,860
It's not a dream, is it?

776
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,250
Hae Ra, we should get out of here.

777
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,550
We have to go before the guards return.

778
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,860
Hae Ra, hurry!

779
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,260
Why?

780
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,050
Where are you taking me?

781
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:03,290
If we left you there, you'd die a peaceful death.

782
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,710
You should pay for your crimes and pay your dues.

783
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:08,590
Clean up the mess you created before you die.

784
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,270
Who the hell are they?

785
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,320
Kim Tae On?

786
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:07,510
How come you're here?

787
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:12,550
You're risking your life for that child?

788
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:18,050
That's good.

789
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:20,910
It's not a bad idea to get rid of all of them at once.

790
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,390
Get rid of them in front of me for good.

791
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:59,630
♫  Can't you hear my heart 
 that is covered with pain?  ♫

792
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:07,570
♫  I don't even remember the moment 
 we were in love anymore  ♫

793
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,250
   

794
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:14,490
 She'll expose me on air 

795
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,520
 and take the kid in the meantime? 

796
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,410
 What are you doing right now? 

797
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,300
 Why are you arresting us? 

798
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,910
 Ms. Yeom just confessed saying she did everything. 

799
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:25,960
 I have to take Ga On to a safe location. 

800
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,800
 I can't sell out my child. 

801
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,790
 She tried to kill you! 

802
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:33,390
 Is there no way to get Kim Tae On? 

803
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:36,500
 Once you decide, I'll have your back.  

804
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,810
 Min Joon, wake up! 

805
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:42,360
  			 

806
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:51,340
