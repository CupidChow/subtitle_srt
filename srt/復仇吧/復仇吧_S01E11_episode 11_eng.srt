1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:07,030
  	 

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,150
   

3
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,060
Over here! Over here!

4
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,100
Come over here and give me the baby.

5
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,650
Hurry! Hurry!

6
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,630
Thank you!

7
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,400
Thank you!

8
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,080
Thank you!

9
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,320
I lost my baby.

10
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,560
I thought you knew what kind of man Lee Hoon Seok is,

11
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,150
and yet, I thought you recommended me for that position.

12
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,790
That's why I wanted to take revenge on you.

13
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,870
That's why I did that.

14
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,230
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

15
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,040
I'll take...

16
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,540
that baby.

17
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,050
I heard you're being chased.

18
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,890
Why don't we...

19
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,910
protect that baby?

20
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,890
   

21
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,660
   

22
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,150
So the child that Cha Min Joon brought back from Canada

23
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,980
is Chairman Kim's son?

24
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,880
After Dr. Park stopped by Chairman Kim's residence,

25
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,940
he rushed a DNA test.

26
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,460
And if you look at the page after that...

27
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,980
   

28
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,810
It's a form to request a change of paternity rights that Mr. Cha submitted.

29
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,220
 I took care of Cha Yi Yeon and the baby. 

30
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,300
It means he didn't get rid of them then.

31
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,100
How is Chairman Kim handling matters regarding the child?

32
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,200
He's making sure no one leaks information on the child.

33
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,560
He's not ready to make the news public.

34
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,320
Don't leave anyone out and let me know who Chairman Kim meets with.

35
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,660
Yes, ma'am.

36
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,970
Hae Ra, are you here?

37
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,970
Gosh, where did she go?

38
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,500
Kang Hae Ra, where are you right now?

39
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,690
What?

40
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,480
    
 Director Kim Tae On...

41
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,060
must be pissed off at Chairman Kim and you.

42
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,840
What are you going to do now?

43
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,610
Now that Director Kim is fuming,

44
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,250
she'll loosen up her dogs.

45
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,580
I'll catch that dog then.

46
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,950
There's trouble.

47
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,160
Hae Ra saw Mr. Hong's accident video clip and went to meet Kang.

48
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,590
   

49
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,360
   

50
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,410
I recorded you.

51
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,880
   

52
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,160
Damn it!

53
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,240
It's no use.

54
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,840
I'll tell the world that you killed Mr. Hong.

55
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,820
I should've...

56
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,160
finished you off then.

57
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,540
Crazy bastard.

58
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,110
Are you okay?

59
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm sure Kang was recorded on the CCTV.

60
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,410
Before he gets rid of it first, hurry up and get the recording.

61
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,810
Why are you so reckless?

62
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,790
What if something happens to you? How about Ga On?

63
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,020
I said...

64
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,640
I said I'd wrap up everything!

65
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,710
   

66
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,210
I'm begging you. Please be careful.

67
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,900
Do you know how scared I get whenever you do this?

68
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,220
When I'm feeling this way,

69
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,290
what about Mr. Cha?

70
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,840
What about Mr. Cha?

71
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,690
"What about Mr. Cha?"

72
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,180
Forget it.

73
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,450
If you're not concerned about Mr. Cha worrying about you,

74
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,110
fine then, Ga On.

75
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,260
Consider Ga On and please...

76
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,380
How did it go?

77
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:49,190
The investigation will go on with assault and attempted murder charges.

78
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,720
I mean...

79
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,900
even after you told them that

80
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,830
Kang is the culprit and tried to stop me from uploading the video?

81
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,850
Since the truck driver already turned himself in,

82
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,470
just because he was at the accident scene

83
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,950
doesn't provide direct proof.

84
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,250
Then what kind of proof do we need to provide?

85
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,190
I'll look into it further.

86
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,340
   

87
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,300
We'll make sure to lock up. Don't worry.

88
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,630
The two of us are together.

89
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,390
And I'll put this next to her pillow.

90
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,410
I think we should install extra alarms.

91
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,470
Oh, I'll call someone for that early in the morning.

92
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,650
It's late. Go home and get some rest.

93
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,320
Okay. See you tomorrow.

94
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,310
I'll text you a list of security companies.

95
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,090
Call me if anything comes up.

96
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,220
Okay. Be careful going home.

97
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,360
You still don't get it?

98
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,210
Get some rest.

99
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,380
My gosh.

100
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,230
   

101
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,750
   

102
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,320
- Yes. 
  - We're ready for the meeting. 

103
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,630
Okay.

104
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,680
Let's begin.

105
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,200
Chairman Kim of FB Life personally visited insurance agents who got into the accident

106
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,160
- and gave compensation money—  
 - Just go with that.

107
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,050
Next.

108
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,450
If FB Group companies switch over as holding companies,

109
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,670
how about we talk about the synergy that will affect—

110
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,350
Did we get all of our stories from the FB PR team today?

111
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,660
Well, not all of them...

112
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,590
 Then you didn't get rid of them both. 

113
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,400
No, I definitely got rid of them.

114
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,000
If you got rid of them, how could Cha Yi Hyeon's child be alive?

115
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,240
- I definitely... 
 - Chairman Kim found Cha Yi Hyeon's kid.

116
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,810
And Kang Hae Ra had raised that kid all this time!

117
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,150
Damn it!

118
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,920
Hyungnim.

119
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,180
Around Gusan Agency's building,

120
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,850
the security tightened, and more CCTVs are installed.

121
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,530
I don't think we can enter easily.

122
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,760
And last night,

123
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,550
that lawyer bastard came with cops

124
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,090
so the building manager had to turn over the CCTV video.

125
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,370
There are more patrols around the building as well.

126
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,010
Kang Hae Ra, I should've gotten rid of that wench then.

127
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,190
Where are you going?

128
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,180
Huh?

129
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,980
To the restroom.

130
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,150
Aren't you going to the law firm for a meeting?

131
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,750
My gosh, no way.

132
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,330
I'm going to the restroom.

133
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,720
With your notebook?

134
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,680
I'll go with you.

135
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,120
Hae Ra.

136
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,760
After we posted the video clip of the insurance agents

137
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,210
and thanks to your news appearance,

138
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,390
FB Life withdrew the right of indemnity lawsuits

139
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,590
and gave them compensation money.

140
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,260
I think you've done enough on that.

141
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,390
Including what happened yesterday, I'm worried about you.

142
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,270
As for compensation, the agents got what they deserved.

143
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,320
But nothing on Mr. Hong has been resolved.

144
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,940
I heard Kang works for FB Life.

145
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,190
Didn't you quit working on the FB case because of Ga On?

146
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,210
Mr. Hong's death is a separate matter.

147
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,180
If his death was intentional,

148
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,210
I can't let it get buried this way.

149
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,520
And if Chairman Kim was behind it,

150
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,230
I can't let him be around Ga On.

151
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,060
What's wrong with you guys?

152
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,320
Shouldn't I do anything from now on?

153
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,020
Do you think Gusan Agency is a safe place?

154
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,810
If Kang wanted to,

155
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,400
he can break into anywhere he wants to.

156
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,130
And Hyung Sung. He was able to come in looking for me.

157
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,230
Geez, why bring me up?

158
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,320
I wasn't really trying to hurt you then.

159
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,530
I know.

160
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,130
You were trembling then.

161
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,210
What?

162
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,030
You were trembling?

163
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,900
No, I wasn't.

164
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,680
No, I didn't tremble.

165
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,270
"Yeah, Kang Hae Ra, I won't let you off easy."

166
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,900
"I'm from hell to take my revenge on you!"

167
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,820
Were you like this?

168
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,100
No, I didn't.

169
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,510
The police are out to get him,

170
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,650
and Prosecutor Jang is working on the case, not just us.

171
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,930
You don't have to step forward, Hae Ra.

172
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,410
What you did last night was enough.

173
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,020
We couldn't catch him at the organ auction.

174
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,000
He won't be afraid just because his identity was revealed.

175
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,120
More than anything,

176
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,170
he's like a demon who caused an accident to kill someone.

177
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,260
I can't let him off this way.

178
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,890
Then we'll work on the ground.

179
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,890
Why don't you back us up from the office?

180
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,440
While working on the content on Kang.

181
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,290
I'm so worried about you.

182
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,420
You fought off Kang last night,

183
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,650
and you revealed his wrongdoing on VTube.

184
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,670
I'm afraid he won't leave you alone.

185
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,030
I feel the same way about that.

186
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,490
If you're working on the ground,

187
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,830
I'd be worried and won't be able to focus.

188
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,920
If you're all so worried about me,

189
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,360
I'll work on video content on Kang.

190
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,860
But be sure to share with me your progress on this case.

191
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,070
Then let's begin our meeting.

192
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:57,020
The police are investigating, and since he's committed a crime,

193
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,470
I think they'll try to smuggle out of the country.

194
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,810
I know someone who knows a smuggling broker in Incheon.

195
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,460
I'm thinking of going to Incheon.

196
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,410
He ran away all of a sudden.

197
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,410
He could stop by his office or his home.

198
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,380
Eun Hye, I think you should stake out in front of Kang's office.

199
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,420
Do you think he'd come back?

200
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,770
They say, "The foot of the candle is dark."

201
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,190
As Mr. Cha said, he ran off all of a sudden.

202
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,130
It's highly possible that he'll come back.

203
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,780
Then I'll stake out in front of Happy Credit building.

204
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,230
If they notice anything in Incheon, I'll ask him to call me.

205
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,800
I'll call you right away when I hear from him.

206
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,900
Okay.

207
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,250
I know where Choi might show up.

208
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,070
I'll go around the area.

209
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,760
The list of credit agencies that Kang runs.

210
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,130
I'll get it soon.

211
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,710
Please monitor that area, Hyun Sung.

212
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,770
Okay.

213
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,650
I'll monitor one of those places.

214
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,660
Okay, let's move then.

215
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,500
I'll rattle Director Kim from the inside.

216
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,180
You keep your eyes on her movements.

217
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,640
I'm sure she'll meet up with Kang again.

218
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,770
Okay.

219
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,990
But you won't tell Gusan Agency people

220
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,010
about Director Kim Tae On, will you?

221
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,920
I don't want anyone else getting hurt or victimized.

222
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,850
Get Gusan Agency people's help while keeping them out of danger.

223
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,860
Let's take care of Kang ourselves first.

224
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,910
Okay.

225
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,220
I know Assemblyman Kim.

226
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,330
Who's this again?

227
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,410
His name is Bae Young Tak. He's from the Shipping Association.

228
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
Someone from the Shipping Association?

229
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,640
Meeting Assembly Kim and someone from the Shipping Association means...

230
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,440
And Chairman Kim wants to see you in his office.

231
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,330
Yeah.

232
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,240
Sit down.

233
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,700
I called you in because I wanted to talk to both of you.

234
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,560
I'd like to talk about switching over to holding companies,

235
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,010
and I think...

236
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:55,220
we should restructure the group governance.

237
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,470
Director Cha had some good ideas.

238
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,180
I thought we'd hear him out together.

239
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,880
Director Cha's good ideas?

240
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,330
Go ahead and tell us.

241
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,410
Okay.

242
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,900
FB Group's Financial companies

243
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,590
are pretty solid overall.

244
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,740
The problem is with the general affiliates.

245
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,010
Among them, distribution affiliates especially need restructuring.

246
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,950
I was wondering if you could take charge of restructuring distribution affiliates.

247
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,600
I also heard about it just now.

248
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,260
I think it's a pretty good idea.

249
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,210
So I was thinking...

250
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,840
why don't you check out the Chinese market, Tae On?

251
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,640
For the past ten years, FB Distribution

252
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,750
has invested over one trillion won in the Chinese market.

253
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,650
If you withdraw like this now,

254
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,310
FB Group will have to take all the loss.

255
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,710
While all the Korean corporations are withdrawing,

256
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,120
you want me to go to China now?

257
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,790
That's why now is a good opportunity.

258
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,880
While other corporations are withdrawing,

259
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,020
why don't you go there and make the distribution business a success?

260
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,000
This is a great opportunity for you to show off your ability.

261
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,720
Why don't you go for about two years?

262
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,790
I'll do that then.

263
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,200
The Chinese market is important.

264
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,750
In return, the Global Strategy team leader position.

265
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,970
Please appoint Seung Woo oppa for the position.

266
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,990
I'll make him turn himself in.

267
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,680
Please work with the Prosecutors' Office

268
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,020
so that he won't be arrested during the investigation.

269
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,060
Aunt is thinking of selling off FB Life shares she owns.

270
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,840
At this point, if her share is sold off,

271
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,540
the outsiders will think that

272
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,190
there are internal conflicts

273
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,660
due to switching over to holding companies.

274
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,760
It's not like I haven't thought about it.

275
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,370
Global Strategy team leader...

276
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,810
I guess Seung Woo will be good for the position.

277
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,640
I can send away Tae On to China.

278
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,150
Oh, yeah.

279
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,850
Sungmyung Shipping.

280
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,490
They got their business license this year.

281
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,890
Are you trying to import vessels?

282
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,820
But...

283
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,990
they're all used vessels.

284
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,650
What if...

285
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,850
they were all new vessels, how much more would I need?

286
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,540
Make that document...

287
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,880
worth 100 billion won.

288
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,360
 He's turning secondhand vessels... 

289
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,190
 into new vessels? 

290
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,740
 Is this really our building? 

291
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,520
 I said yes. 

292
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,290
 Can't you tell by looking at the paperwork? 

293
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,320
   
 It says "Goo Sung Chul" as the owner right there. 

294
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,540
 Wow! 

295
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,620
 Then you're a "lord." 

296
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,230
 Lord? 

297
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,900
 A landlord. 

298
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,360
 Lord! 

299
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,550
 Wow, daebak! 

300
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,280
Yes, Uncle, it's me.

301
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,360
I was wondering if you looked into what I asked about last time.

302
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,030
To find out who the building was auctioned off to,

303
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,870
do you need the building number?

304
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,970
I have a copy at the office.

305
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,160
Yes.

306
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,510
Can I take a picture of it with my cellphone and send it?

307
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,790
Yes.

308
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,560
I'll do that right away then.

309
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,720
Okay.

310
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,510
   

311
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,620
Yeah.

312
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,640
Hi, are you at the office?

313
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,690
 Yeah. 

314
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,020
Can I ask you a favor?

315
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,040
Yeah, what is it?

316
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,320
Inside the black cabinet in the pantry,

317
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,470
somewhere in there...

318
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,740
 there's a copy of building ownership paper. 

319
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,230
Can you find that and take a picture

320
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,110
of the building number and send it to me?

321
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,530
Okay, got it.

322
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
   

323
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,050
   

324
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,000
   

325
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,510
   

326
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,730
 Was it about ten years ago? 

327
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,790
 When a huge lawsuit landed on him, 

328
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,350
 he lost this building and our house. 

329
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,020
 It took only a moment for that energetic man to crumble. 

330
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,300
   

331
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,640
October 19, 2009?

332
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,280
   

333
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,790
Welcome.

334
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,480
What brings you here?

335
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,920
I was going to visit you because I was worried.

336
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,870
But Eun Hye stopped me, so I was holding back.

337
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,970
Are you okay?

338
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,260
    
 What's this?

339
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,320
Where did you get that?

340
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,760
It's that place, right?

341
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,050
Then, because of that incident,

342
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,390
you lost your house and Gusan building?

343
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,820
Why didn't you tell me?

344
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,060
It's all been taken care of.

345
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,110
I heard you went through a lot.

346
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,310
Everyone's life has ups and downs.

347
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,200
Don't tell Eun Hye.

348
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,370
She'll just be disturbed.

349
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,280
   

350
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,260
    
 Chairman Kim started the shipping business again.

351
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,010
Did he ask you to fabricate the document?

352
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,880
If things go wrong, Chairman Kim

353
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,120
turns over only the people who are involved and get them arrested in his place.

354
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,360
I hope you don't get too deep into this.

355
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,470
I must find out everything on how he committed

356
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,420
his corruptions and

357
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,000
how he managed to cover them up.

358
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,680
That's how I can destroy him.

359
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,750
But still. What if you can't get yourself out of it?

360
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,550
Did you talk to Prosecutor Jang?

361
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,060
It's not easy to find the fugitive only with CCTV,

362
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,420
so he ordered stakeout at a few offices that Kang visits often.

363
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,940
When they catch Kang, along with the video on Kang Hae Ra's camera

364
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,760
and the CCTV from Happy Credit,

365
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,600
they should be able to get to the bottom of the accident Kang caused, right?

366
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,910
We'll have to make sure we do that.

367
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,110
 Why don't you check out the Chinese market? 

368
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,720
 Why don't you go for about two years? 

369
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,140
- Did you get him on the phone? 
 - Yes.

370
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,540
- It's me. 
 - What's up?

371
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,590
Turn yourself into the Prosecutors' Office tomorrow.

372
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,360
What?

373
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,650
You can't hide out forever.

374
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,810
This is all your fault.

375
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,500
Chairman Kim told me to go to China.

376
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,850
So I suggested your return to headquarters.

377
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,410
The team leader of the Global Strategy Team.

378
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,960
 Once you turn yourself in, 

379
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,920
 I asked him to make sure you're not investigated under custody. 

380
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,650
 We can't keep taking it like this. 

381
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,860
And...

382
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,560
we should pay back Cha Min Joon, too.

383
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,690
The Global Strategy team leader is

384
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,120
an executive position.

385
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,200
Do you think that sly Chairman Kim would do that?

386
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,380
So just in case...

387
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,030
you have to prepare something for me.

388
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,230
What is it?

389
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,270
The leash Aunt has...

390
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,270
on my father.

391
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,920
Here's the document we discussed.

392
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,250
   

393
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,470
    
 Mom didn't want to give it to me saying, it's her leash on Chairman Kim.

394
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,670
But I managed to convince her. It was tough to get it from her.

395
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:33,280
   

396
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,210
By chance...

397
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,450
you're not planning on exposing the shipping industry scandal, are you?

398
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,560
Mom and aunts...

399
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,710
There's a reason why they're turning a blind eye.

400
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,940
Don't worry.

401
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,900
I won't burn down the house

402
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,240
just to catch a mouse.

403
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,480
Then why do you need this document out of the blue?

404
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,300
Chairman Kim...

405
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,920
is importing vessels again.

406
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,930
I'm sure they aren't good vessels this time, either.

407
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,720
Why would he?

408
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,360
As for 11 years ago, he needed money

409
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,590
to buy shares to become the chairman.

410
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,430
He doesn't need to do that anymore.

411
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,090
All the assets he owns...

412
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,190
he won't be able to spend everything until the day he dies.

413
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,690
Why would he take such a risk now?

414
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,370
There's no way that Chairman Kim...

415
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,060
is after your shares

416
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,550
that are tied to the foundation, is he?

417
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,010
 No way? 

418
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,970
It's checkmate.

419
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,650
I lost.

420
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,740
Who taught you chess?

421
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,210
My mom.

422
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,860
I see.

423
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,270
Ms. Tae On is here.

424
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,940
I'll take Ga On upstairs.

425
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,610
Tae On is here?

426
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,450
No.

427
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,380
They'll meet at some point.

428
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,340
Your older sister will be here soon.

429
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,250
- Noona? 
 - Yeah.

430
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,670
What's going on?

431
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,420
Say hi.

432
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,240
Your younger brother.

433
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Your older sister I told you earlier.

434
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,880
Say hi.

435
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,910
Hello.

436
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,320
Who is that kid?

437
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,100
Cha Yi Hyeon had a son.

438
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,310
My son.

439
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,730
So you want to bring him into the family?

440
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,980
Yeah.

441
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,230
Why?

442
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,140
Sit down.

443
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,780
My neck hurts.

444
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,500
I now know why people want a child

445
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,420
in their older years.

446
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,980
The kid...

447
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,590
sure has me wrapped around his fingers.

448
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,580
He even has cuteness that

449
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,130
I couldn't even see in you, as a daughter.

450
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,820
I guess he takes after his mom, who wrapped her legs around anyone.

451
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,060
Do you even know Cha Yi Hyeon?

452
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,620
Do I have to see her to know her?

453
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,910
This is a good thing for you, too.

454
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,960
A good thing?

455
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,400
That child...

456
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,230
is your younger brother.

457
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,080
If you get along with him,

458
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,370
he'll help you out later,

459
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,950
and you'll be able to depend on him.

460
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,420
Depend on him?

461
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,320
I'm saying he's a thousand times better than

462
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,870
your mom's side of the family

463
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,590
who want crumbs off of you.

464
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,250
I'll raise him well...

465
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,040
so be good and depend on each other.

466
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,780
Be a good example as his older sister.

467
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,750
So be good.

468
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,670
Gosh, I'm tired.

469
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,960
I'll get some rest now.

470
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,610
It's late.

471
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,360
You should get going now.

472
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,200
I heard Cha Min Joon is Cha Yi Hyeon's younger brother.

473
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,720
People's connections are so interesting.

474
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,950
I had no idea then that woman's younger brother will be working for you.

475
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,330
So when it comes to relationships,

476
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,220
you can never burn the bridge

477
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,950
nor can you trust someone too much.

478
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,890
And without that child,

479
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:50,130
you would've been played by Cha Min Joon.

480
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:55,680
And you would've endangered FB Group.

481
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,750
If you don't stay alert from now on,

482
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,650
even if you're my daughter,

483
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,500
remember that I can't trust you with anything.

484
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,050
- That's all. Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

485
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,590
- Thank you. 
 - Sure. See you again.

486
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,760
   

487
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,720
Call Kang.

488
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,860
Yes, ma'am.

489
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,350
Pardon?

490
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,660
Including that lawyer?

491
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,700
Then talk to the police and...

492
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,440
release the cops staking out...

493
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,130
 After the sloppy job you've done, 

494
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,330
are you asking for me to clean up after you?

495
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,680
Get rid of Kang Hae Ra and Cha Min Joon right now.

496
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,360
Right now!

497
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:52,080
There are cops everywhere.

498
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,470
Under the circumstances, getting rid of Kang Hae Ra and that lawyer

499
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,910
is impossible.

500
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,280
I think that lawyer has a connection at the Prosecutors' Office.

501
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,100
She doesn't have our backs, yet asking us to do this...

502
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,340
Do you think she's making us take the fall?

503
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,630
If we get caught doing this,

504
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,070
she'll make us take all the blame for everything.

505
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,520
So I was thinking...

506
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,300
how about we lay low for a while?

507
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,540
You said that Director Kim is off the rails.

508
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,770
I think we should run away for now.

509
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,770
I'll find out...

510
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:28,070
if we can smuggle out of the country tonight from Incheon.

511
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,500
Mr. Cha.

512
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,030
I got a call from a friend in Incheon.

513
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,330
He got a call asking to smuggle out two adult men to China.

514
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,800
But the people who called him are in the money lending business.

515
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:44,410
I'm pretty sure it must be Kang.

516
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,820
At what time?

517
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,340
At 2 a.m.

518
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,390
I'll call Prosecutor Jang and ask him to send his team over.

519
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,700
You never know. I'll go to Incheon.

520
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,820
What?

521
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,300
What if you bump into Kang there?

522
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,410
You don't stand a chance.

523
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,480
I was just...

524
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,560
He's worried about you.

525
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,250
He's so skilled at speaking not so nicely.

526
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,800
If you're that worried, go with him.

527
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,860
Should I?

528
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,450
Then you two go together.

529
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,720
Kang can come by to pick up his car or stop by his office.

530
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,410
I'll go to the Happy Credit office.

531
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,310
Okay.

532
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,600
Bastard...

533
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,900
Hey, what the hell is with you?

534
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,650
I'll show you where you belong.

535
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,720
Damn it!

536
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,410
The police will arrive soon.

537
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,400
Tell me where Cha Yi Hyeon is before then.

538
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,070
Who? Cha Yi Hyeon?

539
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,330
Cha Yi Hyeon you chased off to Gunsan.

540
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,180
Oh, that... that Chairman Kim's second woman?

541
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:25,350
Why? Was she yours to begin with?

542
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,700
Tell me what happened to my noona!

543
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,480
Your sister...

544
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,720
Why are you looking for your sister now?

545
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,330
Okay, okay, okay!

546
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,950
Your sister...

547
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,660
Damn it!

548
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,190
Get in here!

549
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,720
Damn it!

550
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,270
I didn't think you'd be like this.

551
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,700
I had no idea you'd run off abandoning your kids.

552
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,530
That's not it...

553
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,810
The police are everywhere right now.

554
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,540
I was going to take care of them after things calmed down.

555
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,100
 Dad? 

556
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,450
 Dad. 

557
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,890
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,130
Princess!

559
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,900
Yeah, I'm fine.

560
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,340
Your mom and your sister are well, right?

561
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,190
 But just a moment ago... 

562
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,690
 - your friend brought us a gift.  
 - What?

563
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,700
My friend?

564
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,890
 Just a moment. 

565
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,520
 Your friend wants to talk to you. 

566
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,750
Keep your eye on them for a while.

567
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,250
I'll call you if there are any changes.

568
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,840
Even if you have to leave,

569
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,210
you should wrap up everything.

570
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,000
Isn't that right?

571
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,620
What are you going to do now?

572
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,080
Hyungnim.

573
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,500
I think...

574
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,640
that lawyer has Kang Hae Ra's back.

575
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,370
You think I don't know that?

576
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,060
What I'm saying is...

577
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,660
I think Kang Hae Ra exposed Happy Credit

578
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,660
plotting with that bastard.

579
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,080
The police and Prosecutors' Office raided us at the scene.

580
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,510
Kang Hae Ra couldn't have that kind of power.

581
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,210
All the local police were on our side.

582
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,440
Kang Hae Ra isn't working alone...

583
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,410
but they're working as a team.

584
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,190
That tall girl from Gusan Agency and...

585
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,660
that blond hair and the lawyer's guy.

586
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,590
I think they're a team.

587
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,970
Gusan Agency?

588
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,630
   

589
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,850
Yeah.

590
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,900
What? They're not coming?

591
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,090
All right.

592
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,750
Eun Hye sunbae got a call from the smuggling broker.

593
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,160
Those two men who were to be smuggled said they're not leaving.

594
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,410
Then I'll turn the car around.

595
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,580
Drop me off around here.

596
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,510
Wouldn't it be better to go back to Gusan Agency?

597
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,320
If Choi didn't smuggle out,

598
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,210
he might show up at one of the offices.

599
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,820
I'll continue to stake out.

600
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,550
- See you later. 
 - Hey.

601
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,800
Be careful.

602
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,470
You be careful, Hyung.

603
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,750
   

604
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,420
Yes, Hyung. Where are you?

605
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,310
What?

606
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,780
Stay there. I'll be right there.

607
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,410
   

608
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,690
Hyung.

609
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,800
Are you okay?

610
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,510
Yeah, I'm fine. How is it going with Kang?

611
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,930
We got a call from Goo Eun Hye

612
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,020
saying that they canceled all of a sudden.

613
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:55,350
Where are Gusan Agency people?

614
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,710
Hyun Sung went looking for Choi.

615
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,510
Goo Eun Hye is staking out at Happy Credit.

616
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:02,590
Kang Hae Ra is probably at the Gusan Agency office.

617
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,240
By chance, did this guy stop by?

618
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,700
No.

619
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,400
All right.

620
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,790
Thank you.

621
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,210
Geez, let me go to the restroom.

622
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,410
Hey, rookie.

623
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:43,520
I heard you were desperately looking for me.

624
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,100
I missed you so much, too.

625
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:50,270
Since we desperately wanted to meet, here we are.

626
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,450
What the hell are you talking about?

627
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,920
Your face...

628
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,790
You keep snickering, not knowing your place.

629
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,660
I wanted to make sure you can't go around with your head up.

630
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,670
You're dead meat today.

631
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:23,580
Won't he come by the office?

632
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,740
Why?

633
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,080
You were waiting for me so desperately.

634
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,850
Happy to see me?

635
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,300
Your dad, Goo Sung Chul.

636
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,700
Your dad is so worried about you.

637
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:51,000
If you have time to chase other people,

638
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,880
be good to your dad.

639
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,900
What?

640
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,770
Why don't you call your dad?

641
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,260
Dad.

642
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,920
 Eun Hye, where are you? 

643
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,490
Dad, what's wrong?

644
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:20,460
 I heard you got hurt and is in the hospital. 

645
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,240
 Tell me which hospital. I'll be right over. 

646
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,130
I guess he wants to come running since it's about his daughter.

647
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:34,930
Are you ready?

648
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,850
 Yes. 

649
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,740
 I'll run him over as soon as you tell me. 

650
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,800
What are you doing right now?

651
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,870
 Eun Hye, what's wrong? 

652
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,300
 Are you okay? Huh? 

653
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,200
Dad. Dad...

654
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,810
Dad! Dad!

655
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,520
What?

656
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,880
Should I run him over?

657
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,070
You crazy bastard!

658
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,900
If I see you one more time,

659
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,530
I won't be polite as to explain like this then.

660
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,100
That scum bag.

661
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,620
   

662
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,820
Hyun Sung, what happened?

663
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,980
Where did you go?

664
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,300
I thought something had happened to you, too.

665
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:15,140
This happened to him while chasing after Choi.

666
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,090
Let's go to the ER first.

667
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,330
It's okay.

668
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,050
I know myself.

669
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,460
What's wrong with you?

670
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,980
I think I should visit my dad.

671
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:38,750
Kang found out Dad's number somehow and had him come out...

672
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,920
- Eun Hye! 
 - Dad.

673
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,760
What happened? Are you all right?

674
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,380
Dad, what happened to you?

675
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,940
    
 This...

676
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,820
What the heck is this?

677
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:02,220
    
 Your dad is dying trying to pay off his debt.

678
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,820
Yet the daughter is playing detective.

679
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,890
If I see you one more time,

680
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,190
forget his debt.

681
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,650
I'll turn over your dad to the lumber yard.

682
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,060
Just know that.

683
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,850
I thought you paid off all the debt.

684
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:16,900
You still had more?

685
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,200
You don't have to worry.

686
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,150
How can I not worry?

687
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,100
Do you know how cruel that Kang is?

688
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,890
Of all people, why Kang?

689
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,520
Actually...

690
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,960
the warehouse that caught on fire belonged to Kang.

691
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,760
Even after turning over the building,

692
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,850
I still owed Kang.

693
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,890
I had no choice but to write that note.

694
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,090
What?

695
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,720
That warehouse was...

696
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,650
Kang's warehouse?

697
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:46,710
What are you talking about?

698
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,520
That warehouse belonged to Kang?

699
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,500
That's why Kang filed the right of indemnity lawsuit against you?

700
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,040
Wait a minute.

701
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,600
What fire?

702
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,370
Eleven years ago, I asked Mr. Goo

703
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:03,530
to go to Gunsan to look for a sunbae.

704
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,420
He said he found her, so I went there, too.

705
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,990
But Sunbae was trapped inside a warehouse on fire.

706
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:13,560
That's when I met Ga On for the first time.

707
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,480
Because of me, Mr. Goo...

708
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:22,970
went to that warehouse.

709
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:24,920
Then...

710
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,910
the client...

711
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,160
back then...

712
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,420
was you, Hae Ra?

713
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,910
I'm sorry...

714
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,370
for not telling you sooner.

715
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,430
Hae Ra also found out this afternoon that I was sued for

716
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:47,530
the right of indemnity over that fire.

717
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:50,830
At the time, Hae Ra couldn't afford to pay off the lawsuit.

718
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,400
She wanted to tell you about it.

719
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,520
But I told her not to disturb you.

720
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:57,820
Then...

721
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,970
the woman and the baby were trapped inside the warehouse.

722
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:03,840
And they set the place on fire with them inside?

723
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,430
I don't know if they started the fire intentionally.

724
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,900
But it's true that the woman and the baby were trapped inside.

725
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,230
 Sunbae was trapped inside a warehouse on fire. 

726
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:48,120
 That's when I met Ga On for the first time. 

727
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,390
    
 I hadn't heard from you yet...

728
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,260
so I was wondering what was going on.

729
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:20,210
Chairman Kim will release news on the shipping contract insurance in the near future.

730
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:23,140
Please run that story extensively.

731
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,490
The news about Chairman Kim?

732
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:29,590
And along with that, I'd like a relevant article to spread.

733
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,890
It's about shipping insurance from 11 years ago.

734
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,120
Why did you give me this?

735
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,380
Eleven years ago, a shipping company imported vessels

736
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,570
and signed up for insurance with Sangil Fire Insurance.

737
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:48,340
Sangil Fire Insurance signed up for another insurance with FB Fire.

738
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,160
But a vessel from that shipping company got into an accident.

739
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:55,130
So when the accident occurred,

740
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:58,290
FB Fire must've paid off Sangil Fire Insurance.

741
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,480
That's right.

742
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,470
FB Fire Insurance that was covering for Sangil

743
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,950
paid quite a large sum to them.

744
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:10,720
The real owner of Sangil Fire Insurance

745
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,690
was Chairman Kim.

746
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:15,680
The shipping company responsible for the accident

747
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,650
was Chairman Kim's paper company.

748
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,580
You're saying the insurance compensation paid by FB Fire

749
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,640
ultimately ended up in Chairman Kim's pocket.

750
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,720
But not too long ago,

751
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,810
that shipping company changed its name and opened for business

752
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,890
and started importing vessels.

753
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:35,380
You're saying that company

754
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:38,440
recently signed up for insurance with FB Fire, right?

755
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,720
Is there any document related to the shipping company?

756
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:47,740
For now, I'd like the insurance scandal to go public.

757
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,860
This is the document you gave me last time.

758
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,200
You did a good job.

759
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:07,830
We have time for paperwork.

760
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,700
But I wonder if we can get past the customs.

761
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,700
You don't have to worry about that.

762
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,710
I have someone else for that job.

763
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:18,890
While Tae On is in China,

764
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:22,410
you just have to make sure things are moving smoothly.

765
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,060
Yes, I understand.

766
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,220
But...

767
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:31,840
Director Song Seung Woo. He'll be helping Director Kim.

768
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,620
Will you be okay with that?

769
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:36,610
The Global Strategy team leader is an executive position.

770
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:40,420
Director Kim's leave for China might not happen.

771
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,090
Do you think Seung Woo and her aunts

772
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,710
will stop Tae On from going to China?

773
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,730
When they find out Tae On is leaving for China,

774
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:52,880
they'll shout hooray with their arms raised.

775
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,290
Tae On's mom's side of the family...

776
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:57,990
might seem like they care about her.

777
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:00,410
They're circling around Tae On

778
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:02,760
to get something for themselves.

779
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,690
And she has no idea.

780
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:07,160
She thinks her maternal side is on her side

781
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,090
and teams up with Seung Woo.

782
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:10,460
Geez.

783
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,340
I want to split them up,

784
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:16,150
and that's why I'm telling her to go to China.

785
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:21,200
So you're doing that on purpose for Director Kim's sake.

786
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,780
In any case...

787
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,990
she's my daughter.

788
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,560
Tae On and Ga On both...

789
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,600
In order for them to survive this jungle,

790
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,860
they need to have power.

791
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,560
If not...

792
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,450
those hyenas will...

793
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,360
rip them apart...

794
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,450
and devour them.

795
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,330
   

796
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,600
All right. Shall we begin?

797
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,780
What?

798
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,330
I'd be offended even if Deputy Chief Ahn came in.

799
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,810
A low-level prosecutor like you will interrogate me?

800
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,690
I'm curious about that, too.

801
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,520
Why did I get assigned to this case out of the blue?

802
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:26,480
I went in because Deputy Chief Ahn summoned me in a hurry.

803
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,560
And he gives me this case.

804
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:36,120
   

805
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,010
 What are you trying to pull right now? 

806
00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:46,020
I tried to talk him into it.

807
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:50,210
But your case was such high profile that they can't let you go that easily.

808
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:53,070
 They said you can't avoid being placed under arrest. 

809
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,410
My gosh.

810
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:58,130
I had no idea it will turn out this way.

811
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,230
What?

812
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,440
You had no idea?

813
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,580
 You tried to get the document on Chairman Kim from me. 

814
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,760
You rambled on about going to China and my going back to headquarters, huh?

815
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,300
Do you think I'll sit back and take it like this?

816
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:23,350
Geez, she can't even handle it, yet she's all over the place, not knowing her place.

817
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:26,830
You have to bring down that Tae On while you're at it!

818
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,690
If Chairman Kim switches to holding companies,

819
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:32,140
we're all screwed!

820
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,560
Geez, come on now!

821
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,880
Don't let the calls from my maternal side through for now.

822
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:40,950
Yes, ma'am.

823
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,040
Where is Chairman Kim?

824
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,530
He's at the office.

825
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,470
Open it.

826
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:22,090
Are you really giving this to me?

827
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:24,040
You can use it right away.

828
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,300
Really?

829
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,710
I can make a call right now?

830
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:31,810
You must have someone you want to call.

831
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:37,090
You should keep an eye on the press from now on.

832
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:40,300
If any issues come up before switching to holding companies,

833
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,860
it will affect other things,  too.

834
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,280
Okay, that'll be all.

835
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,000
Go on and get back to work.

836
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,360
Yes, sir.

837
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,090
She can't find Ga On.

838
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:03,330
What?

839
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:05,730
Director Kim Tae On stopped by earlier.

840
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:08,020
He's been missing since then.

841
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,900
Find out where Tae On is.

842
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,950
Yes.

843
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,100
Hurry!

844
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,190
Did you see Eun Hye?

845
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:00,870
She went to drive Mr. Goo home last night.

846
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,710
She's not back yet?

847
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,360
Yeah.

848
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,650
Are you feeling better?

849
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:07,960
I'm okay.

850
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,730
Don't worry about me.

851
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:11,390
I'll go out for a moment.

852
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:13,140
Are you going to look for Choi?

853
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,830
I have to look into something else.

854
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:16,490
Be careful.

855
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,660
Okay.

856
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:41,200
 I was curious from the get-go. 

857
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,000
 Kang... 

858
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,130
 Who does he work for? 

859
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:50,140
 He's working for Director Kim Tae On. 

860
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,830
Yes.

861
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:14,430
 Mom, it's me. 

862
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:16,130
Ga On.

863
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,400
Whose phone is this?

864
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,130
 Mom, I got a new cellphone. 

865
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:25,850
 Is your workplace Gusan Agency? 

866
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:26,890
What?

867
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:28,000
Yeah.

868
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,970
Ta-da!

869
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:40,130
- Are you sure she went there? 
 - Yes.

870
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,250
Ga On.

871
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,900
Ga On, how did you come here?

872
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,450
Ga On.

873
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:37,460
- Is this the place? 
 - Yes.

874
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,260
We found the right place.

875
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,560
Good job.

876
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:05,330
Hae Ra!

877
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:06,470
♫  I will walk through rough life  ♫

878
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:13,770
♫  You and I will stand in the midst of it all  ♫

879
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:16,430
   

880
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,100
   

881
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:23,770
    
  Watch Kang Hae Ra closely and see what she's up to. 

882
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:25,680
 Find out the real owner of the warehouse 

883
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,460
 as well as the current owner. 

884
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:31,180
 Did you come to work here to get me and FB Group? 

885
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,610
 Don't you dare touch even a hair on Ga On. 

886
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,360
 I'll kill you. 

887
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,160
 I'll have to let him finish what he started. 

888
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,240
 They share a long history. 

889
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,860
 I'm sorry. 

890
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,940
 I'm sorry, Mr. Cha. 

891
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:46,410
 Eun Hye!
