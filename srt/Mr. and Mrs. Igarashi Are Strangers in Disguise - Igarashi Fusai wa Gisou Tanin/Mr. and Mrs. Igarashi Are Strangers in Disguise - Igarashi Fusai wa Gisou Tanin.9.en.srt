1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,010
(Takebashi) Like Like... (Miya) Manager

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,900
The stone steps are amazing. (Takebashi) Hahaha...

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,800
I'm going up the stairs now. That's amazing.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,000
(Naoto) It reminds me of me. (Mahiro) Yes.

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,760
We went to a place where we went on a trip for the first time.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,050
I can't believe I'll be coming with you this time for work.

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,850
I guess it means I should remember my feelings once again.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,710
There was still.

9
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,170
Ah... yes.

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,710
Ah, sorry.

11
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,230
yes….

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,920
Dad, take care, there's a step here.

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,610
yes.

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,610
That's wonderful. Yeah.

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,880
Can we do it too?

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,090
I can.

17
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,770
Two people line up

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,320
Even if you become a grandpa and grandma

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,000
(Takebashi) Look, I've said this many times, but everyone... It's a trial stay, it's a trial stay!

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,730
Come on, group action, come up.

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,890
(Yamanaka) Hayashi-san! (Miu) Wow, so cute.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,580
(Miu) It's chewy. (Yamanaka) Hey, fluffy.

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,280
(Miya) Manager: Let's buy some manju after all.

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,220
We're thinking about telling Hayashi-san.

25
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,720
picture?

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,070
I wasn't told what I felt directly

27
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,110
Maybe I'm self-conscious though...

28
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,640
It'll be clear someday.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,680
I think it's better to say it early.

30
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,900
I agree.

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,830
Let's apologise and get it to understand what we've hidden.

32
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,430
Yeah.

33
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,130
Everyone, pose! (Everyone) Yes.

34
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,490
(Miya) Please.

35
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,650
I'll take a picture.

36
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,050
(Shutter sound)

37
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,760
Of course, there are a lot of families.

38
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,760
ah….

39
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,330
Around the entrance

40
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,700
It would be great to create a space that the family can enjoy.

41
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,390
surely. Yeah.

42
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,250
The outage is nice, so I want to make this work.

43
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,250
Would you like to see it? Deep. Yeah.

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,180
Seto-san: You haven't said anything unnecessary to Kaizawa-san, have you?

45
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,210
(Seto) Well... Are you scared?

46
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,900
Accept your feelings.

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

48
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,620
(Tongue tapping)

49
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,320
That's how you push yourself.

50
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,600
Mom, what's wrong?

51
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,470
I said that today, I'm on a business trip.

52
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,170
Helper? I'm asking.

53
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,220
Because it should be coming soon. Wait a little longer.

54
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,220
Yes, then.

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,290
Are you okay? Something happened?

56
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,660
Ah, no... from my mother. ah….

57
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,200
My grandmother has dementia.

58
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,570
Recently, I've been moving forward a little... It's difficult to be alone with my mother.

59
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,610
Do you live together? Ah... Yes.

60
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:54,160
My mother and I were caring for them. I see...

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,520
That's tough for Hayashi-san too.

62
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:03,240
Sometimes it can get mentally exhausted.

63
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,240
But it's an important family and I feel like I need to support them.

64
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,700
So, what about that souvenir?

65
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,070
Ah... Grandma likes this kind of thing.

66
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,100
Ah, I see.

67
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,800
Don't overdo it too much.

68
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,670
thank you.

69
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,880
So, um... Yes, gather! I'll hand over the key.

70
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Yes, group action! (Seto) It's passing by.

71
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
So let's go. yes.

72
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,240
(Everyone) Oh... No no...

73
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,620
Wow, this is my first time doing a hot spring outside of a family trip.

74
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,820
So I have to buy a souvenir from my wife.

75
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm getting mad. (Miya) What?

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
If you forget that, you'll definitely get scolded!

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,220
(Higashitani) Is he a type of person lying on the boss's butt?

78
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,580
There's no husband who isn't afraid of his wife, right?

79
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,940
Eh, why are you scared?

80
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,300
You married people you like, right?

81
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,480
Of course that's true...

82
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,670
A couple is the closest stranger.

83
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,550
It seems we understand each other, but we don't understand each other.

84
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,250
Missing things are common.

85
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,440
It's tough! I don't think I can do it.

86
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,800
In the first place, you don't have a girlfriend.

87
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,000
That's the most difficult thing! Just

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,370
You can reveal any kind of appearance, even if it's not cool.

89
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,560
Is there a sense of security?

90
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,590
No matter what, this person will be there

91
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,280
That's it.

92
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,830
(Everyone) Wow! (Takebashi) No, a moment... Stop it!

93
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,520
Stop it, it's fine to talk about me. Talk about work.

94
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,890
(Miya) Are you starting now?

95
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,420
But I'm jealous. That kind of wonderful family.

96
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,800
(Miya) Eh, Hayashi-san, do you have a desire to get married?

97
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,820
Of course there is!

98
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,860
I'm not very confident about myself

99
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,580
Marry a wonderful person who accepts me like this

100
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:21,470
I hope that we can be blessed with a cute baby and build a warm family.

101
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,470
(Everyone) Hmm...

102
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,600
Seto? what up?

103
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,130
I'm not particularly interested in this, so I get a drink.

104
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,830
(Miya) What?

105
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,860
Ah... I'll go too.

106
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,720
It's a shawl... This too. Hahaha...

107
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,740
Huh. Aii... Aii.

108
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,100
Seto: It feels bad.

109
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,290
He's been in a bad mood lately.

110
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,330
(Yamanaka) Isn't that how it always feels?

111
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,200
Ah, Hayashi-san.

112
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,200
I have something I want to talk about after this.

113
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,290
If you like it

114
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,650
I wonder if he'll come to my room after this.

115
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:18,360
What... what about the story?

116
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,070
I'll talk about the details then.

117
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,590
It's bad though

118
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,960
Can you come so that you don't get noticed?

119
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,490
got it.

120
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,010
Ah... Incidentally, the room is a drum.

121
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,010
Drum... Yes.

122
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,500
The type like Deputy Director

123
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,360
It's the best thing to turn on the switch that you can't leave alone.

124
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,360
It feels like he's finally getting serious.

125
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,750
Okay!

126
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,860
Drum here?

127
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,860
(Door chime)

128
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Good evening, Deputy Director...

129
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,620
teeth?

130
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,270
Why is Aizawa-san there?

131
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,550
From us to Hayashi

132
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,420
There's something I have to talk about.

133
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,460
We are...

134
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:58,870
Actually, I've been silent with everyone at work...

135
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,870
Ah, that...

136
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,320
We are couples.

137
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,940
I got married in-house at my previous company.

138
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,500
There have been so many things that they are separated now.

139
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,350
If we change jobs,

140
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,060
By chance, I joined the same company...

141
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,590
Until I decide what to do in the future

142
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,590
Let's hide it to everyone.

143
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,050
I'm really sorry.

144
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,050
Wow...

145
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,530
To hide the relationship

146
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:10,080
It's my fault for saying that I was single right away.

147
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm so sorry.

148
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:25,570
But you were kind to me, right?

149
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,570
You're doing pretty hard every day

150
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,330
Even if I see my true self

151
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,560
It's okay. You accepted that you're trying hard...

152
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,940
He protected me from stalkers that day too.

153
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:53,340
(Miu) I thought Deputy Director was only looking at me!

154
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,190
Since then, is stalkers okay?

155
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,190
yes! good

156
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,120
You are an important subordinate.

157
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
I don't feel any more than that.

158
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,560
I was shallow.

159
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,560
I shouldn't have stayed there.

160
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,830
just

161
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,700
Only things that incite her anxiety

162
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,700
Please don't say it.

163
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,590
I like Mahiro.

164
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,870
Huh? Uncomfortable...

165
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,970
Why should I be told that?

166
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,330
It's my fault for that person to lie!

167
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,880
Do something that will make you feel good and don't say I'm the bad guy!

168
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,400
it is…. Traitor!

169
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
I'll give it to everyone!

170
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,170
Don't be fooled!

171
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,170
Don't be fooled!

172
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,970
(Miya and the others' talk)

173
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,660
that! Can you listen a bit?

174
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,180
Oops, are you okay?

175
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,200
It looks like I was really drunk.

176
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,220
I'm drunk... What? Are you about to vomit?

177
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,070
(Seto) It's dangerous, here...

178
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,770
(Miu) No! yeah? What?

179
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,790
It was like this. Looks like fun.

180
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm excited, everyone. I'm the only one who's depressed.

181
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,370
What is it? What? Please don't do it anymore.

182
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,400
Just leave it alone!

183
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,260
Is it okay to know what's going on now?

184
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,780
They're the ones who are in the wrong.

185
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,140
Hey, stay calm for a little while... Calm?

186
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,680
There's no way you can become it! Because I finally found it.

187
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,540
at last….

188
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,390
I'm calm too though

189
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,590
You're happy inside, right? It would be better if the two divorced.

190
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,620
What if you're a bit honest?

191
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,990
Even plucking people like you

192
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,850
I don't want to satisfy my desires.

193
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,850
That's how I'm just running away from my feelings.

194
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,470
(footsteps)

195
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,380
Hayashi-san, can you talk?

196
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
(Miu) What? I'm talking to Seto-san right now.

197
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,620
sorry….

198
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,490
I don't really want to talk to this person.

199
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,490
please.

200
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,930
Hayashi-san... Because I won't allow it.

201
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,800
That guy lied to me because he was single too

202
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
You were pretending to be someone else and laughing a little.

203
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,430
I didn't have time to laugh.

204
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,300
Why not take it easy to act like a good person?

205
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,170
Hayashi-san, maybe

206
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,380
Did you know we're a couple?

207
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,730
What if that's the case?

208
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,920
Did you also set up the matter with Director Itaka?

209
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,630
Wow, Kaizawa-san wasn't surprisingly stupid.

210
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,500
That's not to say what you do, right?

211
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Did you tell the deputy director?

212
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,090
I haven't said that.

213
00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:00,480
I am also responsible for letting you go this far.

214
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,010
Don't make fun of me!

215
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,040
That kind of thing is what makes you think of someone good!

216
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,570
It's not all your fault!

217
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,930
If you knew you were married

218
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,780
I couldn't really like the Deputy Director!

219
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,500
I don't want to have an affair! I just want the Deputy Director!

220
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,370
You... There's no way you can understand my feelings!

221
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,240
To get what you want... To get what you want

222
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,430
Even though I've never been desperate!

223
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,790
Why... what I got was trying to let go of it easily.

224
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,490
Isn't the Deputy Director that important?

225
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,350
You thought you didn't need it, right? If so, give it away!

226
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,350
If it were me, I would never let go of the Deputy Director's hands!

227
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,170
(The sound of opening the ramune)

228
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,910
Ah, sorry.

229
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,440
Don't listen!

230
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,470
I was just keeping an eye on it.

231
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,850
If they were asked, they would have said something incredible.

232
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,870
Seriously annoying.

233
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,740
What I told me the other day

234
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,270
It's recorded so I guess I can just take it all out.

235
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,310
What if you like? It's also revealed that Aizawa and the deputy chief are married.

236
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:28,310
Even so, you're definitely the one who will be in a terrible position at the company.

237
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,130
Really you

238
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:43,130
He's the prince of Hakuba, who is convenient for Aizawa-san.

239
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,550
Kaizawa-san

240
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,260
Seto-san always protects Kaizawa-san behind the scenes

241
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,260
Don't you think it's brave?

242
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,970
You should be grateful.

243
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,740
That necklace doesn't suit me at all!

244
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Is it okay...?

245
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,810
Ah, yes...

246
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,920
That Seto-kun might be...

247
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,940
I knew it.

248
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,940
I heard it from the forest.

249
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,060
Sorry I got involved in this.

250
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Not particularly.

251
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,510
Um... don't cause any more trouble

252
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,510
I'll be careful.

253
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,260
I've learned a lot too

254
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,790
It's less confusing to share information

255
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,790
I think it's easy to work out as well.

256
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,510
thank you.

257
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,280
worst….

258
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,630
Um... I have a request.

259
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:08,760
I wonder if the Deputy Director will keep quiet about what Hayashi-san did behind the scenes?

260
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,980
Is it because it will be used as a transaction material with Hayashi?

261
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,510
I haven't thought about it that much.

262
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:23,580
But everyone can tell the person they like that ugly

263
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,940
I don't think it's annoying. that's why….

264
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,960
sorry

265
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,510
I really don't know what you're saying.

266
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:39,570
Ah... That's right.

267
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,620
But what is Hayashi's feelings for Deputy Director?

268
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,480
I don't think it's a lie. that's why

269
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,480
I don't want to hurt him any more...

270
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,580
Please take it easy.

271
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,580
That kind of kindness is what drives everyone around you.

272
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,830
So I'm...

273
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,340
Me...

274
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,890
I'll leave it as ramune.

275
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,640
Yeah…. If you let your guard down

276
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,640
This is how you'll be taken advantage of. Please be aware of this for a moment.

277
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,710
yes….

278
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,590
So shall we go?

279
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,020
(Door chime)

280
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Mahiro.

281
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:03,000
I see... Did he tell Seto too?

282
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I caused trouble. home.

283
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,560
So you could talk calmly with Hayashi?

284
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,150
Umm...

285
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,340
Rather, it feels like he was defeated.

286
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,190
picture? no

287
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,050
The other side was really heated up.

288
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,590
I see...

289
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,290
But I don't think I'll be saying that.

290
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,640
When you calm down

291
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
I think he's the type who doesn't take himself any disadvantage.

292
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,530
For now, I have no choice but to see what happens.

293
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
That's right.

294
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,950
Can I listen to it a bit?

295
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,220
Hayashi-san asked for his cooperation, wasn't Seto?

296
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,370
That... to make us part ways.

297
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:18,590
Well, that's how it is.

298
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,590
Why was it Seto?

299
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,150
Because I thought I was hooked by Aizawa-san.

300
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,940
picture….
