1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,850
Aizawa-san, thank you for your continued support today.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,550
(Mahiro) Oh, please. Please don't be nervous.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,570
Please relax completely. yes.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,090
Well, let's start with

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,970
Please tell us why you changed jobs to our company.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,330
I was drawn to this company

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,360
As the company name means "danran".

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,420
Design: Not only functional, but also the warmth of the family

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,620
Because we deal with such interior decorations.

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,500
By becoming a family that marries someone who isn't yours

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,210
I think there are things that can help you grow internally.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,420
Do you think that family-friendly proposals are needed in the future?

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,280
I agree.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,280
Naoto: Madly asked, I thought he was a little more solid.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,740
Let me do it at my own pace

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:08,130
Interiors have the potential to enrich such family time.

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,130
I realized the depth and became interested.

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,230
It's not softened! I can't rest at all!

19
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,940
I can laugh and say thank you for your hard work

20
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,940
I want to be such a couple...

21
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,280
Aizawa-san: You're in the contract business department, right?

22
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,140
yes. What kind of work did you do before?

23
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,320
Was it done?

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,860
(Kazuma) Well, Igarashi is excellent so I'm looking forward to it.

25
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,380
thank you. (Kazuma) I'm looking forward to the first day.

26
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,580
I will do my best to be able to work with Kazama again.

27
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,770
It's a fresh start. yes.

28
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,290
do your best. thank you.

29
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,480
I'll see you again soon.

30
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,850
Yes, this is it. thank you.

31
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,050
(Miya) Aizawa-san!

32
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,230
That's heavy, I'll carry it.

33
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,590
It's okay. It's fine, it's fine.

34
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,290
Aizawa Mahiro has become a member of Samuras Japan.

35
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,290
I look forward to your success in the future.

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,670
I always say that and leave it alone.

37
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:55,540
Ma asked, I thought I was a little more solid.

38
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,540
Haa...

39
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,730
Oh!

40
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,080
Huh?

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,960
What do you mean? Why is he there?

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,170
why? Why is he there?

43
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,170
Huh?

44
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,720
(Takebashi) Look, see. He's a bit handsome, isn't he?

45
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,080
That's why don't compare yourself to me.

46
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,460
Do you all know? A little too much laugh!

47
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,810
Please all get along well.

48
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,350
So this is Igarashi-kun, who will be joining the company from today.

49
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,720
Igarashi-kun will be asked to follow me as deputy director.

50
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,080
Nice to meet you, this is Igarashi Naoto.

51
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

52
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,370
Ah, um...

53
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,090
what up? Igarashi-kun, are you nervous?

54
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,950
Right. I was a little too motivated.

55
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,950
(Takebashi) That's reliable. Hey!

56
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,710
Yes, starting today, with you all

57
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,740
We will work hard to improve our planning and sales capabilities.

58
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,110
Let's work together to liven up the contract business division.

59
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,110
(Takebashi) Applause!

60
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,700
(Miu) Oh no! A super-respective property has arrived!

61
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,280
(Miu) Nice to meet you.

62
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,300
Haa...

63
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,510
No way No way No way No way. I thought I would stop breathing.

64
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,870
What is this a dream? Divine punishment?

65
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,570
Abundant memorial services from ancestors... (footsteps)

66
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,450
Isn't it?

67
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,450
It's been a while, wife.

68
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,900
Why are you at this company?

69
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,930
That's this line.

70
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,790
I joined the company a month ago.

71
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,500
I thought I'd shut up and quit, but then I quickly changed jobs?

72
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,200
You quit because you didn't want to meet up with them.

73
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,230
Why are you joining the same company again?

74
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:40,620
I had been approached for headhunting for three months now.

75
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,640
teeth? What is that?

76
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,660
I couldn't say it.

77
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,200
That's going to run away from home without your permission.

78
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,230
it is….

79
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,430
Do you know?

80
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,430
Are we married?

81
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,990
That's right, but...

82
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,890
I mean, where do you live?

83
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,910
Should I let you know, right?

84
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,800
It's not something that adults do to leave suddenly and not let go of it.

85
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,000
Idiot who runs away from home but lets out the first move

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,020
Where are you?

87
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,020
This isn't just for us.

88
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:33,310
I was invited by the boss, but as soon as I joined the company, I had such a problem.

89
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,010
How much trouble will your selfish actions cause to those around you?

90
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:40,010
As a couple, there's no problem if they stay quiet, right?

91
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,630
Haa...

92
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,720
If you are a subordinate, speak in honorific language, just like a subordinate.

93
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,530
It's annoying!

94
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,530
Annoying, annoying, annoying!

95
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,540
(Seto) Aizawa-san. Huh?

96
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,740
This is the opposite.

97
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,590
Ah!

98
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,590
Ah!

99
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,040
thank you.

100
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,570
It's for myself.

101
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,270
The salesman's mistakes have an impact on me, the designer.

102
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,270
I'll be careful after that.

103
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,600
Deputy Director: This is the document for the person in charge.

104
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,640
I also sent it to you, but I printed it just to be safe.

105
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,330
thank you. Hayashi is quick to work.

106
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,180
Yes, I'm happy. Ah, hey...

107
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,530
Ah, sorry. OK?

108
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,530
Thank you Thank you.

109
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,110
Ah, sorry, sorry.

110
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Deputy Director. This is...

111
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,320
Excuse me a bit. Huh?

112
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Yeah! They're definitely matching!

113
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,890
Eh, maybe you two...

114
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,540
Do you like kokeshi?

115
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,540
yes? Huh?

116
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,950
Ah, that's right. That's right.

117
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,130
Wow, too, Kaizawa-san?

118
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,830
Ah yes. I love Kokeshi...

119
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,370
(Miu) Wow. It's cute isn't it? Cute Cute.

120
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,390
cute…. By coincidence By coincidence.

121
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,410
like….

122
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,280
I didn't know that my wife was in the same company! ?

123
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,470
sorry.

124
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,170
Rather, I think they chose the same company on purpose.

125
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,200
In fact, I'm waiting for a comment.

126
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,060
I actually didn't say it.

127
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,910
Why didn't you say it?

128
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,630
No, why don't you both know?

129
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,170
It's embarrassing, we're separated.

130
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,030
Since then, I have not heard from you.

131
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,380
Is that what's going on?

132
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,580
there was.

133
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,110
So what are your future plans?

134
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,830
No, it's about the couple's business policy.

135
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:17,210
That has not been confirmed by the other party's intentions.

136
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,250
Hmm, that's not good.

137
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,450
sorry. Ah, no...

138
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,990
My department is caused by an old problem

139
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,680
I've been avoiding placing couples.

140
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,240
I'll try to take this opportunity to lift the ban.

141
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,290
If that were to become a divorce at a rapid pace...

142
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,160
It's not that we're married to our team...

143
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,700
Of course I didn't say it.

144
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
oh dear….

145
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,740
Until we reach a conclusion, we will continue to... right?

146
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,200
We will strive to keep the information confidential.

147
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,410
Talk early.

148
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,610
Do it well.

149
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,610
Beautifully cleanly.

150
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,700
So please, please.

151
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,220
thank you.

152
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,220
Ah, close the lock. yes.

153
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,920
(Mysterious) By chance, it's from the same company...

154
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,800
That's now fate.

155
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,670
I don't believe that.

156
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,050
So, could you talk to Naoto?

157
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,580
no….

158
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,610
I'll put on a bravado anyway

159
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,610
You just said things you never thought of.

160
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,160
As always, you're not honest.

161
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,750
I ran away from home without my permission

162
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,290
I think it was a bad thing that I didn't contacted him.

163
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,320
But...

164
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,030
When I get cornered by reasoning, I just can't speak properly.

165
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:34,590
If you don't get along that well, you should get a divorce right away.

166
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,590
That's true though.

167
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,640
Isn't that what you meant to run away from home?

168
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,380
it is….

169
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,640
Yes, a man appears.

170
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,830
Why Naoto...

171
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:03,830
If we don't do this, we won't talk properly either of us, right?

172
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,110
ah!

173
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,110
Don't show it, talk!

174
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:36,330
Where do you live now?

175
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,350
Umm...

176
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,350
Are you lying in the new man's house?

177
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,460
This is personal information so there is no obligation to answer this question.

178
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,460
Infidelity is against the law.

179
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:02,050
I rent an apartment and live alone.

180
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:11,860
Why don't you even contact me?

181
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,550
Even though I didn't contact you that.

182
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,580
That's the one that blocked emails and messages, right?

183
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,770
If you feel like that, you can do whatever you want.

184
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,470
It's strange to just block it off without permission, do something, isn't it?

185
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,650
Why is he always selfish like that?

186
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:30,370
Yes Snack Byuty Fru's special onion miso soup!

187
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,220
No, I don't like onions...

188
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,220
Onions have a sedative effect that reduces frustration.

189
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,500
Because we met like this

190
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Talk a little more.

191
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,590
Well, I got in!

192
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,310
That's over there!

193
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,330
Over there.

194
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,530
What are you doing?

195
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:49,160
～

196
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,680
Ah, already.

197
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,680
This is what happens because you act without thinking.

198
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,470
In the end, Naoto

199
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,470
You're trying to say it's all my fault, right?

200
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,760
Anyway, I told the manager.

201
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,470
It becomes a problem if this situation is known within the department.

202
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,470
I was strictly ordered not to say this now.

203
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,030
Why are you always so calm?

204
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,780
We are completely strangers.

205
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,780
To thoroughly disguise others.

206
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,690
I know it even if I'm not told.

207
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,490
It's fine now.

208
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,040
(Door opening and closing sound)

209
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,530
I have to do it properly...

210
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,530
divorce….

211
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,770
it hurts….

212
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,820
It hurts!

213
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,990
What are you laughing?

214
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,180
Naoto stares too much.

215
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,550
What is that?

216
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,430
Mahiro will rush straight away, so I'm nervous when he's with him.

217
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,430
Isn't it a mistake to make your heart pound?

218
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,440
Even a kokeshi ballpoint pen is so cute!

219
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,630
Oh, there's also a memo pad.

220
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,630
I'm somehow attached to the mystery.

221
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,380
Ah, sorry. Sorry, hello.

222
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,380
sorry.

223
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,270
Dad, take care, there's a step here.

224
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,120
yes.

225
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,120
That's wonderful. Yeah.

226
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,410
Can we do it too?

227
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,280
I can.

228
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,010
No matter how old they are, two of them side by side?

229
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:34,010
Even if the two of them side by side, become grandpas and grandmas.

230
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,450
Shall I buy this matching? Yeah

231
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,010
(Seto) So that's fine.

232
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,430
Sorry, what?

233
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,970
So you're attending the two of you tonight's welcome party, right?

234
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,000
Two? (Atsuya) I'm busy with delivery times

235
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,520
We hadn't had the welcome party for Kaizawa.

236
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,520
As it is joint, I would like to ask you. (Miya) Please!

237
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,780
OK? That's OK. I did it.

238
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,780
It was OK. That's good.

239
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,040
What is a welcome party?

240
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,420
There is a high possibility that you will be attacked by questions about your private life.

241
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:28,120
surely.

242
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,150
Here we are about each other's personalities

243
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,340
It's better to adjust the settings in advance...

244
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,360
Secondary Secretary!

245
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,040
Ah, Hayashi-san.

246
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,040
So this is what I'm.

247
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,460
(Miu) Welcome party! Ah...

248
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,990
Aizawa-san, let's drink as hard as we can today.

249
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,990
That's right? Let's prepare now.

250
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,430
(Miya) Come on! (Miu) Deputy Director Let's go!

251
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:03,130
So I wish you both the best of you.

252
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,330
cheers! (Everyone) Cheers!

253
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,330
thank you.

254
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,070
Wow, it looks delicious!

255
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,920
Ah, it's tasty!

256
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,130
It's delicious! It's thick.

257
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,490
Are you okay?

258
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,860
(Miu) Deputy Director: If you don't like beer, should I change it to something else?

259
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,230
Oh no, it's okay. thank you.

260
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,090
Hayashi-san: You're really considerate.

261
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,940
When you're in a place like this

262
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,630
It kind of makes me look like a mother.

263
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,630
I put a lot of onions.

264
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,250
Thank you, you're really good at it.

265
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,360
yes! Well then, please take a look!

266
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,910
(Yamanaka) Today we're starting a question time for the two leading characters!

267
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,770
came! (Higashiya) Anyone have any questions?

268
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,460
(Miya) Yes! Yes, yes yes...

269
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,670
OK? Yes Yes Yes Yes!

270
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,690
So let's start with me.

271
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:19,060
Yes, do you two have a lover?

272
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,920
(Everyone) Who!

273
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,280
No! No, no! Because it's going to be sexually harassment.

274
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,650
(Miya) Yes, is that not possible?

275
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,840
It's a squeal!

276
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,370
Please tell me what type you like!

277
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,060
(Everyone) Who!

278
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,420
No good! Ah, I was surprised! The manager was surprised.

279
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,610
Because it's Reiwa.

280
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,300
Is Reiwa bad? No!

281
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,150
(Miya) Compliance!

282
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,010
But I might want to know a little about it too.

283
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,380
(Yamanaka) I want to know! (Miya) right? Right, right?

284
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,070
To avoid risks such as infidelity in the company

285
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,430
Is it okay to make public information about whether they are married or unmarried?

286
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,970
Oh! That's good!

287
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,160
It's a squeal!

288
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,210
Are you two married?

289
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,070
Or are you single?

290
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,090
《What should I do? What to do about this.

291
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,450
What should I do? 》

292
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,450
《What should I do? What shall I do? Me? What should I answer? 》

293
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,600
Yes... Well...

294
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,960
I'm single. I'm married.

295
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Huh! Are you married?
