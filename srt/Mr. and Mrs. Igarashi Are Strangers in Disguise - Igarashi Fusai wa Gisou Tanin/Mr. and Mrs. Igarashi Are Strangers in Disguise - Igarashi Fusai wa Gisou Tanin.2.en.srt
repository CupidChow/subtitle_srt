1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,310
(Seto) To avoid risks such as infidelity in the company

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,300
It would be fine to disclose information about whether they are married or unmarried.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,530
(Miya) That's fine.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,730
(Miya) Are you two married?

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,250
Or are you single?

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,310
(Naoto) Ugh... (Mahiro) Umm...

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,510
I'm single. I'm married.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:28,510
Huh!

9
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,780
(Yamanaka) What kind of husband is he?

10
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,640
(Yamanaka) Appearance, work, etc.

11
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,660
No...it's just normal.

12
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,380
Aizawa-san, you don't have to be that humble.

13
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,270
Well, it looks like it's just above the middle.

14
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,470
I'm very healthy nerd and have few friends

15
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,010
I think Torie is only capable of working.

16
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,540
Ah, it's a business, so the outside is good and the mouth is good.

17
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,920
Even if it's a bit harsh to the person you married.

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,450
Because it's the person I married.

19
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,480
Ahh. Huh.

20
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,010
What about the Deputy Director? marriage.

21
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,540
Ah... that's it

22
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,240
I don't think I've ever met now.

23
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,280
Wow.

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,980
I'm enjoying myself now.

25
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,510
It's so comfortable to use your time freely.

26
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,720
Everything can be done efficiently and...

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,600
(Higashitani) It seems like someone who married the deputy chief is going to be a tough guy.

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,980
(laughter)

29
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,510
(Takebashi) No no... what about marriage?

30
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,690
Basically, it's difficult.

31
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,550
I understand that the manager is tough.

32
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,730
Men should remember. (Miu) Um!

33
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,260
Do you think that the Deputy Director is a good idea of ​​office romance?

34
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,980
Ah... I think it's fine as long as it doesn't interfere with your work.

35
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,690
Oh.

36
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,890
Where did Aizawa meet your husband?

37
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,590
Ah, no...

38
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,960
(Higashitani) Maybe it was an office romance?

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,670
Oh? no….

40
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,870
(Seto) Sorry, can I go home soon?

41
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,240
I have an online game match.

42
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,600
(Miya) At this time? That's right.

43
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,960
So it's about time... Everyone too, it's early tomorrow

44
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,320
Let's open it. What! Huh!

45
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,680
now…. That's a lie.

46
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Don't leave it behind...

47
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,110
That's why we should have had a proper meeting.

48
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,630
Because Mahiro refuses to come in and blocks

49
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,480
This is what happens. Is it someone's fault again?

50
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,010
Or rather, what is "single"?

51
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,030
I don't know if they want to be popular.

52
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,050
If you say you're married, you might as well be about the other person

53
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,570
You'll definitely be asked to dig deep into the roots.

54
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,760
You should just do something like that.

55
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,290
Me beer. (Unusual) Yes. Ah, you dodged it well.

56
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,320
What's "I wonder what it's on the inside?" Me with a highball.

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,190
Yes, yes. It's better than a complicated single person.

58
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,380
Thanks to you, I'm enjoying it to the fullest.

59
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,230
How would you like to do this forever?

60
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,090
Unlike someone else, I live a proper life.

61
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,620
What does it mean?

62
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,810
Those shoes

63
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,170
It's dirty and worn out.

64
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,860
Everyone wears well-maintained shoes.

65
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,380
Like Hayashi-san. Wow!

66
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,930
An old man stretching his nose at the feet of a young girl

67
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,620
It's really impossible though. Don't push vulgar ideas on you.

68
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,820
As a working adult... Which is vulgar?

69
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,340
You're not the top inside

70
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,200
Under the bottom. Huh? Why to you

71
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,060
I have to say that... Yes, below the bottom...

72
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,590
Yes, below the bottom, below the bottom...

73
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,960
(Sighs)

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,500
What are you angry about before you fight?

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Think about it.

76
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,080
(Sighs)

77
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,400
Myo-san, sorry I'm going home today.

78
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,760
Ah, a bit Mahiro-chan.

79
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,290
Mahiro-chan!

80
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,290
Changes! (Door opening and closing sound)

81
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,050
Isn't it just a way to chase at times like this?

82
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,050
I'm not expecting it.

83
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,930
Really...

84
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,820
What are you angry at?

85
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,190
"I got married after six months of dating

86
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,050
I had fun at first

87
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,410
It was supposed to be.

88
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,410
But...》

89
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,190
That's why I always tell people not to accumulate it.

90
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,910
Washing it all at once saves water.

91
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,910
He says that and leaves it alone all the time.

92
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
Let me do it at my own pace

93
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,360
{Something is slowly shifting...}

94
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,340
《Something gradually accumulates...》

95
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,370
Why aren't you taking out the trash?

96
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,560
sorry….

97
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,920
Makoto

98
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,630
I thought I was even more solid.

99
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:24,020
Being solid is

100
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,540
Nervous and impatient

101
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,080
I can't help but point out the other person's mistakes

102
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,450
Are you talking about someone like you?

103
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:38,490
I'm trying to ease the burden on each other a little more...

104
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,510
It's not softened!

105
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,200
I can't rest at all!

106
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,930
I am...

107
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,970
Even if the garbage accumulates for about a day or the kitchen gets dirty

108
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,520
I can laugh and say thank you for your hard work

109
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,880
I want to be such a couple...

110
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,880
(Sighs)

111
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:16,650
"I don't know what that is..."

112
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,360
"In the end I ran away."

113
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,450
What, dad?

114
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,480
And why a video call?

115
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,680
Yes... it's completely different.

116
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Is this one?

117
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,760
father? (Yukito) What if it's so good, Mahiro!

118
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,950
fine?

119
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,640
Yes, I'm going to have coffee now.

120
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,680
Oh, this is the coffee this time! Panama's Gaisha!

121
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,050
It's the perfect balance between sweetness and sourness, isn't it?

122
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,410
Enjoy it slowly.

123
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,450
Aii Aaaah, what about Naoto?

124
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:37,450
Ah... I wonder if he's back yet.

125
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,220
Yes, the work is tough.

126
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,240
With that body... both of you should be careful.

127
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,120
Yes, dad should eat properly too.

128
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,140
Don't slacking off on your own.

129
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,020
Hahaha... It's okay, it's okay, get along well with Naoto. Right!

130
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,720
Bye Bye. Well then, see you next time.

131
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,580
Yes, yes... Yes I'll cut it.

132
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,580
(The sound of a call being cut off)

133
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,310
I can't say it after all...

134
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,570
(Daichi) Could it be that he could have got a man? It has nothing to do with you guys.

135
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,590
(Kaito) It's not too bad, you should do it once!

136
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,620
So buy some shoes Louboutin.

137
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,650
You're not that seriously. Such a greedy woman

138
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,670
Tatsumon is also excited! It's true!

139
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,670
This guy has that kind of thing. Hayashi-san?

140
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,940
What... Deputy Director Igarashi! What? What happened?

141
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,460
Ah... for a little shopping.

142
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,990
Huh, is it near your house?

143
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,690
Ah, in that apartment.

144
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,690
What... What? Was that really stylish?

145
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,450
That's great, I'm home too, near here.

146
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,450
Ah, that's right. yes.

147
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,680
That's it.

148
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,580
Oh... Did you pull?

149
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,430
You were pulling it, right? No, it's okay to be pulled

150
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,280
Don't tell people at work!

151
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,510
I won't say it. It's not something you bother to say to others.

152
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,870
And... Right.

153
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,250
There are secrets that no one can tell anyone.

154
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,120
Not letting it go outside

155
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,480
That means you have a sense of your identity as a working adult.

156
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,480
You're usually doing quite a bit of effort.

157
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,410
thank you….

158
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,410
So it's late at night, so be careful.

159
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,980
Not only is the specs, but the inside is perfect too.

160
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,280
Hey, a man? Isn't it your man? Who is he? Seriously.

161
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,470
male….

162
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,470
It's okay.

163
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,510
I'm usually trying quite a bit...

164
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,840
I have to do it properly...

165
00:12:22,840 --> 00:13:10,310
～

166
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,180
《I have to do it properly》

167
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,220
(Miu) Deputy Director!

168
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,250
good morning. Ah good morning.

169
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,120
Thank you for yesterday.

170
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
What? Was there something?

171
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
Deputy Director: That's so kind.

172
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,200
Aizawa-san! Good morning. It's difficult.

173
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,900
I received a call from Tagawa Kobo... picture?

174
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,770
When I checked the delivery date, they told me it would be next month...

175
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,970
See, I'm definitely ordering this month.

176
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,670
However, there are a lot of emergency orders from other companies there.

177
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,530
I should have put in a confirmation phone.

178
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,560
Sorry, my mistake.

179
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,080
Seto-kun you met the president here, right?

180
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,110
yes.

181
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,970
game! ?

182
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,830
I'm currently working though.

183
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,530
President Tagawa has done some work.

184
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,560
So, can you connect it? Call the CEO right away.

185
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,260
We met in the lobby in 30 minutes. 30 minutes?

186
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,960
Yes I'm buying some sweets at department stores. It takes 20 minutes each way though.

187
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Fukusunaya's Castella is only there.

188
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,930
(Tagawa) Anyway, it's not possible this month.

189
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:51,310
We are very sorry for not reconfirming the phone.

190
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,190
However, we will confirm the delivery date by email...

191
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,190
(Sighs)

192
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,090
Umm...

193
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,010
(Seto) President!

194
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,200
Then I'll give up this time.

195
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,070
Huh? Instead

196
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,260
Be your friend.

197
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,620
What!

198
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,820
I have a Super Metal Coin from Krobull.

199
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,510
Will you replace it?

200
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,530
Seriously? Seriously.

201
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,390
Oh... I'll brag about it to my son.

202
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,250
Hahaha... But this game

203
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,950
Don't you think the graphics are not good?

204
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,820
No, if you talk about quality on such a tiny screen

205
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,510
Poor thing.

206
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,540
Because even small things can be found at Tagawa Kobo

207
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,560
You're not slacking off, right?

208
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,920
Oh no...

209
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,920
That's why we rely on you.

210
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:04,830
Well, it was a shame that I didn't check the email.

211
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,940
I understand, I'll do it this month.

212
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,510
thank you.

213
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,380
Hey, please replace it properly instead.

214
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,240
Of course. which one?

215
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,450
(Seto) What? Is it a coin? Well, this and this.

216
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,640
And this?

217
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,660
It really helped.

218
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,870
It was the place I was going to ruin.

219
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,580
Why did you just shut up?

220
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,580
Ah.

221
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,160
Sigh.

222
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,050
I've always thought I'd be bad at it, but I can't believe it's this far.

223
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,080
I was surprised myself too.

224
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,440
What is the cause and why?

225
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,810
what?

226
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:08,350
If I know that, I might be able to solve it.

227
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:13,570
No, leave the cause aside

228
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:17,270
It's pointless to talk to you anymore

229
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,970
I thought I had been given up.

230
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,170
Maybe it was tough.

231
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,560
Isn't there a lot of sighs too?

232
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,750
I'll breathe

233
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,750
There is also a pattern where they are politely searching for the next word.

234
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,870
Is Seto-kun the person who's been in his 10th life?

235
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,580
What is it? that.

236
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Anyway, thank you so much.

237
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,780
thank you.

238
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,310
So I'll go back to the company and report it.

239
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,510
I'm fine with a straight home today.

240
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,840
Pain.

241
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,570
Sandals?

242
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,510
It's perfect.

243
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,890
Plan A is compared to Plan B.

244
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,610
Because it uses both wood and reinforced steel

245
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,510
I think it will save 10% in terms of finance and shorten construction periods.

246
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,510
First, raise your hand if you think Plan A is good.

247
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,410
So if you think Plan B is good then raise your hand.

248
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,850
Now, this time we will proceed by adopting Plan A.

249
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,730
thank you. (applause)

250
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,730
This is definitely... It was plan B.

251
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,790
That's right!

252
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,970
Okay! Let's do our best and clean up.

253
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,970
It hurts...

254
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,090
Aizawa-san.

255
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,620
If you like it

256
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,650
Would you like to date me?

257
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,650
picture?

258
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,570
Okay.

259
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,600
Are they sandals?

260
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,470
Ah, this is for internal use

261
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,470
I haven't worn it yet so it's new.

262
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Those legs...

263
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,730
It's really big.

264
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,980
That's right...

265
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,530
Ah, but I'm really happy about it.

266
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,530
thank you.

267
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,830
What is the size of those feet?

268
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:41,370
Ah... it's 23cm.

269
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:45,370
People with small hands have small legs too.

270
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:54,340
People with larger hands have larger legs too.

271
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,880
Ah... That's right.

272
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,260
You've said something obvious right now, right?

273
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,260
Yeah…

274
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,140
(Vibrator sound)

275
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,940
(Vibrator sound)

276
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,430
{Now that's right...}

277
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,690
{Now that's right...}

278
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,890
《I might be able to talk》

279
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,890
《I might be able to talk》

280
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:48,320
"Calm down your own feelings"

281
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,320
Calm down and feel real

282
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,790
Deputy Director Igarashi!

283
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,830
Hayashi-san... what's wrong?

284
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,700
～

285
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:46,900
～
