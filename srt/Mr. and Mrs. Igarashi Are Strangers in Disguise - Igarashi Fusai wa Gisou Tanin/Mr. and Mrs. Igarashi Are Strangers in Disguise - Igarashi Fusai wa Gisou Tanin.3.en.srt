1
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,850
{Naoto: The true feelings I might be able to talk about...

2
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,560
(Miu) Deputy Director Igarashi!

3
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,080
Hayashi-san? what happened?

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,100
(Miu) I'm being chased by a stalker.

5
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,120
What a stalker? What, where?

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,120
Don't look! Please pretend to be your lover like this.

7
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,670
That's what it is here.

8
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,050
Is it okay? At the Deputy Director's house.

9
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,050
Oh ...

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,960
Second-level manager?

11
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:30,470
(Mahiro) Even though he has sandals, it's easy to run in!

12
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:40,970
Why always

13
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,970
Just run away...

14
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,870
It's late at night too

15
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,730
I can't stay at home.

16
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,420
So, can you let me stay here until I settle?

17
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,120
(Mystical) Oh! No way!

18
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,660
What a stalker... what a stalker? police!

19
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,680
Isn't it better to go to the police?

20
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,890
Ah, but I don't think he's a bad person...

21
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,930
Are you an acquaintance? I mean, I'm an acquaintance...

22
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,120
Ah, fall in love at first sight!

23
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,980
I was loved at first sight! Like that.

24
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,520
Love at first sight. That's right, fall in love at first sight.

25
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,520
That's why I thought the police weren't overstated.

26
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,330
If he says he's fine, that's fine.

27
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,530
Don't worry at all anymore!

28
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,390
So, sorry, but I'll go home. Hmm?

29
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,750
It's bad if you keep them waiting because they have a contract.

30
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,620
I can't believe that... This is taxi fee.

31
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,140
Then, Myo-san, call me a car. (Mysterious) Yes.

32
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,520
Deputy Director Igarashi! Well then, please!

33
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,040
Yes while I'm waiting

34
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,910
Snack Byutifru's special eggplant miso soup.

35
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,100
Don't spill it.

36
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,790
Yes.

37
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,790
Come on, sit early!

38
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,600
"It was my first love at first sight in my life."

39
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Aizawa-san!

40
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,690
that….

41
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,740
Could you please come and join me again?

42
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,600
yes.

43
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,800
Yes!

44
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,670
{And my first time in my life

45
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:53,050
Jealousy, anxiety, jealousy...

46
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,590
Myo: What? It's been six months since we've only been dating, right?

47
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,960
It's not, it's been six months already.

48
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,490
What on earth are you panicking for?

49
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,690
(Door opening and closing sound)

50
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,550
Sorry, late.

51
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,250
I've been caught by the manager.

52
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,620
Oh ...

53
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,820
marry me!

54
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,840
Huh?

55
00:05:21,840 --> 00:06:03,840
～

56
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,450
As long as I talk properly...

57
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:48,720
"When I think about it, it's all that I fell in love with

58
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,740
Always from me

59
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,440
Ah Mahiro. Why not eat outside for the first time in a while on payday?

60
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,320
Ah, I was having dinner with a client that day.

61
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,350
That's right.

62
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,370
sorry!

63
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,560
Then I'll eat it! I'll enjoy having this

64
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,100
"I'm always worried about being with you..."

65
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,800
Enter this here to share your schedule.

66
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,990
Wow, convenient.

67
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,690
But can I do it as a bare slut?

68
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,410
If you know what each other's plans, you won't be able to pass by strange things, right?

69
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,410
Yes, I'll do my best.

70
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,330
Oh, come to think of it tomorrow

71
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,330
My high school friends will be coming over here so I'll go and see you.

72
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,970
Ah, I see. I have to include that kind of thing too.

73
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,670
sorry

74
00:07:51,670 --> 00:08:14,570
～

75
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:22,140
"Even so, we could make up if we met.

76
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,860
I thought the solution would be easy to find.

77
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,890
(Takebashi) Oops, come again. Yes, yes, yes...

78
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,910
I've waited.

79
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:44,910
～

80
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,600
Aizawa-san.

81
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,960
What is it?

82
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,960
That example...

83
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,590
When are the plans to collect the item?

84
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:10,290
Should it be collected?

85
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,820
We are under careful consideration.

86
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,190
What? Does that mean it's no longer necessary?

87
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,190
I will consider this and report it again.

88
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,940
Is this a plan B okay? (Takebashi) What? Then A.

89
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,860
Is it an aquarium? Yes Yes.

90
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,900
It seems that there are plans to add a cafe area due to the renewal.

91
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,430
From the perspective of creating a space

92
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,130
It was a request to make an interior design proposal.

93
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,320
Looks interesting.

94
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,180
I'll be quick but I'll say hello

95
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,210
I want you to go to the other party tomorrow.

96
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,730
Aizawa-san. yes.

97
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,930
Can you please with me? Huh?

98
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,960
Are you me?

99
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,530
No, it's a big deal, so the two of them will definitely have a hearing.

100
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,220
Hehe...

101
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,080
Take this as an opportunity to solve it.

102
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,120
Don't waste your senior's thoughts.

103
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,140
Yes Yes.

104
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,140
Thank you very much!

105
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,700
Secondary Secretary!

106
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,730
Could I accompany you in that case?

107
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,750
Huh?

108
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,120
I love dolphins, sea otters, and aquariums.

109
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,140
I think I can come up with a variety of ideas.

110
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,000
Ah, hmm... Oh, and that

111
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,900
I would like to work with the Deputy Director to study.

112
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:24,800
Aizawa-san could you give it to me this time?

113
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,500
Yes... That's right.

114
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,530
That motivation is amazing.

115
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,230
But this time

116
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,450
Aizawa-san needs knowledge of his career and food and drink.

117
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:45,840
I hope Hayashi will continue to do his best on the Hidaka Foods matter.

118
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,870
Thank you very much.

119
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,870
Yes, I'll do my best. Yeah.

120
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,830
Was it good?

121
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,360
What?

122
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,220
What's going on...

123
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:12,100
Please take a look at this document by tomorrow.

124
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,470
yes.

125
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,340
"When I think about it, I've always been looking for a solution."

126
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,700
copper? Childcare. It's dangerous, I can't sleep at all.

127
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,390
Well, my husband does a lot of stuff

128
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,910
It's somehow spinning though.

129
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,610
As expected of Kobayashi-kun, he's a sloppy man.

130
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,330
Well, if I had to hold my husband and three babies together, I was having a flapping throbbing

131
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:39,720
A feeling of family? It'll come out, isn't it?

132
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,620
I'm about to think about my kids.

133
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:53,180
I want to concentrate on my work right now so I can't say anything.

134
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,040
If you say that

135
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,060
Can't you ever make it?

136
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,950
I grew up in a single-parent family

137
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:10,950
I want to be a mother

138
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:37,230
"In the end, we couldn't solve anything..."

139
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,570
good morning.

140
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,570
Deputy Director Good morning.

141
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,160
Good luck today.

142
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,160
yes.

143
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,440
How about installing a bench designed to give you the sea?

144
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,140
They also put up several benches for two people for couples' visitors.

145
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,690
If you change the decorations according to the season, you can also change the atmosphere.

146
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,400
Ah, that's good. And the outdoor penguin area...

147
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,770
I'd like to deliberately try out a chic monochrome style.

148
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,120
That's good! yes.

149
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,830
You two are perfect.

150
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,830
What...

151
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,910
thank you very much. you're welcome.

152
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,770
thank you very much. that….

153
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,800
I'll be looking at the building for further study

154
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,330
Is that okay? Of course, you will pay the fee.

155
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,690
That's definitely worth it. Since you're already here, enjoy yourself.

156
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,550
thank you.

157
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:22,640
～

158
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,700
It's cute, isn't it? Mahiro's favorite jellyfish.

159
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Yeah.

160
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,830
Shall we go next?

161
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,670
Oh, it's a shark ahead.

162
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,670
This aquarium sells sharks so I'm looking forward to it.

163
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,860
{If you think about it

164
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,570
Maybe he's been spinning all the time.

165
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,420
Can you come and join me?

166
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,610
marry me!

167
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,630
Once you know what each other's plans, you won't be able to pass by strange things.

168
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,320
I'm going to think about kids soon

169
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:54,730
～

170
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,730
Harisenbon is usually so thin.

171
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,520
Hmm? Hmm.

172
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,210
It swells with threat.

173
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,400
Where is Harry. Oh there it was.

174
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,430
Harry! Shall we compete? Harry.

175
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,450
Harry! Hmm!

176
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:23,850
Hmm! Come on, come on, bulge!

177
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,710
Harry!

178
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:32,100
Come on! Inflatable Harry!

179
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,620
Mom! Hmm?

180
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,970
There are some weird people.

181
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,670
Don't point!

182
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,670
sorry. home.

183
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,970
Because it's not cool.

184
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,870
He finally laughed.

185
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,660
I have to try my best to make him happy.

186
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,890
It's rewarding, isn't it? Above all, it looks interesting.

187
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,760
I'm sorry to Hayashi-san.

188
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,450
Well, he's a hard worker

189
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,980
It's good to be motivated

190
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,700
I'm worried that I'll end up getting a flat tire because I'm too busy.

191
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,760
Hayashi is really concerned about him.

192
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,810
yes? It's normal.

193
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,170
I couldn't see that though.

194
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,870
What?

195
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,060
In front of the apartment.

196
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,940
The two were together, right?

197
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,970
Oh no. That's not the case.

198
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,970
It's fine, no matter what, it's my fault.

199
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,370
Why are you saying that?

200
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,810
Ah...

201
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,010
Ah already!

202
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,190
What is this?

203
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,240
sorry. This is me, Harry.

204
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,780
Harry?

205
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,300
no….

206
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,500
Just because it hits you, you intimidate me...

207
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,500
I don't want to hurt you.

208
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,920
That's right, isn't it?

209
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:17,080
Apparently Hayashi-san is being targeted by a stalker.

210
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,780
Huh?

211
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,320
He ran away near me so I saved him.

212
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:30,040
Take me to Myo's shop.

213
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
That's all.

214
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,290
That's right...

215
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,680
I wanted to visit Mahiro at the aquarium.

216
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:56,270
Mahiro is the only one I want to come with.

217
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
thank you.

218
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,510
It's not work this time

219
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,510
Let's come with you.

220
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,990
Oh Seto-kun.

221
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,860
(Seto) Thank you for your hard work. Ah, thank you for your hard work.

222
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,390
It's rare, working overtime.

223
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,910
Ah, that's right.

224
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:45,910
Jaan! Please do your best with overtime privileges.

225
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,400
It looks like it's okay.

226
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Hmm?

227
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,790
I'm tired. Yes, thank you for your hard work.

228
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
What are you doing, me?

229
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,870
It's here!

230
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,060
(Entrance chime)

231
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,780
yeah? Mahiro? Suddenly?

232
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,820
That's fine though. It's fine though.

233
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,190
Hayashi-san! ? Deputy Director! The stalker.

234
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,210
Please help me!

235
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,070
What...

236
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,070
wait a minute!

237
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,610
Let's eat one.

238
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,850
sorry. I thought it was a nuisance

239
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:34,210
It's really scary. please.

240
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,740
That's fine though...

241
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,930
Because I'll make tea

242
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,450
For now, contact your family when it's settled down.

243
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,640
Family is no good!

244
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,000
No, but it's just like this...

245
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I can't worry about it.

246
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,450
Just sit down for now.

247
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:22,870
～

248
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,740
I saw the shadow of a woman.

249
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,930
Did you say something?

250
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,780
home!

251
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,980
not at all.

252
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,980
To anything.
