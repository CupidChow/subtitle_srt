1
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,090
(Naoto) Hayashi-san After drinking this it's about time...

2
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,220
Hayashi-san.

3
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,400
Hayashi-san!

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,930
Hayashi-san.

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,930
What should I do about this...

6
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,160
(Miu) "Deputy Director Igarashi Thank you for yesterday.

7
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,010
I'll put the key in the mailbox.

8
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,890
The fact that we spent the night together is our own secret."

9
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,600
A strange child...

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,280
What?

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,970
Should I tell Mahiro this?

12
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,830
No, no, no, no, no.

13
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,830
It's been going well, but now I can't make a stir.

14
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:46,150
Oh, a bit... Stop dropping the necklace.

15
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,600
yeah?

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,600
This is...

17
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,190
Thank you for your hard work.

18
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,190
(Mahiro) Thank you for your hard work.

19
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,570
what? What about a call?

20
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
It's really good, and it suits you.

21
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,900
A bit... this is the company

22
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,670
(Miu) Ah, good morning. good morning.

23
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,020
Aizawa-san!

24
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,880
That necklace...

25
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,400
picture?

26
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,110
No, it's cute.

27
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,110
Yes... thank you.

28
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,900
I'll erase it.

29
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,470
(Yukito) Yes, this is the usual dominant coffee.

30
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,470
I'll enjoy having this.

31
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,250
Hmm... is this taste Brazilian?

32
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,620
(Yukito) Yes, sorry, Costa Rica.

33
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,500
This sourness and fruitiness... It's impossible, it's impossible, I don't know.

34
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,530
Anything is fine as long as it's tasty. That's what it is

35
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,380
In the future, you will become a great coffee shop...

36
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,240
(2 people) It won't be.

37
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,420
Yes, I understand.

38
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,950
Hey dad. yeah?

39
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:35,170
I've changed my job, right?

40
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,170
Ah, yes. why?

41
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,620
Hmm, what do you mean, it's like a step up in life.

42
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,680
Hmm, I see. No, Naoto-kun didn't say anything.

43
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,540
What? Are you in touch? Yeah.

44
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,730
Sometimes I send you an email about the latest news.

45
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,260
Isn't it because your dad lives alone?

46
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,780
He's a good guy.

47
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,640
That's right….

48
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,670
No, I'm glad that the two were close.

49
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,210
Dad, you're failing.

50
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,760
It's not the father's fault. It's that person who's the wrong person.

51
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,460
Well... But dad

52
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,660
Cheesecake doesn't make a mistake.

53
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,200
Wow, it looks delicious! I'll enjoy having this.

54
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Yeah!

55
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,580
(Received sound)

56
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,380
That's...

57
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,260
"It's not like getting something from work, so why not eat it?"

58
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,120
It's the place to invite you.

59
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,970
What is it now

60
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,160
"What do you want to get from work?"

61
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,360
Was he invited me to eat? Wow, it's a failure!

62
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,410
Ah, my idiot!

63
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,100
Mahiro?

64
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,620
Oh, what is it, mom?

65
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,620
yes.

66
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,540
Wow, there are still things like this.

67
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
What, Seto-kun?

68
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,390
Ah... just a little alternative.

69
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,150
Hokkaido Hokkaido Hokkaido!

70
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,010
Hokkaido ~ Oh!

71
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,900
～

72
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,750
congratulations! (Bell)

73
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,750
Okay!

74
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,660
congratulations. thank you.

75
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,360
(Seto) That's good, Hokkaido won.

76
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,720
It's better than tissues, isn't it? Yes.

77
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,740
Ah, that's fine, I'll give it to you.

78
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,740
picture? I did it.

79
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,010
yeah?

80
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,100
He's like Aizawa-san, he's an innocent adult.

81
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,140
Even Seto-kun is innocent to give a lucky draw.

82
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,140
Not particularly... I was bored.

83
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,560
So I guess that's over there. Ah yes, then.

84
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,860
good morning.

85
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,860
good morning.

86
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,100
Good morning Deputy Director!

87
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,950
That's what happened the other day... The other day?

88
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,160
I found a good shop near my office.

89
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,510
Would you like to go next time?

90
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,200
Let me feast as a thank you the other day.

91
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,570
If it's such a good restaurant, invite the members of the club and go together.

92
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,100
What... Ah, Manager.

93
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,640
(Takebashi) Huh? This is the event that happened last time.

94
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,500
In the way we had a meeting yesterday

95
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,520
Is that okay?

96
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,520
good morning. good morning.

97
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,940
yes.

98
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,470
picture? What is it? this.

99
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,490
Yes, a return.

100
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,370
Does chocolate mint taste like toothpaste?

101
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,370
It's no good to be averse to eating. Try it? Because life changes.

102
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,300
I'm jealous.

103
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,300
Yeah. (Received sound)

104
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,720
"I want to talk a little tonight."

105
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,920
(Mysterious) Yes, please. thank you.

106
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
thank you.

107
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,670
So let's talk...

108
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,590
Mahiro

109
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:49,470
Can you come back to us?

110
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,490
picture?

111
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,380
In fact, the mothers are moving to Tokyo so I wonder if they can stay at home.

112
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,230
I've been contacted.

113
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,450
Ah, ah, that's it...

114
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,310
Look, you're my parents classmates, right?

115
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,670
It's been 10 years since I've had a high school reunion.

116
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,670
I want to stay overnight and sightseeing.

117
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,270
Just one night is fine.

118
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,270
I wonder if they'll come to our house just like usual.

119
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
(Entrance chime)

120
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,680
I'll come in...

121
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,730
It's me.

122
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,410
You're still cleaned up as ever.

123
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,410
No, I'm almost back to sleep.

124
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,510
Now, shall we do it? Ah, yes...

125
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,070
Well, um...

126
00:12:26,110 --> 00:13:13,740
～

127
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,740
I'm already here. Eh, isn't it early?

128
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,490
Mahiro This.

129
00:13:20,490 --> 00:14:08,630
～

130
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,650
(Entrance chime)

131
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,450
(Two) are here!

132
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,350
(Sanae) Delicious!

133
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,880
It must have been so much harder.

134
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,750
Mostly Naoto. What I've made is

135
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,290
Just like inari sushi. Have you made it?

136
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,840
Ah... I made it in the kitchen there.

137
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,530
Ah, come on, eat vegetables with your mom.

138
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,550
ah….

139
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,580
Come to think of it, Naoto, did you change your job?

140
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,270
Ah... well.

141
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,300
Did you decide after consulting Mahiro properly?

142
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,840
Ah, well... hey.

143
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,550
Actually, we changed jobs to the same company.

144
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:04,940
(Masataka) Is that so? No, we're already close!

145
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,640
It's not worthy of us though. Right!

146
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,640
(Masataka) Don't get excited at the same workplace.

147
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,270
Are you okay? What?

148
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,790
(Masataka) It's the same at home or at work

149
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,320
It's choking up.

150
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,190
I don't think that's the case either.

151
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,190
If so, it's fine.

152
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,260
Being the same for 40 years from 2nd year junior high school

153
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,960
I think it's amazing though. Well.

154
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,840
Are you two always so close?

155
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,210
Ah, yes, it's because it's a relationship from junior high school students.

156
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,250
It feels like we know each other all together

157
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,120
I don't even feel like fighting. That's amazing.

158
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,820
Well, I just like it though.

159
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,670
Yeah.

160
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,040
We're both our first loves.

161
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,900
That's fine, I've heard it 100 times. Oh, so this is the 101st time.

162
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,470
Actually, my first love is a school teacher.

163
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,000
Ah... I'll assume I didn't ask.

164
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
please.

165
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,740
(The sound of the door opening)

166
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:47,290
Moms seem to have slept.

167
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,290
I see.

168
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,450
Thank you for your hard work. Seriously thank you.

169
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,180
I wish they were happy.

170
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:21,130
But it feels a bit guilty and it feels a bit cheating.

171
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,130
Even if I talk about separation now, I'm just worried.

172
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
That's right, but...

173
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
Maybe one day they'll end their separation.

174
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,120
Ah... I wonder what it would be like to be together for 40 years.

175
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,520
I can't imagine it. That's right.

176
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,220
But when my mothers were in the second year of junior high school

177
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,250
I don't think I'd imagined that.

178
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,290
I think so... What, you're the first love, right?

179
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,290
You might think you're going to marry this person.

180
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,720
I don't have the time to do that.

181
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,300
If it's your first love then it's even more.

182
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,580
I want this person to turn to you

183
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,580
I want to get to know her, I'm desperate to find something in front of me, wanting to be with her.

184
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,730
I'm an experienced person.

185
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,170
Let's go to sleep soon.

186
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,170
Yeah.

187
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,990
good night.

188
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,910
good night.

189
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:57,910
～

190
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,210
Ah this...

191
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,070
Ah that...

192
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,070
Can't you bring it?

193
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,970
Because you don't have to wear it.

194
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Yes I understand.

195
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,860
Ah, hope? I'd like to ask for a little while.

196
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,560
Aizawa-san, um...

197
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,600
Can I talk to you a little?

198
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Huh?

199
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,020
sexual harassment…. yes.

200
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,380
I'm the manager of the sales department at Shimura Construction.

201
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,240
I've been making a lot of comments like that all the time...

202
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,980
The worst... Let's tell Manager Takebashi and get him to deal with it immediately.

203
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,840
But I want to continue this project until the end!

204
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,580
But... Hayashi-san is planning to go to entertain tonight, right?

205
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,450
Isn't it even more dangerous if you drink alcohol?

206
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:41,450
That's right, that's scary...

207
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,090
I understand I'll go too.

208
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,860
It would be impossible to sexually harass them if they had two of them.

209
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,720
What? Is it true? Yeah.

210
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,720
thank you!

211
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,290
A little.

212
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,670
(Itaka) Even if you look like this, I...

213
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,910
Chan-chan... I've left Koshien!

214
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,430
Huh! Wow! That's amazing.

215
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:27,290
The head of the (national) department was number 4.

216
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,510
Wow, amazing! If it's an athletic club, you're strong.

217
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,720
Now, one more drink. Oh, a bit...

218
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,920
Please come, Manager! I'm going, I'm going...

219
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,110
Right! Hayashi-san, aren't you making me drink too much?

220
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,820
If you destroy it, you won't be able to sexually harass them.

221
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,510
Oh, Kunitachi is also welcome. Huh?

222
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,370
I'm going. (National) I put a lot in...

223
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,370
(Miu) I put it in too much!

224
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,780
Manager Itaka: Are you okay? It's okay, it's okay...

225
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,480
I called a taxi to the street over there. Ah, understand, thank you.

226
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,340
Okay, I'll cross. Ah, be careful.

227
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,040
Aizawa-san, Itaka-san, can I ask you? Yes, okay.

228
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,230
So please. Thank you for your hard work.

229
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,420
Manager again. Well then.

230
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,610
I'm going... Yes, let's go...

231
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,800
OK? a little bit….

232
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,340
Oh, just a moment... Manager Itaka, are you okay?

233
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,710
Can I walk? It's okay... I'm going I'm going.

234
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,890
I'm going.

235
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:34,890
(Shutter sound)

236
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,230
Erase is complete.
