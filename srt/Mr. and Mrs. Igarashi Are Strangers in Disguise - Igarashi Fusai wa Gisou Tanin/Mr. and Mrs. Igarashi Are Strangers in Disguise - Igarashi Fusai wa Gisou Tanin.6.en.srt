1
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,450
(Naoto) Is there an Italian restaurant in the heck?

2
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,500
There's also tempura.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,880
It's the type that Mahiro likes to fry at the counter.

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,580
(Fax reception sound)

5
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,580
Yes, is it a fax?

6
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,050
(Yamanaka) Good morning.

7
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,690
picture?

8
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,680
(Mahiro) Good morning.

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
(Miya) Good morning.

10
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,710
What is it? this.

11
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,460
It was a fax that was received by an unknown sender.

12
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,810
(Miu) Yes...

13
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,180
Who is this...?

14
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,910
Ah, come to think of it...

15
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,940
What?

16
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,970
This morning via Kunitachi

17
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:03,200
I received a message asking me to change my affairs to Mr. Aizawa.

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,220
But that's because I'm not

19
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,100
The other party decided that Aizawa-san was more reliable...

20
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,460
So it has nothing to do with this photo...

21
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,330
What am I talking about?

22
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,020
Sorry, I'm confused.

23
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,870
Please calm down.

24
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,870
I'm not trying to blame Hayashi.

25
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,680
That's because Director Itakabe was quite drunk.

26
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,880
This is when I sent it to a taxi.

27
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,270
I was calling a taxi on the road ahead.

28
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,130
Isn't that so? Hayashi-san.

29
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,170
picture? a….

30
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,030
Sorry I don't remember very well.

31
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,030
picture? (Miu) Sorry.

32
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,300
And anyway, the truth is unfounded.

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,300
This is impossible.

34
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
It doesn't matter whether it's true or not.

35
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,970
First, someone has malicious intentions

36
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,670
What they are trying to seize Aizawa.

37
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,540
and

38
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,540
Mr. Aizawa took action that could have led to misunderstanding.

39
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,630
That's the problem.

40
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,740
Anyway, get back to work.

41
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:54,310
Once we have decided on future measures, we'll have a discussion again.

42
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,310
(Miu) Yes.

43
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,120
(Seto) There was something I wanted to confirm in the report

44
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,490
Are you importing it?

45
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,050
Ah, yes, it's okay. I'll go back soon.

46
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,050
yes.

47
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,960
(Miya) There are rumors that Chief Itaka over there likes women.

48
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,150
(Higashitani) Nowadays, do you use a pillow to get work?

49
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,020
(Miya) There's none.

50
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,880
Just a moment for both of us! picture?

51
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,900
Ah!

52
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,260
fool! What are you doing now... Sorry, sorry, sorry!

53
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,260
I'll clean it up soon. I'll clean it up right away.

54
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,540
That's silly.

55
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,150
I'll just listen to it

56
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,150
Do you guys really believe in this?

57
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,250
It's not too funny as a drink topic.

58
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,670
When I saw Kaizawa, my usual

59
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,520
It's like I can't get a bit of a hit like this

60
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
You know, you know, normal.

61
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,770
Aizawa-san is different, if it's different, it's not.

62
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,770
I'd better say it chan.

63
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,400
I just went with the entertainment

64
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,430
Everything written there is a mess.

65
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:49,500
I simply sent the drunken Director Itaka to a taxi.

66
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,380
Trust me. please!

67
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,570
Oh um...

68
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,270
I'm not doubting anything.

69
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,790
That's right!

70
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,470
Oh, sorry, um

71
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,170
To be honest, I was a bit suspicious at first. My idiot!

72
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,030
(Higashitani) Really idiot! I mean, this is

73
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,060
It's a bad prank that can be seen no matter what the angle is.

74
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:19,450
(Yamanaka) I'm really annoyed. Definitely catch the culprit.

75
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,450
Tch: That's boring.

76
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,900
Seto.

77
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,440
Something's wrong? Working overtime until this time...

78
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,980
I've gathered the information I need to find the culprit.

79
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,830
picture?

80
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,830
Oh, I haven't applied for overtime.

81
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,940
Its reputation as a company is not bad either.

82
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,970
There are some strange rumors that are reliable about Itakabe himself.

83
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,840
It didn't come out.

84
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,380
Why did you do this?

85
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,380
I thought that the people above were just thinking about self-preservation anyway.

86
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,490
Aizawa-san was sexually harassed or threatened with a contract as a shield.

87
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,370
Did you think about that possibility?

88
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,390
it is….

89
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,090
We also provide careful interviews about this kind of situation.

90
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,090
I guess it's not my boss's job.

91
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,850
We're doing what we need to do too.

92
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,850
It's something that has someone else, so here...

93
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,750
The person you are facing and discussing with is wrong.

94
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,020
Well, this is what I'm talking about.

95
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,020
Excuse me.

96
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,840
(National) Thank you for yesterday.

97
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,840
The manager was in a very good mood and said he had drank too much.

98
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,130
That's good. We were able to introduce you to some excellent seniors.

99
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,150
But is it okay?

100
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,010
I handed it over to Aizawa-san.

101
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,720
I don't think this alone suits my sense of conversation.

102
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,740
That's right.

103
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,590
That guy looks a bit old.

104
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,610
Eh, that's right.

105
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,980
I would like to work on the Kunitachi project.

106
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,180
The project will be launched next month... Yeah.

107
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,210
I'll definitely nominate Miu Pyon.

108
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,580
Eh, thank you!

109
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,960
I'll do my best.

110
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,680
a! Is it okay? I don't have to go back with my wife.

111
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,680
It's been changed until Miu Pyon is satisfied!

112
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,550
(Mysterious) You couldn't believe that was serious?

113
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,730
No, I haven't done it.

114
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,270
There's no way Mahiro would be such an old man!

115
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,470
So why didn't you say that on the spot?

116
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,010
That's...

117
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,720
There is also a position.

118
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,410
Maybe it's not what I know

119
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,410
I was wondering if Mahiro was giving someone a grudge.

120
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,030
I was thinking a little.

121
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:08,750
Perhaps he ran away from home due to the fact that Soybeans were the cause.

122
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,280
Are you stupid! ? Idiot idiot! Idiot!

123
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,630
I know... I know.

124
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,830
That's not possible.

125
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,710
But Mahiro came out.

126
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,710
Yes, that's all abruptly.

127
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,780
I guess I didn't know anything about Mahiro.

128
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,850
I thought I knew everything...

129
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,930
I was getting anxious.

130
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,710
No one knows 100% of the other person.

131
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,710
I'm not a psychic.

132
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,320
Still, facing the person in front of me now

133
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Isn't it a couple who try to understand?

134
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,070
It's creepy, me.

135
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,870
Good morning. good morning.

136
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,580
That's kind of red today.

137
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,600
Is that a new way to praise?

138
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,800
Just my impression.

139
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Anyway, please come on this.

140
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,580
Ah this. It was a 20% discount.

141
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,580
I was on TV yesterday and was curious.

142
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,680
Thank you Seto-kun.

143
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,380
No, even if you say that in pudding.

144
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,230
This too

145
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,230
Thank you so much for yesterday.

146
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,170
Not particularly...

147
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,050
I just hate that kind of atmosphere.

148
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,590
But this guy, when Aizawa was called out to the Deputy Director

149
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,110
He looked extremely worried.

150
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,310
I went to the conference room and even listened.

151
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,000
No, it's not serious. No, it's not serious.

152
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,530
That happened to be...

153
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,900
I was thinking of checking the one in the report...

154
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,900
Thank you.

155
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,870
(Souma) Mama!

156
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,230
picture?

157
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:50,430
Not mom! Where is Mom?

158
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,300
Ah... uh... mom. Where is Mom? Where is Mom?

159
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,490
Mom! Mom.

160
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,030
Let's sit down. It's so good!

161
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:03,060
Mom you said you should wait here, right?

162
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,080
Yeah.

163
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,110
It's okay, I'll come back soon.

164
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,810
Oh, right? Shall I drink some juice and wait?

165
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,180
They sell delicious orange juice over there.

166
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,700
Yeah! Nice!

167
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:26,280
(Risa) Souma Souma Souma!

168
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,130
(Risa) Ah, sorry.

169
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,830
Didn't you see that boy about five years old?

170
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,690
Ah, no... Are you lost?

171
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,540
I told you to wait here

172
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,570
It's gone.

173
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,780
Someone saw him walking with a tall woman wearing a red sweater.

174
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,780
A red sweater?

175
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,920
I think I'll come back soon.

176
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,110
picture?

177
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,340
I think he's also buying some juice to comfort him.

178
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,370
I can't believe it's kidnapping...

179
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,740
The kidnapping is...

180
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,450
If I were the person I think, that would never be the case.

181
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,820
He's like a mass of justice

182
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:25,820
He's such a good person who can't leave someone in trouble alone if he sees someone who's in trouble.

183
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,270
Mom!

184
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,130
Ah, Ouma!

185
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,130
Where were you going!

186
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,810
thank you very much. bye bye!

187
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,810
bye bye! bye bye!

188
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:09,750
I wanted to hear that it was definitely not there.

189
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,010
sorry!

190
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,320
There's no way Mahiro would have an affair.

191
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,040
But for a moment, I heard "Maybe"

192
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,570
I couldn't say anything.

193
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,750
That's why...

194
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:42,640
There's none, I know.

195
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,640
But I no longer understand such simple things...

196
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,780
I feel pathetic myself.

197
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,160
I wonder why I don't know about Mahiro.

198
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:07,730
So as a boss

199
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:13,290
You have to avoid risks to the company

200
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,290
I created an escape route.

201
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,380
It's not cool.

202
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:37,690
But I'm so annoyed when I see Seto protecting Mahiro.

203
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,900
I had to do it.

204
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,450
I wanted to do it.

205
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,650
I want to protect Mahiro.

206
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,650
Because they're married.

207
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,280
It was quite shocking.

208
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,540
That's right.

209
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,240
It made me worried.

210
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
I'm really sorry.

211
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,510
Sorry Mahiro.

212
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,790
It's late.

213
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,870
sorry.

214
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:50,760
Mahiro hadn't changed.

215
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,760
Me...

216
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Really, it's not cool.

217
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:28,230
Naoto has always been uncool.

218
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,850
Hehehe.

219
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,500
Wow...

220
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,360
I was nervous.

221
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,210
Ahaha.

222
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,210
fool.

223
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,130
Oh and actually

224
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:05,170
I'll give Kunitachi a greeting about the change in charge.

225
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,530
I met you. ah.

226
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,900
If something strange happens to the other side too

227
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,120
I was thinking about correcting it.

228
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,330
I see.

229
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,020
thank you.

230
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:28,400
Ah, no...

231
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,920
Mahiro We are...

232
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Oh no, me...

233
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:44,230
I want to face Mahiro again.

234
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,230
Little by little...

235
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Yeah.

236
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,680
Damn it! (Hope) What?

237
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,370
Take a picture from a better angle.

238
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,230
Ah, that's it.

239
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,270
This means you can't make an excuse like "I just took care of you."

240
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,620
No, it's actually the case, so it's not surprising.

241
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,980
Still, I did my best.

242
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,510
Tw... They're all too useless.

243
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,040
This is no good at doing it now.

244
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,230
That's cute...

245
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,090
If that's the case, wouldn't your high-spec boss turn around?

246
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,120
Because it has nothing to do with you.

247
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,340
Hey, I'm also the president's son, so it's a high-spec?

248
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,360
Maybe it's for me?

249
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,220
All you have is money.

250
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,410
That's amazing.

251
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,450
Hey, stop it. I'm going home already.

252
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,450
That's boring...

253
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,690
Come to think of it, when I took a photo

254
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,220
I thought I'd seen that person somewhere before.

255
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,750
That's a common face. No, it's not.

256
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,620
That person often comes to my father's company for sales.

257
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,810
Isn't it a lie?

258
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,000
I thought she'd come with a really beautiful and stylish person

259
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,020
I remember.

260
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,220
But then I got married and changed my name.

261
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,080
He said, "Igarashi"

262
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,100
I was so slurped.

263
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,290
Igarashi?

264
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:36,290
I think he said he married someone from the same company...

265
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,230
I'm smiting it...
