1
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,290
(Mahiro) What was the story of the manager today? About a competition?

2
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,160
(Naoto) Ah, no.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,850
Let's speed up a little.

4
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:34,770
That's exactly right. First of all, you have to pass the company competition.

5
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,300
Yeah….

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,670
Takebashi: As the branch chief for Igarashi

7
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,360
I want you to be assigned to Singapore.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,740
As early as three months.

9
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,280
Will you think about it?

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,280
I'll wait for a reply until next month.

11
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,700
got it.

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,700
(Takebashi) Yes, please. yes

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,620
Good luck. Mahiro.

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,810
yeah?

15
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,520
Is work fun?

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,880
I've been busy lately...

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,100
Hmm, I changed jobs with great energy

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,460
It's so much fun right now.

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,460
Well, I've always been interested in interior decoration and it's very rewarding.

20
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,910
Oh!

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,440
When I stayed the other day

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,970
Naoto: You weren't sleeping at all, did you?

23
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,170
Ah, no...

24
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,700
It's been a while since I thought Mahiro was next to me

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,720
I can't sleep.

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,940
Conversely, I might have slept well.

27
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,960
yeah? yeah?

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,650
yeah? What is that? No, no, no, no.

29
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,650
Because I was relieved. What does it mean?

30
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,700
I brought the pudding you ordered.

31
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,700
(Yukito) You know. I really love that you're happy.

32
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,180
I decided to try again with Naoto.

33
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,720
Oh I see.

34
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,280
I want to do my best even if I leave my house and run away without my permission.

35
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,480
Yeah.

36
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,540
Come to think of it, did you hear from someone?

37
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,400
No, absolutely.

38
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,590
It's freedom

39
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,590
I don't feel bound by anything.

40
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,020
I mean selfish.

41
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,020
That's what I say.

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,110
That's me too.

43
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,110
Haha...

44
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,590
(Haruna) No way!

45
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,940
Have you grown that tall?

46
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,800
What...

47
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,820
There's preparation for the exhibition

48
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,190
I thought I'd returned to Japan for the first time in a while, but this is it.

49
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,050
this….

50
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,900
I'm falling so quickly

51
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,780
That person really wanted to meet me.

52
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,990
That's good, it doesn't look like your dad.

53
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,510
I gave birth to such a beautiful woman

54
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,510
Thank you very much.

55
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:38,800
I didn't look like you.

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,800
yes. Well then, fine.

57
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,760
As skilled as ever.

58
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,950
It's embarrassing to be seen so much.

59
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,950
Eh, really?

60
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,820
Plate.

61
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,070
I'll leave the plate here. Yeah.

62
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,950
Ah, pasta is different. A deeper one.

63
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,950
Ah, I see.

64
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,150
Hmm, it's tasty! Yeah.

65
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,340
This is this taste!

66
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,200
Ah, hey, this would taste even better if you pour this on cheese.

67
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Can I put it on?

68
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,110
Ah... Yes of course.

69
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,320
Let's do the washing dishes.

70
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,180
Eh, you're still at work, aren't you? I'll do it.

71
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,370
Yes. It's a hassle to store it in.

72
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,230
Ah, what if you take a bath?

73
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,080
Ah, then, first...

74
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,950
Yeah. Take out the laundry.

75
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,640
I'll do the laundry.

76
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,820
Are you okay.

77
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:45,730
This time I want to do it properly.

78
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,730
thank you.

79
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,840
Family with children

80
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,870
We want to create an environment where you can enjoy it with peace of mind.

81
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,400
We hope you will let us know your opinions.

82
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,430
(Miu/Higashitani) Thank you very much.

83
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,800
(Masako) My older child really loves to travel

84
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,650
I have an 8 month old baby below me.

85
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,360
Oh, then it would be more convenient to have a daycare center.

86
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,060
(Kana) I'm sure I'll live a life that suits my children now.

87
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,250
It's gone. (Yusuke) Me too.

88
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,770
I'm secondary to my hobbies now.

89
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,770
That's right. That's right.

90
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,200
It's been two minutes. (Masako) Two minutes have passed?

91
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,390
Nose is sticking out Nose is sticking out.

92
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,080
wait a minute. It's been two minutes!

93
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,100
Wait a little while, not long.

94
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Mom I want to talk a little more with my sister.

95
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,190
Everyone holds on what they want to do

96
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:53,190
I'm trying hard to sacrifice a lot of things for my children.

97
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,450
It's very different from my mother.

98
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,710
I see.

99
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,580
I won't do that.

100
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,580
it's okay.

101
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,470
Huh?

102
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,670
It's okay because I'm the same.

103
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,450
thank you.

104
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,450
Yeah.

105
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,500
(Miu) Chocolate mint drink?

106
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,360
It suits you.

107
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,240
(Seto) I thought so at first, but after drinking it I got hooked.

108
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,630
Isn't it just a maiden to be dyed in the color of someone you like?

109
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,630
(Vibrator sound)

110
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,360
Ah, is this? It's a matchmaking app.

111
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,540
No, I haven't heard of it though.

112
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,400
Only high-spec men can register

113
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,770
I thought there was a high competitive rate...

114
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,470
113 messages! ?

115
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,470
Anyway, I caught 100 people. Maybe it's okay.

116
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,210
What is it?

117
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,750
no. I'm jealous of all sorts.

118
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,460
I think Seto may not be able to register.

119
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,460
That's right. Don't miss it.

120
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,580
Huh? Me...?

121
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,280
I want to leave the project leader of the competition to Mr. Aizawa.

122
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,470
I will do my best.

123
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,660
good.

124
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,530
I think I'm busy with sales, but please take care of me.

125
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,060
yes.

126
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,260
in….

127
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,960
Did you start living together again?

128
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,340
Ah, um... I'm really sorry for the inconvenience.

129
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,530
No no, I'm relieved.

130
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,910
But it's even more bothering me.

131
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,110
Huh? Even though overseas assignment was a dream

132
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,140
That's the timing.

133
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,860
Are you assigned to an overseas office?

134
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,720
yeah?

135
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,590
yeah? Haven't you talked about it yet?

136
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,780
No, um...

137
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,980
Ahh!

138
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,500
There was an important promise.

139
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,200
An important promise?

140
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,230
meeting. meeting?

141
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,920
I have to go. Should I go?

142
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,920
sorry! I'm really sorry, sorry, sorry.

143
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm working overseas...

144
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,240
Yes, I'm going back now. What about Mahiro?

145
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,120
Ah, it's a holiday tomorrow...

146
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,170
I want to prepare for my move so I think I'll stay overnight today.

147
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,860
Understood.

148
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,560
Hey, Naoto.

149
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
yeah? what?

150
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,470
Ah... uh.

151
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,500
I'll go home tomorrow.

152
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,380
Ah, see you tomorrow.

153
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,410
Yeah.

154
00:12:46,410 --> 00:13:12,410
～

155
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,580
Right! what happened? that.

156
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,940
yeah? Ah.

157
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,150
What? It's a Milan brand.

158
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,170
Milan style pajamas.

159
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:31,200
Hmm.

160
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,080
Daddy, when he said he wanted to go abroad

161
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,270
What answered?

162
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,980
Huh?

163
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,980
Ah.

164
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,090
Dad got mad.

165
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,130
"What are you talking about selfishly, don't even think about Mahiro?

166
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:03,180
What do you think of your family?"

167
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,880
I see. Yeah.

168
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,880
I should have discussed it properly.

169
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,110
We can't give up on each other.

170
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,190
Hey, a paper bag in my pajamas...

171
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,710
This is this. Didn't you have a sketchbook?

172
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,730
(Yukito) Just knock it.

173
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,600
Oh, did you come? There was.

174
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,450
I don't have to put it in places like this as an important work tool.

175
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,330
It would be fine if there was. Grazzie.

176
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:39,700
Ah, you. you.

177
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,230
You're a little too plain?

178
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,100
His style is good, so it's a waste.

179
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Chao!

180
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
wait a minute!

181
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,870
Hmm, not bad, yes.

182
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,870
I'm not going to lose to the macchiato that I drink in Milan, though.

183
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,020
I'm currently working for an interior decoration company.

184
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,550
yes.

185
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,740
My husband is at the same company.

186
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
Hmm.

187
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,150
You're not interested, right?

188
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,340
More than about children

189
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:49,730
Because my job is more important.

190
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,430
That's right.

191
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:57,150
Back then, there was no other option.

192
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:01,860
Some people choose to live for their family once they get married.

193
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,920
But I... ummm, I didn't want to abandon myself.

194
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,960
I don't regret it.

195
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,160
That's why that's how it is...

196
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,050
Isn't there any guilt or anything like that?

197
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,240
To ignore your own thoughts

198
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,110
Isn't it a sin?

199
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:33,510
Don't justify your selfish self for abandoning your family.

200
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,550
That's right, I'm the one who's the wrong one. Yes.

201
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:43,280
But for my family, huh...

202
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I wonder if I'll live by killing myself?

203
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,770
Let's walk. Icchi, Icchi.

204
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,480
Do you want to jump? Se-no-pion is expensive.

205
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,500
Se-no-pion.

206
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,880
Like Ah one more time. I'm not a god.

207
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,880
That's fun.

208
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:26,370
Become a married couple with Naoto and build a happy family

209
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:33,940
I wanted to be confident that I was okay

210
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,940
Are you okay.

211
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,930
very sorry.

212
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,130
Please decline this time.

213
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,130
I see.

214
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,010
So, excuse me.

215
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,390
Igarashi.

216
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,150
Is it really okay?

217
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,340
What...

218
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,050
You've always said you wanted to work abroad, right?

219
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:23,050
So you came to one of our companies that have overseas expansion, right?

220
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:32,870
I want to be with my wife now.

221
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,870
It has to be there.

222
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:45,260
Wait a week until the deadline.

223
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
Don't regret it.

224
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,970
(Seto) I stood up and listened.

225
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,370
Aizawa-san, do you know this?

226
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,390
It has nothing to do with you.

227
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,250
I've been involved in a lot of stuff with this too.

228
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,790
There's no need to confuse Mahiro.

229
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:20,180
Ahh... The deputy director isn't suited to marriage, is it?

230
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,710
what?

231
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,260
Can you say that you are a couple without being able to talk about such important things?

232
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,260
For you! it doesn't matter.

233
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,380
Just because it seems like it will fit into the original Saya, I will get through it without causing any trouble.

234
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:46,380
Hmm, it's a beautiful cover-up craft.

235
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:57,720
If it hurts Aizawa-san any more

236
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,120
I put my hands on it.

237
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,090
Ah, welcome back.

238
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,690
I'm home.

239
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,670
Actually... Yeah.

240
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,670
Manager Takebashi asked about an appointment, and I was told...

241
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,950
I wish they had consulted me earlier.

242
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,140
Huh?

243
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,990
A story about being assigned to overseas.

244
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,690
What, why?

245
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,720
I heard it, accidentally.

246
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:32,460
Ah, what is it...

247
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,160
I'm Naoto... I refused.

248
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Huh?

249
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,230
I want to be with Mahiro.

250
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,230
So don't worry, it's okay.

251
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,350
What are you talking about?

252
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:58,560
Huh? Did you decide on your own?

253
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,250
Oh no, I don't want to cause unnecessary worries.

254
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,610
Extra? What's unnecessary?

255
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,810
Is it the problem for the two of you in the future? There are many options.

256
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,680
No, that's why we're couples

257
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,050
I thought we should be together.

258
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:19,930
It's no point if you can't even talk about such an important thing.

259
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,790
I was thinking about the two of them...

260
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:25,490
What is that? So Naoto is

261
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,030
Hold on what you want to do for the sake of the two of you and hide your true feelings

262
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,210
Do you match everything to the other person?

263
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,750
Why is that what's going to be about? Because!

264
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:43,750
That's not going to be me.

265
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,790
Is that about Mahiro?

266
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:15,570
Can't Mahiro be herself when she's with me?

267
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,220
So you worked so hard?

268
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,770
sorry.

269
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,770
Wait a minute, Mahiro.

270
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,760
Aizawa-san?

271
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,650
Seto-kun...

272
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,710
what happened? It's a huge coincidence.

273
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,830
why….

274
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,830
Yeah….

275
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:37,250
Would you like to do it for me now?
