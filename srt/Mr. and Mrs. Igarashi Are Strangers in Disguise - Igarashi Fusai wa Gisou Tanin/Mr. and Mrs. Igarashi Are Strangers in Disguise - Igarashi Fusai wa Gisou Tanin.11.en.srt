1
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,090
(Seto) I envy you too.

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:15,620
(Miu) What? When you realize your feelings

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,420
It was too late.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,770
What is that a virgin?

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,770
(Coughing voice)

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,570
Ah, it's the kind of person that's like, "This is the first time I've really fallen in love with you."

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,270
Wow, that's troublesome.

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,130
(Mahiro) Good morning.

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,980
good morning.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,000
Are you feeling unwell?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,040
It's just a hangover.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,910
It's rare. (Naoto) Miya

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,270
Where does the budget data come in?

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,460
(Miya) I'll share it via email immediately. Ah, please.

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,460
Also...

16
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,390
(Sigh)

17
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,730
that….

18
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,090
Thank you for yesterday.

19
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,630
picture?

20
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,480
a…. yes.

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,840
Thank you so much.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,060
Was your mom okay yesterday?

23
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,440
It was a mess. ah….

24
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,140
but

25
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,860
I guess he finally listened to what I was saying...

26
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,400
I'm going to be put into a grandma facility.

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,760
I see...

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,760
So um...

29
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,690
thank you very much.

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
What are you laughing? (Mahiro's laughter)

31
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,540
(Vibrator sound)

32
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,540
hospital?

33
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,450
father….

34
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,190
Mahiro!

35
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,050
Naoto. What about your dad?

36
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:55,760
I'm sleeping on medicine now.

37
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,300
I have to wake up

38
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,990
I don't know what's going on in the future.

39
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,690
I see...

40
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,690
It would have been a danger if the transportation had been delayed even a little.

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,210
Aizawa-san.

42
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,060
His condition is calm

43
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,060
All your family members please go home.

44
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,370
I went to my parents' house and took my dad's belongings.

45
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,230
I'll go with you too.

46
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,940
Yes, it's okay. No, but...

47
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,940
I'll contact you when your dad wakes up.

48
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,850
Understood.

49
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,230
Naoto. yeah?

50
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Thank you for staying with me.

51
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,820
Haruna: Be fine.

52
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,700
Mom, why are you going?

53
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
I don't like it!

54
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,660
(Door opening and closing sound)

55
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:06,670
(Ringtone)

56
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,670
I can't answer the phone right now.

57
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,180
Naoto...

58
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,180
I was worried after all.

59
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,440
thank you.

60
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,460
Aizawa-san!

61
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Dad, you've woken up.

62
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,090
(Yukito) Oh, sorry for the early morning.

63
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,620
father….

64
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,830
Don't make me worried.

65
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,700
Sorry, sorry, Dad was surprised too.

66
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,720
What is the teacher? Yeah.

67
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,080
It doesn't seem to be a result of any aftereffects

68
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,620
I wonder if I'll be able to be discharged in about two weeks.

69
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,620
good….

70
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,040
I'm feeling sick anyway

71
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,730
Say it's because the customer is waiting

72
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,250
Did you force yourself to open the store, right?

73
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,440
sorry.

74
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,330
Brain hemorrhage is caused by high blood pressure.

75
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,360
I live a life covered in cheese, chocolate and butter

76
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,360
This is what happens... Mahiro.

77
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,140
A bit... I'm going shopping.

78
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,070
good….

79
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,540
Maybe you've been feeling unwell for a while?

80
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,260
I'm going to look cool in front of my daughter.

81
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,610
Hahaha...

82
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,330
But there's something like that too, isn't Mahiro?

83
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,510
picture?

84
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,870
It's not like he doesn't show his weaknesses

85
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,730
I'll be strong soon

86
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,280
I mean, I try to solve everything myself.

87
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,480
Well, what's the point I've been holding back?

88
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,500
Because it's family

89
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,220
I wish I could share the bad points too.

90
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,270
(Yukito) The story of how his mother left when he was 10 years old

91
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,800
You've heard of it before.

92
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,680
Suddenly, he said, "I have something I want to do overseas."

93
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,730
No, I run a store and I'm in the mood

94
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,250
Well, if you tell me not to be selfish

95
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,800
I left alone. Was that so...?

96
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,350
(Yukito) I wonder if he thinks he was abandoned by his mother, Mahiro is.

97
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,710
Maybe that's why

98
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,740
Even after my mother left

99
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,740
I've started working hard on my own.

100
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,330
Don't complain, do your house

101
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,200
I quit the club I liked.

102
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
I lied to me saying I'm tired of it.

103
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,450
But I think Naoto knows too.

104
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:59,500
Making sure you're not that dexterous.

105
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,370
That's how unimportant things are

106
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,060
I can say it loudly

107
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,440
When it comes to the important thing, I can't say anything.

108
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:17,000
And at one point, I guess I've reached my limit

109
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,540
I don't know if it exploded

110
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,920
I was crying loudly in my room.

111
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,650
That means I'll realize it sooner.

112
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,650
Hahaha...

113
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:47,520
(Vibrator sound)

114
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,870
yes.

115
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,560
(Haruna) Ah, Mahiro?

116
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,930
After 20 years, your voice changes.

117
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,960
Of course, I didn't know.

118
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,500
So? Yukito-san, did you fall?

119
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
What's going on? Feeling like you're going to die?

120
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,230
Because it didn't matter

121
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:17,780
I think I'll be discharged in about two weeks.

122
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,460
Oh well.

123
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,990
So it's not a big deal, isn't it?

124
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,530
Well... yes.

125
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,050
Well, that's fine.

126
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,750
Is that all the necessary matters?

127
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,640
That's all. OK, I understand.

128
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,000
Well then. (Check-off sound)

129
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,990
(Not pronunciation)

130
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,830
This is the underwear.

131
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,880
thank you. Yeah.

132
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,150
I don't think Mahiro would take care of me.

133
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,350
I'm already 29 though.

134
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,130
It's getting bigger.

135
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,830
Go to university and get a job

136
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,530
I'm getting married too

137
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,880
There's no need to worry

138
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,880
She's an excellent girl.

139
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:36,020
Um, dad.

140
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:41,020
I'm separated from Naoto.

141
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,310
That's what I thought.

142
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,330
What? Did you notice?

143
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,330
Dad, don't underestimate it.

144
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:02,120
in? What do you think you'll do now?

145
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,850
Yes... I want to be with you... I think.

146
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,740
That's right. There's some inclusion.

147
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,290
No, it's difficult to put into words.

148
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,290
I'm not good at it and express my intentions.

149
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Have you finally realized it?

150
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,700
Oh... Seto.

151
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,060
Working on a holiday is rare.

152
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,760
More than that, Kaizawa's father...

153
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,460
Wake up this morning

154
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,490
It's not important. I was worried.

155
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,360
good.

156
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Aizawa-san has been so many things all these days.

157
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,270
That's right.

158
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,350
(Sigh)

159
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,230
Is that a habit?

160
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,230
picture? Sigh.

161
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:35,720
Aizawa-san, did you know that you don't like sighing?

162
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,920
picture?

163
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,610
I said that before.

164
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,300
I can't talk to you

165
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
I feel like I've given up.

166
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,080
I can laugh and say thank you for your hard work

167
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,930
I want to be such a couple...

168
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,930
(Sigh)

169
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,360
Anyway, we only have a relationship based on the family register.

170
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,360
(Sigh)

171
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
(Sigh)

172
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,400
Mahiro...

173
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,930
together

174
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,930
Let's go home.

175
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,060
sorry.

176
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,060
I didn't know anything about Mahiro.

177
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,990
What about?

178
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,990
I... I used to sigh in front of Mahiro.

179
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:27,160
For me, I can't express what I want to say or what I want to say

180
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
I'm angry...

181
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,220
sorry.

182
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,320
It's not Naoto's fault.

183
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:58,810
My mother was sighing well.

184
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,860
If I say selfish

185
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,880
It's not that I'm angry

186
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Ahhh.

187
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,820
Something like rejection

188
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,820
I feel like I've given up...

189
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,430
Today

190
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:29,430
It's been a while since I spoke on the phone.

191
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,410
My voice and hands were shaking...

192
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:47,470
I thought it was okay

193
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:53,470
It seems he was still stuck.

194
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,960
For me, that person is

195
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,180
He's like a side-teacher.

196
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,890
Prioritize what you want to do and throw away your family...

197
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,890
I definitely don't want to be like that...

198
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,150
But...

199
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,150
It's scary too.

200
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,750
Someday I too

201
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,750
I wonder if that's what happens...

202
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,600
So I became a married couple with Naoto

203
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,490
Building a happy family

204
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:02,050
I'm okay

205
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,050
I wanted to be confident.

206
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:20,560
But... forever

207
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,560
I don't have confidence...

208
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,070
Mahiro

209
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,790
Let's show each other more.

210
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:48,790
It's all uncool, perhaps, the things that got messy.

211
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,280
Is that what a family?

212
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,280
I think it means a couple.

213
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,430
I'm definitely not Mahiro says anything

214
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,430
Because he won't disappear from before Mahiro.

215
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,790
(cry)

216
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,940
I love you, Mahiro.

217
00:22:01,240 --> 00:23:07,570
～

218
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,260
good morning.

219
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,260
good morning.

220
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,870
Mahiro

221
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,870
Will you not come back?

222
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,120
I really want to be with Mahiro.

223
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,880
Yeah.

224
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
Seriously?

225
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,830
Thank you for your continued support.

226
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,830
Oh wow, I did it!

227
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,080
(Takebashi) Report? Yes, once more with my wife

228
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,270
We've come to talk about living together.

229
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,270
I see...

230
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:15,750
I feel sad at times like that

231
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,290
Yotsuya Bussan's business you were in charge of

232
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,290
It has been decided that it will be expanded to Asia.

233
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,550
So...

234
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,910
To Igarashi

235
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,910
I would like him to be assigned to Singapore as the branch manager.
