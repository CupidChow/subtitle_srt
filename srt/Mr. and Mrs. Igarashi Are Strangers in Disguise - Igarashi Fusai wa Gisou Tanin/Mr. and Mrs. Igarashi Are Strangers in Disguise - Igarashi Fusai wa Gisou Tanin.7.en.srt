1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,450
(Miu) Isn't it okay? Manager Takebashi.

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,150
(Takebashi) No... It's a bit no good, Hayashi-san.

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,500
Isn't it just me and the club manager?

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,870
No no... I mean, why are you making it dark?

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,870
A bit... already.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,460
Why are you so curious about Aizawa-san?

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,170
Because... I've learned it.

8
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,350
The secret of the Igarashi couple.

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,550
Heh... Oh, ah!

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,900
Oh!

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,760
I mean, why

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,760
Igarashi-san, did you know that Aizawa is a couple?

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,190
That's exactly right.

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,210
Did you hit it?

15
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,900
I think the manager spoke on his own.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,420
No, it just happened.

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,460
After Kaizawa joined the company, unaware that the two were separated

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,490
Igarashi-kun, headhunting.

19
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,180
Eh, they're separated...

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,220
So, are you two really not friends?

21
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,080
Well... more

22
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,110
What Hayashi knows about the two?

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,640
I haven't said that.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,000
So let's keep this secret only here.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,370
Even the two of them don't want to be cared for by the people around them.

26
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,750
I know. I also want to concentrate on my work at work.

27
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,270
Nice!

28
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,630
So then, I'll have a meeting so can I leave it to you?

29
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,150
Yes I'll check the inventory and then go back to the office.

30
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,150
Yes, please. yes.

31
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,880
(Mahiro) Ah, Deputy Director

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,880
I dropped it. (Naoto) Ah, thank you.

33
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,140
Yeah! They're definitely matching!

34
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,570
Is that what it is?

35
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,590
(Seto) It's it!

36
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,620
Eh, no, sorry! I'm getting some effort...

37
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,480
OK? Not particularly.

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,480
sorry.

39
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,710
I'm going back now.

40
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,750
Convenience store? I'll come but.

41
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,750
Ice cream, I understand.

42
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,620
(Sigh)

43
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,120
(Wae) Ah, please help! picture?

44
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,320
Please help me, I'm trapped.

45
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,010
I want to go outside! Ah...

46
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,540
It's okay, Grandma. picture?

47
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,080
See, I bought some ice cream. Yeah, let's eat together in our room.

48
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,440
ice!

49
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Yeah….

50
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,530
That's right...

51
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,550
(Kumiko) Welcome home. I'm home. Mom-in-law...

52
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,920
Yes... you'll eat dinner, right? Yeah.

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,780
(Kumiko) Yes, sit down Yes.

54
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,310
Miu Can you bring your bucket to the bathroom over there?

55
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,500
(Kumiko) Yes... she's a good girl.

56
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,030
Yes, yes, sit down... yes it's fine.

57
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,050
Yes OK OK!

58
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,910
Recently, the number of misconceptions has suddenly increased

59
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,610
Without a diaper, it's not possible anymore.

60
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,630
The sweet potato is also terrible.

61
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,830
If you put a lock in your room, it's the one you used to be.

62
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,210
"I'm trapped, help me."

63
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,210
I want to help you here...

64
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,960
After all, wouldn't it be better to get into a facility soon?

65
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,820
If it's money, I'll help too.

66
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,690
If you do that, your dad will get mad!

67
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,900
Dad... I haven't heard from him for 10 years

68
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,420
There's no way he'll come back.

69
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,970
That person is the kind of person who suddenly comes back without contacting me.

70
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,170
It's a problem, stepmother.

71
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,360
Yes.

72
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,360
(laughter)

73
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,680
Dad said my blood pressure would be high

74
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,540
It doesn't taste good when you make a low-salt dish.

75
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,060
You're going to be in a bad mood.

76
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,260
So in the end it's back to a richer taste.

77
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,130
Hmm... How about work? Are you going well?

78
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,680
Yes I'm busy but I'm doing it somehow.

79
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,870
Hmm...

80
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,900
But Miu isn't that good at work

81
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,930
I also studied pretty decently.

82
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,930
So, find a good person quickly and have fun.

83
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
A good person...

84
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,210
There are secrets that no one can tell anyone.

85
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,060
Not letting it go outside

86
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,270
That means you have a sense of your identity as a working adult.

87
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,270
You're doing pretty hard every day

88
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,180
I agree….

89
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,880
(Yukito) It's been a while since we two came together.

90
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,070
Sorry it's been a while.

91
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,090
I'm glad you looked healthy. (Yukito) Yes.

92
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,470
It just got a new bean. Let me know your thoughts.

93
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,820
OK! Leave it to me.

94
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,360
I would like Naoto's impressions, not Mahiro.

95
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,380
Huh?

96
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,570
Well, I guess I understand more than Mahiro.

97
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,260
yes? Yeah.

98
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,790
here you are.

99
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,790
I'll enjoy having this. I'll enjoy having this.

100
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,060
Yes it's tasty. Yeah….

101
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,770
The balance between sourness and sweetness is great.

102
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,480
But it's complicated but has a unique flavour...

103
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,840
As expected from Naoto!

104
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,540
This time's beans

105
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:38,260
It's a blend of wild Ethiopian species and Brazilian beans.

106
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,120
Ah, that's why it's fruity yet rich.

107
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,980
I don't know what you're talking about.

108
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,180
Both are beans with strong personality

109
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,360
My preferences differ though

110
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,900
When I blend it, it becomes strangely cohesive.

111
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,930
It will have a rich taste.

112
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,790
Complement each other's lack

113
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:03,170
They bring out the good parts...

114
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,170
Yes... I want to be that way for couples too.

115
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,430
Ah, I won't say it...

116
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,430
Stop it and it's difficult to react.

117
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,510
Yes it's tasty.

118
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:24,390
Thank you Dad, I was happy.

119
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,590
Good, I've been away for a while

120
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,590
I was curious.

121
00:08:32,980 --> 00:09:20,780
～

122
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,300
that….

123
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Isn't that a bit nice?

124
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,890
what happened? Suddenly. Something happened?

125
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,920
Sorry for letting it go and reheating it.

126
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,130
Do you already know that the faxing is the culprit?

127
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,130
picture?

128
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,750
No... it's not clear yet.

129
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,790
That fax was politely notified to me.

130
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,670
When I looked it up, it seems that it was sent from a convenience store in Midorimachi.

131
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,040
Near the apartment... Do you know what you know?

132
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,770
Ah, no... I think it's near the apartment where an acquaintance lives.

133
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,470
What do you think?

134
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,680
Yes, it doesn't seem to be possible.

135
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,560
So, would it be a grudge from the other employee?

136
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,260
Or is it harassment from a competitor? Thank you Seto-kun.

137
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,300
But there's nothing particularly since then

138
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,300
If there's nothing more then that's fine...

139
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,030
I think it's not good to be too friendly.

140
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,790
I've been saying this so much lately.

141
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,810
I'm just worried.

142
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,810
picture?

143
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,240
Ah, no...there's not all good people in the world.

144
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,930
I wonder if my feet will be scrubbed.

145
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:05,840
Seto-kun... about me

146
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,690
Do you think you're an idiot?

147
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,230
That's how it is...

148
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,230
Thank you, I'll be careful.

149
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,860
Deputy Director: Materials for the afternoon meeting.

150
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,070
Ah, thank you. So...

151
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,620
Hayashi-san lives near us, right?

152
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,320
Ah, he said his parents' house was close.

153
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,700
why? Ah, uh, anything.

154
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,380
So, excuse me.

155
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,380
Ah, Aizawa-san, sorry.

156
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Can I hear about this too?

157
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,750
Yes, there is no problem.

158
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,750
What? Seriously?

159
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,340
So... I'll contact you later with more details.

160
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,340
Yes, I understand.

161
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,700
It's the first time. Thank you for your hard work.

162
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,700
(2 people) Thank you for your hard work.

163
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,430
Hayashi-san

164
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,430
Maybe it's a bit time fine. picture?

165
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,150
It's about a photo of Director Itaka.

166
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,010
That was really difficult, isn't it?

167
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,540
Something's wrong because of me

168
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,390
sorry.

169
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,260
Ah, yes that's fine.

170
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,460
But Hayashi-san then

171
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,830
He took Kunitachi to the station.

172
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,850
Yes, we went to the station together.

173
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,400
I think that photo was taken at that time

174
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,270
Was there any suspicious people nearby?

175
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:38,330
Huh? Sorry I really don't remember...

176
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,180
I see...

177
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,180
I wonder what it was...

178
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,780
that…. but….

179
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,490
Deputy Director: He was so angry, right?

180
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,010
picture?

181
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,390
I was a little surprised that he had such a scary face.

182
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:07,290
Ah, I think it's just a manager.

183
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,990
He also followed me later. picture?

184
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,530
He went to check with Kunitachi.

185
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,740
It seems that the company over there hadn't been sent any strange faxes or anything.

186
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,960
Wow, Deputy Director is really kind.

187
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,510
That's good - he's just like Miu thought.

188
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,510
picture?

189
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,460
I'll just say that to Aizawa-san.

190
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,810
I

191
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,810
I like it: Deputy Director Igarashi.

192
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,260
He's good at work, I respect him, and he's cool.

193
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,260
It's a miracle that such a person is still single!

194
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,190
Yes, that's right...

195
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,910
But I have to check the feelings of the other side slowly.

196
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,960
See, it would be a pain if it interferes with your work.

197
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,960
That's right.

198
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,560
But I'm a little conceived

199
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,950
I don't think there's a pulse.

200
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,950
picture?

201
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,210
Um... Actually, I'm the last time

202
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:46,090
I went to the Deputy Director's house.

203
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,950
Deputy Director's House

204
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,650
The rooms are also super clean.

205
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,510
Maybe it was 2DK...

206
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,540
There are bear bricks and other decorations at the entrance.

207
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,890
It feels stylish.

208
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:03,440
Also, the deputy director is so cute when he puts his bangs down.

209
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,970
Isn't that a gap good?

210
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:10,970
What does that mean?

211
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,280
Before this

212
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,480
I went to sleep overnight.

213
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,200
This kind of thing is awkward and I keep it a secret

214
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Sorry... I want only Aizawa-san to know.

215
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:42,790
Please keep an eye on us, Mr. Kaizawa.

216
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
It's late.

217
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,860
Ah, mahi... Aizawa-san, thank you for your hard work.

218
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,560
I made a reservation at the store.

219
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,260
The wine is also delicious

220
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,960
You have to be careful not to drink too much.

221
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Well, if you drink too much, just stay at home...

222
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,050
what up? Mahiro.

223
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,450
Did you stay there?

224
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,470
picture?

225
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,840
About Hayashi

226
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,540
Did you stay there?

227
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,540
Why did that...

228
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,940
Wait, Mahiro! There's nothing with Hayashi-san.

229
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:55,560
Yes, I understand.

230
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,280
But then again. I'm going home today.

231
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,810
Mahiro!

232
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,810
Don't touch it!

233
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:41,060
(Vibrator sound)

234
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,190
This sofa will also be available in more colors and sizes.

235
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,540
I'll let you know when I decide. yes.

236
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,540
Yes please. please.

237
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,140
Deputy Director Igarashi here. Ah, I'll go right away.

238
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,770
If it's this, then it's here, here and here.

239
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,140
yes. This is the variation of curtains

240
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,840
Wouldn't it be better to have a sample? That's right.

241
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,840
So I'll try and find a bit. Yeah.

242
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,990
(knock)

243
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,990
Excuse me. yes.

244
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,770
Deputy Director: What's wrong? Talk.

245
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,300
No... Hayashi-san

246
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,010
Did you tell Aizawa-san about staying at home?

247
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,040
Ah, sorry!

248
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,080
That day, the Deputy Director gently protected me

249
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,280
I'm so happy... I'll always be there for advice

250
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,980
I'm not alone in Aizawa...

251
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,530
It's best not to talk about that to other people too much.

252
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,730
sorry….

253
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,100
But it's okay! Aizawa-san is

254
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,100
He's not the kind of person to talk about.

255
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,030
Sorry I ended up working overtime.

256
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,730
No, I want to do what I can today.

257
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:06,730
Ah, there was a collection of textile designs in the literature room.

258
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,860
I'll go too, that's heavy.

259
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,860
Ah, yes.

260
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,280
Is stalkers okay since then?

261
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,140
yes! The police are patrolling around.

262
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:29,140
I see. That's good.

263
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,590
Deputy Director...

264
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,590
It's really kind.

265
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,810
(The sound of the door opening)

266
00:21:48,560 --> 00:22:05,390
～

267
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,390
Aizawa-san?

268
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,940
I wonder what's wrong? Aizawa-san.

269
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:44,110
(Hyperventilation breathing)

270
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:59,600
～

271
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,290
Aizawa-san!

272
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,290
Aizawa-san, calm down.

273
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,380
Breathe slowly.

274
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,550
please.

275
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,570
thank you.

276
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:38,570
Wow, sorry for the inconvenience.

277
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,440
Is hyperventilation common?

278
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:58,010
Ah, that's not the case.

279
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,360
So what is it?

280
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
picture?

281
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:10,910
That's how I look... I'm worried.

282
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,450
that's why

283
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,810
Would you like to talk to me?

284
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,810
What happened?
