1
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,070
(Mahiro) Well...

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,150
(Yamanaka) I'm glad I tried it out.

3
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,850
(Miya) Yes, I was able to roughly grasp the flow of people.

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,040
(Higashitani) I was able to relieve my fatigue from the hot springs.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,040
(Miya) That's it.

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,120
Secondary.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,160
This is a document for children's facilities at hotels across the country.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,190
(Naoto) Ah, thank you.

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,880
Can it be held at the meeting after this?

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,080
I'll prepare. Also...

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Excuse me.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Hayashi-san.

13
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,260
(Sigh)

14
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,900
(Miu) What is it?

15
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,600
(Seto) No...

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,800
Maybe it's okay anyway.

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,670
Are you watching me because you're a errand by Aizawa?

18
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,670
different.

19
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,440
But I thought it must have been a shock.

20
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,150
Is it when you're worried about someone?

21
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,350
surely.

22
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,350
Wow, I finally admitted it.

23
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,930
Like you

24
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,930
Not all of them can be honest with themselves.

25
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,170
So please help me.

26
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,770
It's empty.

27
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,940
Why was it Seto?

28
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Because I thought I was hooked by Aizawa-san.

29
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,020
I don't have time to go along with your jokes.

30
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,020
I've been so involved with your lies.

31
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,100
I feel sorry for that.

32
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,710
If so then

33
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,240
What if we break up?

34
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,260
Huh?

35
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,300
It's really a hassle to have a couple fighting about romantic conversations within the office.

36
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,320
you….

37
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,850
I've said the right thing.

38
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,210
Take it easy.

39
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,570
A bit Naoto.

40
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,770
I'm kidding.

41
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,770
Why can't you have that much time?

42
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,210
I'm getting caught up in it and getting annoying.

43
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,210
Even if it's rotten, wouldn't you be proud of your husband?

44
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Is it me that's annoying?

45
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,990
(Vibrator sound)

46
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,290
(Vibrator sound)

47
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,490
what happened? mother.

48
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,510
(Kumiko) What time can I go home today?

49
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,710
I don't know because I work overtime.

50
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,410
I want to take care of my grandma.

51
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,590
Look, it's your dad's birthday tomorrow, right?

52
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,280
I want to buy some flowers or something.

53
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,470
Sorry, but I think it's going to be late.

54
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,820
Moms want to go out too.

55
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
Because I'm at work now.

56
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,460
Have you not had lunch yet?

57
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:11,700
I'm not finished work. I see, thank you for your hard work.

58
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,890
Deputy Director: Isn't it your beloved wife lunch box?

59
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,900
Ah, a bit...

60
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,460
Oh I shouldn't say it!

61
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,460
Hayashi-san...

62
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,680
Please don't be so scared.

63
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,680
I'm not planning to reveal it and it's annoying to be considerate.

64
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,440
sorry.

65
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,810
It's annoying to be apologised.

66
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:54,120
Hayashi-san, I think he really liked Naoto.

67
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,120
it is….

68
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,190
That's Mahiro.

69
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:19,550
Why don't we live together again?

70
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,240
Huh?

71
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:30,310
I wonder what will happen if we continue our half-hearted relationship as it is now.

72
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,670
We are more clear...

73
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,370
I don't think so.

74
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:43,440
That's a repetition of the same thing.

75
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,330
I've hurt Hayashi so much, so I'll go back to normal

76
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,330
Isn't that too selfish?

77
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,100
good night.

78
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
good night

79
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:24,530
I still want you to apologize.

80
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,530
I'm really sorry.

81
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Please throw this away.

82
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,730
Ah, I'm busy...

83
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,090
(Takebashi) It was officially decided at this morning's executive meeting, so

84
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,960
We would like to start the Tsukiyo Hotel competition.

85
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,310
(Everyone) Yes. (Takebashi) Let's do our best.

86
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,500
It's also a client's request

87
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,200
If we consider the basis of suggestions for spaces that can approach family groups...

88
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,890
Near the kids' space that doubles as a daycare center

89
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,750
By setting up an area where adults can enjoy themselves...

90
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,610
Rather than simply incorporating regionality

91
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,140
We should add new elements to it

92
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,160
I think so.

93
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,860
(Takebashi) There are a lot of things out there.

94
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,900
Hayashi-san, is there anything?

95
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,250
No, especially me.

96
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,270
I see.

97
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,270
So that's all for the meeting. (Everyone) Yes.

98
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,210
Why does it come with you?

99
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,240
Meeting with Mimine Construction Company

100
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,100
I was thinking of letting you participate too.

101
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,470
I'm in charge of Mimine Construction though.

102
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:05,020
There are competitions, so salespeople need cooperation, right?

103
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,390
(Miu) Sorry for the tea. (Suzumura) Ah, thank you.

104
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,080
This is Aizawa from the contract business department.

105
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,110
(Suzumura) Ah, hello.

106
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,810
Wow, I was able to work with Miu-chan...

107
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,350
Ah, I'm happy to be able to work with Miu.

108
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,370
Thank you for your time. Yeah.

109
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,400
Miu-chan? Ah, I'm sorry.

110
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,090
I'm the same age as my niece, so I'm not too worried.

111
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,950
ah…. I am honored.

112
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,820
So, this time I'll talk about the details of our plan...

113
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,010
Ah, it's okay.

114
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,550
If Miu is in charge, I'll do it at home.

115
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,900
thank you.

116
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,100
However, I would like to share my plans for now.

117
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,120
We have consultations on budget and delivery dates... That kind of thing

118
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,490
Because I'll be interacting with the manager. You're fine.

119
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,850
More than that, today

120
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,380
I want to talk a lot.

121
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,400
is that so? Yeah.

122
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,760
Then... That Suzumura-sama.

123
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,140
Even though we've had so much effort, we can't just talk about it.

124
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,850
Wow, it's fine, it's fine. See, I'm bored even when I'm at work.

125
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,720
If so, why not read this document at least?

126
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,580
We have carefully considered and summarized the forest.

127
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,610
Ah, is it Aikawa-san?

128
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,810
This is Aizawa. Ah, Aizawa-san.

129
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,180
You wanna be? Your head is hard.

130
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,390
I can't get married if that's the case.

131
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,580
Suzumura-san. yeah?

132
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,600
Aizawa-san is getting married!

133
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,790
What? Is that so? Ah, sorry, something.

134
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,650
More on the previous golf story

135
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,500
Please let me know. That's fine.

136
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,850
I heard that he got a really good score.

137
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,710
My personal best has arrived! Yes, my best!

138
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,730
Take a look at the swing a bit. It was a bit amazing.

139
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,750
Wow, it's beautiful! It's Fur!

140
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,280
What's fur? This is fur! This is fur...

141
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,150
Thank you for today. Miu-chan was fun.

142
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,150
Well then, please. please.

143
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,220
thank you very much.

144
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,220
bye bye!

145
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:17,180
This is my way so please don't get in the way.

146
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,380
That old man is annoying, but he can do his job.

147
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,250
Those who are well-designed will win.

148
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,100
It's educational...

149
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,480
Ah, Hayashi-san, I wonder if I can't talk a little more after this.

150
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,480
It's not possible. I don't have time.

151
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,890
(Vibrator sound)

152
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,430
mother? Because I'm at work.

153
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,450
Huh?

154
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,450
Isn't it a lie? What about grandma?

155
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,770
Hayashi-san, Grandma...

156
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,300
It looks like he's gone from home.

157
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,490
While my mother was shopping.

158
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,020
I have to go searching... Wait, I'll go too.

159
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,210
Huh? If you have any photos, please show me.

160
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,730
photograph…. Grandma's.

161
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,090
Photos...

162
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,110
This one.

163
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,640
What do you think you're going somewhere?

164
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,500
Umm, um...

165
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,350
Wait a minute.

166
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,380
Let's think slowly and calmly.

167
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,920
I usually go for a walk, and a supermarket...

168
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,770
What's wrong?

169
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,480
Hayashi's grandma...

170
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,480
come here for a second. Huh?

171
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,740
Sorry, can you do it a bit?

172
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,440
Have you not seen this guy?

173
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,980
Now I don't know. sorry.

174
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,980
Understood, thank you very much.

175
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Grandma!

176
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Grandma!

177
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,200
sorry. a little bit

178
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,390
Have you ever seen this person?

179
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,410
i don't know…. Oh I haven't seen it.

180
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,610
Sumima...

181
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,150
Ah, sorry. yeah?

182
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,510
What's wrong? Ah, no, that was a misunderstanding.

183
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,510
Sorry, thank you very much.

184
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,670
Are you okay?

185
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,600
Let's sit once.

186
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,460
I'll buy you a little juice. yes.

187
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,150
Let's calm down. Wait a minute.

188
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,680
Seriously annoying.

189
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,700
Huh?

190
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
It's all because of your mother.

191
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,150
Seto-kun.

192
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,170
hello?

193
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,870
It was protected at a convenience store in Kitamachi (Seto).

194
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,890
I understand, I'll go straight away.

195
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,910
My grandma was found.

196
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,910
What! let's go.

197
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,340
Thank you ice cream. (Wae) Yes.

198
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,190
It's tasty. delicious?

199
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,050
Yes isn't it cold?

200
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,590
Grandma!

201
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,590
what happened? good.

202
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,850
I'll buy it for Ice Kenji.

203
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,710
To your dad? Yes yes.

204
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,060
So you came to buy it alone?

205
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,950
That girl likes strawberry flavor.

206
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,480
I have to feed him. Wait a minute.

207
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes...

208
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,060
It's not possible.

209
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,060
Dad won't come back anymore.

210
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,060
(Miu) Grandma, take care of your feet.

211
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,060
(Wae) Ahhh...

212
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Come up.

213
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,180
(Wae) Kenji Yes, yes...

214
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,040
Grandma's room is inside.

215
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,040
I'll send you a friend. (Wae) Yes, yes.

216
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,650
Um sorry until this late.

217
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,350
It was really good to be found.

218
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,200
(Kumiko) Ah! mother.

219
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,390
What, Miu...

220
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,920
People at work. He helped me search.

221
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,780
Ah, is that so?

222
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,140
Thank you very much for the inconvenience. home.

223
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,500
Sorry, thank you so much.

224
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,850
Why did you take your eyes off your grandma?

225
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,210
I was just going out shopping.

226
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,230
I hope you come home early.

227
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,080
Ah, mom.

228
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,280
(Miu) You contacted me that I was going to be late, right?

229
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,990
(Kumiko) I can't stay at home forever either.

230
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,680
Because they're doing it all at the expense of them.

231
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,700
It's just your mother doing it on her own.

232
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,240
I have said many times to leave it to the facility.

233
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,110
It's just for your father, so it's no use.

234
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,630
Hey, if I wasn't there when I got home

235
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,630
I'm the one who gets complained about it.

236
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Take it easy.

237
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,600
Just wake up.

238
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,120
Dad hasn't returned in 10 years.

239
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,810
He's not coming back anymore.

240
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,340
I'm currently making a girl somewhere and doing it!

241
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,700
Don't say anything stupid!

242
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,590
Mostly you find someone who is good at Miu and reduce your work

243
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,620
If you could help with the house, it would be easier for moms too...

244
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,810
Don't push your own ideal!

245
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,810
Don't try to make your daughter do what you couldn't achieve!

246
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,220
A bad kid like you

247
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,250
I have to hold my husband and make him happy

248
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,250
You'll be unhappy forever!

249
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,150
mother.

250
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,110
Hayashi is an excellent and strong woman.

251
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,110
I'm not a bad kid.

252
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,250
I have an eye to see people

253
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,120
You can respond flexibly to any opponent.

254
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,980
As a sales person, there are things that should be emulated

255
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
There are many.

256
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,080
I agree that it's strong too.

257
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,940
Honestly, I think I can earn more than a guy somewhere else.

258
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
What are you guys?

259
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,500
I don't want my mother to insult me...

260
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,950
I understand my daughter the most.

261
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,300
If so!

262
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,840
If so, more

263
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,400
Please take a closer look at Hayashi-san!

264
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,140
I can't accept it by the closest family

265
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,140
Because it's so painful.

266
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,620
My mother couldn't accept that my father wasn't coming back

267
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,660
I'm clinging to my grandmother's presence.

268
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,660
Because it's the only bond I have with my father.

269
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,870
Hayashi-san is filial and filial.

270
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,460
I definitely don't want to be like that.

271
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Like mother...

272
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:45,390
That's why I definitely don't want to choose the wrong person.

273
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,090
Find a husband who will take me properly and support me

274
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,090
I have no choice but to be happy.

275
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,750
The only person who can save me like this is the Deputy Director.

276
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,750
That's what I was thinking.

277
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,150
But

278
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,180
There's someone like Aizawa next to me.

279
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,370
There's nothing I can do about it.

280
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,060
a….

281
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,780
But getting married isn't that easy.

282
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,820
If you just want the other person, things won't go well...

283
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,680
I know. If you want it from someone else

284
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,550
Of course, I would make a certain amount of sacrifices myself too.

285
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,550
Did you get married without that determination?

286
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,660
I might be a bit envious of you.

287
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,840
Huh?

288
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:53,230
If you could tell me something like Hayashi-san directly

289
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:58,450
Maybe the couple will do well too.

290
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,300
If you know

291
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,830
You should just say what you want to say clearly.

292
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,540
I'm so bad

293
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,410
Tell me what I want to say clearly

294
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,450
You have to get what you want yourself

295
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,820
I couldn't get anything.

296
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,190
That's why I had some crazy guys

297
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,560
I did some dirty things too.

298
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Do you think you're aware of it?

299
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,470
To get out of this situation

300
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,470
I have no choice but to find a good marriage partner.

301
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,910
Why do you want to get married so much?

302
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,910
So why did Aizawa get married?

303
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,690
it is….

304
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,390
I can't answer these questions

305
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,390
They'll be separated or something.

306
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,990
If you have time to take care of others, be happy quickly.

307
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,280
I caught such a good property.

308
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:44,010
(The sound of the stomach squeal)

309
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,010
See, it's the worst.

310
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,100
It made me laugh.

311
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,460
Yes.

312
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,460
(Miu) You were laughing, wasn't it?

313
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,070
It's right...

314
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,700
(Yukito) Ah...
