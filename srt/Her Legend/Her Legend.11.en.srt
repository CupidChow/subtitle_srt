1
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,354
All I know is that the father is a
representative of a huge corporation.

2
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:24,119
They've been in the states a long time
so I wasn't able to get exact details.

3
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:26,189
Anyway I found their address,
write it down.

4
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:39,887
[Kim Jong Wook.
Woo Do Young.]

5
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:46,454
Woo Do Young, she had the
exact same name as Mrs. Woo.

6
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:10,461
Min Ki, what are you doing here?

7
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:13,704
Is this the house you moved into?

8
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,717
How did you know to
find this place?

9
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:22,186
Did you live in Yeon Jong Do,
before you moved here?

10
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:26,018
Why are you asking me
these questions?

11
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:31,245
Before your mother came to New York,
she was a painter too right?

12
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,546
Have you known Ms. Eun Jung Soo
from a long time ago?

13
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:45,329
Aunt

14
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:49,462
Go ahead and answer
your phone.

15
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:56,512
No, it's fine...
what did you just say?

16
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:00,064
I was wondering if you
knew Ms. Eun Jung Soo...

17
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:02,969
You're here.

18
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:05,860
I thought you'd be here
soon so I came out to check.

19
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:07,597
Mom.

20
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:11,366
Hello.

21
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,535
Director Kang, let's talk
about that at work later.

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,926
I'll go inside and you guys
can finish your discussion.

23
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,146
No mom!

24
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:23,597
I was just about to go in.

25
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:27,679
Sure... well then...

26
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:31,290
Goodbye.

27
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:37,690
Let's go in.

28
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,171
Did Min Ki bring you home?

29
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:56,869
Seo Hyun.

30
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:58,507
Yes?

31
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:02,155
I'm sorry mom,
what did you just say?

32
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:05,318
By any chance, are you two
seeing each other again?

33
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,332
No, it's nothing like that.

34
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:10,698
He needed to tell me something
about work that's all.

35
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,600
It can't be easy seeing
each other everyday at work.

36
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,800
I can't believe of all the places, you're
working at the same company as Min Ki.

37
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:23,916
Seo Hyun.

38
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,800
You and Min Ki...
I don't why you two broke up.

39
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:33,301
But your father and I
thought he was a great guy.

40
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:37,292
If Min Ki came here with the
intentions of asking you out again...

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,700
I told you it's not like that!

42
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:44,143
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,132
I'm just a little sensitive right now.

44
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,863
Who could that be at this time?

45
00:03:55,397 --> 00:03:56,518
Who is it?

46
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:58,564
It's me!

47
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,900
Oh my, it's Seo Hyun's aunt... Hello!

48
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:08,062
I thought you went home.

49
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,182
Did you forget something here?

50
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,990
Yes, I did amongst other things.

51
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:18,780
- Did Seo Hyun come home?
- Yes, a little while ago.

52
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:32,248
Are you crazy!

53
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:34,209
What are you doing here
at this hour?

54
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,700
Then you should have
answered your phone!

55
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:40,446
I was panicking! I couldn't just sit
there and wait for you to call back!

56
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:43,184
Did something... happen?

57
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900
Has that woman said anything to you?

58
00:04:48,212 --> 00:04:49,279
Like what?

59
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,375
What is she supposed
to tell me?

60
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:56,809
For goodness sakes!
What happened?

61
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:59,706
Jung Soo saw that woman at the
department store she was working at.

62
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:08,156
Was it a glimpse or
did she see her face to face?

63
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,692
It looks as if she saw her
face to face.

64
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:12,820
Jung Soo was in a state of shock
so she lost her.

65
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:15,803
And that woman didn't
recognize her at all.

66
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:21,363
Now that she knows, she's going
to try to find her no matter what!

67
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:23,878
What are we going to do
about this?

68
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:26,658
Stop it... whatever we need to do,
we have to stop that from happening.

69
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
No matter what we can't let
those two meet each other!

70
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:29,849
No matter what!

71
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:39,878
By any chance, do you
know Ms. Eun Jung Soo?

72
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,816
What?

73
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:44,923
What are you talking about?

74
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:47,150
I've noticed at
the interviews...

75
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:50,055
you seemed uncomfortable
around Ms. Eun Jung Soo.

76
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:51,639
I'm not.

77
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:53,863
Ms. Eun Jung Soo is not
even a designer.

78
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,394
She's just a part-time employee that
will only be here for three months.

79
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,600
And what if that design really
belongs to Ms. Eun Jung Soo?

80
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:01,894
Then it's even more
imperative that we let this go.

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,800
Director Kang.

82
00:06:06,942 --> 00:06:08,411
Did you something bad happen?

83
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:11,410
You don't look so good.

84
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:13,583
Nothing happened.

85
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,382
Did you have a tough time
searching all day today?

86
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,358
No, it wasn't tough at all.

87
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:22,304
Just knowing that I'll be
able to see Mrs. Woo someday...

88
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,500
Has given me energy
right down to pinky toe.

89
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:35,524
That lady... Did that family
have a daughter at all?

90
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,900
No, they weren't able to have children,
that's why they were trying to adopt me.

91
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:42,531
Why do you ask?

92
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:44,610
Oh it's nothing.

93
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,198
I just thought that information
might help in finding her.

94
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:56,765
I'm so sorry... I know how busy
you are to be concerned with this.

95
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:00,794
Ms. Jung Soo.

96
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,700
Have you known Director Kim long?

97
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,400
Did you know her before
you came to Shin Hwa group?

98
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:16,214
No... the first time I met
her was at Shin Hwa group.

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,500
I apologize for barging in
so late at night.

100
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,100
- No don't be, are you leaving?
- Yes.

101
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:34,634
By the way, did anything bad
happen to you?

102
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,100
No!

103
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:40,065
I was just in a hurry to
ask Seo Hyun about something.

104
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,800
- I'll be on my way then.
- Have a safe trip.

105
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,686
- I'm going to get a taxi for her.
- Good idea.

106
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:47,042
No, that's not necessary.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
- It's all right aunt.
- No please, don't get up.

108
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,200
Goodbye now.

109
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:04,363
Why did you come out?

110
00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:17,595
You've been like this for awhile,
what are you thinking about?

111
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,400
I think there's something
going on with Seo Hyun's aunt.

112
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,200
She came back so quickly after leaving
and I think Seo Hyun is involved too.

113
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,400
Oh, and Min Ki was here
a little while ago.

114
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,700
Seo Hyun said he just stopped
by for a moment due to work.

115
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You think they are seeing
each other again?

116
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm not sure about Min Ki but Seo Hyun
has no intention to see him again.

117
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,000
For the time being they see each other
everyday because they have no choice.

118
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:52,851
Well both of them are rational, I'm sure
they're handling it in a wise manner.

119
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,200
I told you to go in!
Why do you keep following me?

120
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
I'll get you a taxi, take the taxi home.

121
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:03,539
Are you that rich?

122
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:07,902
Besides, now these days they blast
the air conditioner in the buses.

123
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,424
There's no point in taking a taxi.

124
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,700
Go in...
Hurry and go in!

125
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:29,377
What is it?

126
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:31,223
What's wrong?

127
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:36,363
Mom... I'm scared.

128
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:41,075
What am I going to do if
everyone finds out the truth?

129
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,600
What am I going to do if
Jung Soo comes here tomorrow?

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,500
Also... if she finds out
I took her place.

131
00:09:54,242 --> 00:09:55,265
What am I going to do?

132
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:00,238
That will never happen.

133
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,264
I'm going make sure that it doesn't.

134
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,357
I'll take Jung Soo and immigrate to
another country before that happens.

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,900
She will never see that woman.

136
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:13,170
So keep your mind clear
and ready yourself.

137
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:23,307
Also, don't ever think that
you stole Jung Soo's place.

138
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,931
You and the position that you have
right now, instead of Jung Soo.

139
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:30,826
It was fated for you.

140
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:34,984
Having it stolen?
That was Jung Soo's fate.

141
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,000
Be good to your adoptive parents.

142
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:43,553
Bend over backwards for them.

143
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,200
Even if by chance they find out
that you're not Jung Soo...

144
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:50,163
Make it so that they can't
ever kick you out.

145
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:52,196
Understand?

146
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:31,042
I know you had something
to say to me yesterday.

147
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,782
I'm sorry for cutting you off
like that.

148
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:37,010
I didn't want mom think
we were seeing each other again.

149
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:40,606
How did you know about the
previous house that we lived in?

150
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,900
And what was it that you
wanted to say to me yesterday?

151
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
I don't even know where to begin.

152
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:49,752
What is it that has you so frazzled?

153
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,000
You say... the first time you met Ms. Eun
Jung Soo was at Shin Hwa group right?

154
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:58,019
How many times do I
have to tell you?

155
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,469
I immigrated to the states
as a sophomore in high school.

156
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:03,744
And as you know we returned when
we found out grandfather passed away.

157
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,181
How could I possibly know
Eun Jung Soo.

158
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:11,488
Why?

159
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,500
Did Eun Jung Soo say
she knew me from before?

160
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,300
No... Eun Jung Soo said Shin Hwa
was the first time she ever met you.

161
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,800
I was wondering... Did your mother...
ever adopted a child?

162
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,200
- Adoption?
- Also, I don't mean any harm by this.

163
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:40,107
Your mother and father... are
they your biological parents?

164
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:46,284
Min Ki, what in the world has you
asking me these kind of questions?

165
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,400
Did you find anything
yesterday about Mrs. Woo?

166
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:55,702
I went to the community
center in Yeon Jong Do.

167
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:58,689
But they're not allowed to give the
address of where they currently live.

168
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,100
Is it vital you find that woman?

169
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,700
Why? So you can go back
and be their daughter again?

170
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:09,394
No, I'm too old for an adoption.

171
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
Then don't bother.

172
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
You're wasting your energy for nothing!

173
00:13:17,707 --> 00:13:19,534
And once I found your place,
I was shocked.

174
00:13:19,888 --> 00:13:24,771
The person Ms. Eun Jung Soo
was looking for... is your mother.

175
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:32,119
- Have you told Eun Jung Soo?
- Not yet.

176
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:36,516
There seems to be a story behind
this so I wanted to ask you first.

177
00:13:37,156 --> 00:13:38,234
You should have!...

178
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:42,906
What's wrong?

179
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,026
What's wrong? Are you all right?

180
00:13:48,445 --> 00:13:49,534
I'm all right.

181
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:04,339
Can you keep a secret?

182
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:07,195
Min Ki, I'll tell you everything.

183
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:11,405
But you can't tell anyone,
especially Eun Jung Soo.

184
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:18,685
Yes, everything you said
is true Min Ki.

185
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,023
My mom and dad...

186
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:25,747
They're not my biological parents.

187
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:33,527
17 years ago my parents
planned on adopting a child.

188
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,681
During the adoption process...
my mom got into a car accident.

189
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:42,600
When it was declared that she
was in a vegetative state...

190
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:44,724
They stopped the adoption process.

191
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,393
Dad took mom to New York.

192
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,500
And after eight years, mom
miraculously came out of her coma.

193
00:14:55,267 --> 00:15:03,477
But at that point any means of contact
with that child had already ended.

194
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,046
Dad was worried about her health.

195
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:12,458
So instead of that child,
he adopted me.

196
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:16,652
Only my dad and I know about this.

197
00:15:18,556 --> 00:15:23,108
My mom still thinks I'm the child
she originally tried to adopt.

198
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,800
Then... the child she wanted
to adopt at first...

199
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,712
- Was Ms. Eun Jung Soo?
- I don't know.

200
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:35,631
If the person Eun Jung Soo
is looking for is my mother...

201
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,565
Then yes it's a possibility.

202
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:42,791
Min Ki.

203
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:44,311
Do me a favor.

204
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:47,613
My mom's health is getting better.

205
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:52,152
And her memories are
slowly returning as well.

206
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:56,178
But if she found out the truth...
she'll go into shock.

207
00:15:57,254 --> 00:15:58,771
So don't tell Eun Jung Soo.

208
00:15:59,612 --> 00:16:03,365
Besides, you don't know for sure
she is the child that was to be adopted.

209
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,078
- Jung Soo!
- Honey!

210
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:11,933
Honey, come out here for a second!
You too Jung Soo!

211
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:14,069
- Yes uncle?
- Where did you go? What is that?

212
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:17,603
You think we can make a hundred
of these by the day after tomorrow?

213
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:20,112
A hundred by the day after tomorrow?

214
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:21,381
What are you talking about?

215
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,200
It's a bag for samples
and other products.

216
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,200
The business that was supposed to
supply these had a flood in their factory.

217
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,700
If we do a good job, we'll probably
continue to supply for this company.

218
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,100
- Let's do it! Of course we should!
- What luck is this!

219
00:16:37,354 --> 00:16:39,850
Honey I'm impressed with your skills!
Oh my goodness!

220
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,700
The people there were in a hurry
so I wasn't able to get a pattern

221
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,357
You think you will be able
to make this?

222
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,900
This is nothing uncle.

223
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,500
Honey you know how talented
Jung Soo is!

224
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,100
Oh my gosh, this is great!

225
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:53,026
- Oh and if you look here.
- Yeah?

226
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,700
Your back is like an island.

227
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,000
The only island that I can
rest peacefully.

228
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,700
Wow Eun Jung Soo! Just one look
and she's got the pattern down!

229
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:08,838
I've learned from the best uncle!

230
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,000
- No chatter we have a hundred to make!
- We're on it!

231
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,600
This woman never picks up
the phone!

232
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:22,936
She's supposed to teach me an hour
everyday and I've gotten no word.

233
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:28,438
Is anyone home?

234
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:31,631
- Is anyone home?
- Yes!

235
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:32,901
What is it?

236
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:35,341
Who is it?

237
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,200
Behind the three sides,
you know where it is right?

238
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:39,895
- Yes, of course.
- Jung Soo.

239
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,300
This is a surprise.

240
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,400
What brings you here?

241
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,300
I'm suppose to learn how
to make bags starting today.

242
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:51,531
Please come in.

243
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:54,163
Bags?

244
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Director Do, please
introduce yourself.

245
00:18:57,455 --> 00:19:01,711
Starting today, the person who
will be teaching you is my uncle.

246
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,400
Me?... Wait, he wants to
learn how to make bags?

247
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,400
Why do you want to learn how
to make bags from a person like me.

248
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,600
- But it's nice to meet you.
- Yes.

249
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,200
I'm not saying this because
I know how to make bags.

250
00:19:22,268 --> 00:19:24,147
And you'll know
what I mean later on.

251
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,500
But you won't find a better
group of people than us anywhere.

252
00:19:28,022 --> 00:19:29,106
I see.

253
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,800
You came at the perfect time.

254
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:33,849
We need all the help
we can get right now.

255
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:40,100
When learning a skill you know you
have to start from the ground up right?

256
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,400
Well tailors start by
learning how to remove threads.

257
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:45,710
So have a seat and start
pulling those threads out.

258
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,900
Don't tell him to do that.

259
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Honey bring us some refreshing.
Hurry! Be quick!

260
00:19:51,297 --> 00:19:52,969
We don't have anything refreshing.

261
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,300
By the way, what's with the getup?

262
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:57,724
You won't be able to learn
properly dressed like that.

263
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,700
What's wrong with it?
I look great.

264
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,900
Yes, as your working
clothes it's quite unusual.

265
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,900
But it's stylish, it has style.

266
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,000
Please sit... I'll teach
you how to do this first.

267
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:21,300
I swear Jung Soo... this is amazing...
you drew this pattern down to a tee!

268
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,200
Why does it matter who teaches you?

269
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,100
Also, a teacher should be hard and
scary in order to learn properly.

270
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:32,949
You take me for granted and
think lightly of me. How will you learn?

271
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:36,002
This wasn't what we agreed on! I made
it clear you were going to teach me!

272
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:40,005
I'm pairing you up with a
challenging teacher, you don't like it?

273
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:43,171
If you want to learn then start
now, if not then just forget it.

274
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,402
We just got an unexpected
work order.

275
00:20:45,473 --> 00:20:47,775
So giving you lessons at this
time isn't possible anyways.

276
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:48,904
We're really busy.

277
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,192
Promise my butt!

278
00:20:53,581 --> 00:20:54,741
What was I thinking?

279
00:20:55,844 --> 00:20:56,949
This is bull crap!

280
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:17,954
This is a called a neck.

281
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:23,264
This looks similar to a fork
so we just call it the trident.

282
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:27,161
There's one that has
two spears and there's

283
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,476
this one like a pick,
makes one hole at a time.

284
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:32,407
You have to make the holes good.

285
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:36,162
So that way it's easy to sew
and the stitching looks good.

286
00:21:38,678 --> 00:21:41,778
Goodness... next time
dress comfortably!

287
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,058
- You must be hot.
- Oh... I'm fine.

288
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:48,535
Here, try making a hole.

289
00:21:52,673 --> 00:21:54,030
Use those two right there.

290
00:22:07,906 --> 00:22:08,928
What is it?

291
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:13,555
That thing... give it to me.

292
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:17,450
- This?
- Yeah.

293
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:23,069
What are you going to use it for?

294
00:22:24,805 --> 00:22:27,751
I need it for the sweat on my forehead.
How should I wear this?

295
00:22:43,648 --> 00:22:46,969
- This is pretty good.
- That was quick!

296
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:50,764
Since Jung Soo did the pattern
so well, we made this in no time.

297
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,100
- Director Do was a big help too.
- Not at all.

298
00:22:54,354 --> 00:22:55,538
Hold on.

299
00:22:57,725 --> 00:22:58,842
Hello?

300
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,640
Hello manager!

301
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,700
Yes, yes... a sample?

302
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,300
Yes, I understand!

303
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:06,959
Yes, I'll be right there.

304
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,400
That was the home shopping network,
They want to see one of the bags we made.

305
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:17,096
Why do they want to see a sample?
They think we can't make that simple bag?

306
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:20,184
They've never worked with us before,
it's understandable they don't trust us.

307
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,700
It's fine! We made
these bags anyways.

308
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:25,903
We'll just take these and
show it to them.

309
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,100
Kyung Ho took the scooter,
how are you going to get there?

310
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,700
I'll go uncle.

311
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,114
It's too hot outside for
you to carry these bags.

312
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,900
- I'll go.
- Uncle you need to make more bags.

313
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,750
We need to have 100 bags by the day
after tomorrow, you don't have time!

314
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,432
I can make it when I get back.

315
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,800
I'll go with her and I have
my motorcycle with me as well.

316
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:46,065
Motorcycle?

317
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,000
So that's why you're dressed like that.

318
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,600
I don't know what to say?

319
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:12,506
I appreciate this.
Thanks to you, we got here quickly!

320
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:16,562
- Will you be all right?
- Yes, I'll be right back!

321
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,156
That's tough...
I said that's tough.

322
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:23,853
Carry the bags from behind your back,
she always carries it in front of her.

323
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:24,948
Oh my back!

324
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:32,155
You used a different zipper
from the sample bag we gave you.

325
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:34,484
We checked the home shopping
bulletin board online.

326
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,900
And there were some inquiries on
the zipper malfunction of the bags.

327
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,700
Well I found out the zipper
used for the sample bags

328
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,400
is one that tends to break
easily around the ends.

329
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:46,210
The unit price was a little expensive.

330
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,400
But we went ahead changed it to a
zipper that caused less trouble.

331
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:50,795
There was hardly any difference
in the style of the design.

332
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,500
You're attention to details
is impressive.

333
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,000
We're more than happy to use
products of good quality.

334
00:24:57,223 --> 00:24:59,052
But I heard you guys
were a small business.

335
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,100
Is it all right for you to
lose profit on the unit price?

336
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,500
Honestly, we're not
losing that much.

337
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:07,786
It's more important investing in quality
products and getting recognized for it.

338
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,900
And ultimately it's our duty to provide
that. My uncle is very firm on that.

339
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Being a small business,
I was very worried.

340
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:17,400
But I feel confident in
trusting you now.

341
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:19,220
Just please make sure
it's done on time.

342
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,200
Yes! We'll do our best!
Thank you so much!

343
00:25:23,514 --> 00:25:24,640
Thank you!

344
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,200
Yes!

345
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,400
- Did it go well?
- We passed!

346
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,500
They liked it! Once we're done, they'll
consider using us as their supplier.

347
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:41,054
- Aren't you thankful?
- Of course I'm thankful!

348
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:42,751
It's hard for a small time
business like us

349
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:45,563
to be considered as a supplier
for a home shopping network.

350
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:46,896
That's not what I meant.

351
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:49,865
Do you know how much
this baby costs?

352
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,500
Me and my Emma took you to an important
meeting. Shouldn't you feel honored?

353
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:02,303
Hey motorcycle, thanks for the ride.

354
00:26:03,517 --> 00:26:08,666
But how did you get so
unlucky to meet this jerk.

355
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
What? What did you just say?

356
00:26:11,662 --> 00:26:12,666
Nothing.

357
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:15,295
I heard you say something
about being unlucky.

358
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:18,698
I said how nice it would be to have
something refreshing on a day like this.

359
00:26:23,437 --> 00:26:24,549
Hold on a second.

360
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:27,425
Yes Director.

361
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm outside right now.

362
00:26:32,278 --> 00:26:33,364
Yes, I know where that is.

363
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,400
Okay, I'll see you then.

364
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,000
- Let's go.
- Director? You mean Director Kang?

365
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:42,379
Yes.

366
00:26:42,588 --> 00:26:43,997
Why are you meeting Min Ki?

367
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,600
Forget it! Don't tell me
if you don't want to.

368
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,252
Oh my gosh! What a jerk!

369
00:27:09,155 --> 00:27:10,176
Manager Kang.

370
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,400
I won't be disappointed.

371
00:27:12,648 --> 00:27:13,787
Just tell me.

372
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,800
I knew you had something
to say to me yesterday.

373
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:24,500
But I could see you were hesitant in
telling me so I waited for you to be ready.

374
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,062
Ms. Eun Jung Soo.

375
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,800
If you ever find that person again...
what do you plan on doing?

376
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,700
What do you mean by that?

377
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,600
You said there's a chance she
might not remember you at all.

378
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:51,425
Or what if, for some reason she
is not be looking for you.

379
00:27:52,585 --> 00:27:55,042
I'm afraid, finding
that person might be...

380
00:27:55,043 --> 00:27:57,276
more disappointing
and hurtful for you.

381
00:27:58,572 --> 00:28:00,500
At this point, I'm not sure if
this is the right thing to say

382
00:28:00,535 --> 00:28:04,810
But there's a saying that memories
should be buried as memories.

383
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,000
While finding Mrs. Woo...

384
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,500
I'm just worried that you
might get more hurt by it.

385
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,339
Ms. Jung Soo.

386
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:21,348
- All I want...
- To me Mrs. Woo... is not a memory.

387
00:28:23,263 --> 00:28:26,930
Not once... was Mrs. Woo
a memory to me.

388
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,600
17 years may have passed.

389
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:32,098
But everytime I think about
Mrs. Woo...

390
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:36,121
I still feel the same way I did
17 years ago, it hurts, and I miss her.

391
00:28:50,969 --> 00:28:54,621
Hey Bear... don't laugh.

392
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,700
I don't like you today.

393
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:09,688
So you're saying... Mrs. Woo thinks
the adopted daughter she has is me?

394
00:29:11,923 --> 00:29:14,053
I don't know if this
will give you any comfort.

395
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
But that woman
had knowledge of you.

396
00:29:18,116 --> 00:29:21,240
As soon as she came out of her coma...
she was searching for you Ms. Jung Soo.

397
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,900
Then the person who got
adopted instead of me.

398
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:30,751
Did you get a chance to meet
her personally Director Kang?

399
00:29:32,502 --> 00:29:33,628
Yes.

400
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,200
How is Mrs. Woo's health

401
00:29:39,304 --> 00:29:40,344
She's very healthy.

402
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:44,823
During her recovery, she did have
amnesia for a certain period of time.

403
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:47,874
But recently she has been
slowly getting her memories back.

404
00:29:49,285 --> 00:29:50,907
I'm so relieved to hear that.

405
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:00,462
Director Kang.

406
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,200
Thank you so much.

407
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:07,934
I had no idea something
like that had happened.

408
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
If I eventually met Mrs. Woo...

409
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,800
Imagine how shocked she would be
if she realized her daughter wasn't me?

410
00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:43,799
Thank you.

411
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,808
Don't think of anything
and just get some sleep.

412
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:07,426
Also... if you need my
help for anything, call me.

413
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:09,435
I will.

414
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,560
By the way, what is that?

415
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:15,584
Do you have a motorcycle?

416
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:18,151
No.

417
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,500
I just happened to have it.

418
00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:22,788
It's really nothing.

419
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,900
Thank you for taking me home.

420
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:18,626
Jung Soo.

421
00:32:18,873 --> 00:32:19,893
Jung Soo!

422
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,200
Look at all this sweat!
Jung Soo what's wrong?

423
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:27,056
Jung Soo! Wake up!

424
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,100
What's wrong with her?
Jung Soo! Jung Soo!

425
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,600
Oh this bad! Kyung Ho!

426
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,600
Kyung Ho! She's sweating like crazy!

427
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,596
- Take a look at her!
- Jung Soo! What's wrong with her?

428
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,785
Hey! Put her your back!

429
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:42,905
Hurry and carry her!

430
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:44,557
- What's wrong?
- Honey.

431
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,300
- What's wrong with her?
- Mom, get out of the way!

432
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,800
- Where are you going?
- Jung Soo wake up!

433
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:53,912
What in the world is
wrong with her?

434
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,100
Jung Soo did? Did she say
anything at all yesterday?

435
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,800
Okay mom, I'll talk to you later.

436
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,800
You didn't tell Eun Jung Soo
I was that child did you?

437
00:33:15,421 --> 00:33:18,700
No, I didn't. I thought it would
be best if you told her yourself.

438
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,300
That's not going to happen.

439
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:26,040
It's not your fault with the
way things happened.

440
00:33:26,236 --> 00:33:28,271
Also, even if the truth
is revealed, I don't

441
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,035
believe it's going
to change anything.

442
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:33,030
What is that you're so
scared of that you can't talk?

443
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,900
You're right, none of this
is my fault.

444
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:40,223
But I don't feel comfortable
standing in front of Eun Jung Soo.

445
00:33:40,314 --> 00:33:42,422
If I can, I want to avoid
her as much as possible.

446
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,720
Is it wrong for me to do that?

447
00:33:45,068 --> 00:33:47,067
I thought it was strange from the beginning.

448
00:33:47,703 --> 00:33:51,175
If it had anything to Ms. Jung Soo,
you became extremely sensitive.

449
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,600
- I told you I'm not!
- The connection you have with Jung Soo.

450
00:33:55,349 --> 00:33:56,939
Now that I know, I understand.

451
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,700
When we were in New York,
you were so lonely.

452
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:02,098
And I can understand now,
why you were so uneasy too.

453
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:05,181
What is it that you're
trying to say to me?

454
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,100
Ms. Jung Soo said for your mom's health
she won't try to see her.

455
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:13,468
So at least go to her and
offer her some comfort.

456
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,900
She's very worried and
curious about your mother.

457
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,500
Meet up with her and
give her some reassurance.

458
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,100
When did you get to know
Eun Jung Soo so well?

459
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,004
Have you ever waited
for someone for 17 years?

460
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:34,308
Of course not, to you that
would be pointless and silly.

461
00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:37,844
You couldn't possibly fathom it.

462
00:34:54,047 --> 00:34:55,323
Mrs. Woo.

463
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,600
What did you say?... Jung Soo.

464
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:03,824
Mrs. Woo... Mrs. Woo.

465
00:35:06,149 --> 00:35:07,319
Mrs. Woo?

466
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Are you awake?

467
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,100
Do you recognize me?

468
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,340
Uncle.

469
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,300
Here, eat.

470
00:35:41,763 --> 00:35:43,295
Should I put the rice
in the soup too?

471
00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:45,104
Sure.

472
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,900
Come on, dig in!

473
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,800
You don't even listen when I said
stay another day in the hospital.

474
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:06,565
Why would I check in at the
hospital when I'm perfectly fine?

475
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:09,216
The doctor said, all I need
is to eat and sleep well.

476
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,500
Well why aren't you sleeping
and eating well then?

477
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,600
You're too young to be
passing out.

478
00:36:25,344 --> 00:36:26,462
Uncle.

479
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Have we ever changed our
address or phone number at all?

480
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,900
Maybe our cell phones but not
our home address and phone number.

481
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,400
Mrs. Woo from the states
had tried to contact me.

482
00:36:55,285 --> 00:36:56,297
Then what should we do?

483
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:59,160
Should we go apologize and
ask them to change daughters?

484
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,200
You really have a way
with words you know that?

485
00:37:02,648 --> 00:37:05,073
Aren't you embarrassed to
even look up at the heavens?

486
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:06,987
Aren't you even scared of
getting hit by lightening.

487
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:08,080
No I'm not.

488
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:10,868
It's your fault that Kyung Hee and
I were forced into this situation

489
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,200
If anyone gets hit by lightening, it
will be you first. I'm not scared at all!

490
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,600
You were just as involved in this!
Where do you get off acting innocent?

491
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,000
Do you think by confessing now
it will justify what we've done?

492
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,300
The water has already been
spilled... and from now on...

493
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,900
It will continue to be like that!

494
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,400
One of these days, you, me and
Kyung Hee will regret this sorely!

495
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,900
You're right. I'm a wretch!

496
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,900
Five years ago, when I didn't stop
you and Kyung Hee... it's all my fault.

497
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:48,483
It's all my fault!

498
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,800
I've cleaned the
master bedroom already.

499
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,737
So you don't have to worry
about that room

500
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:59,100
Goodness! Master bedroom or not, that's
my job! You shouldn't worry about that!

501
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,900
- Then, I'll be on my way.
- Yes of course.

502
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:04,056
- Have a safe trip.
- I will.

503
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,300
Why is all this here wasting space?

504
00:39:34,653 --> 00:39:36,831
It must be true, before the
accident she was a painter.

505
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,832
If you ask me, they don't
look that great.

506
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:57,569
This... is Jung Soo.

507
00:40:16,638 --> 00:40:20,545
Besides that picture, what if
she remembers something else?

508
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,700
Her face hasn't changed at all.

509
00:40:24,385 --> 00:40:27,704
If she see's that picture and looks at
Jung Soo's face... she'll know right away.

510
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,303
Mrs. Kim.

511
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:43,893
Are you heading home?

512
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,800
What are you doing here
at this time of the day?

513
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:50,817
Oh, I just happened
to get off work early.

514
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,000
Please, go in then.

515
00:40:54,846 --> 00:40:55,891
Yes.

516
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:15,086
That was close!

517
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,100
Of all people, it had to be him.

518
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,700
- I'm home.
- Oh my gosh, you startled me!

519
00:41:22,454 --> 00:41:23,563
Did I scare you?

520
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,300
- What is that?
- You don't need know.

521
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:50,015
A picture?

522
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,200
What do you mean Mrs. Kim
took a picture out with her?

523
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,200
I don't know why,
but it was picture for sure.

524
00:41:58,857 --> 00:41:59,967
There's no way.

525
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,736
Are you missing something then?

526
00:42:26,106 --> 00:42:28,073
Seo Hyun. Seo Hyun's picture is missing.

527
00:42:30,906 --> 00:42:31,955
Seo Hyun's picture?

528
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,038
I drew a picture of Seo Hyun
when she was little.

529
00:42:34,614 --> 00:42:36,024
That's the only one missing.

530
00:42:36,102 --> 00:42:37,950
Why would Mrs. Kim take that?

531
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,597
Since it's a picture of Seo Hyun,

532
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,389
she probably just thought it was
a picture of her niece and took it.

533
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,808
But the strange part it is,
why would she hide that?

534
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:12,546
Study abroad?

535
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,016
You're going to pay for
her education overseas?

536
00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:21,212
I found some decent schools.

537
00:43:21,923 --> 00:43:24,467
Since I don't know what your
grades were like in high school.

538
00:43:24,844 --> 00:43:27,991
No matter where you go, you'll have
to start with English language classes.

539
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,509
At the minimum it takes you
five to six years.

540
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,400
Who are you?
Where did evil wench Kyung Hee go?

541
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,500
Wait, is this all a setup so
you can bully Jung Soo more?

542
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,200
I appreciate the offer but it's
too late for me to study abroad.

543
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:46,343
With what happened in Dong Dae Mun
and business being slow at the stalls.

544
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:50,067
I won't be able to study comfortably
knowing what the situation is like here.

545
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:53,772
Also, I could never burden you
like that.

546
00:43:55,188 --> 00:43:56,264
You should go now.

547
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,300
Jung Soo... don't worry about us,
just go.

548
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,800
And you... you're more than entitled
to take that offer from Kyung Hee.

549
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,600
Why am I entitled?

550
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,900
Pay it back! All you
have to do is pay it back.

551
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:23,153
When you come back from studying
abroad, just get a job and pay it back.

552
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:40,445
Why are you in such a hurry
to send her over abroad?

553
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,600
What am I suppose to do? What if she
decides to show up at my doorsteps?

554
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,500
First, I need her out the country.
Only then will I be able to breathe.

555
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:50,696
And when she does come
back from studying abroad?

556
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,100
She has no education and has
nothing to show for it right now.

557
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,400
But once she comes back she might
look and treat you differently.

558
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,800
How are you going to stand that?

559
00:45:03,096 --> 00:45:04,227
I don't know.

560
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,800
I don't have the tolerance
to think that far.

561
00:45:07,015 --> 00:45:10,223
Right now, all I can think about is
how I'm going to survive at this moment.

562
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,530
So you have to push her mom.

563
00:45:12,552 --> 00:45:14,953
Encourage so she can leave
here as soon as possible!

564
00:45:15,176 --> 00:45:16,327
I'll be going now.

565
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:28,743
I have know idea,
what any of this means.

566
00:45:28,764 --> 00:45:30,134
Are you going to go?

567
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,000
I'm not sure, it just
came out of nowhere.

568
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:38,200
Hey, don't you think Kyung Hee
is acting strange?

569
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:39,922
She would never offer
something like this.

570
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,784
If anything, she'll want to take
what's already in your mouth from you

571
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,400
I'm relieved to see she's
showing some remorse towards you.

572
00:45:51,443 --> 00:45:53,369
Don't say anything and just go.

573
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:13,954
There's action going on
here with Shin Hwa group!

574
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,800
The rumors about the stolen
design has been confirmed!

575
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:37,247
There are rumors spreading
about the stolen design sir.

576
00:47:37,275 --> 00:47:39,168
We're trying to figure out the
source of the rumors.

577
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,610
Tell the public relations
team to block everything.

578
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,100
Do whatever you must to stop
this from getting out to the press!

579
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,900
Yes sir.

580
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,100
Isn't President Do and
Director Choi inside?

581
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,600
We don't know, we have
no idea either!

582
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,800
Is it true there was a meeting
with an investigation committee?

583
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,258
We don't know.

584
00:48:07,825 --> 00:48:10,121
Are accusations a design was stolen
from a foreign company true?

585
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,000
- We're asking you a question!
- Say something!

586
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:33,510
[Shin Hwa Group, the best fashion company
in the country, tainted by stealing.]

587
00:48:43,496 --> 00:48:45,787
Thank you for calling,
this is a Luna representative?

588
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:48,221
Yes... no, it's not.

589
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:54,200
- Yes this is Luna team...
- Yes?... no, it is not true!

590
00:48:55,513 --> 00:48:58,814
- Yes, there will be an official report.
- Please check that again for me please.

591
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,500
Director Kang.

592
00:49:05,669 --> 00:49:08,189
Starting now, everything involved
with this issue is off limits.

593
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,299
Mail, messenger, cell phone...

594
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:14,800
Any topic related to the
incident is prohibited.

595
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,600
We ask for your cooperation until
this situation has been taken care of.

596
00:49:18,735 --> 00:49:19,911
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

597
00:49:30,383 --> 00:49:31,474
What is this?

598
00:49:32,042 --> 00:49:35,245
We can't even block one little lie!
We have reporters banging down our doors!

599
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,000
That is unacceptable!

600
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,600
Also, if there was a
scandal like that.

601
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:45,379
you should have resolved it properly.

602
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,800
Do you hear those reporters out there?

603
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:53,100
How long do you people plan on
just sitting there and be idle?

604
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,400
Does anyone have anything to say?

605
00:50:05,511 --> 00:50:06,626
What is it?

606
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Director Do is currently giving
an interview with the reporters.

607
00:50:10,252 --> 00:50:11,332
What?

608
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,200
I'll say this again. Luna brand
did not steal any design at all.

609
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,000
There have been false reports
given by the press and media.

610
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,500
Shin Hwa will be pressing full
charges against these allegations.

611
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,400
Thank you.

612
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,554
Come in.

613
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,500
We found out who supplied
the rumor sir.

614
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,300
The Luna team is one thing but the brand
hasn't even officially made it's debut.

615
00:50:55,535 --> 00:50:58,665
This selfish behavior of yours was a
little too reckless don't you think?

616
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,900
Yes, I agree my judgment was rash.

617
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,600
The news will only get bigger if the
company doesn't do anything about it.

618
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,500
- I couldn't let that happen.
- But denying it doesn't solve it either.

619
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,500
Min Ki, do you think Jung Soo
stole Red Milano's design?

620
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,700
Personally, no I don't.

621
00:51:17,517 --> 00:51:21,051
But nothing has been
confirmed one hundred percent.

622
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:25,268
We still can't confirm if Red Milano's
design was been copied or not?

623
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,200
Think about it, when designing a bag

624
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,600
The handle, material, logo... these
little things make a huge difference.

625
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:36,800
What idiot would copy the design without
taking those things into consideration?

626
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,300
So are you implying that
fax was manipulated then?

627
00:51:40,575 --> 00:51:42,655
I don't know how you received that fax.

628
00:51:42,992 --> 00:51:45,383
But from a common sense point
of view, it's hard to accept.

629
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,100
What are you trying to say?

630
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,000
Then are you saying
I made that fax up?

631
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,500
Let's just wait and see.

632
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,082
I'm sure we'll get a reaction
from Red Milano soon.

633
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,000
You're insulting me.

634
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:03,400
In case, the design was stolen
and Luna's image is tainted.

635
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,000
Also if Sae Kyung takes a blow
for this incident.

636
00:52:07,242 --> 00:52:09,646
You will have to take sole
responsibility for it Director Do.

637
00:52:14,735 --> 00:52:17,787
Director Do, The President is demands
to see you over an urgent matter.

638
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:38,327
Do you realize what you've just done?

639
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,200
Even if it is an emergency.

640
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,200
You should when to interfere or not.

641
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:49,022
We did not steal the design.

642
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,800
Didn't you receive documented
proof that design was stolen?

643
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:56,914
On what grounds are you
declaring that it wasn't stolen!

644
00:52:58,003 --> 00:52:59,732
I just know it's wasn't stolen.

645
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:01,574
President

646
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:06,600
Shin Hwa can't standby and let some
weak proof steer us away from the truth.

647
00:53:07,924 --> 00:53:09,048
Just wait a little bit.

648
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:13,036
It won't take long for
the truth to come out.

649
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:28,400
You knew that the fastest way to get
Red Milano's attention was the press.

650
00:53:28,534 --> 00:53:29,692
If that's the case...

651
00:53:30,329 --> 00:53:33,237
Then Red Milano will reveal the
truth about the stolen design.

652
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:40,900
Are you doing this for the young lady
that got fired over the stolen design?

653
00:53:41,466 --> 00:53:43,242
It's not solely for that reason.

654
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:49,000
I don't know why it's so important that
you clear her name of the false charges.

655
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:54,900
But to intentionally make Red Milano
look bad to boost our own image...

656
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,600
I'm really disappointed.

657
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:06,200
I don't know who will benefit
from this, but let's decide that later.

658
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,700
Strike and Reduce
Red Milano by pi.

659
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,600
Expand Shin Hwa group by pi.

660
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,700
Hopefully my calculation will work.

661
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,600
It seems Director Do's interview
has only added fuel to the fire sir.

662
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,460
At a sensitive time like this.

663
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,500
He should know staying out of
the limelight is the best solution.

664
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
If it's not someone from the
security department then who is it?

665
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,450
Are they still searching?

666
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,000
Red Milano released an official statement.

667
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:00,400
Red Milano's designs for the next season
has nothing to do with incident sir.

668
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:07,705
What is this?
Did Jin Hoo know all along?

669
00:56:10,552 --> 00:56:11,791
The design was never leaked!

670
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,600
Right on the mark! Okay!

671
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,400
Why did you get such expensive zippers?
We won't have anything left!

672
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:26,300
Oh right! The baseball game
should be on right now!

673
00:56:27,075 --> 00:56:29,264
I wonder which station
it will be broadcasted.

674
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,732
Shocking news, Shin Hwa groups allegations
of stealing designs has been revealed.

675
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,600
Jung Soo, are you watching this?

676
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:53,100
Red Milano has made an official statement
in regards to stealing their design.

677
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,000
Red Milano's fall designs for 2013.

678
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,900
Have never been leaked.

679
00:56:59,271 --> 00:57:01,739
That means your name has been
cleared of the false accusations right?

680
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,100
How dare they try to blame
this on an honest person!

681
00:57:06,637 --> 00:57:07,753
Hey! Hey!

682
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,300
Where is she going?
We still have a lot of work to do!

683
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,500
Come in.

684
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,400
What's with the serious look?

685
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:28,266
You knew from the very beginning
haven't you?

686
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,400
That the design wasn't stolen
and the fax you had was fake.

687
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,400
In fact, you planned that fax all along.

688
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,600
Stop talking nonsense.

689
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,718
Ms. Yoo Ah Rah.

690
00:57:37,966 --> 00:57:40,097
It was already confirmed
that she copied my design.

691
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:43,530
Why did you go so far as to accuse us
of stealing Red Milano's design instead?

692
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:46,872
Why would she agree to do something
that wasn't beneficial to her?

693
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:51,027
She was probably embarrassed to admit
that she stole from a part-time employee.

694
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,500
Just confess that you planned
it so you could kick me out.

695
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,700
Just be yourself!

696
00:58:00,165 --> 00:58:06,165
Don't delude yourself... I don't need
to play childish games to kick you out.

697
00:58:09,577 --> 00:58:10,703
What's going on?

698
00:58:11,901 --> 00:58:15,349
Director Kim, your mother is here in
the lobby. Where should I escort her?

699
00:58:19,228 --> 00:58:23,064
I'll be right down!... No! Actually
please take her to the seventh floor.

700
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:30,010
A guest is here, I'm sorry but
you're going to have to leave.

701
00:58:48,054 --> 00:58:49,415
- This way please.
- Yes.

702
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,300
Mom! I'm glad you're here.

703
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,100
Did I come at a busy time?

704
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:56,873
I was about to go home anyway,
your timing was perfect!

705
00:58:57,783 --> 00:58:59,774
- Thank you... let's go mom.
- Sure.

706
00:59:12,272 --> 00:59:13,827
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

707
00:59:14,323 --> 00:59:17,552
Your father will be home late. Should
we go somewhere fancy for dinner?

708
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:21,274
Sounds good. But you're
responsible if dad get's jealous.
