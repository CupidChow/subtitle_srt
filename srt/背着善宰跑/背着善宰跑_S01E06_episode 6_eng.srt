♫  I wished the rain would never end  ♫

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,670
 This is DJ Ham's Ten-Ten Friends. 

9
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,730
 I'm with Sun Jae here, headed to part two. 

10
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,150
 It's the rainy season. 

11
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,870
 And it's raining today as usual. 

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,630
 Which is why we're listening to "Rain Shower" by Eclipse. 

13
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,590
 Did you know? This song was 

14
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,080
 voted number one as the "Song that reminds you of your first love." 

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,000
Sun Jae, I just found out that you wrote this song before your debut.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,140
Yes.

17
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,990
Were you thinking of your first love when you were writing?

18
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,700
 Whoa, from your reaction, I think I'm right. 

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,900
Your movie that's about to come out is also about first love.

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,300
- Yes. 
 - Could you tell us about your first love?

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,250
I promise your secret is safe with me.

22
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,620
My first love?

23
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,340
♫   You came down like a rain shower one day  ♫

24
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,550
It was raining the day I met her.

25
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,740
 Mister! 

26
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,070
 Holding a yellow umbrella over me, she smiled at me. 

27
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,650
 I was so nervous that I couldn't breathe. 

28
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,200
As if I had forgotten how to breathe.

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,910
 - Oh, my! When was that?  
 - He used to say his fans were his first love.

30
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,680
 That... is a secret. 

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,830
Who could she be? I'm so curious.

32
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,970
   

33
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,440
 This isn't worth singing in front of all those people! 

34
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,520
 Why are you worried about me? 

35
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,770
Hey.

36
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,920
Come with me.

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,510
Have you seen Tae Sung?

38
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,690
Choi Ga Hyun dragged Im Sol somewhere!

39
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,630
Who is that?

40
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,220
- He's hot. 
 - He's so tall!

41
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,080
Hey!

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,870
Let Kim Tae Sung deal with it.

43
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,410
How can I just do nothing?

44
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,130
What if she's somewhere getting beat up?

45
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,560
What's going on out of the blue?

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,380
I told you you're not allowed to break Sol's heart.

47
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,230
- What? 
 - I heard you don't actually like me.

48
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,770
You just dated a random girl to get Choi Ga Hyun off your back.

49
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,800
And I happen to be that rando...?

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,050
- Who said that? 
 - Does that matter?

51
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,860
I didn't know you were that much of a shitface. I'm so disappointed.

52
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,240
I'm just glad that I found out first.

53
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,130
Anyway, you and I are over, dude! Do you understand?

54
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,870
I know you're just acting your age... but don't live your life like that.

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,300
Oh!

56
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,480
By the way...

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,400
even if I come back and say, "I don't remember breaking up,"

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,920
saying some nonsense and beg you to take me back, don't ever take me back.

59
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,600
Geez, seriously.

60
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,890
Yeah, this is for the best.

61
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,570
High school seniors should focus on studies, not romance.

62
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,180
 It's my number one treasure. 

63
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,110
 Here we go again. 

64
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,690
 Let's go. We're late. 

65
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,030
What?

66
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,730
- This is still... 
  - You can talk. 

67
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,710
 Wow, you walked right out of an advertisement. 

68
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,390
 You came alive. 

69
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,700
 Yeah, you are so funny. 

70
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,630
How do I delete this?

71
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,010
Sun Jae.

72
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,430
You told me to only think about myself. Right?

73
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,040
Can you break up with him?

74
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,850
If that's what I want, can you do that?

75
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,810
 I like you. 

76
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,170
Then break up with Kim Tae Sung.

77
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,530
 I... like you. 

78
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,980
Why?

79
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,250
 Why would Sun Jae like me? 

80
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,410
- Did you get beat up? 
  - No way! 

81
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,790
Did somebody hit you?

82
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,100
Im Sol!

83
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,400
♫  I think I do  ♫

84
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,690
 I like you. 

85
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,350
 I like you. 

86
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,970
Why do I keep thinking about it?

87
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,150
What's wrong with me?

88
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,860
What is wrong with you?

89
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,310
- What? 
 - Why are you yelling at the onions?

90
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,390
You've been crying this whole time. Is something wrong?

91
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,860
No. It's nothing.

92
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,370
My eyes hurt so much.

93
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,700
It's because you've been smashing the onions with your bare hands.

94
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,020
Put this in your mouth.

95
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,150
It still hurts.

96
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,350
Look at you ugly crying.

97
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,450
Stop peeling them and go get some makgeolli from the store.

98
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,490
I forgot to get some.

99
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,800
It hurts!

100
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,220
 I didn't know you were that much of a shit face. 

101
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,760
 I'm so disappointed. 

102
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,830
 Anyway, you and I are over, dude! 

103
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,770
 Do you understand? 

104
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,160
What are you thinking about instead of eating?

105
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,350
It's weird.

106
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,210
What is?

107
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,870
- In here? 
 - In there?

108
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,770
How do I say this?

109
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,590
Something... Something is...

110
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,890
- What? 
 - ...hurting.

111
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,580
- Your heart? 
 - My heart.

112
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,340
Hey, if you got hit in the head, your head should hurt. Why is your heart hurting?

113
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,150
I know, right?

114
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,560
I know. You're pissed that Im Sol kicked you to the curb.

115
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,810
You're all worked up and pissed, aren't you?

116
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,760
Hey, do you have a death wish?

117
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,250
You are so careless.

118
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,130
What right do you have to tell her to break up with him?

119
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,180
Then, should I just sit and watch her date a jerk like him?

120
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,150
You can't say that before properly telling her how you feel.

121
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,280
You're like a candle, you know.

122
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,310
You always blow it.

123
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,560
I'm going to go insane.

124
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,430
Hey, don't just sit there. Want to go on a blind date?

125
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,480
- Hey! Let's just go. 
 - No.

126
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,900
Let's go.

127
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,250
A blind date?

128
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,240
That dude...

129
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,540
- Hey! Hey! 
 - Is she on your mind?

130
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,720
Not at all.

131
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,050
Should I say yes?

132
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,150
- Don't do it. 
 - Sure, set it up.

133
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,250
Yeah, if you got dumped, just go out with someone new.

134
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,140
I'm going to go, too.

135
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,280
What's up with you?

136
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,990
Did you get dumped?

137
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,040
Are you making fun of me?

138
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,650
- Wow. 
 - Have fun on your blind date.

139
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,140
Fighting!

140
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,820
Wow, he got d-d-dumped?

141
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,100
Hey, Ryu Sun Jae!

142
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,460
Is he insane?

143
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,860
He's insane.

144
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,520
How much did you cry?

145
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,130
What?

146
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,300
Hold on. Ow!

147
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,000
Stop crying!

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,140
Why are you crying over that SOB?

149
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,720
What?

150
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,850
What are you talking about? This is because of onions.

151
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,230
Onions?

152
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,340
Kim Tae Sung is an onion?

153
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,660
What?

154
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,140
   

155
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,350
What's with the alcohol?

156
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,760
You're already trying to cope with alcohol?

157
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,620
Just lean on me instead!

158
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,590
Why do you keep drinking?

159
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,450
I mean, this isn't it, Sun Jae...

160
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,250
Give it to me.

161
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,840
What? Let go.

162
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,130
No! I can't see you fall apart.

163
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,790
I'm not going to fall apart. What the heck? Give it back!

164
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,360
No! No matter how hard, this isn't it.

165
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,190
Give it back, Sun Jae!

166
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,400
Give it back!

167
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,880
Are you going to keep doing this? Are you really?

168
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,420
Are you really?

169
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,090
What's going on with you?

170
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,720
What?

171
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,950
I'm going to pour this out.

172
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,140
What the heck? I was picking it up for my grandma!

173
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,520
That bastard...

174
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,280
Get your hands off her!

175
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,220
Crazy bastard, how dare you do that to my sister?

176
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,880
Sun Jae!

177
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,490
Brother! Are you crazy?

178
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,630
Sun Jae!

179
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,070
Shouldn't you have taken him to the hospital?

180
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,490
Hospital?

181
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,680
How could he be like that with a little bit of makgeolli?

182
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,590
Hey, he's kind of pathetic. Right?

183
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,240
It's your fault!

184
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,560
Makgeolli doesn't sit well with Sun Jae.

185
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,940
He'll pass out after just one sip.

186
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,790
Sun Jae must be burning up!

187
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,390
How can you sleep like you're dead?

188
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,740
 I like you. 

189
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,180
 I... like you. 

190
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,970
What was that?

191
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,770
Where am I?

192
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,610
This is crazy.

193
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,700
Sorry.

194
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,990
What? You...

195
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,860
Oh... that...

196
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,000
The fan. I wanted to turn the fan on for you.

197
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,850
Oh, no.

198
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,410
Why is the fan here again?

199
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,390
What? Did he fall off the bed?

200
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,790
Geez. Whatever.

201
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,420
Geez! Why is it so cold all of a sudden?

202
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,880
He's strong even when he's asleep.

203
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,380
I'm so cold.

204
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,050
Is he asleep?

205
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,310
What are you two doing?

206
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,870
Oh, I don't know why I'm sleeping here!

207
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,760
Maybe I sleepwalk.

208
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,790
You two, seriously...

209
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,540
Come here! Come here!

210
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,630
Hey, let go!

211
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,820
You bastard, how dare you do that move on me?

212
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,840
Why aren't you coming in?

213
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,700
Did you get a confession of love or something?

214
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,960
How did you know?

215
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,730
Really? From whom?

216
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,910
Wait, from Ryu Sun Jae?

217
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,300
How can Sun Jae like me?

218
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,120
Why does such a dazzling boy like me?

219
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,940
Girl, you seduced him.

220
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,340
I did? When?

221
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,480
Think about it.

222
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,020
You broke into the swim arena and told him you loved him.

223
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,220
You kept skipping study sessions to follow him around.

224
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,480
You went to his match to cheer for him.

225
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,510
When he got shoulder surgery, you brought him food every day.

226
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,580
That's because I had a reason to.

227
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,970
A reason? Please.

228
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,370
Then why did you crawl into his room when he was asleep?

229
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,000
You know he likes you.

230
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,210
You're an old vixen.

231
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,930
I'm not a vixen.

232
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,980
I am older than nineteen, though.

233
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,270
I think he's been so into sports and single his whole life.

234
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,480
Guys like that have a weakness for girls who approach them like bulldozers.

235
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,600
Really?

236
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,080
Anyway, I can't stand people who dangle it in front of you.

237
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,290
Whether I'm pooping or not, why take your clothes off?

238
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,650
If you don't want to give me your heart, don't dangle it in front of me.

239
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,500
Poop? Who did?

240
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,120
What?

241
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,590
Don't get distracted. Come inside and study.

242
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,440
 Did I just confuse him when he did nothing? 

243
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,030
So loud.

244
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,500
Sun Jae!

245
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,160
Oh!

246
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,120
What are you doing here?

247
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,770
- I came to see you. 
  - Don't come on too strong 

248
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,680
 right after her breakup. 

249
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,230
 Don't be obvious. Don't be clingy. Be cool. 

250
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,950
Not.

251
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,220
I'm at the library to study.

252
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,280
Oh, okay.

253
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,550
Studying. Yes.

254
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,360
Wow, I got the seat next to you.

255
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,850
What a coincidence.

256
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,960
R-Right.

257
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,390
Then... good luck studying.

258
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,150
Oh, okay.

259
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,700
Y-Y-You, too. Good luck.

260
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,790
 Those two are here to romance each other. 

261
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,640
 - Lee Seung Yuop bats...  
 - Hit! Hit!

262
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,440
 A grounder for second base. 

263
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,770
 - To the second base.  
 - Is it a double play?

264
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,130
Right. She lost her phone.

265
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,570
Oh, I heard that Choi Ga Hyun is still bullying Im Sol.

266
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,100
She keeps dragging her around.

267
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,810
What? Why are you just telling me this?

268
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,090
Because I just heard it today.

269
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,530
Dude.

270
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,630
You bastard.

271
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,760
   

272
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,040
   

273
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,810
   

274
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,880
How are you going to go to college?

275
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,450
You got level 8s on everything.

276
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,930
How many levels are there?

277
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,170
Is that really low?

278
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,630
It's not just low. It's on the floor.

279
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,820
I'm applying with special skills, so I just need to meet the minimum.

280
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,150
What is the minimum?

281
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,910
Level 5.

282
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,170
You're level 8.

283
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,750
We're already at the 8th inning.

284
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,430
Can they start scoring?

285
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,190
You got 8s on everything.

286
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,500
8, 8, 8, 8.

287
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,970
Wow, he looks good.

288
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,460
Lee Seung Yuop is playing very well.

289
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,800
But the collegiate exams are coming up soon. Don't you think this is a bit too much?

290
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,000
- You said you'd help me. 
 - I did.

291
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,870
But it's been a while since I studied for the collegiate exam, too.

292
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,440
I can't even remember the quadratic formula. What do I do?

293
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,430
Spit it out!

294
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,900
Hurry! You'll burn your mouth!

295
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,620
Isn't it hot?

296
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,740
I'm okay.

297
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,400
Score.

298
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,940
What? What do you mean you scored?

299
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,470
Look! He scored.

300
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,170
Lee Seung Yuop! Lee Seung Yuop! Lee Seung Yuop!

301
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,290
He scored twice. Wow.

302
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,150
Lee Seung Yuop!

303
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,870
 Republic of Korea! 

304
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,550
 Republic of Korea! 

305
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,360
Oh? Is it going to rain?

306
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,540
I have an umbrella. I brought it with me today.

307
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,430
Wait! Where is it? The library?

308
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:39,430
I might have left it at the restaurant.

309
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,890
Where are you going? You're going to get soaked.

310
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,590
 I don't know who's dangling it in front of whom. 

311
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,710
You almost broke your skull.

312
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,150
 It's working, seriously. 

313
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,670
Huh? We must have won the baseball game.

314
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,260
I think we did.

315
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,700
Wow, I didn't think we would make it to the finals.

316
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,700
What are you thinking about?

317
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,080
What? Nothing.

318
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,410
 Is she still heartbroken over Kim Tae Sung? 

319
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,640
Should we go... cheer on the streets for the finals?

320
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,180
- On the streets? 
 - Yeah.

321
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,500
 I can't stand people who dangle it in front of others. 

322
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,330
The exams are soon! We need to be studying.

323
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,470
Hey! How can you study all day, every day, in that cramped room?

324
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,070
You need to clear your head and get fresh air once in a while.

325
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,440
It's just one day. Can you go?

326
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,200
You know the English vocabulary book you were looking at?

327
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,320
- If you memorize that whole thing. 
 - The whole thing?

328
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,210
Wow, so you don't want to go.

329
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:24,120
So, focus on studying.

330
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,580
What if I memorize the whole thing?

331
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,520
You said you would go if I did.

332
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,810
I'll memorize the whole thing in a day.

333
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,710
Let's go.

334
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,090
What the heck is he doing?

335
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,420
What is wrong with him?

336
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,290
It stopped raining. Why are you sharing an umbrella?

337
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,450
Standing so close?

338
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,220
- Did you go somewhere together? 
 - None of your business.

339
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,740
What are you doing here?

340
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,170
We need to talk.

341
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,500
- I don't have anything to say to you. 
 - I do.

342
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,550
You just listen.

343
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,270
- She said no. 
 - Why don't you back off?

344
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,590
You butted in first.

345
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,040
Oh, should I have turned on my blinkers?

346
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,960
Okay, okay.

347
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,520
Let's hear what you have to say.

348
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,170
Wait.

349
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,260
What?

350
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,640
 Be cool. 

351
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,360
Good luck with the talk.

352
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,590
See you tomorrow.

353
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,340
Bye.

354
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,990
Night.

355
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,100
 Stop. Just forget about me. 

356
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,280
 What does that mean? 

357
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,820
 - Just forget me! 
 - How do I do that? 

358
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,740
 You're crazy. 

359
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,320
 Yes, Kim Tae Sung is crazy. 

360
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,620
 He is a criminal. 

361
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,630
 His crime was loving one woman to death! 

362
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,780
 Tae Sung! 

363
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,370
 If loving someone was a crime, I would be sentenced to life. 

364
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,320
 This is crazy. 

365
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,420
 Im Sol! 

366
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,860
 You are my star! 

367
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,300
No way.

368
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,990
What do you want to say?

369
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,580
I don't have a lot of time, so spit it out.

370
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,560
I heard Choi Ga Hyun was bullying you.

371
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,120
I didn't know.

372
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,640
Did you get hurt?

373
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,890
You cried a lot. Right?

374
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,210
No! I didn't cry at all.

375
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,670
You didn't? Why not?

376
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,330
I was used. Do I need to cry over that?

377
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,880
No, I guess.

378
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,980
But for some reason, I'm sad.

379
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,300
- Why are you sad? 
 - Exactly.

380
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,630
Anyway, I'm sorry.

381
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,420
That's what I came here to say.

382
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,010
I'm really sorry.

383
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,990
I guess you're not a total shitface.

384
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,780
Also, I wasn't using you.

385
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,490
- Then why did you ask me out? 
 - You said you liked me.

386
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,920
Do you date everyone who says they like you?

387
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,760
- No. 
 - Are you talking or farting?

388
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,110
- Huh? 
 - What?

389
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,760
Did...

390
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,320
Did I like you?

391
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,160
- What the... 
 - That's right.

392
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,400
- I did like you. 
 - Wow!

393
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,310
Wow, y-y-you are ridiculous.

394
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,040
How can this be?

395
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,750
I think I liked you a lot.

396
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,060
No thanks.

397
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:03,190
If you came to give that back, hand it back and go.

398
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,330
It's not like that.

399
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,840
Then what? Are you going to throw it out? Give it to me.

400
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,830
Let go! I said it's not like that!

401
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,320
It's my favorite stuffed animal. I cuddle with it all the time.

402
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,060
What nonsense! Give it back!

403
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,240
It's mine!

404
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,420
 Tae Sung! Our love is forever! 

405
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,860
 Tae Sung! Our love is forever! 

406
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,780
Should we just be together forever?

407
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,550
No!

408
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:37,800
 The biggest villain of my life is me in the past. 

409
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,010
Huh?

410
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,470
What's wrong?

411
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,060
My legs are cramping.

412
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,750
Huh?

413
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:59,560
Goodness, you are such a good son.

414
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,620
Bending those long legs to help me pull out the weeds.

415
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,570
Gosh, you are all grown up now.

416
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,060
My son, you know what?

417
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,890
Plants can hear us.

418
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,820
So, if you caress them like this every day,

419
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,490
and tell them, "You're so pretty," and say nice things,

420
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,950
- they grow much faster. 
  - Where is she? What are they talking about? 

421
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,240
So, Sun Jae...

422
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,170
I'll only say nice things to you.

423
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,560
Goodness, my son...

424
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,470
You lowlife bastard!

425
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,160
Do those look like weeds to you?

426
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,480
Why are you pulling out healthy peppers and shit?

427
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,280
Go away! Go away!

428
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,290
Are you helping or screwing me over, you little turd!

429
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,090
Gosh, my poor little peppers, so sorry...

430
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,180
Goodness, my babies...

431
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,800
- Dad! 
 - My goodness...

432
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,590
You were born with the wrong older brother.

433
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,790
 Stop getting into fights. 

434
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,310
 You should graduate from high school, at least. 

435
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,210
 You'll regret it later. 

436
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,960
 Is it good? 

437
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,710
Forever, my ass.

438
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,260
Mom, are you going somewhere?

439
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,540
I told you.

440
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,520
I'm going to Jeju Island with my friends.

441
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,000
- Jeju? 
 - Yes.

442
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,280
 Her trip with that guy must have been today. 

443
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,360
 You're leaving your high school senior daughter behind to go to Jeju Island? 

444
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,730
 It's with the guy who drove you home last time. Right? 

445
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,960
 Who cares? 

446
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,250
 Plus, you don't get a crown for being a high school senior! 

447
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,990
 I busted my ass to raise you guys alone. Am I not allowed to go on vacation? 

448
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,020
 I feel bad for Dad. That's why! 

449
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,510
 He was worried about you until the day he died. 

450
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,330
 He couldn't even rest in peace. I feel so sorry for him! 

451
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,450
Hand wash your uniform shirts every day.

452
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,200
Don't just throw them in the hamper.

453
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,490
Don't ask for new ones when other colored clothes bleed on them.

454
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,090
Okay, I got it.

455
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,770
And soak your dishes after you eat.

456
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,810
You always leave them with food still stuck on them

457
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,680
and we get maggots and fruit flies. So disgusting.

458
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,120
And tell your brother.

459
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,720
If he drinks and falls asleep on the streets

460
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,670
and gets caught, I'm disowning him.

461
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,790
Lock your doors, and don't sleep with your windows open, even if it's hot.

462
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,360
Okay, I said I got it!

463
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,290
Mom, we're not toddlers, you know.

464
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,540
You two might be older, but you're still clueless.

465
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,660
It's because you keep coddling us.

466
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,210
If you're not here, we'll do even better.

467
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,430
Goodness, really?

468
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,470
You'll be fine without your mom, huh?

469
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,540
Of course!

470
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,520
See? You raise a child all for nothing.

471
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,050
Did you just realize that?

472
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,230
They say when you're old and sick, turn to your husband, not your kids.

473
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,640
So, find a new husband soon.

474
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,960
Hey, when I get old and sick, I should die. Not find a husband.

475
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,910
Enough! Stop spewing nonsense and go inside.

476
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,670
I'll be back. Go study!

477
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,030
Have fun, Mom!

478
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,500
So, what you're saying is, not today, not tomorrow,

479
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,620
but on September 1st, something may or may not happen to you.

480
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,440
You want to tell me what that is, but you can't.

481
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,060
Yes. Exactly.

482
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,100
Student, if you think something's going to happen at the reservoir that day,

483
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,790
just don't go near it. Right?

484
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,230
That's true, but...

485
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,380
Okay, okay.

486
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:03,300
Okay. Have one of these and get home safe. Okay?

487
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,700
Okay.

488
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,520
Go home.

489
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,250
Something might happen, so don't come back!

490
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,560
She's normal looking for a crazy girl.

491
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,390
Hello, Detective Kim.

492
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,450
What do you mean? Something might happen?

493
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,650
Oh, it's just crazy talk.

494
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,940
What brings you here?

495
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,250
You know the night patrol logs from last month?

496
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,940
Can I see them organized by the hour?

497
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,960
 Lee Seung Yuop hits the ball high... 

498
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,860
 - It gets above the right fielder!  
 - We won, we won.

499
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,590
 It flies over the fence! 

500
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,570
Hello?

501
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,530
Hello?

502
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,480
If you called, you need to say something.

503
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,360
 Excuse me. 

504
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,910
 I picked up a cell phone. 

505
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:58,130
Oh, yes! That belongs to my granddaughter.

506
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,340
 You must have found it. 

507
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,630
How should I get this to you?

508
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,580
 I'll come pick it up from you. 

509
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,400
 Where do I go? 

510
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,680
Oh, no! I'm in the countryside.

511
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,800
 Oh, then, could you mail it to us? 

512
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,700
 I'll give you the address. 

513
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,480
Should I?

514
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,960
   

515
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,820
Study?

516
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:40,490
♫  That night, when everyone's gathered  ♫

517
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:48,840
♫  When you're not sitting in your usual seat  ♫

518
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,930
When did you get here?

519
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:55,270
♫  When I catch your scent, the one that I liked so much  ♫

520
00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:02,400
♫  I turn my head, wondering if it's you  ♫

521
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,580
♫  When I find myself in your neighborhood  ♫

522
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:16,730
♫  When I keep thinking of your face  ♫

523
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,410
♫  I think I do, I think I like you  ♫

524
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,790
 It's my number one treasure. 

525
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:31,900
♫  Day by day, all I think of is you  ♫

526
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:39,400
♫  I want to see you, I can do better  ♫

527
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:46,410
♫  I want to be brave and pick up the phone, but I can't  ♫

528
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,230
♫  Like a fool  ♫

529
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,250
 I like you. 

530
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,480
 I... like you. 

531
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,110
"My friend is h-hardworking."

532
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,430
Hardworking. Hardworking.

533
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,450
This is crazy!

534
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,090
What is?

535
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,760
N-No, nothing.

536
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,500
But... why is your face so red?

537
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,100
Huh?

538
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,830
B-Because it's hot.

539
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,370
Hey.

540
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,140
- Do you know? 
 - What?

541
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,770
Have you noticed?

542
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,610
W-What?

543
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,720
I...

544
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,010
- I memorized everything. 
 - What?

545
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:13,110
You said we'd go cheer for the baseball finals if I memorized all the vocabulary.

546
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,640
If you don't believe me, test me.

547
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,450
Oh, no, it's not that...

548
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,750
Then, you're coming with me tomorrow.

549
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,870
 I have to tell you something. 

550
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,230
 Republic of Korea! 

551
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,570
 Republic of Korea! 

552
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:39,300
We can feel the passion of the citizens who have gathered to cheer for the national team.

553
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,370
8 games, 8 wins.

554
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:44,160
Our national team is writing their own legend with every match.

555
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,730
Can our national team take us all the way to the gold?

556
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,120
- Im Sol! Over here! 
  - Republic of Korea! 

557
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,070
 Republic of Korea! 

558
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,250
 Republic of Korea! 

559
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,050
Excuse me.

560
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,710
Excuse me...

561
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,050
Excuse me.

562
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,400
Excuse me.

563
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,000
You're early!

564
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,930
Yeah, I wanted a good spot.

565
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,270
I think we'll get a good view here.

566
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,920
Really? Weren't you hot?

567
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:22,760
♫  Will it be embarrassing to say, "I miss you"?  ♫

568
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,280
That feels amazing.

569
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,610
I was burning up.

570
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,040
♫  Even if I close my eyes  ♫

571
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,320
♫  I really miss you  ♫

572
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,560
Right. It's really hot.

573
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,840
♫  I can't hide my feelings, can you hear it?  ♫

574
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:46,190
♫  Could I tell you how I feel inside?  ♫

575
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:52,130
♫  Didn't you feel it a little, too?  ♫

576
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,350
That helps, right?

577
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:58,200
♫  These are my true feelings  ♫

578
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,180
♫  I hope you know, I hope you see me  ♫

579
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,000
Hyun Joo is here!

580
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,790
Is that you?

581
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,850
Oh, you're here too!

582
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,510
Where's Sol? Is she out?

583
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,790
You'd know better than me.

584
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,330
You brought chicken, Hyun Joo!

585
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,940
I brought it to share with Sol while we watch baseball.

586
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,460
If Sol's not here, I'm leaving.

587
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,480
Don't go.

588
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,080
Or if you do...

589
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,280
leave the chicken with me.

590
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:59,940
 This is the men's baseball finals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 

591
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,780
Octopus?

592
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,140
Oh, this?

593
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,870
 Stop! Stop! 

594
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,740
 How many times will you play Choi Min Sik? How boring. 

595
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,210
That's why you never get it.

596
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:16,760
Just because you dress up like him doesn't mean you can move the people the same way.

597
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,590
You need authenticity in your acting.

598
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,860
Maybe you're right.

599
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,280
I get rejected at every audition, so I wanted to stand out.

600
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,400
But I think you're right.

601
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,250
 Why is he pulling at my heartstrings? I want to protect him. 

602
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,680
 Get it together! You can't fall for this! 

603
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,100
Oh! Hit it! Good! Damn...

604
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,770
Hey, why aren't you eating?

605
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,790
Here. Have some.

606
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:54,090
 He's unexpectedly sweet. I'm getting butterflies in my stomach... 

607
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:57,790
 Get it together! Don't you dare fall for this! 

608
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,200
Hyun Joo, look.

609
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,340
Clean!

610
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,460
If someone looks at the bone,

611
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,230
they shouldn't be able to tell if you had fried or sauced.

612
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,200
 Why am I falling for lines like that? 

613
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,150
 He's Im Geum. The kind of person I hate the most. 

614
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:27,920
 Gosh, but he's still cute! 

615
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,500
 No. I can't fall for this. 

616
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,890
 - Lee Seung Yuop hits to the left...  
  - I can never fall for him. 

617
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:36,710
 I can't. Never... 

618
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,600
 Is it going to make it? Is it? 

619
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,730
 - No, no! 
 - It's gone! 

620
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:46,070
 Yes! He did it! 

621
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,510
 Lee Seung Yuop, a home run! 

622
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:52,120
Hyun Joo!

623
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,460
We can win! We can win!

624
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,130
Lee Seung Yuop hit a home run! This is crazy!

625
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,580
I fell for it.

626
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,910
Hi, sweetie baby.

627
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,220
Geum is watching baseball right now.

628
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,490
I thought you were busy, Princess Chae Won.

629
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,020
Yeah.

630
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,060
Yeah, see you tomorrow. Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.

631
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:28,480
- What? 
 - Do you have a girlfriend?

632
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,870
Yeah.

633
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,730
Why?

634
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,630
Am I not allowed to have a girlfriend?

635
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:36,110
No!

636
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,730
Why are you just telling me this now?

637
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,570
Hey! Where are you going?

638
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,130
 The score is 2:1! 

639
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,600
   

640
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:13,040
Lee Yong Gyu! Lee Yong Gyu!

641
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,390
 Lee Young Gyu scores a double! 

642
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,720
 Lee Yong Gyu did it! 

643
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,670
 - Lee Yong Gyu! Lee Yong Gyu! 
 - It's 3:1! 

644
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,230
Hey, how busy can your dad be?

645
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,150
His son is in the hospital, and he hasn't even shown up.

646
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,160
 Korea is leading by a point... 

647
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,650
 The streets are hot with passionate fans who are gathered. 

648
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,930
Hey, that was Im Sol and Ryu Sun Jae. Right?

649
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:50,090
Wow, I guess she's educated and smart.

650
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,930
She got it together to date a wholesome guy.

651
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,300
Right?

652
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,160
Get out. Go home.

653
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,570
Take this and go home.

654
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,150
- I'm still eating! 
 - Get out.

655
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,770
- What's wrong? 
 - Get out, you bastard.

656
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:05,540
- What's wrong with you? 
 - Hurry up, dude.

657
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,350
I'm out!

658
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,320
The game isn't even over yet.

659
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,900
 We are at the end of the 9th inning with one out... 

660
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,910
 Guriel at the plate, Jung Dae Hyun is the pitcher... 

661
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,510
 No ball, two strikes! 

662
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,350
Oh, is it a double?

663
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,230
 It's a gold for South Korea 

664
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,910
 A gold medal! 

665
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:30,760
 Republic of Korea wins the gold medal! 

666
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,830
 A gold for South Korea's baseball team! 

667
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:44,600
   

668
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:53,570
♫  All those hidden seasons  ♫

669
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:59,680
♫  Are calling us back again  ♫

670
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:03,940
♫  Wherever I am... ♫

671
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,030
 Republic of Korea! 

672
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:10,020
 Republic of Korea! 

673
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,470
- Republic of Korea! 
 - I have to tell you something!

674
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,350
What? What did you say?

675
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:19,600
 - A gold medal for Korea! 
 - Republic of Korea! 

676
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:26,560
♫  I've been waiting for this for so long  ♫

677
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:32,120
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

678
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,490
 Republic of Korea! 

679
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:40,910
♫  All my life, it's you  ♫

680
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:42,520
What?

681
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,220
What's going on?

682
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,760
I was going to wait a bit longer.

683
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,160
- But I don't think I can hide it anymore. 
 - What?

684
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:56,550
You know what I used to hate the most?

685
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,040
Rain.

686
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:05,570
After being in a swimming pool all day long,

687
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:11,330
going outside, getting wet again in the rain pissed me off.

688
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:16,780
But... it rained the day I met you.

689
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,930
I liked the rain that day.

690
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,790
I hated it all my life, but I liked it overnight.

691
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,450
I thought it would just be that day.

692
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,020
But no.

693
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,970
I still don't hate it.

694
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,540
I don't think I'll hate it again.

695
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,570
Rain... or you.

696
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,560
Sol.

697
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:56,630
I... like you a lot.

698
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:13,760
Y-You don't need to answer right away.

699
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,590
Sun Jae!

700
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,330
I...

701
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,390
Take it.

702
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,810
Maybe it's urgent.

703
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:42,390
Hello?

704
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:43,990
 It's Kim Tae Sung. 

705
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,800
 Are you with Im Sol right now? 

706
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,210
Why are you calling me?

707
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,120
- Let's go. 
 - What?

708
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,410
What's going on?

709
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,520
Your mom.

710
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,600
She's in the hospital.

711
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,080
What?

712
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,520
Doctor, a patient named Park Bok Soon—

713
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,470
Are you Sol?

714
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:25,050
I almost didn't recognize you.

715
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:28,900
I saw you a few times when you were little. Don't you remember me?

716
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:41,030
 We did a biopsy during an endoscopy, and it wasn't good. 

717
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:45,260
 But thankfully, we caught it early. She should be okay after surgery. 

718
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,310
I had no idea.

719
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,070
Why did I not know?

720
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,910
 If you're not here, we'll do even better. 

721
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,900
 Mom, we're not toddlers, you know. 

722
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,010
 You'll be fine without your mom, huh? 

723
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,290
 Of course! 

724
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,480
I told her I'd be fine without her.

725
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,320
I didn't know she was sick.

726
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,330
It's not your fault.

727
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,540
Don't think like that.

728
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,630
Thank you for calling.

729
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,070
If you hadn't, my mom would've gone into surgery by herself.

730
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:46,790
- How is she doing? 
 - She just went into the OR.

731
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,190
She's going to be okay.

732
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:52,100
But how did you break your arm?

733
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,060
- You didn't get into a fight, did you? 
 - No.

734
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:58,450
I don't know what kind of person you think I am.

735
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,790
That's a relief.

736
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:15,410
Tae Sung, I don't know what kind of scars you have...

737
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:17,750
or what kind of pain you're in,

738
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:21,290
but I don't want you to have regrets later.

739
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:24,960
I want you to get through this time in your life.

740
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,640
That's the one thing I want to say to my first love.

741
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,750
So please, try to change your destiny, too.

742
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,570
I'll be earnestly praying for you.

743
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,570
I'll be going now.

744
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,150
Why is she acting like that?

745
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,330
Like it's the last time I'll see her.

746
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:57,560
The painkiller is going in now. If it hurts a lot, let me know.

747
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,750
Thank you.

748
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:08,110
- Where's Grandma? 
 - I told Brother to take her home.

749
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:10,300
She should get some rest and come back tomorrow.

750
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,800
- Don't worry and sleep, Mom. 
 - Good job.

751
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,760
Why did you come back?

752
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,450
Did the surgery

753
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,360
go well?

754
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,400
Did you get any sleep?

755
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,720
You look tired.

756
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,640
You're going to pass out at this rate.

757
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,520
I'm okay.

758
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,840
You haven't eaten, right? Want me to bring you something?

759
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,540
I'm fine, really.

760
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,450
You can go.

761
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:06,680
Okay. Then I'll watch you go in and come back tomorrow.

762
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,670
No.

763
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,450
Don't come.

764
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:17,700
Sun Jae, I can't accept your feelings.

765
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,330
I mean...

766
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:27,730
I wasn't expecting anything. Don't be so cold.

767
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,470
You're confused because I gave you mixed signals.

768
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:33,870
- It's not like that. 
 - I'm sorry I hung around you and led you on.

769
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:36,340
- I said it's not like that. 
 - You know...

770
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,600
If you continue like this, I'll feel uncomfortable and pressured.

771
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,660
So, just

772
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,560
stop liking me.

773
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:52,460
♫  Your low and deep voice  ♫

774
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,100
 I forgot to ask you the most important question. How do you feel? 

775
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,880
 What does it matter? I'm leaving soon anyway. 

776
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,490
 Where are you going? 

777
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,550
 Whether you go to a rural school or go abroad, 

778
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,180
 besides that, what does your heart want? 

779
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:15,260
♫  I would embrace you right there and then  ♫

780
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:22,120
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

781
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:30,220
♫  I want to go back to our time together  ♫

782
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:37,510
♫  No matter what happens, I will remember you  ♫

783
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:46,880
♫  Your name is painted deep in my heart  ♫

784
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:58,290
   

785
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:02,520
My dear sister, could you bring my phone charger?

786
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,700
- I forgot... 
 - At this hour?

787
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:07,520
Mom will be discharged tomorrow. Just stick it out for the night.

788
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,490
I auditioned for a movie, and they said they would call me. Huh? Please!

789
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:15,770
You skipped the first day of school and are staying home. Can't you do it for me?

790
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:19,230
I'm sorry, Brother. I really can't go anywhere today.

791
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:23,100
So, come get it or buy it somewhere nearby. Figure it out.

792
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:33,570
Yes. I just need to stick it out for the next two hours.

793
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:36,720
I'll be fine. Nothing will happen.

794
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:33,730
 Your umbrella is at the library. 

795
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:37,370
 Are you not coming anymore because of me? 

796
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:40,170
 I won't make you uncomfortable. Can we talk in person? 

797
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:42,060
 Just for a minute. 

798
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,380
 I'll wait for you at the playground. 

799
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:55,700
 I'm sorry. I can't go outside today. 

800
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,620
 Don't wait for me. 

801
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,390
   

802
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:28,600
Where is he going? Didn't he see my reply?

803
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:12,590
He's not waiting for me, is he?

804
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:02,030
 Did you ever see me before the practice game? 

805
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:06,800
 I did. You thought I was the package delivery guy. 

806
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,290
 I don't think you remember. 

807
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,720
 Mister! 

808
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,990
 It was raining the day I met her. 

809
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:21,900
 Holding a yellow umbrella over me, she smiled at me. 

810
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:25,650
 I was so nervous that I couldn't breathe. 

811
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,100
 No way... 

812
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,880
 It rained the day I met you. 

813
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,310
 I liked the rain that day. 

814
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:34,120
 Sol. 

815
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,050
 I... 

816
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,900
 like you a lot. 

817
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,100
