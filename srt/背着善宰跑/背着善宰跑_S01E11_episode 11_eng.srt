3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,470
   

4
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,120
   

5
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,570
♫  In a quiet alley—  ♫

6
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,580
Isn't that Sun Jae?

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,010
Oh, sorry, sorry...

8
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,090
That's my mom's voice.

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,220
I meant to quietly pass by.

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,520
Why do something so good under a bright-as-day streetlamp?

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,640
You have a new girlfriend?

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,210
- Hello. 
 - Must be nice.

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,490
Finish up, finish up.

14
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,170
I didn't see anything. Nothing.

16
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,210
Goodness, how can Sun Jae do that right in front of his house?

17
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,510
So embarrassing. Gosh...

18
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,530
I knew it when he was renting an adult movie in high school.

19
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,620
Should've known.

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,020
   

21
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,330
What do I do now?

22
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,930
Sun Jae, don't worry.

23
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,770
I'm going to protect you.

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,940
Not that.

25
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,290
What if your mom thinks I'm a bad guy?

26
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,520
- What? 
 - Should I just tell her it's you?

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,480
Maybe she'll get upset.

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,890
Is that what you're worried about? Is that important?

29
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,090
Very important.

30
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,530
How can you smile right now?

31
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,160
Why? Can a person who has found they're going to die in 15 years not smile?

32
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,800
How can you say that so easily?

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,190
I'm afraid to say it because it might become a reality.

34
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,460
I can't even put it past my lips, and you just...

35
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,750
I won't die so quickly.

36
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,470
No matter what happens to me from now on,

37
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,440
don't ever think it's because of you.

38
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,110
This is the last time?

39
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,400
When are you going back?

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,090
I don't know.

41
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,350
I think I have about a month left.

42
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,570
Can't you just stay?

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,860
I guess you have to go.

44
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,970
Then...

45
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,510
when you leave in a month, meet me there (in the future).

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,510
I'll run to you.

47
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,780
To 2023, where you are.

48
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,710
It must be exhausting to be on a plane for more than 10 hours.

49
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,990
I booked business class, so he should be okay.

50
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,700
I've never been in business class in my 50 years.

51
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,730
The plane food should be good. Right?

52
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,340
Why? He's a grown man.

53
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,400
Are you so sad about not seeing him for a few months?

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,830
He might be grown, but he's still a kid.

55
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,620
Except for a few out-of-town training sessions,

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,980
I haven't been apart from him this long in 20 years.

57
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,770
I raised him so preciously because I never wanted him to feel the lack of a mom.

58
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,150
When he gets a wife, that will all be for nothing.

59
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:17,550
♫  I feel this strange feeling, my heart is beating fast  ♫

60
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,150
♫  I'm dizzy, I'm just in it  ♫

61
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,680
♫  Will it be embarrassing to say, "I miss you?"  ♫

62
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,250
 Are you asleep? 
   

63
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,880
♫  Will it be embarrassing to say, "I miss you?"  ♫

64
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,190
    
 ♫  Here I go thinking by myself again  ♫

65
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:36,380
     
 ♫  No matter how I try to look away, I'm feeling ashamed  ♫

66
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,220
    
 ♫  I can't hide my feelings, can you hear it?  ♫

67
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,850
    
 ♫  I can't hide my feelings, can you hear it?  ♫

68
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,180
♫  Can I tell you how I feel  ♫

69
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,020
♫  Didn't you feel it a little too?  ♫

70
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,210
    
 ♫  My heart is beating for you  ♫

71
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,440
♫  These are my true feelings  ♫

72
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,060
   

73
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,690
♫  I wish for you to know, my love  ♫ 
 ♫  I wish for you to welcome that  ♫

74
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:20,020
I need to take good care of myself for the next 15 years.

75
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,410
Baek In Hyuk must have left something behind.

76
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,580
Found it.

77
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,040
 Not yet. Why aren't you asleep? 

78
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,710
She is crazy cute.

79
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,130
   

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,150
My charger is in my suitcase.

81
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:32,350
The house feels empty without my son.

82
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,740
Good god, I forgot to close the door.

83
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,590
A big house can be so scary...

84
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,220
Gosh, I don't know. Let's wash up and go to bed.

85
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,180
What was that?

86
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,030
What...

87
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,370
Who are you?

88
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,640
Dad!

89
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,510
Dad! Dad!

90
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,830
W-What do I do?

91
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:04,110
Dad!

92
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,540
 In front of your house? 

93
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,330
Yes. I'm not completely certain, but...

94
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,610
it was the same truck that Kim Young Soo was driving.

95
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,070
   

96
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,900
Could you check?

97
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,060
I'll check right away.

98
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,990
Get all the CCTV footage around Kim Young Soo's attempted kidnapping victim's house.

99
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,680
If you see a white truck, track its path.

100
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,420
 Stop running away now and just like me. 

101
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,690
 Is that really okay? 

102
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,870
 Dad! Dad! 

103
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,990
 Dad! Dad! 

104
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,990
What to do?  Dad! Dad!

105
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,660
Sun Jae! Your son, Ryu Sun Jae!

106
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,220
- You scared me. 
 - My son?

107
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,420
You should be eating your plane food. Why are you here?

108
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm here because I didn't go.

109
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,940
Dad, are you okay?

110
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,240
You little punk, what is this thing on your face?!

111
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,770
Are you trying to give your dad a heart attack?

112
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,560
Why aren't you going to America?

113
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,670
Dad, can we have a conversation?

114
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,220
Everyone wanted me to, so I was going to give it one last try. But...

115
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,040
honestly, I didn't have the confidence.

116
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,470
I can't let you pay the expensive costs for rehab when my heart isn't really in it.

117
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,910
But still...

118
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,590
They say it's a place even famous athletes have a hard time getting a spot in.

119
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,610
You threw such a precious opportunity out the window? You little punk!

120
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,200
When I actually thought about swimming again,

121
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,860
I just couldn't get excited about it.

122
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,180
I thought I was still attached to it, but I guess not.

123
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,190
I think I moved on from it better than I thought.

124
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,140
Are you really confident you won't regret this?

125
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,780
Yes.

126
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,310
Then w-w-what are you going to do from now on?

127
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,400
I'm only 20 years old, Dad.

128
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,630
I'll slowly figure out what I want to do.

129
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,040
Gosh, so frustrating.

130
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
Dad, who knows?

131
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,920
Maybe I'll get famous for something else and even have fans.

132
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,470
Like that's easy? You've got some big delusions.

133
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,770
Gosh. Why does my head hurt so much?

134
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,410
Dad, do you have a headache?

135
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,910
Oh, right. Your bags.

136
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,650
What did you do with your bags?

137
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,050
I left the airport after I saw you check your bags. Did you get them back?

138
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,630
Why is my face so dry? I need to apply some lotion.

139
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,050
Your dry face? How about your bags?

140
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,570
Hey, you little punk! Not the special stir-fried pepper paste! That's—

141
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,320
 Let's do the speedball to the front. 

142
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,900
 This is incredibly effective for slimming your arms. Do it while you're watching TV! 

143
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:15,290
 If you keep doing this, you can do 500 in 10 minutes. 

144
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,300
 It's exactly like punching a sandbag. 

145
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,630
 Very good, very good. 

146
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,880
- What is that? 
  - Straight ahead! 

147
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,050
 The faster you go, the more effective. 

148
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,380
Oh, my gosh! So loud! Are you not in menopause yet?

149
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,820
Dancing first thing in the morning?

150
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,080
 Pull your knee up. 

151
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,560
 - Do it four times.  
 - Gosh.

152
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,800
I need to work out if I want to live a long, healthy life.

153
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,080
- Right, Mom? 
 - She's very right.

154
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,290
Right. You know...

155
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,420
I saw Sun Jae kiss a girl in front of our house last night.

156
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,700
Kiss?

157
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,200
Why were you watching that? Goodness, you nosy woman!

158
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,650
How could I not see it? They were doing it for all to see, out on the street.

159
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,150
Geez, that punk.

160
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,600
With that innocent-looking face... he's quite naughty.

161
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,100
He's not like that!

162
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,340
How would you know if he's not like that?

163
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,430
Boys are all the same. And his girlfriend is probably the same, too.

164
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,430
Chasing her boyfriend all the way to his house?

165
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,810
With eyes on them and all.

166
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,380
Smooch, smooch, smooch...

167
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,760
They're not kids! What's so wrong about it?

168
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,800
Well, if they like each other, it can happen!

169
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,840
Bok Soon and your dad would make out whenever they saw each other standing against every wall or wherever.

170
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,820
- Mom! Stop it! 
 - Gosh, they were basically octopus tentacles.

171
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,800
That's how she had you!

172
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,730
You were octopus tentacles?

173
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,060
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

174
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,250
I think your son has a girlfriend.

175
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,360
- What? 
 - Oh, yesterday...

176
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,720
Last night, on the street, he was with his girlfriend doing...

177
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,270
- Doing what? 
 - It looked very instinctive.

178
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,880
Maybe because he watched "Basic Instinct" over and over again.

179
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,100
Whoa, it was just...

180
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,260
What the heck are you trying to say?

181
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,760
Never mind. I'll respect your son's pride.

182
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,960
Oh, they just...

183
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,440
I think you meant privacy, not pride!

184
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,840
What do you mean they were just what?

185
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,210
I'm losing my mind.

186
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,710
- Sun Jae. 
 - Huh?

187
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:04,480
Is the reason you didn't go to America

188
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,310
because of a girl? No, right?

189
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,890
What?

190
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,130
Not at all!

191
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,920
See you later.

192
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,720
That's right. A girl? He's only ever cared about swimming.

193
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,910
How dare she see something else and talk to me like that? So rudely!

194
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,020
Someone might see us. Let's go.

195
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,790
Let's go.

196
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,710
- What if people in your class see us? 
 - Should we hide it?

197
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,000
I just don't know if this is the right thing to do.

198
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,600
After I leave...

199
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,740
I can't waste a minute, a second.

200
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,100
So, let's not hold back or hide.

201
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,700
Let's just like each other as much as we'd like to.

202
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,860
If you go back, I'll take care of the rest.

203
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,440
I'll make sure you're not confused.

204
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,300
You just want to keep holding my hands, don't you?

205
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,970
Yes.

206
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,630
Are you still worried?

207
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,910
Fine. If it bothers you, we can keep it a secret.

208
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,430
You're caught red-handed!

209
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,800
What are you guys doing?

210
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,880
Are you two dating? You told me you weren't!

211
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,800
Traitor!

212
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,600
You said no. You said you weren't even friends. You said you two weren't anything.

213
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,510
You denied it outright. Now, it's a secret? How can you do this to your bestie?

214
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,310
Come on. Don't get so mad.

215
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,020
You're hiding something from me, too.

216
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,240
What? I have nothing to hide!

217
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,860
Yes, you do.

218
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,010
And you! You better be good to me.

219
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,450
I'll keep an eye on how you treat Sol. You better behave and not have a wandering eye.

220
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,190
If you make her cry... I'm going to—

221
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,810
- One of my friends who saw you earlier wants to ask you out. 
 - 011-488-2848.

222
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,900
- W-What? 
 - 011-488-2848.

223
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,400
Tell him to call me.

224
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,750
Have a good time, you two. I'll be out of your way.

225
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,900
You can go now.

226
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,680
What? Are you going to sit in for the lecture?

227
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,490
Yeah.

228
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,620
- Don't you have classes today? 
 - I don't have any classes today.

229
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,970
You came to school when you don't have classes?

230
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,590
Class is starting.

231
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,220
- Hey. What if you get caught? 
 - Be quiet.

232
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,540
 And this is public distance. Next... 

233
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,650
 Let's talk about the depth of field. 

234
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,440
 Within the space, the depth of field dictates where to look. 

235
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,240
 - It expresses the context.  
 - What?

236
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,860
- Focus, focus. 
  - There's deep focus, select focus, and soft focus. 

237
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,810
 Deep focus can express something indirectly. 

238
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:02,180
 The director must ensure the harmony of all elements. 

239
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,010
 The mis-en-scene is important for realism. 

240
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,350
- Want to go get your favorite tteokbokki? 
 - Tteokbokki sounds good.

241
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,780
- Good idea, right? 
 - Yeah.

242
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,590
One second.

243
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,520
 Hey! I heard you didn't go to the US! 

244
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,020
- How did you know? 
 - Your dad called me!

245
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,520
He talked to me all night, saying you were driving him nuts.

246
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,500
If you weren't going to go, you should have told me.

247
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,300
- You made us audition by ourselves! 
 - Oh, right. How did the audition go?

248
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,500
 We got in, dude. We're at final callbacks now. 

249
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,180
If I had known, I would have brought you!

250
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,240
That's good. You already got it without me last time. You'll be fine.

251
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,650
Hey! We're next.

252
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,320
Hey, I have to go.

253
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,470
Anyway, I'm getting you back for this.

254
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,390
Okay. I hope you make it.

255
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,700
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

256
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,990
What audition?

257
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,150
Were you going to go to an audition?

258
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:08,960
Yeah. In Hyuk asked me to go in for Superstar K or something.

259
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,180
What? They got it without you?

260
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,120
Yeah. They're at the final callbacks now.

261
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,100
No, Sun Jae.

262
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,700
Run!

263
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,860
- Where are we going? 
 - The auditions!

264
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,610
- What? 
 - Hurry up. Tell In Hyuk you'll be right there.

265
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,940
- Calm down, Sol. 
 - We have to go!

266
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,390
It's no use even if we go now.

267
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,190
He said they were up next.

268
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,850
What?

269
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,840
Oh, no.

270
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,610
What do I do?

271
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,820
 This isn't worth singing in front of all those people! 

272
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,850
I must have lost my mind.

273
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,180
What's wrong?

274
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,810
Should I have gone to the audition with In Hyuk?

275
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,540
Am I a singer in the future?

276
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,780
If you've heard my song in the future, am I super famous?

277
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,240
Maybe not anymore.

278
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,070
So what if I'm not?

279
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,780
You like singing.

280
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,740
You looked really happy then.

281
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,180
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

282
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,780
What if I took away your happiness?

283
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,640
I'm worried that you'll never sing onstage again because of me.

284
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,370
So, when you go back to the future,

285
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,200
would you be disappointed if I wasn't a singer?

286
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,100
Of course not. I'm fine as long as you're happy.

287
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:08,360
- What if I'm happy and unemployed? 
 - If you're happy, I'll take care of both of us.

288
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,400
How reassuring.

289
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,740
Two Americanos.

290
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,970
Thank you.

291
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,060
Really?

292
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,750
So, what do you usually do on your day off?

293
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,820
I like to watch movies. I'm also a fan of international soccer.

294
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,250
During the season, I stay up all night to watch matches.

295
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,490
International soccer?

296
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:32,110
Hey, me too! Are you a fan of Park Ji Sung?

297
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,570
- You, too? 
 - Me, too!

298
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,610
- Two! 
 - Hearts!

299
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,600
- Never stopping! 
 - Hearts!

300
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,530
- The world's! 
 - Core!

301
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,450
- Air! 
 - Core!

302
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,310
- Park Ji Sung! 
  - Forever! 

303
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,480
I told her to find someone else, and she did.

304
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,660
Hey, that guy's in our major. Right?

305
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,830
What's he like? What do people say?

306
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,990
Oh, Cho Rong?

307
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,810
He can drink a shit ton. He's funny.

308
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,880
His nickname is "Alcrayboy."

309
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,910
"Alcohol-drinking Crazy Boy."

310
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,370
Alcrayboy?

311
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,600
I don't like men who drink a lot.

312
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,300
She really had to pick him?

313
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,900
Gosh. Hey, let's go.

314
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,500
Okay.

315
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,030
It's so hot!

316
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,340
- It's not that hot. 
 - How did you drink that?

317
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,850
What's so funny?

318
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,910
Stop drinking it!

319
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,850
No.

320
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,310
You missed all your classes. Were you running a marathon or something?

321
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,320
Hey, my brother is getting married.

322
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,880
I got him a gift for their honeymoon.

323
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,950
What's the gift?

324
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,400
I went to 100 convenience stores.

325
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,190
Wow, really?

326
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,550
Amazing.

327
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,650
I'm sorry.

328
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,560
   

329
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,790
What are you guys doing?

330
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:16,110
Ryu Sun Jae, you've been making a lot of girls cry since you got a girlfriend.

331
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,700
When I get a girlfriend, I'll make a few cry, too.

332
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,090
- Nonsense. 
 - How did your date go?

333
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,350
Yeah! Thank you so much, my friend!

334
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,820
If things go well with Hyun Joo, let's go on a double date.

335
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,940
What? Did you set him up on a blind date and not me?

336
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,660
Hey, are you done?

337
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,820
I'll be right out.

338
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,980
See you in front of the Humanities building.

339
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,210
- Bye. 
 - Okay, bye!

340
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,550
Hey, I can explain the date.

341
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,060
What are you doing?

342
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,820
Here.

343
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,130
What is this?

344
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,550
- Cute! 
 - Ta-da!

345
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,310
- They match! 
 - Yeah.

346
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,800
- Cute! 
 - Cute, right?

347
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,810
Yeah.

348
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,890
♫  All these times that have been hiding  ♫

349
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,760
♫  Are calling us back again  ♫

350
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,030
What are you doing?

351
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,310
You don't know?

352
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,690
If you catch falling cherry blossom petals, your wish comes true.

353
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:34,800
♫  At the end, it's always you  ♫

354
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:41,370
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

355
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:48,740
♫  I've been waiting for you for so long, you are the spring  ♫

356

♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

357

♫  Even if it fades away  ♫

358
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,410
♫  All my life, it's you  ♫

359
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,070
Let's make a wish. Close your eyes.

360
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:24,020
♫  Inside the story called you  ♫

361
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,570
♫  I'm dreaming again  ♫

362
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,660
What was your wish?

363
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,750
It's a secret!

364
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,050
How about you?

365
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,140
It's a secret.

366
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,510
♫  I'm going to find you  ♫

367
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:49,410
I think my wish already came true, though.

368
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,910
♫  I've been waiting for you for so long, you are the spring  ♫

369
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,580
What?

370
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,180
What if someone sees?

371
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:02,630
♫   'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

372
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,850
♫  Even if it fades away  ♫

373
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,920
Hey!

374
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,220
♫   All my life, it's you   ♫

375
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:20,910
♫  Petals falling on the white road  ♫

376
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,700
♫  You and I were so happy   ♫

377
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,060
Wait till I get you.

378
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,330
You can try!

379
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,000
♫  If we could meet again...  ♫

380
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,330
Why?

381
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,530
The day just flew by.

382
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,960
I know.

383
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,850
Go get some rest.

384
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,490
What if I don't?

385
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,810
I want to stay with you longer.

386
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,570
Can't I?

387
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,180
You can.

388
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,560
What? No.

389
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:06,870
No, w-w-where can we go at this hour?

390
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,050
What do you mean?

391
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,610
Where?

392
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,970
 When will you come to your senses? 

393
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,430
 Why put the cart before the horse? 

394
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,410
What's wrong?

395
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,970
What?

396
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,380
N-Nothing.

397
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,190
The ocean looks so pretty.

398
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,390
Should we go?

399
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,570
What? The ocean?

400
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,840
Yeah. Let's go see the ocean.

401
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,810
Before you go back.

402
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,160
Okay. Let's make sure we go.

403
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,570
I j-j-just wanted to rewind.

404
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,300
Oh, go ahead. Rewind.

405
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,440
Maybe just a minute?

406
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,920
Can we go back to a minute ago, too?

407
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,340
What?

408
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,830
If you give me another chance I'll try to do bet—

409
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,940
It's fine.

410
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:15,400
I misunderstood because of you kissing me in the streets before, and running and all.

411
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,820
Just watch the movie.

412
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,080
Gosh, too bad for me.

413
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,250
How can you sleep right now?

414
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,450
Let's just stay like this a little longer.

415
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,610
Just a little longer.

416
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,340
   

417
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,580
When did I fall asleep?

418
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,180
Oh, no!

419
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,700
A-Are you awake?

420
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,850
I never slept.

421
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,920
You didn't sleep at all?

422
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,070
How can I sleep like this?

423
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,810
Why? Was I snoring?

424
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,880
Never mind.

425
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,890
Why were you suddenly fanning me?

426
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,850
Huh? Oh...

427
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,310
Well...

428
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:42,790
I thought you might be h-h-hot.

429
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,490
What?

430
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,970
Why are you grabbing my collar?

431
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,830
I thought you had something on your shirt.

432
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,600
Did you drool on me? It's okay.

433
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,760
No!

434
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,580
It's ok—

435
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,610
Hey, you!

436
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm sorry! Oh, no...

437
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,300
I—

438
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,830
You bastard!

439
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,570
Come outside!

440
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,290
-  Brother! Come on! 
 - You bastard!

441
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,800
- Stop it! 
 - The ones kissing in the streets!

442
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,400
Was it you, you brat?

443
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,140
What the hell were you doing with my sister all night?

444
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,340
Mom, let go of me. We weren't doing anything!

445
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:38,000
- We weren't doing anything! 
 - Then why are you naked, you asshole!

446
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,620
How dare you lay your hands on my son!

447
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,290
Let go! Let go! Let go!

448
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,580
- Dad! 
 - Let go!

449
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,390
What the heck?

450
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,520
Dad!

451
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,740
Dad...

452
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,170
This lady—

453
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,280
Let go!

454
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,300
Oh, my gosh! Did you just hit my son?

455
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,020
- You hit my son! 
 - Mom! Mom!

456
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,540
Calm down, listen to me.

457
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,090
Don't stop me! Yes, I hit him.

458
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,610
You expect me to sit and watch while my son is humiliated?

459
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,060
Oh, humiliated?

460
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,280
Try saying that again after you look at your son!

461
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,640
What's wrong with how my son looks?

462
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:24,470
Then, you two have something going on...

463
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,460
You bastard!

464
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,780
Sol is the reason you didn't go to the US?

465
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,290
- Dad, it's not that. 
 - How can you give up your dreams for some girl?

466
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,150
"Some girl"? That's my precious daughter you're talking about!

467
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,820
My son is precious, too.

468
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,820
What did you do to seduce my innocent son that you kept him from going to America?

469
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,310
"Kept him from"? Who kept him back?

470
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,630
When our house flooded,

471
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:50,020
your son was the one who moved buckets of water like some servant!

472
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,470
You don't know anything.

473
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,530
Sol wasn't even interested in your son!

474
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,000
What the heck are you talking about?

475
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Hey, is that true?

476
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,190
- Yes. I'm the one who pursued her. 
 - Geez.

477
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,380
See?

478
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,700
Shut your mouth, you bastard.

479
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,830
Innocent? My ass.

480
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:10,730
He's been renting adult videos since he was a minor.

481
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,590
He rented "Basic Instinct" for a whole month!

482
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:17,110
Watching it over and over and over again!

483
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,020
Really?

484
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:25,980
Gosh, if I hear "Basic Instinct" one more time, my ears will bleed.

485
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,800
It's not true. Don't listen.

486
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,580
Don't listen.

487
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,230
Fine. I watched the movie.

488
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,170
I'm the one who watched it!

489
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,630
- Dad! 
 - Happy now?

490
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,580
Gosh, seriously.

491
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:43,110
Sun Jae knew nothing else but eating, sleeping, and swimming.

492
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:46,580
He had no interest in women. Zero!

493
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,220
Not even an inch.

494
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,460
- Who— 
 - He was innocence itself!

495
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,620
That boy is like oxygen.

496
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,990
Oxygen!

497
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,970
Let's go.

498
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,220
Dad, we can't just leave like this.

499
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,240
Naive little bastard. Follow me.

500
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,840
Dad, we can't leave like this.

501
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,580
- Come on! 
 - No, Dad!

502
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,970
Why are you being so stubborn?

503
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,800
Dad!

504
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,340
Why... Why are these...

505
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,440
Innocent? A boy like oxygen?

506
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,870
You perverted bastard!

507
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,280
You!

508
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,710
What is all this ruckus?

509
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,170
What's going on?

510
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,700
- Mom! Listen to this— 
 - Stop!

511
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,910
They're mine.

512
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,800
They're all mine.

513
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,050
You expect us to believe that?

514
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,270
My heart still beats with desire!

515
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:04,100
Enough!

516
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,290
I know he's an adult and all,

517
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,090
but he must be carrying hundreds of these!

518
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:13,770
You can't ever be with an animal with such nasty thoughts.

519
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,840
You cannot ever date him. Never!

520
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,510
Gosh. Thank you for your disapproval. Yes.

521
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,520
Let go, I said!

522
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,850
You cannot be with a girl with such a vicious mother.

523
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,910
Never!

524
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,630
Let's go.

525
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,030
Those really aren't mine.

526
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,740
- It doesn't matter! 
 - Please just listen to us!

527
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,770
- Sun Jae! 
 - Sol!

528
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,500
Sun Jae!

529
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,520
- Sun Jae! 
 - Sol!

530
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,640
- Sun Jae! 
 - Sol! Dad, please!

531
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,090
Sol! Sol!

532
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,390
Sun Jae!

533
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,730
Is she really upset?

534
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:59,480
I explained to her that you're not like that, but it didn't work.

535
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,420
 What should we do? 

536
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,190
But, Sun Jae...

537
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,850
Those... really weren't yours. Right?

538
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,140
Of course not! No!

539
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,480
Wow. Hey. How could you, too, think...

540
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,160
Okay, okay, I believe you. Yeah, I do.

541
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,630
- You trust in me 100%? 
 - Huh?

542
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,400
Yeah! Of course!

543
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,290
Yeah, I believe you.

544
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,800
You don't.

545
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,470
All right.

546
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,160
I'm going to explain all this within an hour. Just wait.

547
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,170
Okay.

548
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:46,280
How did those end up in my bag?

549
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,610
So...

550
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,300
Yeah...

551
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,600
Focus. Focus.

552
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,350
Was it, then?

553
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,320
   

554
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,900
 - The phone is turned off. After the beep...  
 - Why isn't he answering?

555
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,810
 - Hey, Sun Jae.  
 - Hey, hey. The con-

556
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:19,540
Hey, the c-c-c... you know what I'm talking about!

557
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,640
Corn? What corn? A unicorn?

558
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,090
No. There were hundreds of them in the black plastic bag. Don't you know?

559
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,280
Oh, those?

560
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,080
How do you know about those?

561
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:34,940
Cho Rong was freaking out that he lost the wedding gift for his brother.

562
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,160
They belong to Kim Cho Rong?

563
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,210
Kim Cho Rong's phone was off.

564
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,140
Where is he?

565
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,850
- Geez! 
 - Dad.

566
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,780
- What? 
 - We're here already.

567
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,820
All right. Student Sun Jae...

568
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:06,210
No, I mean, you're a fully grown man now.

569
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:12,590
A young man, Sun Jae, called us here to clear up the misunderstanding.

570
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:16,370
Let's clear things up with both sides.

571
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:23,990
Who watched "Basic Instinct," the starting point of all this?

572
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,670
It wasn't me.

573
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:29,530
I rented it, but I didn't watch it.

574
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,320
So you drank, but it wasn't drinking and driving?

575
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,340
Look!

576
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,050
We only have a DVD player at home. We can't play VHS tapes!

577
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,870
- That's right! 
 - Then why did you rent it?

578
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,540
That's...

579
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,570
I was so nervous that I picked something at random.

580
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,360
Why were you nervous about renting a video?

581
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,320
What, do you get tremors or something?

582
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,160
That's...

583
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,580
because Sol looked so pretty sitting behind the counter.

584
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,360
Stop it.

585
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,600
- You brat! 
 - Stop giving him the eyes.

586
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,140
Gosh! You doormat.

587
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,960
So, you were awestruck because of Sol's beauty.

588
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,080
Yes. That's possible, very possible.

589
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,680
Next.

590
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,170
Who can explain why he was naked this morning?

591
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:30,010
I was trying to get something off his shirt, and it ripped.

592
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,350
What? You ripped his shirt?

593
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,820
You bad, bad girl!

594
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,090
She ripped my shirt, but nothing happened.

595
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,850
Hey. Hey.

596
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,490
She's strong. Don't get hurt.

597
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,740
So, you made love but didn't have an affair?

598
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:50,030
It's true. We fell asleep watching a movie, then I drooled...

599
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:54,100
Believe me, Grandma. Please?

600
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:59,220
Of course, Grandma believes my little baby.

601
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,590
Okay. Next.

602
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,080
Let's look at these weenies that flooded out of this bag.

603
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,860
Gosh, Mom. Don't call them "weenies."

604
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:15,140
Anyway, why were you carrying hundreds of these weenies?

605
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,030
Those aren't mine. They're my friend's.

606
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,490
Liar! Do you expect us to believe that?

607
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,810
I have a witness.

608
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,890
The witness was supposed to be here. Wait.

609
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,850
 - I'm on my way.  
 - Hold on.

610
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:27,980
A witness?

611
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,250
What? Did you call up the owner of these weenies?

612
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,540
Yes. He'll be here soon.

613
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:38,980
What's taking him so long? I'm going crazy.

614
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,350
Gosh! You troublemaker.

615
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,120
What are you doing?

616
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,910
Let's just go.

617
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,570
- Gosh. 
 - Dad, hold on.

618
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,410
Yes. It'll be more embarrassing to give a half-baked explanation.

619
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,640
It's time for me to go to aerobics. Let's go.

620
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,790
- Mom, just a little longer. 
 - I also need to get to the senior center.

621
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:57,380
Let's wrap this up.

622
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,980
- Hold on! 
 - Grandma!

623
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,150
Sun Jae!

624
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,080
Hello.

625
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:25,400
Do you, by any chance, have my condoms?

626
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,970
We did it!

627
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,830
It's a little blurry, but...

628
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,500
It's Kim Young Soo.

629
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,560
I think he tried to park somewhere without a CCTV.

630
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,290
Thankfully, this one was hidden behind a tree. So, he missed it.

631
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,280
And...

632
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,570
Here. He comes back in 15 minutes and drives off.

633
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,240
We couldn't track him after that. He moved to a freeway with no CCTVs around.

634
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,330
He pulled over and disappeared for 15 minutes.

635
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:08,010
Did he meet up with someone? Is there an ATM around there?

636
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,250
There's a public phone booth.

637
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,790
There's a public phone booth about a kilometer away.

638
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:18,200
I requested the call logs from that hour.

639
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,110
    
 - Where is this? 
 - They sell food for farm animals and such.

640
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:27,290
The owner used to run an illegal slaughterhouse.

641
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:30,840
The animal tranquilizer he uses at every crime.

642
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,640
Was he trying to obtain it?

643
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,450
I think he's preparing for his next crime.

644
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,710
Nice confidence! Nice!

645
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:51,380
Let's go! Flaunt it! Flaunt your confidence!

646
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,410
Nice, nice, nice, good! Good!

647
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,470
Good!

648
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,380
♫   Reckless energy, I'm never signing out   ♫

649
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,300
♫  Throw my elbows up and my money out  ♫

650
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,900
♫  Throw my elbows up and my money out  ♫

651
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,030
So hot.

652
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:05,410
♫   I came to get down so let's run it up  ♫

653
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,630
Nice. Smile!

654
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:11,470
So good.

655
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,470
Yes!

656
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,200
I feel like my hair could have been better.

657
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,530
- Your hair? 
 - Yeah.

658
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,940
You look fine.

659
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,040
You look great. The best.

660
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,270
Seriously?

661
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,670
No photos of our prince, please.

662
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,820
I was texting.

663
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,330
- Does he think he's a celebrity? 
 - Ridiculous.

664
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,800
Hey, stop being extra.

665
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,030
Look at that cute guy.

666
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,780
He's freaking hot.

667
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,600
The other guy looks like a bbungeobbang*. 
  (fish-shaped bread) 

668
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,900
No, a sea pineapple.

669
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,840
But the other guy is so hot.

670
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,830
Thanks a freaking lot.

671
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,160
So cute!

672
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,110
Fish-shaped bread? Sea pineapple?

673
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,750
I'm freaking jealous of you.

674
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,890
   

675
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:00,320
What's up?

676
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:03,270
What?

677
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,880
The white truck in front of my house.

678
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,200
- It belongs to Kim Young Soo? 
 - Yes.

679
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,020
 So, he's been following me around, looking for an opportunity? 

680
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,880
Someone will get in touch with you soon.

681
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,440
But I came ahead to tell you to be careful.

682
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,820
- Thank you. 
 - With the situation like this,

683
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,570
shouldn't you tell your family and go somewhere safe until he's caught?

684
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,260
I can't.

685
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:28,540
If he's determined to find me, he'll find me wherever I go.

686
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,120
What the hell happens because of Kim Young Soo?

687
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,950
You can't answer this, either. Right?

688
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:40,000
Please don't tell anyone. Keep this a secret.

689
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,970
For free? Buy me dinner or something.

690
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,820
Fine, I will.

691
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,160
Huh?

692
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,440
Sun Jae!

693
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,140
Hey, buddy.

694
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,550
Why would you buy Kim Tae Sung dinner?

695
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,730
W-Well, because...

696
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,900
Why are you here?

697
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,300
To get my dad's underwear back.

698
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,370
Here.

699
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:12,030
Yeah. I took it by accident last time.

700
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,640
I offered to buy dinner as an apology.

701
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,940
Let's go. I'll buy you dinner.

702
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,440
Why would you pay for my dinner?

703
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,320
I don't like my girlfriend having dinner with her ex-boyfriend.

704
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,100
- What? 
 - What?

705
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,950
Thanks.

706
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,940
Don't come see Sol again.

707
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,250
Can I just eat, buddy?

708
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,870
When were we ever buddies? Why do you keep calling me that?

709
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:46,930
We even slept together. We're buddies.

710
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:51,830
So, Im Sol is your girlfriend?

711
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:57,570
She is my girlfriend now.

712
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,310
   

713
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,760
Congratulations.

714
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,860
You think it's going to be forever, huh? It's not.

715
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,890
Look at me. I got dumped after 2 weeks.

716
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:21,140
Be good to her while you can.

717
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,240
Whatever.

718
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,140
What's the secret Sol asked you not to tell anyone?

719
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,800
What? Were you listening?

720
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,780
Are you buying me dinner to get me to tell you?

721
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,380
Why else would I buy you dinner?

722
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,640
Oh, no.

723
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,770
She told me not to tell anyone.

724
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:44,180
I'm not just "anyone."

725
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,970
I don't know. I'm not going to tell you.

726
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:50,790
Why don't you ask your, your only, your dear girlfriend?

727
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:56,680
I'll get the check. Enjoy your dinner.

728
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,760
You're leaving? I hate eating by myself.

729
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,500
Grow up.

730
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:13,190
Stop hanging around Sol!

731
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,050
There's a reason I'm hanging around.

732
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,940
You don't know anything.

733
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,060
- What is it? 
 - It's a secret.

734
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,950
What secret...

735
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,450
I'm jealous of you, bastard.

736
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,630
I get it, bastard.

737
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,190
You know.

738
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:35,340
I think I really liked her.

739
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:38,290
So what? Do you think I care?

740
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,790
Is she really leaving in a month?

741
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,960
What did you just say?

742
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:55,590
And action!

743
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,160
What should we do now?

744
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,830
- Should we eat? 
 - Should we eat?

745
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,350
What should we do after we eat?

746
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:03,290
- How dare you cheat on my daughter? 
 - What's going on?

747
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:05,360
Get him on the ground!

748
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,790
No, no, I didn't!

749
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,300
NG!  (Cut, no good) 

750
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,810
How dare you cheat on my daughter?

751
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,660
Get him on the ground!

752
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,200
Hold on!

753
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,300
We're done filming!

754
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,370
- Why? 
 - The role of "Cheating Man" in this scene,

755
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,720
will be a cameo from the actor Hwang Jung Oh!

756
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,830
What? Hwang Jung Oh?

757
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:26,910
The guy who won Best Actor at Cannes?

758
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:30,440
Stop filming immediately and reschedule around his availability.

759
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,450
- Yes, sir! 
 - Amazing!

760
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,150
Ms. Il Sook!

761
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,820
Hwang Jung Oh is doing it!

762
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,040
Hwang Jung Oh.

763
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:43,970
Hwang Jung Oh! Hwang Jung Oh!

764
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,250
Director! Does this mean I'm fired?

765
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,630
I never replace people, but... It's Hwang Jung Oh. The Cannes guy.

766
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,760
You understand, right? You're such a professional.

767
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:58,340
 Hwang Jung Oh! Hwang Jung Oh! 

768
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:04,160
 Hwang Jung Oh! Hwang Jung Oh! 

769
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,950
 Hwang Jung Oh! Hwang Jung Oh! 

770
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:22,030
Put this on. You were getting beaten up left and right.

771
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:28,550
Please don't tell my mom.

772
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,990
You should be thankful you got fired.

773
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:33,070
They could have broken a bone if they kept going.

774
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:36,430
Is that supposed to make me feel better? Don't pity me.

775
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:38,470
Do you pity me?

776
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:40,450
Why would I pity you?

777
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:45,180
I pity the industry professionals who can't recognize a talent like you.

778
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,930
To me, you're basically Hyun Bin*. You're Gong Yoo*. 
  (famous Korean actors) 

779
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:49,450
What?

780
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:55,420
That's not true. Let's be honest.

781
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:00,890
I am being honest. To me, you're like 24K pure gold.

782
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,500
A bar of gold.

783
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,940
A bar of gold? Wow, "a bar of gold."

784
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:14,640
I thought things were going well between you and Cho Rong.

785
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,010
- Who told you that? 
 - You were cracking up together!

786
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,910
It was so cringe that I couldn't look at you two.

787
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,030
Hey, look at this! You see this? Goosebumps on my arm?

788
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:27,140
Oh, I got you.

789
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,430
What?

790
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,630
Are you being jealous right now?

791
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:32,790
J-J-Jealous? No.

792
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,130
You totally are!

793
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,970
Why are you stuttering? Why are you blushing?

794
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,500
Hey, go away.

795
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,060
- Why are you blushing? 
 - Hey! Stop it.

796
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,660
Run! Run!

797
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,840
Oppa, get in there!

798
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,670
You get in first!

799
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:18,180
It's too small! You get in!

800
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,930
You should live.

801
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:23,530
No way! I can't save myself alone!

802
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,930
Go!

803
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,160
We're alive.

804
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,100
Why isn't he leaving?

805
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:42,870
Why did you want me to hide instead of you?

806
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:45,770
I didn't want him to bite you.

807
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:50,240
That makes no sense. You could have died if that big dog bit you.

808
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,550
Oppa.

809
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,360
Do you really...

810
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,760
What the hell?

811
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:18,940
What?

812
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,540
- Good morning. 
 - What?

813
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,210
I need new friends.

814
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:29,020
Hey! Why was I sleeping next to him?

815
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:33,060
Don't you remember? Huh? Don't you?

816
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,820
 Sol! 

817
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,700
 Wow, there are so many Sol. 
 (Sol means pine cones) 

818
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,310
 Sol! 

819
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,730
 - Sol! Sol! Sol! 
 - This Sol is hurt! 

820
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,190
 - I love her! 
 - Im Sol! 

821
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,160
 Love her! 

822
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,780
 - Im! 
 - Sol! 

823
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,630
 - Hey, Sol! 
 - Im Sol! 

824
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:58,400
 ♫ Don't go, don't go, don't go ♫ 

825
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,220
 ♫ If it was me ♫ 

826
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:07,810
- Stop crying, bastard!

827
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,510
No way.

828
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,890
Look. Crazy...

829
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,860
- What is that? 
 - You're practically besties now.

830
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:29,970
I guess you have the same weird taste in women. You're both on the exact same page.

831
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,090
- What's wrong with Im Sol? 
 - What's wrong with Im Sol?

832
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,110
You two better not drink together again.

833
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:38,290
I'm feeling very sensitive today.

834
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:41,030
Could you please get lost? Please?

835
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,070
Geez, seriously.

836
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:47,510
I'll make some hangover ramen.

837
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,190
Should I make two?

838
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,870
Make it three.

839
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,710
Those bastards...

840
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,210
 What's the secret Sol asked you not to tell anyone? 

841
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:08,590
 Don't you think I should know? 

842
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:11,490
 What is it? 

843
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:15,200
 My dad is chasing after Kim Young Soo, so don't worry about it. 

844
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,910
 I can't tell you more than that. 

845
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:20,100
 Kim Young Soo. 

846
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,220
Hey, why are you taking that off?

847
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,750
I listed my room.

848
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:39,610
I'm quitting the band and moving back home.

849
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,190
So suddenly?

850
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:43,050
Are you okay?

851
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:47,400
If I'm not, what?

852
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,540
We got fired from the club. Tonight's our last show.

853
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,700
Dong Sup quit, so we can't go on anyway.

854
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,250
But it's your last show. You should do it.

855
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,400
Should I help promote it?

856
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,940
I can't sing, but I got the looks, you know.

857
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,660
I'll fill the house. What do you think?

858
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:12,620
You will?

859
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,390
Really?

860
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,220
   

861
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:50,750
   

862
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,580
- Nice to meet you, Young Soo. 
 - Kim Young Soo.

863
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,670
We got you, bastard.

864
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,810
What? You caught him?

865
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:21,540
Yes, Sol. It's all over. You don't have to worry anymore.

866
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,200
Okay, Detective. Thank you.

867
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,680
It's really over.

868
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,730
 In Hyuk's last show is today. 

869
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,520
 Want to watch it together? 

870
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,900
- Start the car. 
 - Yes, sir.

871
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,070
   

872
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:00,580
Is Sun Jae not here yet?

873
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:08,540
No one's ever here during our time slot. What's going on tonight?

874
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,860
My friend did some work for us.

875
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,420
 Hey, princesses, come see some cuties play. 

876
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,470
Are you ready?

877
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,280
Let's go, guys.

878
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,340
Hello.

879
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,640
So many of you are here tonight. Thank you.

880
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,630
Tonight is the last show we will play as Eclipse.

881
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:45,040
So, we brought in a guest vocalist.

882
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,130
Let's give him a warm welcome.

883
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,320
The first song was written by our guest vocalist.

884
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,620
 I'm worried that you'll never sing onstage again because of me. 

885
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,400
This is called "Rain Shower."

886
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:25,330
♫  I wished the rain would never end  ♫

887
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:32,470
♫  The day you first came to me  ♫

888
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:39,880
♫  I hoped it wouldn't just be a quick drizzle  ♫

889
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:45,950
♫  That's what I sincerely wished for  ♫

890
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,660
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

891
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:54,090
♫  I've only been thinking of you every day  ♫

892
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:59,410
♫  You seep into my thoughts once again today  ♫

893
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:07,450
♫  You are a gift from the heavens  ♫

894
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:14,690
♫  In this lonely world I'll protect you  ♫

895
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:18,270
 Thank you. For being alive. 

896
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:20,810
 Stay alive today. 

897
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:23,050
 Because it's nice outside. 

898
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,750
 It rained the day I met you. 

899
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,240
 I liked the rain that day. 

900
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,900
 I like you a lot. 

901
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,480
♫  Those painful memories we wish to forget  ♫

902
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,250
 Sol. 

903
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,430
 Stop running away from me. 

904
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:38,940
 You can just like me. 

905
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:42,820
♫  We can let it flow away with raindrops  ♫

906
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,350
 If I die saving you, 

907
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:48,330
♫  Even when exhausted, even when skies are gray  ♫

908
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:51,320
 it's okay. 

909
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,610
♫  Don't forget that I'm here  ♫

910
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:05,520
♫  You are love, my one and only love  ♫

911
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,340
 Sun Jae, he said it's over. 

912
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:12,630
 We have a future now. 

913
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:17,070
♫  I'll never forget what was given to me  ♫

914
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:23,740
♫  Not even the smallest memory,  I'm inscribing it again today   ♫

915
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:31,580
♫  You're a gift to me  ♫

916
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,340
 Yes, Sol. 

917
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:16,140
 It's all over. You don't have to worry anymore. 

918
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,870
   

919
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:33,710
 If you catch falling cherry blossom petals, your wish comes true. 

920
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:36,440
 Let's make a wish. Close your eyes. 

921
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:40,960
 Please let Sol be happy forever. 

922
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,860
 Please let Sun Jae be happy forever. 

923
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:49,250
 Please let us be happy together forever. 

924
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:58,580
♫  All these times that have been hiding  ♫

925
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:04,680
♫  Are calling us back again  ♫

926
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:10,440
♫  Wherever I am... ♫

927
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,520
   

928
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,010
 What happens here that day? 

929
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:18,760
 What's going on with you? 

930
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,950
 Because someone might take my girlfriend and run. 

931
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,930
 - What? 
 - He moved out? 

932
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:24,880
 Do you know where In Hyuk's family lives? 

933
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,880
 Danpo Village? Make sure you behave around the adults down there. 

934
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:34,650
 - Soon Dol! 
 - In the brightest moment of my youth, 

935
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:36,290
 I hope it's with you. 

936
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,640
 I wish tomorrow would never come. 

937
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,490
 I don't want you to go back. 

938
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:44,210
 I want you to be stuck in this time here and never go back. 

939
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:46,940
 Sun Jae, what do we do? 

940
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:53,750
