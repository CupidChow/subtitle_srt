18
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,800
What are you thinking about?

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,510
What?

20
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,520
Oh, nothing.

21
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,870
Are they robbing the convenience store? Why aren't they back?

22
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,040
Sorry, we're late.

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,460
The train is arriving soon. Let's go.

24
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,090
Let's go.

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,490
Okay.

26
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,350
   

27
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,280

Sol.

29
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,050
Sol?

30
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,860
Did you just fall asleep?

31
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,250
Where am I?

32
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,130
What's wrong?

33
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,140
Why am I here with you?

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,150
Sol, what's going on?

35
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,970
Did you... perhaps...

36
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,380
go back?

37
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,430
Let go of me.

38
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,770
- Sol. 
 - Don't follow me!

39
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,820
I'm a little confused.

40
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,610
I'll go home on my own. Sorry.

41
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,620
 I'll change my own fate. 

42
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,980
 So, Sun Jae... 

43
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,680
 Please don't come this time. 

44
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,860
   

45
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,920

48
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,570
What is this?

49
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,410
 Damn it, it's a bust again! 

50
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,160
 The prize money was 10 billion. 

51
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,790
 - 10 billion? 
 - Yeah. 

52
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,290
   

53
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,300
 - Do you have a piece of paper? 
 - Here. 

54
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,450
The numbers that will change your life.

55
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,150
It's a gift from me.

56
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,230
 What is it? 

57
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,620
Numbers I got from somewhere magical.

58
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,340
 Are they lottery numbers or something? 

59
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,730
How magical?

60
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,080
Please have some patience.

61
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,500
Don't just give up after once or twice. Do it until you get it.

62
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,930
Got it?

63
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,510
Okay.

64
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,040
 Hyun Joo, I did all I could. 

65
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,930
Happy birthday.

66
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,400
Thank you.

67
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,580
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

68
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,410
There are a lot of nicer amusement parks. Why here?

69
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,440
When my dad was alive, I came here on my birthday with my family.

70
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,230
I really wanted to come back here.

71
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,660
You should have told me.

72
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,130
It looks exactly the same.

73
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,690
Does this place exist in the future?

74
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,840
I think so.

75
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,240
Then let's come back here then.

76
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,620
When we meet again in the future, we can come here together.

77
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,520
Sounds good.

78
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,420
 I hope this isn't the last time, either. 

79
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,140
Let's go.

80

Yeah. I ran so much.

121

It's your birthday. You should blow out some candles.

- Happy birthday. 
 - You should sing for me!

When did you put this in here? What is it?

Open it, or whatever.

they were all you.

169
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,820
I did that?

170
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,480
♫  You're the spring that I've been waiting for so long  ♫

171
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,200
So...

172
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,450
I'll be a little more thankful.

173
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,450
♫  Even if it's erased again  ♫

174
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,150
♫  All my life, it's you  ♫

175
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,250
But... with just words?

176
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,300
♫  Atop the white road where flower petals fly  ♫

177
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,450
He said to have a good time. If he already thinks that...

178
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,430
You said you were thankful that I was born. Now, you want a reward?

179
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,320
Wow, that's petty.

180
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm originally quite petty.

181
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,870
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

182
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:01,280
♫  You're the spring that I've been waiting for so long  ♫

183
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:06,940
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

184
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:16,800
♫  Even if it's erased again, all my life, it's you  ♫

185
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,120
 If I go back tomorrow, no... 

186
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,910
 today, all of a sudden... 

187
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,160
 don't be too sad. Okay? 

188
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,590
 Don't cry. Okay? 

189
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,760
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

190
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,540
Hello. I'm...

191
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,040
Detective Kim Won Chul from Gangmok Police Station.

192
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,250
Huh?

193
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,520
What brings you here, Detective?

194
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,200
 How can we wait around all day just because a fugitive might appear? 

195
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,510
 Are you a shaman? 

196
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,650
Who would believe me?

197
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,240
What do I do?

198
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,470
   

199
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,200
Yeah, Mom.

200
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,590
 Come back to Seoul right now. 

201
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,890
Huh? I told you I'm coming back tomorrow.

202
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,520
You were kidnapped last year?

203
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,550
How do you know that?

204
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,820
 The detective came by and told us everything. 

205
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,350
 You were almost taken by a murderer and didn't tell me? 

206
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,600
- Mom, that's... 
  - Stop talking and come home right now!  

207
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,140
That murderer is walking around somewhere out there, free!

208
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,070
How can you be out and about? It's so dangerous!

209
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,190
No, no, no, no. I'll come pick you up.

210
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,990
 Go somewhere inside that's crowded. 

211
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,760
Mom, calm down.

212
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,670
I told you I'm with Sun Jae.

213
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,110
 Sun Jae is with me. I'm not in danger. 

214
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,560
Sun Jae is next to you?

215
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,740
 Of course! 

216
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,990
 Plus, Sun Jae's friend's dad is driving us to the station tomorrow. 

217
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,910
We can't tell him we're leaving so suddenly. He'll think something's wrong.

218
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,250
 Then don't be alone. Go somewhere with a lot of people. 

219
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,540
 Or just stick with Sun Jae. Okay? 

220
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,410
Okay.

221
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,290
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

222
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,850
 I'll explain everything when I get home. 

223
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,620
Okay. Get home safe, you brat!

224
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,130
"Brat"? You should make her feel better!

225
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,880
Why did you get mad at her?

226
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,460
Because I'm upset!

227
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,920
Imagine how scared she must have been to lose her memory.

228
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,620
I had no idea and told her she was all over the place.

229
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,950
I just kept scolding her... my goodness...

230
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,270
- Hello. 
 - Oh, Sun Jae.

231
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,950
- Where's Sol? 
 - Is Sol home?

232
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,870
I thought you were with Sol?

233
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,450
Sol said she was with you and that I shouldn't worry.

234
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,690
She said she was with me?

235
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,940
- Yes. 
 - When?

236
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,490
Just now on the phone.

237
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,090
What?

238
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,720
 Sol, what's going on? 

239
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,600
-  Let go of me. 
 - The watch. 

240
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,090
 She was wearing it. 

241
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,350
 She went back to the future, but why was the watch still there? 

242
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:35,100
 Sun Jae, if I go back tomorrow, no... 

243
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,680
 today, all of a sudden, don't be too sad. Okay? 

244
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,550
 Where am I? 

245
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,520
 Why am I here with you? 

246
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,780
 She pretended that she went back? 

247
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,910
The 10th? What happens on the 10th?

248
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,790
Besides the date, why is the location there?

249
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,010
Stop talking and just get the guys to stand watch here that day.

250
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,740
Is it because she's Tae Sung's friend? You went to see her family, too.

251
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,000
That, too, but I can't stop thinking about it.

252
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,690
I feel like I've known her forever.

253
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,190
Hey, man.

254
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,580
What? Okay.

255
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,380
- What happened? 
 - I think Kim Young Soo left Seoul.

256
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,540
They got a few reports of seeing him in Busan.

257
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,650
The Busan police checked the local CCTVs. They think it's him.

258
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,120
- Busan? 
 - Yes.

259
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,170
Hello? Yeah, Sol.

260
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,360
 Detective, I'm sorry to bother you. 

261
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,170
Could you please come to me right now?

262
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,190
 What? Where are you? 

263
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,630
You're the only person I can ask.

264
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,490
Detective, please rescue me.

265
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:14,300
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

266
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,820
   

267
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,970
 On May 10th. 

268
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,740
 He'll probably come. 

269
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,170
 There's still a few days left. What is she thinking? 

270
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,400
 Why did she lie to me? 

271
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,670
 Did the future change? 

272
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,100
   

273
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,970
- Hey. 
  - Hey, I think Im Sol never got on the train at all. 

274
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,830
- What? 
  - My dad called me. 

275
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,570
 He thinks he saw Im Sol while he was out on the boat. 

276
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,860
 He asked if we left her behind. 

277
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,830
 Why didn't you go? 

278
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,390
 Why? 

279
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,650
 You should have gone. 

280
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,490
 You shouldn't be here right now. 

281
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,270
 Just pretend like you don't know me. 

282
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,310
 No matter where I am, what I'm doing, or what happens to me. 

283
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:02,280
 Please just leave me alone. 

284
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,510
 She was trying to stay back there alone. 

285
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,360
 It's so pretty. 

286
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,180
 Thank you. 

287
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,910
 I should thank you. 

288
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,160
 For being born. 

289
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,820
 For crossing through a lot of time to come to me. 

290
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,640
 For letting me hang on to you. 

291
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
 Thank you so much. 

292
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,070
 Sun Jae, I'm sorry. 

293
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,650
 But you can't be here right now. 

294
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,450
   

295
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,990
   

296
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,040
   

297
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,190
 5:00 in the morning... 

298
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,850
 The dolphin mural. 

299
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,010
 The red bricks. 

300
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,650
Just you?

301
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,900
Yes.

302
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,050
Just get me anything.

303
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,660
All right.

304
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,730
   

305
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,990
 Sol, where are you? 

306
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,860
 I saw your mom. 

307
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,570
 Please answer your phone. 

308
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,020
 Sun Jae, just wait a little longer. 

309
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,250
 It's all going to be over soon. 

310
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,570
Why isn't Detective Kim here yet?

311
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,260
He has to be here before 5:00.

312
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,790
 Hello? Detective Kim? 

313
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,820
 I just got here. 

314
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,190
 I'm right behind you. 

315
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,650
We'll keep watch for you here.

316
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,380
 - Thank you so much for coming.  
 - Of course.

317
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,360
You really think Kim Young Soo is going to be here tonight?

318
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,020
We should be looking all over Busan.

319
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,560
His face is on "wanted" posters all over the country.

320
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,170
You think he'll pop up in Busan Station and get on the CCTV?

321
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,470
So, you think he did that on purpose to confuse the police?

322
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,770
Why?

323
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,110
We'll see.

324
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,870
 Where did he see Sol? 

325
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,110
 Not sure, but I think near the breakwater. 

326
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,610
I'd like to pay.

327
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,680
16,000 won.

328
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,430
   

329
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,450
 It's 5:00. 

330
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,050
   

331
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,700
 Right now! 

332
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,580
Please stop right here.

333
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,200
Sol!

334
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,140
Sol!

335
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,790
Sol!

336
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,930
   

337
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,640
 It's here. 

338
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,480
 One... 

339
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,520
Let us see your IDs, please.

340
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,330
 Two, three, four... 

341
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,270
 Five... 

342
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:06,310
 Kim Young Soo! 

343
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,890
Detective!

344
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,270
Get out of the way.

345
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,780
Detective Kim!

346
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,460
Are you all right?

347
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,530
We got a report and came right away.

348
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,360
Did something happen?

349
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,990
- A report? 
 - Yes.

350
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,490
Hey, Sol.

351
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,530
- Are you all right? 
 - What's going on?

352
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,510
I'm sorry.

353
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,430
 This is the Jooyang Reservoir murder suspect. 

354
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,280
 His name is Kim Young Soo. Around 180cm tall, athletic build... 

355
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,780
 He can be recognized by the long, monolid shape of his eyes. 

356
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,700
- Kim Young Soo? 
 - Damn it.

357
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,630
We got a report saying a female student in pink is in danger.

358
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,480
They asked us to protect her.

359
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,620
It wasn't about seeing the wanted criminal?

360
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,100
No. It seemed like someone who knew her.

361
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,330
No way...

362
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,080
Sun Jae!

363
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,870
No!

364
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,910
Sol!

365
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,650
- Sol! 
 - Chief!

366
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,160
 Please, please, not this time. 

367
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:46,950
No. No!

368
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,250
 Sometimes you know the consequences 

369
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,230
 but make the same choice anyway. 

370
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,120
 Because you want to. 

371
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,470
 I like you. 

372
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,980
 I like you, Sun Jae. 

373
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,130
 I love you. 

374
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,650
 I love you, Sol. 

375
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,790
♫  This yearning I can't hide  ♫

376
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,440
Sun Jae!

377
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:21,450
♫  I fall asleep missing you  ♫

378
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,720
Sun Jae!

379
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,710
♫  I can't forget the traces of you  ♫

380
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,550
 Sun Jae, it's morning. 

381
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,800
♫  If I could stop, even just for a moment  ♫

382
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,400
 Shouldn't you wake up? 

383
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,610
♫  If I could stop, even just for a moment  ♫

384
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,490
 Wake up! 

385
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,640
 The day is bright! 

386
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:58,910
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

387
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,380
♫  I want to turn back our time together  ♫

388
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,790
 Close your eyes. 

389
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,230
 If you close your eyes, it's dark. 

390
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,190
 - Are you awake? 
 - No, I'm not. 

391
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,310
 My world is still dark. 

392
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,120
 What in the world... 

393
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,710
 You said you wished tomorrow wouldn't come. 

394
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:24,220
 Until I open my eyes, tomorrow isn't here. 

395
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,450
 Should I just keep my eyes closed? 

396
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,080
 What happens then? 

397
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,490
 This moment will last forever. 

398
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:49,610
♫  But at the end, please come back to me to me  ♫

399
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,530
 You're just making excuses to sleep in. 

400
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,610
♫  I sigh and try my best to smile  ♫

401
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,500
 How did you know? 

402
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,770
♫  Nonchalantly I approach   ♫

403
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,520
 Let's just stay like this a little longer. 

404
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,780
 Okay. 

405
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:14,470
♫  All day, I miss you   ♫ 
 ♫  I want to turn back our time together  ♫

 Sun Jae!

00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,770
♫  I want to turn back our time together  ♫

408
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:27,060
♫  No matter what happens, I will remember you  ♫

409
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,660
♫  Your name is painted deep in my heart  ♫

410
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:38,190
 Sun Jae, is your world still dark? 

411
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,250
   

412
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,510
   
 I came back to the time I was living in, 

413
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:35,800
 several seasons passed, and winter came again. 

414
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,150
Good job eating!

415
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,730
Yummy, right? Make sure you chew!

416
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,310
I'm late, I'm late!

417
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:46,130
- Let's go, Bo Ah! 
 - I don't want to.

418
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,510
Mommy doesn't want to go to work, either. Let's go!

419
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,340
Don't go.

420
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,980
Goodness, Mal Ja.

421
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,940
- Don't go. 
 - Honey, honey, honey!

422
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,760
- Your coat. 
 - Give me the backpack.

423
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,920
Let's put on your coat and go!

424
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,460
Me, too. Me, too!

425
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,300
Who made you cry?

426
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,490
Want to try this?

427
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,010
   

428
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,690
   

429
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,830
 In return for changing many things, I lost something precious. 

430
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,460
   

431
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:29,970
   

432
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,800
   

433
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,950
   

434
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:40,960
 I'm living in the present as if nothing ever happened. 

435
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,850
Here's your coffee IV drip.

436
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,040
Thank you!

437
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,270
You made it.

438
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,710
Wow, I can breathe again.

439
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,930
You left before me. Why did it take you so long?

440
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:58,930
Bo Ah's daycare teacher made me stay back and talk to her.

441
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,780
Becoming an older sister has made her more stubborn.

442
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,690
Gosh, I'm so worried.

443
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,880
The CEO doesn't know I'm late, right?

444
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,700
I already told her you were at a meeting.

445
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,610
So quick on your feet. Thank you.

446
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,300
I heard she tore your pitch apart yesterday.

447
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,050
What did she say?

448
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,820
- She said it was like the coffee you make. 
 - What?

449
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,220
- Like it was bad? 
 - Yeah.

450
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,640
- Like neither here nor there. 
 - What?

451
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,740
It's neither a romance nor a specific genre.

452
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,770
It's not big, so it's not quite right as a commercial project.

453
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,160
Without a star in it, no one will pay to see it in theaters.

454
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,280
I mean, she's right.

455
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,080
She's not right.

456
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,540
She can't tell the difference between a latte and a cappuccino. Why talk about coffee?

457
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,440
Honestly, her taste sucks.

458
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,040
Producing stuff like "Hero"?

459
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
It's been a while since she's lost her taste.

460
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,190
I know! Mermaids and aliens?

461
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,580
Beating up zombies and going to space? Are you kidding me?

462
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:01,530
If it opens in theaters, we'll get over 10 million viewers!

463
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,950
You know I look up to your adventurous spirit. Right?

464
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,850
I'm going to go prepare for a meeting.

465
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,580
- Producer Im. 
 - Yes?

466
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,760
Come to my office.

467
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,620
Go to the set right now.

468
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,340
What? Did something happen?

469
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,700
Our dear actor Park Do Jun wants us to cut the kiss scene.

470
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,980
It's a romance. We can't get rid of the kiss...

471
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,130
That's why I need you to go convince him.

472
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,580
The director is mad, asking to replace him.

473
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:47,090
If we lose Park Do Jun, we'll lose investments and lose everything.

474
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,210
We can't do that, can we?

475
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:53,230
What does his management even do? Why is it always me who has to go to convince him?

476
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:59,750
They say they "fully respect the actor's wishes."

477
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,880
He's the CEO's nephew, apparently.

478
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,650
He's basically Your Majesty.

479
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,390
Hey, Do Jun!

480
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,480
You've gotten even better looking!

481
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,280
You're totally glowing.

482
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,210
I was wondering why so much light was in my eyes!

483
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,460
Sister PD, you're back again.

484
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,250
I wanted to see you, Do Jun!

485
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,660
Oh, it smells like alcohol...

486
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,780
Have you been drinking?

487
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,660
Is that alcohol, by chance?

488
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,580
Sister PD, do you like whiskey?

489
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,590
You can't drink in the middle of a shoot!

490
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,880
Huh? Wasn't your name "Sool," Sister PD? 
 (It means "alcohol" in Korean)

491
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,210
Im... Sool?

492
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,220
Not "Sool," Sol!

493
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,290
I heard you don't want to do the kiss scene.

494
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,450
Why not?

495
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,840
I'm not going on camera until we cut the kiss scene.

496
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,860
I can't.

497
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,690
Do Jun, what's the name of our movie?

498
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,360
It's "Shall We Kiss?"

499
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,480
How can we cut the kiss scene?

500
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,510
It's "Shall We Kiss?"

501
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,540
It's not "We kissed."

502
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,600
We can't make a romance movie without a kiss scene!

503
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,740
Imagine you bought a cream bun, and there's no cream inside.

504
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,050
How ridiculous would that be?

505
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,710
Does a hot dog have a dog in it?

506
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,000
Does an eggplant have an egg in it?

507
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,640
That's not what that—

508
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,110
You know how important this kiss is to the main characters' arc.

509
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,000
The storyboard was insane!

510
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,550
It might be one of the greatest kiss scenes in the history of Korean cinema.

511
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,900
And you don't want to do this?

512
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,850
You'll do it, right?

513
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,340
I know you are!

514
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,620
- I'll give you time to sober up, so go brush your teeth— 
 - I'm not going to shoot it.

515
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,540
Why not? Why don't you want to do it?

516
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,300
Just tell me the reason.

517
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,660
This is a secret.

518
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,700
Fine! I'll tell you and you only.

519
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,650
My girlfriend doesn't want me to.

520
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,350
She's the jealous type.

521
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,600
How can this be?

522
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,250
If she tells you to die, will you?

523
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,180
I'd at least pretend to. I'm a good actor.

524
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,220
Acting is what you do on set! Not in front of your girlfriend!

525
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:03,300
Anyway, I'm not coming back on set until the kiss scene is cut.

526
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,630
Got it?

527
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,260
Bye now.

528
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,540
Hold on. H-Hold on.

529
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,150
Do Jun?

530
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,510
Do Jun!

531
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,670
The shoot isn't canceled. You can't just leave like this!

532
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,530
I don't know, I can't hear you.

533
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:21,470
Do Jun. The director brought up replacing you. If you keep...

534
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:27,060
I thought people invested in this film because I was in it.

535
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,150
Hey, Do Jun. Listen to me—

536
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,710
Wow, unbelievably rude.

537
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,400
You've been drinking. Are you crazy?

538
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,920
Get out of the car! Get out!

539
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,510
Park Do Jun, you crazy bastard!

540
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,330
What? Are you crazy?!

541
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,880
- What's with that woman? 
 - Oh goodness!

542
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,750
You're the crazy one!

543
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,840
Get out, dude.

544
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,640
We treat you like a king, and you think you can go rogue?

545
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,440
How dare you drink and get behind the wheel?

546
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,960
With your girlfriend in the car? This is attempted murder!

547
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,790
If you want to die, die alone! Don't hit and kill someone else!

548
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,860
You're totally a thug.

549
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,650
- Hey, you! 
 - This is so fun.

550
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:48,010
Can you play it one more time?

551
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,200
- Shut up! 
 - Too bad.

552
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,910
So, the actor was trying to leave the set,

553
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,380
and you were trying to stop him. Is that correct?

554
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:02,280
Yes. We will not settle until we get an apology.

555
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,800
A-An apology?

556
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,910
How can you be so confidently shameless?

557
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:11,470
Let me explain what happened. The situation...

558
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,980
Answer your phone first.

559
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,730
- Yes, CEO. 
  - Hey! 

560
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,000
 I told you to talk to him, not to fight and get the cops involved! 

561
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,460
That's not what...

562
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,970
 Just apologize. 

563
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,100
 Don't blow this up. Just make it stop. Got it? 

564
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,480
What?

565
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,060
Park Do Jun was just...

566
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,840
I heard he was with a girl.

567
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,670
Are you going to blow up his private life, too?

568
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:44,120
 You want to see the whole production get canceled? 

569
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,170
Apologize and bury this quietly.

570
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,670
CEO? CEO!

571
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,860
What did she say?

572
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,610
I'm sorry.

573
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,460
I apologize.

574
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,290
Why apologize to me?

575
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:04,080
Our artist is the one who got hurt.

576
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,870
What?

577
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,440
   

578
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,870
I guess my 30's are fated to be about writing apology letters at the police station.

579
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,900
Hey, pretty noona.

580
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,310
Wait, you look familiar.

581
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,680
You must come to the police station often.

582
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,770
Could you please be quiet? I can't focus.

583
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,810
   

584
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,970
Want some tips on writing apology letters well?

585
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,480
I'm an expert in that field.

586
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,360
Why are you in the cell anyway? You're a cop.

587
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:43,150
I like the temperature and humidity here.

588
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,620
I just feel more comfortable here than in the lounge.

589
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,170
Maybe that's where you're supposed to be.

590
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,960
Just get it over with.

591
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,230
You look upset. Oppa will buy you a drink.

592
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:57,510
Oppa? No thanks.

593
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,350
So what's the tip for writing it well?

594
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,300
Write this down.

595
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,680
- Saying what? 
 - 911.

596
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,250
Sister Thug, for you.

597
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,950
Hey, I'm not a criminal. I don't need to eat tofu and be reborn.

598
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,610
You should be reborn.

599
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,920
You've always acted so recklessly, even from long ago.

600
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,870
I saw it when you took cigarettes from the delinquents and scolded them.

601
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,460
Mind your own life.

602
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,890
So why did you get arrested?

603
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,220
He was drinking and driving?

604
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,890
You should have said that back there!

605
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,320
It would have come up on the breathalyzer.

606
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,340
I was going to, but...

607
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,220
My boss told me to apologize and bury it.

608
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,630
I didn't get this job to do that kind of work, you know?

609
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,710
So bitter.

610
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,050
Want me to dig through the CCTV footage

611
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,490
for footage of him drinking and getting behind the wheel of the car with a girl.

612
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,100
Want me to find it all and put him behind bars?

613
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,200
I'll get fired if we do that.

614
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,020
But thanks for offering.

615
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,570
Give it to me.

616
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,170
These aren't empty words. I'm serious.

617
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,490
No thanks.

618
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,520
So, the girl in the passenger seat was Chaeni, the model?

619
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,800
Yeah, why?

620
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,990
Is she cute? She is, right?

621
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:24,720
Why isn't she with a guy like me?

622
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,510
Why is she with a guy like Park Do Jun?

623
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,120
Maybe I should have asked In Hyuk to introduce me to her.

624
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,480
Then what? You think she'll go out with you?

625
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,200
You think you're still a minor internet celebrity for being hot?

626
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,640
I'm still cute, though. Right?

627
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,430
That smiling with the eyes thing you do? It won't work anymore.

628
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,750
Darn it.

629
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,600
   

630
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,840
 That used to be Sun Jae's ad. 

631
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,280
Drink slowly. Don't pass out drunk again.

632
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,830
If you pass out again tonight, I'm leaving you here.

633
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,800
Hey, I won't get drunk with only this much.

634
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,250
A day like this? Even if I wanted to get drunk, I couldn't.

635
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:15,620
Hey, world! Why are you doing this to me?

636
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,700
What did I ever do wrong?

637
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,110
Let go!

638
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,490
Let's just get home quietly.

639
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,650
Park Do Jun, that bastard.

640
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,920
I'm going to get him back!

641
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,220
Yeah, yeah, you'll get him back.

642
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,850
Why did I suggest drinking?

643
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,110
I can't even get a cab.

644
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,630
Today is not my day.

645
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,110
Your scarf is undone.

646
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,500
Are you asleep?

647
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,140
Fine. Just sleep, then.

648
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,640
Sleep.

649
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:23,170
It's snowing.

650
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,640
I wonder if we can get a cab...

651
00:47:53,570 --> 00:48:00,540
♫  If I miss you this much, will it come true?  ♫

652
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:07,380
♫  I want to tell you someday before it's too late  ♫

653
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,910
 Sol, I... 

654
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,650
♫  Love, not even for a moment did I let go  ♫

655
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:15,440
 ...like you a lot. 

656
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,550
 Sol, stop running away from me. You can just like me. 

657
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:24,080
 If I die saving you, it's okay. 

658
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,790
 I don't care. 

659
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:30,600
♫  If you come like the first snow I've been waiting for  ♫

660
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,320
 You said you missed me. 

661
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,470
 So? 

662
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,790
 What about now? 

663
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:47,000
♫  Love, I never let go, not even for a moment  ♫

664
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,060
♫  Will you remember this heart of mine?  ♫

665
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,100
 I like you. 

666
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,070
 I like you, Sun Jae. 

667
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:59,270
♫  Go up against all time  ♫

668
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,100
 I love you. 

669
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:05,090
 I love you, Sol. 

670
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:09,520
♫  I remember you  ♫

671
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,820
I can't get a cab.

672
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,150
♫  Maybe this time  ♫

673
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,260
Hey, let's go.

674
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,880
♫  I circle around you again  ♫

675
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,270
♫  You're my destiny, I can't erase you  ♫

676
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:25,900
Are you crying?

677
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:32,340
♫  Will I reach you one more time?  ♫

678
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:38,520
♫  No matter where you are in time  ♫

679
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,570
Don't cry.

680
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,800
♫  For me, it's you  ♫

681
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,880
Sun Jae...

682
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,600
What?

683
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,750
I miss you, Sun Jae.

684
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:02,230
♫  The sincerity of your protection over me  ♫

685
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:09,980
♫  I couldn't say them or hear them  ♫

686
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:16,950
♫  Inside the memories of our past  ♫

687
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:22,460
   

688
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,700
 Did you get to work okay? 

689
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,100
I have no idea how I got home.

690
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,770
 I heard you carried me home last night. Thanks. 

691
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:36,020
 If you want to thank me, buy me some hangover soup. 

692
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,930
 Want to have lunch together? 

693
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:40,260
 Wow, cops have a lot of time on their hands.  

694
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,140
 Next time. I need to fix the disaster I created yesterday. 

695
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,210
My stomach hurts.

696
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:14,930
I'm taking Park Do Jun off the movie.

697
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,960
If we lose our investments and the film is canceled,

698
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,540
it's because of Park Do Jun's personal issues.

699
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:23,000
We'll sue them for damages.

700
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,430
I thought we were going to bury it and move forward.

701
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:31,410
I didn't know that bastard Park Do Jun drank and drove on set.

702
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:36,050
Why didn't you tell me the most important thing?

703
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:39,170
You told me to bury it before I had a chance to...

704
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,570
I did?

705
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,140
Yes.

706
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:51,280
Anyway, I'll handle this, just so you know.

707
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,500
I should've taken care of my own employee.

708
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,190
I made you write an apology letter for nothing.

709
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,790
I'm sorry.

710
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,480
What did you say?

711
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,510
I said I'm sorry.

712
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,390
It's okay. Thank you.

713
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,580
Oh, the pitch you turned in last time?

714
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,270
Make some edits and bring it back tomorrow.

715
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,370
I thought you didn't like it.

716
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,970
When did I say that?

717
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,570
Hey, I read it again.

718
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:25,840
I think if we really bring out the young romance thing, it might work.

719
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,400
T-Then...

720
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:31,870
Let's make your script into a movie.

721
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:33,770
Really?

722
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:37,390
Thank you, CEO! Thank you!

723
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,520
You know I value your abilities highly, right?

724
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,170
Treat me right, you brat.

725
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,080
Of course, of course!

726
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,580
I will.

727
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,110
What is that? The budget proposal?

728
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,240
Oh, yes.

729
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,250
What is this?

730
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:02,030
You must've heard that I'm moving forward with your pitch.

731
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:05,430
Did you write me a thank you card or something?

732
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,140
I'll read it before bed.

733
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,450
What? Go edit your pitch.

734
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,760
Oh, yes. I'll do my best. Thank you!

735
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,810
Thank you!

736
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,520
Oh, my gosh! Congratulations!

737
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,830
I didn't think this day would come for me, Hyun Joo.

738
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,100
I had no idea our CEO valued me this much.

739
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,710
I talked so much shit about her last night when I was drunk!

740
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:39,630
What?

741
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:40,720
The red envelope.

742
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,590
 What? Bury? 

743
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,260
 Bury what? 

744
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,550
 Fine. I'm quitting this company. 

745
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:54,340
 I came here to make movies. 

746
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:59,250
 I didn't come here to be treated like this! 

747
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,480
 "Get it done, do it right, make it work!" 

748
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,580
 You said that was the type of employee I am. 

749
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,360
 If I'm that kind of employee... 

750
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,980
 How could you treat me like this? 

751
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,610
 Seriously, I'm getting the ick. 

752
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:29,750
 This is my first resignation letter ever. 

753
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,280
 I'm quitting this company. 

754
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,470
 I started working here with big dreams of making movies, 

755
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,110
 but all I do is bullshit. 

756
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,070
 All I do is clean up after celebrities' antics 

757
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,960
 and cater to their every whim, and I'm sick of it! 

758
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,840
 I don't want to work here anymore. 

759
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,400
 I quit this company! 

760
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,380
 CEO Lee Gyung Ja. 

761
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,280
 Gyung Ja! 

762
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,670
 You pay me less than an ant's pee. 

763
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,520
 Stop working me to death! 

764
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,720
 Why am I writing apology letters at the police station at my age? 

765
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:14,060
 Hire someone else who can do it right, get it done, and make it work. 

766
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,850
 If you want to hold onto me, 

767
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,380
 you'll have to convince someone crazier than Park Do Jun. 

768
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,580
 That's me, Im Sol! 

769
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:28,830
 Gyung Ja, it has not been nice working with you. 

770
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:31,060
 I hope our paths never cross again. 

771
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,380
 I'll get the heck out! Bye! 

772
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,950
 Do it right, get it done, make it work! 

773
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:41,980
What do I do?

774
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:43,650
What do I do?

775
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:46,590
Bye-bye. You're out.

776
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:49,390
You get your pitch through and cause this disaster?

777
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:50,840
Bye-bye.

778
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,940
She said she'll read it tonight. She may not have read it yet.

779
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,980
Hey! She already left.

780
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,010
What? Where?

781
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:00,850
   

782
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,470
   

783
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,150
 What do I do after saying hi? 

784
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:24,210
 What if she asks why I'm here? 

785
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:27,140
 How do I get the envelope out of her bag? 

786
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:39,270
Great!

787
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:01,090
Gosh, hello! Hello!

788
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,960
Cheers!

789
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,810
What?

790
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:41,000
Thank goodness.

791
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,550
She hasn't read it yet.

792
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:46,150
Let me put this back...

793
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,910
 Sun Jae! 

794
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,240
 Sun Jae! 

795
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:20,880
♫  It wasn't how I felt, so I had to let it go  ♫

796
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,200
♫  I think of the night we had that time  ♫

 Sun Jae! 

799
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:34,650
 Sun Jae! 

800

♫  I can see a little clearer  ♫

801
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:45,500
 Why did my watch suddenly become a time machine? 

802
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:50,550
 How can I tell you this? That I got this power after you died. 

803
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,650
 One moment, your scent came to me   ♫

804
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,540
 No way... 

805
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:00,270
♫  I won't let it disappear, I won't let it get away  ♫

806
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:07,380
 Sun Jae, maybe we should have never met from the start. 

807
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,670
♫  This moment, everything  ♫

808
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,250
 No, we should have never met.

♫  I might know you from somewhere  ♫

810

♫  Everything felt like a dream, so I missed it a little  ♫

815
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:09,070
♫  One moment, your scent came to me  ♫

816
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:15,140
♫  I won't let it disappear, I won't let it get away  ♫

817
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:23,670
♫  Don't let go of my hands, this moment  ♫

818
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:26,490
 Sun Jae? 

819
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:29,900
♫  With you  ♫

820
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,670
♫  I might embrace you  ♫

821
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,690
♫  Be with you  ♫

822
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:45,640
♫  I'm running to you  ♫

823
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:54,580
♫  Standing at the end of the world that's fast asleep  ♫

824
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:58,090
♫  Toward the pouring light, step by step  ♫

825
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:01,170
   

826
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:02,560
 Why are you crying? 

827
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,300
 I didn't make you cry. 

828
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,060
 - The winning film is... 
 - Oh, no! 

829
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:09,180
 I pray I'll never run into that woman again. 

830
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:12,960
 Ryu Sun Jae, I don't want you to star in this movie. 

831
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,220
 Why would she hate me? She's never met me. 

832
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,830
 Sol, what's wrong? Did something happen? 

833
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,400
 Did you see his face? 

834
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,790
 We meet again. 

835
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:24,100
 This is beyond coincidence. Isn't it fate? 

836
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,990
 I'm not doing anything fate doesn't want me to do. 

837
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:31,470
 If I want to be involved with you, should I be ready to die or something? 

838
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:34,500
♫  You're my only one star  ♫

839
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,690
