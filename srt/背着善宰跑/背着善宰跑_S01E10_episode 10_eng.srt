1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,400
   

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,570
   

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,130
   

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,280
   

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,700
   

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,840
   

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,790
 I will be back. 

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,110
So, you came back like this?

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,780
No, I'm not saying I'm the terminator.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,420
I'm giving you an example of time travel.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,650
So, you came from the future?

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,170
Yes.

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,390
I pressed this button, and I got dropped off in 2008!

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,860
So, you are saying this is my watch that you brought from 2023.

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,300
Right.

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,620
Why did my watch suddenly become a time machine?

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,130
 Like how you saved me before, I think God wants me to save you this time. 

18
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,280
 That I got this power after you died. 

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,760
 How can I tell you this? 

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,480
I don't know.

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,130
It's really incredulous.

22
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,130
Also, why do you have my watch in the future?

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,060
I bought it at an auction. Three million won.  ($3,000) 

24
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,810
- What? 
 - Huh?

25
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,390
Why would I put up an old watch for auction and who would pay 3 million for it?

26
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,970
- I told you I was your fan. 
 - What fan?

27
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,820
You were a really famous singer in a band called Eclipse!

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,120
That's how I know the song "Rain Shower."

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,920
- I can't tell you that. 
 - Why not?

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,000
Because it makes time stop.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,280
Stop it, then.

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,360
It did stop just now, but you didn't know.

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,210
Because time was stopped.

34
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,010
So, you can manipulate time?

35
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,060
It's not like that. Well—

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,450
All this must sound ridiculous and unbelievable.

37
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,860
Yeah.

38
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,250
I knew you'd react like this.

39
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,870
That's why I couldn't tell anyone all this time.

40
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,490
Fine, let's say I believe you.

41
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,810
So, what are you here to change this time?

42
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,830
You said you were going to "change it this time no matter what."

43
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,110
C-C-Change?

44
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,610
I'm not going to change anything.

45
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,720
I was drunk and meant to say, "I'm not going to change it."

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,070
You're not going to change it?

47
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,130
If I'm careless with anything I say or do here,

48
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,190
my future or someone else's future could change.

49
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,110
This is the last time.

50
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,350
If I go back, I can't come back anymore.

51
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,090
So, I was going to stay quiet until I went back.

52
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,540
Is that why you've been running away every time you saw me?

53
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:56,370
You know how I told you I'm sorry for sending mixed signals?

54
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,910
I'm not going to do that this time.

55
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,760
I don't want to confuse you.

56
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,200
Why not? Are you worried I'll misread your signal and confess my love again?

57
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,170
If that's the reason, you don't need to pack your bags and run away.

58
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,620
I'm taking time off from school and going to the US.

59
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,490
- What? 
 - I'm going to try rehab again.

60
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,320
I'll leave for your sake.

61
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,410
And even if I run into you, I'll pretend I don't know you.

62
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,640
So, stop making ridiculous excuses like that.

63
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,620
Rehab?

64
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,040
Sun Jae is leaving?

65
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,010
   

66
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,230
   

67
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,580
 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by 
 ✨ The Marvellous ✨ Team @ Viki.com  

68
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,540
 She came from the future? 

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,530
Hey, what's on your mind?

70
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,620
Have you guys seen Terminator?

71
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,860
- Of course. 
 - Why?

72
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,010
Is time travel possible in real life?

73
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,640
Well, if science evolved enough in the future, it could be possible.

74
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,500
Don't you guys know Einstein's Theory of Relativity?

75
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,630
Have you ever heard of wormholes?

76
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,680
All these buzzwords about time travel!

77
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,200
What are those?

78
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,660
- If I knew, I'd be Einstein. 
 - Geez!

79
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,910
Why do you ask?

80
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,930
What would you do if the girl you like says she is from the future?

81
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,560
I'd forget about her right away!

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,640
That is such a bullshit way to reject.

83
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Is it a trendy way to reject a guy?

84
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,320
She should just say no instead of mocking you.

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,240
- Is that what it is? 
 - But...

86
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,410
if someone I don't like asks me out, that's how I should reject her.

87
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,590
Hey, time travel will be invented before someone asks you out.

88
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,620
You dumbass.

89
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,140
Anyway, forget her.

90
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,720
 He's going to rehab out of the blue? 

91
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,590
 Did the past change again because of me? 

92
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,320
 Okay. This is a good thing. 

93
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,190
 If Sun Jae is far away, he'll never run into that guy. 

94
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,870
Mister!

95
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,240
Really?

96
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,300
Yes. Yes.

97
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,700
Oh, the lead singer?

98
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,540
Of course, that's possible!

99
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,930
Thank you! Thank you!

100
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,150
What's going on?

101
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,130
What's wrong?

102
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,550
I sent our video recordings to Superstar K.

103
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,100
We made it through the first round.

104
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,810
They said to come to the regional auditions.

105
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,230
Really?

106
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,780
I'll call Dong Sup!

107
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,610
Hey, no, no, no!

108
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,860
   

109
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,880
I included this one when I sent in our tape, just in case.

110
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,160
They want us under the condition that Sun Jae is the singer instead of Dong Sup.

111
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,360
What?

112
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,030
Is he going it do it?

113
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,820
As for that... I will have to convince him now.

114
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,440
Your other son is home!

115
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,320
Gosh, who's this?

116
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,350
Our soon-to-be superstar is here!

117
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,330
Sit, sit. I'm just about to get the rice.

118
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,470
What's up? I thought you were busy performing all the time.

119
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,100
I have something to tell Sun Jae.

120
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,530
Oh, really?

121
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,380
Tell me what?

122
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,750
Let's talk later.

123
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:52,080
Wow, how did you know to make galbi for your other son?

124
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,860
How about the restaurant? You're home early.

125
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,400
Oh, I was meeting with Coach Ahn.

126
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,230
By the way, Sun Jae, I heard you've decided to go to the US.

127
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,490
- What? 
 - US?

128
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,120
Sol across the street told me.

129
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,740
You told her you were going to do rehab.

130
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,420
Gosh, you're making the right decision.

131
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,270
Dad, well...

132
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,150
Sol was so worried about you.

133
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,480
She begged me to send you as soon as possible so you can get treatment.

134
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,250
Gosh, I thought I found my daughter-in-law.

135
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,570
She told you to send me soon?

136
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:36,930
Yeah. So, I asked Coach Ahn to find out how soon we can get you in.

137
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,030
Hurry, eat. Why—

138
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,530
The meat is burning!

139
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,220
What? Rehab?

140
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,510
You studied your ass off to go to college!

141
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,580
I know.

142
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,700
I don't know why I even enrolled.

143
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,890
You haven't swam over six months since your surgery.

144
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,050
If I'm going to do rehab, now is the right time.

145
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,590
Everyone is dying for me to go to the US.

146
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,330
This will be my last try.

147
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,190
What if I said I'll never let you go?

148
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,310
Are you in love with me?

149
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,450
Damn it, I'm going to lose my mind.

150
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,790
What's wrong?

151
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,450
You told me to take time off to get my mind off things.

152
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,820
No way! Are you leaving because of Im Sol?

153
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,130
Because I told you "out of sight, out of mind"?

154
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,670
Are you crazy?

155
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,210
Why does she control your entire life?

156
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,640
My entire life? Stop being extra.

157
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,300
And why are you throwing a tantrum?

158
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,550
It's not your life.

159
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,010
My life is at stake, too.

160
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,170
Why is your life at stake?

161
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,520
You said you had something to say. What is it?

162
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,020
Whatever!

163
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,050
   

164
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,890
I wanted to talk to you about your victim statement.

165
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,490
It must have been scary.

166
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,900
Thank you for telling us now.

167
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,580
That night last year, when you collapsed outside Jooyang Reservoir

168
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,510
is the night you were kidnapped. Right?

169
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,080
Yes. Thank you for taking me to the hospital that night.

170
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,610
Sure. I never thought you would have lost your memory.

171
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,050
I should have looked into it further back then.

172
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,100
It's okay.

173
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,740
But that abandoned place where the crime happened...

174
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,160
I heard it's burned down.

175
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,970
Does that mean you haven't found any evidence?

176
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,560
Oh, no.

177
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,470
Fortunately, when we were inspecting the walls where the flames didn't hit,

178
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,800
we found blood that matched the DNA from the body in Jooyang Reservoir.

179
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,850
Really?

180
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,170
That's good.

181
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,200
He's wanted as a murder suspect, so we'll catch him soon.

182
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,000
- Don't worry too much. 
 - Okay.

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,770
So, on the day of the incident,

184
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,960
you said you were kidnapped in a taxi.

185
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,620
But when you escaped the crime scene,

186
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,260
you said he chased you in a truck.

187
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,810
I took the keys to the taxi that day as I ran.

188
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,790
Oh, I see.

189
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,530
Do you remember anything else about that truck?

190
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,110
Based on his activity, it's likely that he's on the run via a vehicle.

191
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:19,090
 I didn't see any info about a truck in the case file. 

192
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,380
No. There was so much going on that day.

193
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,670
I feel like there was a license plate.

194
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,610
But I can't really remember.

195
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,180
Then...

196
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,780
can you pick the truck that looks the most similar?

197
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,800
White.

198
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,450
It was dirty, but it was a white truck.

199
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,740
I'm glad they found some evidence, at least.

200
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,330
Oh, my god!

201
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,400
You said to ignore you at school!

202
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Do you have 1,000 won?

203
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,200
Geez, seriously!

204
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,300
   

205
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,500
Why isn't he answering my calls?

206
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Where did he go?

207
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,530
You were with Geum just now. Right?

208
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,630
Yeah. I was just...

209
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,370
Is this how he's going to be?

210
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,500
Hey, it's Ryu Sun Jae.

211
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,900
Where did she go?

212
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,020
I guess Ryu Sun Jae's taking this GE class, too.

213
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,280
It's a big class. I hadn't seen him in here before.

214
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,470
Wait, maybe he signed up because of you.

215
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,920
Stop saying nonsense.

216
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,820
It's an elective, but why is a PE major taking music in film class?

217
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,360
Sun Jae likes music and film.

218
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,220
Maybe...

219
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,030
he still likes you!

220
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,860
- Hey, hey. 
 - Maybe not.

221
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,430
Who's that? His girlfriend?

222
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,350
She was with him all through the retreat. Right?

223
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,300
I squeezed out too much.

224
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,390
Take some.

225
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,300
What?

226
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,800
I hate sticky stuff.

227
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,060
Your hands are so big.

228
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,960
- Want to compare sizes? 
 - Do you need to see it to know?

229
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,310
Look at her. I think she likes Ryu Sun Jae.

230
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:31,560
That's a trick straight from an online blog on how to get a guy.

231
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,060
Cute.

232
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,850
How is that cute?

233
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,020
I mean, I guess boys might go crazy for it.

234
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:44,610
Silent films are films without recorded sound, in particular, without dialogue.

235
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,180
The idea of putting film and sound together was part of cinema from its conception,

236
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:56,310
but due to technical difficulties, silent films dominated the industry until the late 1920s.

237
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:02,590
After the 1920s, mainstream culture formed around Gyeongseong...

238
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,500
   

239
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,870
   

240
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,800
Wow, you really are young.

241
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,600
You can drink that much at the retreat and drink more now?

242
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,270
I need to drink up while I can.

243
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,230
This is why we studied so hard in high school. Cheers!

244
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,000
Sweet.

245
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,780
Hey, how's Geum doing lately?

246
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,740
Is he still crying over his ex-girlfriend?

247
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,610
Ask him yourself if you want to know.

248
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,720
I can't ask if he's not picking up—

249
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,840
I don't want to know that badly. I was just curious.

250
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,730
What are you talking about? You ruined it.

251
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,610
- You can sit here. 
 - Thank you.

252
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,230
- You can sit here. 
 - Thank you.

253
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,900
Let me know if you need anything.

254
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,170
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

255
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,030
 Cheers! 

256
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,600
 Sun Jae, can you come to an audition with me before you leave? 

257
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,560
What audition?

258
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,870
 Why would I go to an audition? 

259
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,070
Hey, where...

260
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,840
What?

261
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,580
What do you mean you can't find it?

262
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,660
Fine.

263
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,760
Hey, I'll go get Cho Rong.

264
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,500
He really has no sense of direction!

265
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,300
See you later.

266
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,630
Hyun Joo, are you asleep?

267
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,050
Hey! Hey!

268
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,990
Why is he ignoring my calls?

269
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,500
Maybe I should break into his house.

270
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,200
Let's go home.

271
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,010
I'll get the check. Meet me outside.

272
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:12,050
Yeah! Stand up!

273
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,410
Stand up!

274
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,750
♫  Congratulations!  ♫

275
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,440
♫  Congratulations!  ♫

276
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,980
♫  Congratulations to you!  ♫

277
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,890
- Ta-da! 
 - I'm sorry...

278
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,300
What?

279
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,600
When did you change seats?

280
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,260
It was so hot over there.

281
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,820
It's so hot.

282
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,340
 What do I do? 

283
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,390
Oh, no, am I drunk?

284
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,860
- My cheeks are red, right? 
 - If you're drunk, go home.

285
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,900
I'm not that drunk.

286
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,400
 What's wrong with her? 

287
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,080
So bitter!

288
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,650
Why are you drinking if you're drunk?

289
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,570
Where is Hyun Goo, anyway?

290
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,700
- Hey, Sun Jae. I heard... 
 - What?

291
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,770
you're taking time off and going to the US. Is it true?

292
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,670
I guess word spread already.

293
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,080
So, should I apply to be an exchange student and follow you?

294
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,610
- Why would you follow me? 
 - You're so clueless.

295
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,100
Because I like you.

296
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,330
Sun Jae, want to go out with me?

297
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,120
What? You don't like me?

298
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,810
 Do you hate me that much? You can't even stand to run into me? 

299
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,600
I turned left, and then I turned right, and...

300
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,840
Sorry. Are we interrupting?

301
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,540
Interrupting? What?

302
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,690
- Hey, l-let's sit somewhere else. 
 - Okay, okay, somewhere else.

303
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,170
Wait! Do you hear that?

304
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,160
What is that trash can?

305
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,550
Im Sol!

306
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,230
She's so drunk!

307
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,940
Thank you for this. Sorry!

308
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,000
Hey...

309
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,920
Hey! Hey!

310
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,530
That was Im Sol, right?

311
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:37,170
This is bad. She must have seen you and Da Hee kiss from under the table.

312
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,980
- Kiss? 
 - No?

313
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,650
 What are you doing? 

314
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,130
 Well... 

315
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,100
 You have an eyelash on your face. 

316
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,820
 I turned left, and then I turned right, and... 

317
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,400
- Is that what that looked like? 
 - Yes, the angle!

318
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,220
So, she totally misunderstood! Maybe she's crying, heartbroken.

319
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,410
Why would she get her heart broken?

320
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,130
- Im Sol has no interest in me. 
 - What?

321
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,620
I always thought she liked you.

322
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,710
When she heard you hurt your shoulder last year, she ran off sobbing so hard.

323
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,290
You misunderstood. You're the only one who thought that.

324
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,040
My hunch is right.

325
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,250
Why else would she hide under the table like that?

326
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,890
She's probably super jealous right now.

327
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,160
Jealous?

328
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,770
You said I was your first love!

329
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,220
You have no problem going out with anyone, I see.

330
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,470
Hung up on me for 10 years?

331
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,960
Not over!

332
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,610
I...

333
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,350
am not over Chae Won yet.

334
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,650
You just didn't have anyone else to go out with.

335
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,630
It's not that there isn't anyone else out there!

336
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,820
There isn't anyone else for me besides Chae Won!

337
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,970
A man should guard his lips closely.

338
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,480
Not offer it up to just any girl!

339
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,090
Offer it up?

340
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,900
Hyun Joo was throwing herself at me!

341
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,700
You shouldn't have accepted her advances!

342
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,280
"No." "I don't want to." Can't you speak?

343
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,260
You let her because you wanted to.

344
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,760
I mean... I didn't hate it.

345
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,560
It was like an unexpected gift.

346
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,800
Did you like getting a gift?

347
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,700
Did you like it?

348
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,110
 Did you like it? 

349
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,240
I know. I have no right to be jealous.

350
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,280
I'm fine as long as you're happy.

351
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,200
Okay, okay. Yes.

352
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,440
Geez! Whatever! I don't know!

353
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,870
- Sorry. 
 - That was you. Right?

354
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,690
It wasn't me. My brother is drunk and kicking himself.

355
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,910
No, the girl who ran out of the bar with a trash can on her head.

356
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,500
That wasn't you?

357
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,460
- No, it wasn't. 
 - Yes, it was.

358
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,750
- It definitely wasn't. 
 - Did you see it?

359
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,120
No. My eyes were shut.

360
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,500
I don't secretly watch other people kiss.

361
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,460
You did see it.

362
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,860
 She's probably super jealous right now. 

363
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,200
B-Bye.

364
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,260
How do you feel?

365
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,180
- What? 
 - You don't feel anything?

366
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,290
A-About what?

367
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,860
You're not upset?

368
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,580
Even though you saw me kiss a girl?

369
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,760
What would I be upset about?

370
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:13,080
Do you really feel fine about the fact that I'm leaving?

371
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,280
You want to send me off as soon as possible?

372
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,950
Okay. Got it.

373
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,360
Let me ask you one last thing.

374
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,140
I don't understand all this time travel stuff.

375
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,320
I don't care what time period you came from.

376
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,240
To me, the past you, the future you, it's you all the same.

377
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,420
But how about you?

378
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,400
In all the times you've lived, did you ever like me?

379
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,940
Not even for a second?

380
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,070
 I don't deserve to like you. 

381
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,540
No. Never.

382
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:04,200
♫  This yearning I can't hide  ♫

383
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:11,260
♫  I fall asleep missing you  ♫

384
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,390
♫  Your low and deep voice  ♫

385
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:27,480
♫  The traces of you that I can't forget  ♫

386
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:34,640
♫  If I could stop, even just for a moment  ♫

387
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,580
♫  I would embrace you right there and then ♫

388
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,900
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

389
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,240
♫   Our time together   ♫

390
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,350
 If I ever saw you again, 

391
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,290
 I wanted to tell you... 

392
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,940
 that I liked you, too. 

393
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,470
 That I missed you. 

394
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,610
 I really, desperately missed you, Sun Jae. 

395
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:13,040
♫  Your name is painted deep in my heart  ♫

396
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,160
Here.

397
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,040
Why do I have to deliver underwear every day?

398
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,310
I'm busy too, you know.

399
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,970
Want me to go commando, then?

400
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,790
And why don't you pick up the used ones?

401
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,170
I don't want to pick them up.

402
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,100
Just get new ones.

403
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,230
- Bye. 
 - Don't stay out late.

404
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,260
Chief!

405
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,730
Here you are.

406
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,360
The white truck that the kidnapping victim, Im Sol, was talking about...

407
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,090
Im Sol?

408
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,370
Did you just say Im Sol?

409
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,830
 Why would I go to an audition? 

410
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,130
Young man, are you enlisting tomorrow?

411
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,290
No.

412
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,410
I want to show someone my determination.

413
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,550
Hey.

414
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,570
Your hair.

415
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,390
Do you know why I shaved my head?

416
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,920
Why?

417
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
Sun Jae.

418
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,010
I...

419
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,760
want to... do music.

420
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,400
Dude.

421
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,540
Is this how much you want it?

422
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,520
My friend.

423
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,110
Will you come to an audition with me?

424
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,320
Fine! Let's do it!

425
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,640
Let's do it together. Music.

426
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,850
- Music. 
 - Stop crying, dude.

427
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:17,190
Stop crying. Seriously!

428
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,910
Why did you crop your hair so short?

429
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,000
- Sun Jae. 
 - Hey.

430
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,380
I thought the audition was next week.

431
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,640
- Huh? 
 - Hyun Soo called me and asked.

432
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,910
I was going to ask.

433
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,610
I'll do it.

434
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,450
I heard you guys might get cut from the club.

435
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,360
It would help to be on TV. Right?

436
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,470
Wait, it's this easy?

437
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,910
But it's not my fault if you guys don't make it.

438
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:52,400
A few days of practice won't make much difference.

439
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,530
I'll be there after my morning lecture.

440
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,780
See you later.

441
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,100
Okay. Be careful.

442
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,140
Okay.

443
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,360
Take care!

444
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,810
Fuck.

445
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,020
I wish he'd told me earlier.

446
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,630
Where did Hyun Joo go?

447
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,170
Amazing! Whose boyfriend brought flowers?

448
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:26,240
Oh, my god, he's so hot.

449
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,250
I didn't know we had a face like that around here.

450
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,180
What? Why are you...

451
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,060
Hey! Why did you come?

452
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,710
The underwear you took. I need them back.

453
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,910
- Come over here. 
 - Where are you going?

454
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,290
 I told you not to come here. 

455
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,190
 How long were you waiting? 

456
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,880
 - One minute. 
 - Liar. 

457
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,810
 - Five minutes. 
 - I'm not stupid! 

458
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,740
 How long were you waiting? 

459
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,940
 While those leaves fell 87,000 times. 

460
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,270
 You're crazy. 

461
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,560
 This crazy Kim Tae Sung waited for you ever since we parted ways. 

462
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,780
 Why? But why? 

463
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,570
 Did you like me? 

464
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,840
 - No. 
 - Then why on earth did you wait for me? 

465
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,540
 Because I loved you! 

466
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,570
 So much I could die. 

467
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,120
 So much I could go crazy. 

468
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,830
 So much the universe would scatter around. 

469
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,990
 Tae Sung... 

470
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,410
 I told you. 

471
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,080
 Im Sol, you're on my side forever. 

472
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,110
You son of a bitch!

473
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:46,020
I was just going to have one bite.

474
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,940
This is so pathetic.

475
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,370
Path... fine, I'm sorry!

476
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,570
I'm sorry that I'm so pathetic!

477
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,940
What are you doing?

478
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,920
What's with these flowers?

479
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,070
I'm not getting back with you, you know.

480
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,640
You like putting the cart ahead of the horse?

481
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,540
- What? 
 - These aren't yours. They're mine.

482
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,560
Someone confessed her feelings for me before I got here.

483
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,120
Good for you.

484
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,100
Here you go.

485
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,730
- Where's the underwear? 
 - Why would I have that on me?

486
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,730
Did you come here just to get that back?

487
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:32,550
Do you think I came all this way to give you that?

488
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,400
Then why are you here?

489
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,210
Well...

490
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:42,280
I was going to let it go, but I'm not that kind of guy.

491
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,590
I was worried about you.

492
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,550
I heard you got kidnapped last year.

493
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,340
You're Detective Kim's son?

494
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,840
Then, why did you live like that?

495
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,130
Wow, my ex-girlfriend is so kind.

496
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,460
Anyway, this is a secret. Don't tell anyone. Got it?

497
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,170
It's a big deal. You didn't even tell your family?

498
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,370
Why bother? I don't want to make them worry.

499
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:13,810
But are you okay?

500
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,430
You didn't get hurt or anything?

501
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,790
I'm fine. I'm here, aren't I?

502
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,810
My dad's good at his job.

503
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:26,250
He let go of my mom, but he's good at catching bad guys.

504
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,970
He'll get that jerk soon. Don't worry.

505
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,990
Thank you for caring.

506
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,140
Hey, I'm asking because you're Detective Kim's son.

507
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,970
Can I ask you for a favor?

508
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,530
A favor?

509
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,680
When Sun Jae saves me, they catch the Jooyang Reservoir murderer.

510
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,460
When he's about to get out of prison...

511
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:10,190
Later, in 2023, could you tell Detective Kim this?

512
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:14,350
Instead of protecting me, he must protect Sun Jae.

513
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,980
What are you talking about?

514
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,010
Protect what?

515
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,560
I can't tell you more than that.

516
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,330
Just tell him that.

517
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,930
Does it have to do with the Jooyang Reservoir murderer?

518
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,160
You're better at deducing than I thought.

519
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,740
It's my dad's case. You're the victim.

520
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,370
You wouldn't just ask me for a random favor.

521
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,440
You could have been a great detective if you tried.

522
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,700
But why 2023?

523
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,820
Well, that's...

524
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,200
I can't tell you why.

525
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,930
You can tell him yourself then.

526
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,290
Why are you asking me?

527
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,570
That won't be me, then, but the past Sol.

528
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:56,850
She doesn't know anything.

529
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:01,440
Hey, ex-girlfriend, can you say it in a way that makes sense?

530
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,540
What I'm saying is...

531
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,650
Fine. Sun Jae knows, too. I don't need to keep it a secret.

532
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,990
You know, I actually...

533
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,050
came from the future.

534
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,100
♫  You are a gift  ♫

535
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,060
♫  from the...   ♫

536
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,400
 She's totally wasted. 

537
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,990
♫  ...heavens  ♫

538
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,130
In Hyuk.

539
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,120
You really never played this song for Im Sol?

540
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,580
Im Sol?

541
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,630
Why would I play this for her?

542
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,210
Why?

543
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,400
Was I supposed to?

544
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,830
Then, how does she know?

545
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,160
 Did she really hear it in the future? 

546
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,110
Many households have this kind of truck. This won't be easy.

547
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,950
There are no CCTVs in this part of town.

548
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,780
There's one in front of the police station.

549
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,460
Send me all the CCTV footage from there.

550
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,500
What?

551
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,090
I doubt they still have footage from six months ago.

552
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,110
The footage from the day of the fire.

553
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,910
If he drove his truck here, he would be on camera.

554
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,160
The morning market?

555
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,790
 Don't wait up. 

556
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,330
- So, you won't be home tonight. 
  - Oh, and Sun Jae! 

557
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,040
I have good news.

558
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,450
- Good news? 
  - You know the rehab center in the US? 

559
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,700
 Luckily, an athlete ahead of you canceled at the last minute. 

560
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,370
You can get treatment right away.

561
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,940
So I just made the reservation.

562
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,550
 Usually, you need to wait for months. This is fate! 

563
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:17,300
I was running around all day booking airplane tickets.

564
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,810
 Go home and check. 

565
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,420
 And submit a request to take time off tomorrow. Okay? 

566
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,010
When do I leave?

567
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,450
 Huh? So... 

568
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,160
 it is a bit soon. 

569
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:34,420
Fine, let's say I believe you. Tell me.

570
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,980
Who's winning the Korean Series Finals this year?

571
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,720
I don't remember. And I can't tell you anyway.

572
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,440
Then, why should I believe you?

573
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,870
You're free to believe me or not.

574
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,890
But please remember what I said for the next 15 years

575
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,520
and make sure to tell Detective Kim.

576
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,050
You might be saving someone's life. Okay?

577
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:59,160
Does something happen to future Ryu Sun Jae?

578
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,210
Does he get hurt or something?

579
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:05,710
I told you I can't tell you what happens in the future.

580
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,080
How can you ask your ex-boyfriend to protect another dude?

581
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,750
Making me jealous.

582
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,040
You flirt like it's breathing.

583
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,430
You player.

584
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,860
It's dark in this part of town.

585
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,360
Here. Hold it.

586
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,020
I'm not holding your hand!

587
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,030
Not my hand.

588
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,510
You can hold onto this.

589
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,320
Stop messing with me! Go!

590
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,710
How far will you follow me?

591
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,480
I'll walk you home.

592
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,120
I know they haven't caught him yet.

593
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,020
What if he comes after you?

594
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,450
It's okay. He won't yet.

595
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:48,280
Not yet?

596
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,390
Hi, Mom.

597
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,000
What?

598
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,400
- Why are you so late? 
 - What's going on?

599
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,150
Who's this? Tae Sung, my daughter's ex-boyfriend!

600
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,850
- Mom! 
 - Hello.

601
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,350
Last time, there was a fire. This time, a flood.

602
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,100
I get to see you every time there's a disaster over here.

603
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,280
How nice. Cold!

604
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,200
Why is Sun Jae holding up a bowl?

605
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,640
I asked him to come over to help.

606
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,790
- Grandma... 
 - Then should we just let it flood?

607
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,200
Gosh, that girl.

608
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,180
Geum just left to get Mr. Kim, who fixed our pipes last time.

609
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,120
We just have to wait a little. Cold!

610
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,390
Still! This is insane.

611
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,430
Hey, I'll do it. Give it to me.

612
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,390
It's fine.

613
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,280
You brat. Can't you see my arms hurt?

614
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,100
You do it!

615
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,850
- I'll do it. 
 - Would you, Tae Sung?

616
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,520
Do you have time?

617
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,250
All I have is time.

618
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,920
How lovely.

619
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,750
- Mom! 
 - What?

620
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:15,450
Where is all this water coming from?

621
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,100
Is it leaking from somewhere else?

622
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,610
My goodness.

623
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,910
Hey, Sol! Here!

624
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,880
Send them home already!

625
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,950
They volunteered to help!

626
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,330
I didn't call them!

627
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,390
Here we go.

628
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,080
Gosh, we should throw out this water.

629
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,440
- Oh, my. 
 - Hey, hold this for a second.

630
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,850
- What? 
 - Hold it.

631
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,960
Let me move it for you.

632
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,900
So polite.

633
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,710
Why did you break up?

634
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,880
- Mom! 
 - What?

635
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,650
Tae Sung, you're so good-looking

636
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,580
and you're good at helping out, too!

637
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,410
I'm a good one, Mother.

638
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,120
Mother?

639
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,170
Hurry up and hold yours.

640
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,880
Mother?

641
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,360
She's not the father.

642
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,750
Mom.

643
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,120
Look at Sun Jae's arms!

644
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,800
You can tell by his body that he's an athlete.

645
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,020
Right, compared to someone who sits around,

646
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,950
my muscles are built differently.

647
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,580
I sit around?

648
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,560
Am I wrong?

649
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,950
Bok Soon, Mr. Kim is here. Go upstairs.

650
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,430
He's here?

651
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,270
Sol, let's go to the roof and bring down a big bowl.

652
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,830
- Grandma. 
 - Mom, you don't need to go.

653
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,030
Okay, gosh...

654
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,580
Just go.

655
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,980
You splashed me.

656
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,710
You're already wet. What's a little splash?

657
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,680
Geez, hey.

658
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,800
Hey, you're already wet. What's a little splash?

659
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,680
Hey. Take it.

660
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,140
Geez, I just cleaned those floors! Kim Tae Sung!

661
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,490
Get it together.

662
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,810
- What? 
 - If you're not going to do it properly, just leave.

663
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,210
Are you their son-in-law?

664
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,060
Stop telling me what to do.

665
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,060
Why are you here holding up a bowl?

666
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,800
Her ex-boyfriend?

667
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,780
So, you're not her friend or her ex-boyfriend.

668
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,650
I'm her neighbor!

669
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,810
Neighbors are closer than distant relatives.

670
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:07,760
No. Someone she rejected is worse than a stranger.

671
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,400
Baek In Hyuk, that blabbermouth.

672
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,180
At least I dated her once.

673
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,520
You didn't date her. You used her.

674
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,070
How would you know?

675
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,330
- What? 
 - What if I actually had feelings for her?

676
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,150
What are you doing?

677
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:38,980
What would I do with you? But Sol's another story.

678
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,360
Shit, you...

679
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,630
Stop messing with Sol.

680
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,420
What do you even know about Sol?

681
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,110
Seriously.

682
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,590
Grandma! Where did it burst?

683
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,740
In the boiler room, I think.

684
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,730
Mr. Kim is fixing it.

685
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,080
Let's go downstairs and clean up.

686
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,380
Okay, okay.

687
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,880
No!

688
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,200
Sun Jae! Kim Tae Sung!

689
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,250
Stop it, please!

690
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,680
My goodness, this is terrifying.

691
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,630
We might all die like this.

692
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,000
We're all going to die!

693
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,670
   

694
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,600
   

695
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,080
Hey. Why did you let go?

696
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,540
I saved you.

697
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,860
Hey.

698
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,340
Hey!

699
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,570
Hey, good work, you two.

700
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,320
- Thank you. 
 - How can I thank you?

701
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,480
Come upstairs, and let's have some food together.

702
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,100
- Mom! It's after midnight. 
 - What?

703
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,660
When did it get so late?

704
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,740
Oh, no, I feel terrible.

705
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,750
Too bad. Come over another time. I'll make you something good.

706
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,160
Yes. Call me anytime you want.

707
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Hold on. What do we do?

708
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,660
The buses must have stopped running.

709
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,920
Tae Sung, what will you do?

710
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,250
Just stay over. Your clothes are wet, too!

711
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,720
I'd love that.

712
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,450
That can't be.

713
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:41,500
Yeah, Mom. You can't let a boy stay over when you have a grown daughter!

714
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,360
I'm watching like a hawk. So what?

715
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,270
And Tae Sung is not that kind of guy.

716
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:55,350
Things that are bound to happen happen.

717
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,660
But I feel so bad.

718
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,910
- I'm okay sleeping over. 
 - Right?

719
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,170
He can sleep at my place.

720
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,750
That's a better idea!

721
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,850
Yup.

722
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,040
But the two of you are cool. Right?

723
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,530
Nothing happened just now. Right?

724
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,100
What are you talking about? We're close.

725
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,010
We are?

726
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,770
Do you have any water?

727
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:43,420
Wow, champion.

728
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,280
Champion.

729
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,950
What is the Citizens' Hero award?

730
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,670
Hey.

731
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,000
- Do you have any ice? 
 - Just drink it.

732
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,830
Yes, sir.

733
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,210
Do you really have to sleep here?

734
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:06,040
You offered!

735
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,260
Are you changing your mind? Even though we're close?

736
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,030
Here. Then, shut up and go to bed.

737
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,120
I can't fall asleep on the floor.

738
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,090
- Don't you have a bed in your room? 
 - Do you want to die?

739
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,470
I'm kidding!

740
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,500
Do you think I want to sleep in bed with you?

741
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,860
I'll sleep on the couch.

742
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,950
Here we are.

743
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,660
What are you doing?

744
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,220
What?

745
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,750
Are you standing watch?

746
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,080
You think I'll crawl over to Sol's once you fall asleep?

747
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,160
I can't say I'm not worried about that.

748
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,480
You and Sol both see me as an unredeemable piece of trash.

749
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,300
At least you know. Get out as soon as you get up.

750
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:08,540
I don't know if you're clueless, or if you're totally blind.

751
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,280
Can't you tell how she feels?

752
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,870
I don't get why you're so bothered by me.

753
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:22,020
- What? 
 - Don't waste your energy on me being jealous.

754
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,660
Just take care of yourself.

755
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,720
Why is Im Sol asking me to look out for you and not her?

756
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,950
You're huge, dude.

757
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,830
What are you talking about?

758
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,990
If I say more, she'll get mad at me.

759
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,620
Ask her yourself.

760
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,240
What is this?

761
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,680
Are you going somewhere?

762
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,270
   

763
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,910
   
   

764
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,130
 Luckily, an athlete ahead of you canceled at the last minute. 

765
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:01,820
 You can get treatment right away. 

766
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,170
 So I just made the reservation. 

767
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,190
Why leave so suddenly...

768
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,670
   

769
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:19,360
   

770
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,250
   

771
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,110
   

772
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:48,380
 National auditions for Superstar K! 

773
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:50,950
 In the heat of discovering new stars, 

774
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:57,370
 who will be that one star to win the hearts of Korea? 

775
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,510
   

776
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:03,380
Yeah!

777
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,050
Yeah!

778
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,320
So envious. He must be in.

779
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,950
I hope we get a T-shirt, too.

780
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,770
Hey, are you wearing a wig?

781
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,640
It looks so real.

782
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,190
I couldn't roll up here bald.

783
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:22,780
If it's onscreen, it's forever.

784
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,300
When is Sun Jae getting here?

785
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,220
What?

786
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,110
Oh, right.

787
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,840
He'll be here soon. Any minute.

788
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:43,950
 Little sister, can you look for my homework in the classroom and turn it in, please? 

789
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:46,410
What a loser.

790
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,400
Is it here?

791
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,740
Didn't Sun Jae say he's leaving today?

792
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,340
Why leave so suddenly?

793
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,800
It's not. His coach has been pushing for rehab since last year.

794
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,510
I should have gone to the airport to welcome him.

795
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,100
You mean send him off, dude.

796
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,330
He's on a 7:30 p.m. flight. He'll leave in an hour.

797
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,140
Too late.

798
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,220
Heartless dude.

799
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,220
Sun Jae!

800
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,940
Gosh, I barely checked in your bag.

801
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,690
It was so close to 23kg.

802
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,260
- What? 
 - So, the gochujang...

803
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:26,280
I wrapped it up nicely, but be careful so it doesn't explode.

804
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,550
The kelp and seaweed salad...

805
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,550
Dad, am I immigrating?

806
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:32,180
They give me a meal plan there anyway.

807
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,430
Shut up, punk.

808
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:37,410
You'll cry tears of gratitude for your dad every time you eat.

809
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:40,700
And call Coach Ahn as soon as you land.

810
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,350
He said he'll pick you up.

811
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,540
I got it.

812
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,360
If you're anxious, just come with me.

813
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,970
If it weren't for the restaurant, I would want to come!

814
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:52,780
We're getting a new meat supply today, so I should be at the inspection

815
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,420
I shouldn't be here right now...

816
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,170
So just get back to the restaurant.

817
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,780
You're an adult now. You can get on the plane yourself. Right?

818
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,170
- Yeah. 
 - All right.

819
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,330
Gosh, I'm so proud of you, my son.

820
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:08,320
I trust you, my son.

821
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,030
Okay. Have a good trip.

822
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,390
Okay.

823
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:14,770
Oh, you know, you take your shoes off for international flights. Right?

824
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,580
- Of course, I do! 
 - Okay.

825
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,660
   

826
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,420
We're next.

827
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,520
Where is Sun Jae?

828
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,960
Hey, Baek In Hyuk. You...

829
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,500
You'd better tell us the truth.

830
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,470
Actually...

831
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,410
Sun Jae can't come.

832
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:43,140
 What? 

833
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,320
 Hello! We are Eclipse! 

834
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:53,370
I thought you had four members. Where's the fourth?

835
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:56,770
Right, the singer. Where is the singer?

836
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,390
Let me get him right now. Just a second.

837
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,490
- Just a second? 
 - What's up with them?

838
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,090
Hello, I'm the singer Baek In Hyuk.

839
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,060
   

840
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,600
♫  This yearning I can't hide  ♫

841
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:57,680
♫  I fall asleep missing you  ♫

842
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:04,720
♫  Your low and deep voice  ♫

843
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,210
He really left.

844
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:12,890
That's good.

845
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:21,100
♫  If I could stop, even just for a moment  ♫

846
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,820
♫  I would embrace you right there and then  ♫

847
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,210
 I don't understand all this time travel stuff. 

848
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:29,170
 I don't care what time period you came from. 

849
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:33,050
 In all the times you've lived, did you ever like me? 

850
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,180
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

851
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,900
 Not even for a second? 

852
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,710
 No. Never. 

853
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:42,220
 I'm sorry I lied to you. 

854
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,800
 But, Sun Jae, the only thing worse than losing your heart... 

855
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,600
 would be to lose you forever again. 

856
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,980
 There's nothing I can do besides pushing you away like a coward. 

857
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,970
 We're in! 

858
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:18,350
 Sun Jae, we got in with your song! 

859
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:21,710
 - Let's bow to Sun Jae.   
 - Should we? Wait, which way is America?

860
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:25,730
- I don't know. Just do it. 
 -  Thank you, Sun Jae! 

861
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,300
Now, I just need a way to stay safe myself.

862
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,420
 Do you remember anything else about that truck? 

863
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:52,830
 Based on his activity, it's likely that he's on the run via a vehicle. 

864
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,590
Sun Jae! Why are you here?

865
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:33,630
- Why are you running so fast? 
 - Why are you here?

866
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:44,450
No, no, you can't come here.

867
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:48,340
Stop. Don't come!

868
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:29,740
♫  That night, when everyone's gathered  ♫

869
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:33,030
Why didn't you go?

870
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,550
I'm not going anywhere.

871
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,500
Why not?

872
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,860
You should have gone!

873
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:49,780
Why are you here instead of leaving?

874
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,950
You like me.

875
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:57,340
I know it all now...

876
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,900
why you keep pushing me away.

877
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,870
I know...

878
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,730
everything.

879
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,690
So, I came here to hold onto you.

880

884
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:40,300
 Don't waste your energy on me being jealous. 

885
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,210
 Just take care of yourself. 

886
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:46,220
 Why is Im Sol asking me to look out for you and not her? 

887
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,220
   

888

00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,710
 At midnight on January 1st, 2023, the Han River bridge. 

894
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:25,380
 Remember. Okay? 

895
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,760
 Why does it have to be that day? 

896
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,510
 It's a gift that will only be meaningful on that day.

 This is my gift for you.

 Will this gift make its way to the future you?

 - Why are you worried about me? 
 - Because I want to protect you. 

912
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,370
 Why? Why do you need to protect me? 

913
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,350

2023.

918
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,200
I die that year. Right?

919
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,880
By chance...

920
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,590
do I die... because of you?

921
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,800
Trying to save you?

922

No. That's not it, Sun Jae.

stop running away from me.
