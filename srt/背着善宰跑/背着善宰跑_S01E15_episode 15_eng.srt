00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,570
   

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,820
   

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,640
   

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,560
   

5
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:39,200


6
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,290
 Why aren't you saying anything? 

7
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,390
 It's so pretty. 

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,980
 It's so pretty that I'm at a loss for words. 

9
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,920
♫   A long hidden time  ♫

10
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,280
♫  It calls us back again  ♫

11
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,090
♫  Wherever I am ♫

12
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,390
♫  At the end, it's always you  ♫

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,550
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,620
Maybe we'll die together right here.

15
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,880
 Ferris wheel riders, we apologize for the inconvenience. 

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,560
 We're having electricity supply issues. 

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,670
 Operations are paused momentarily. 

18
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,620
 We plan on resuming service shortly. Thank you for your patience. 

19
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,210
♫  All my life, it's you  ♫

20
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,560
How long do we have to sit here like this?

21
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,830
You look peaceful.

22
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,150
You're even sleeping.

23
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,720
Thankfully, it seems like we won't die today.

24
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,520
Hey, Im Sol. Wake up.

25
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,820
Im Sol?

26
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,090
Hey, are you sick or something?

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,760
You're burning up.

28
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,300
Im Sol, wake up.

29
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,200
Hey, Im Sol.

30
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,740
   

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,590
 If I told you you might die if you get close to me, 

32
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,990
 would you still want to do it? 

33
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,450
Anyhow, what a strange woman.

34
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,810
Sun Jae...

35
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,550
Sun Jae...

36
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,610
Sun Jae...

37
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,490
You'll feel better soon.

38
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,620
Get some sleep.

39
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,560
Hyung, I have the medication.

40
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,610
What was that?

41
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,670
The way you'd treat your woman.

42
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,500
What are you saying? I just didn't want her to wake up.

43
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,880
That's what I mean.

44
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,210
You should wake her up and send her home. Why let her sleep?

45
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,740
Will you let her stay the night?

46
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,540
Should I wake up a sick person at the crack of dawn?

47
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,610
So, you want to be alone with a girl at this crack of dawn?

48
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,130
W-What are you imagining?

49
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,740
- Alone? You're here, too. 
 - What do you mean? A woman?

50
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,850
A woman? Hey, you—

51
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,020
Why are you guys here?

52
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,030
We were drinking, and we came here to have our second round.

53
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,300
We want to talk about our performance, too!

54
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,500
Is the doorbell just for decoration? My place isn't company housing!

55
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,800
Hey, I didn't know you had a woman.

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,150
When did you start seeing someone?

57
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,020
I thought you had a crush on me.

58
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,030
Who is it? I thought this was a no-female zone.

59
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,290
Ryu Sun Jae!

60
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,290
Guys, you've been drinking, so let me take you all home.

61
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,570
If you have a woman, you should introduce her to us first!

62
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,770
- Who is it? 
 - Hyung! Is she pretty?

63
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,320
 Don't get in their way. Let's just go. 

64
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,340
 - We're leaving.  
 - I'm exhausted.

65
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,040
 Let's go! 

66
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,290
Am I at Sun Jae's place?

67
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,380
Are you all right?

68
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,810
How are you feeling?

69
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,470
W-Why am I here?

70
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,370
Don't you remember?

71
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,900
You got sick and passed out.

72
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,870
If I got sick and passed out, why am I here?

73
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,800
The wait at the ER can be hours.

74
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,750
You had an extremely high fever.

75
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,220
I thought you might die if I left you.

76
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,300
 You should have left me to die. 

77
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,010
You should have taken me home, then. You know my address.

78
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,850
My place was closer.

79
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,190
Still, how could you...

80
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,000
I had no choice.

81
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,330
To the person who cared for you and even asked a doctor friend the difficult favor of coming over in the middle of the night,

82
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,770
and are you getting upset at me?

83
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,130
Oh, no...

84
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,150
I owe you for yesterday. Thank you.

85
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,170
Just with words?

86
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,030
I'll pay you back. I will.

87
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,580
Let's talk over a meal.

88
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,980
I skipped dinner last night because I was looking after you.

89
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,240
Oh, well, I think I need to go home.

90
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,970
I won't forget to pay you back.

91
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,450
Enjoy your meal.

92
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,010
Where are my shoes?

93
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,890
I left your shoes in the van while rushing here.

94
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,460
I'll tell my manager to bring them over.

95
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,570
- What? 
 - It'll take about 30 minutes.

96
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,530
Why don't we have breakfast together?

97
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,880
Unless you want to leave barefoot.

98
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,290
It's still hot. Blow on it to cool it down.

99
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,970
 Blow on it to cool it down. 

100
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,100
 What was that? A deja vu? 

101
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,750
Why are you not eating and just staring at it?

102
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,480
Maybe you, a grown adult, will pass out so easily because you don't eat well.

103
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,560
I eat plenty.

104
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,250
Are you feeling better?

105
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,970
Your fever broke.

106
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,470
Why are you looking at me like that?

107
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,290
Oh, n-nothing.

108
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,840
You didn't make this yourself, did you?

109
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,970
    
 They delivered it to me fresh.

110
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,120
Just like my (fresh) image.

111
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,230
You don't know how to let something go, do you?

112
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,100
You have some strange sleep habits.

113
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,370
What? Me?

114
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,100
Don't you remember what you did to me in your sleep?

115
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,600
What I did to you?

116
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,850
What did I do?

117
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,700
Well...

118
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
Never mind.

119
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,620
I think it's best if you don't know.

120
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,970
Why? How come?

121
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,240
Because you might die of embarrassment.

122
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,240
By the way, your neck...

123
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,710
Never mind.

124
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,180
So, how will you pay me back?

125
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,790
It's not going to be convenience store coffee again. Right?

126
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,480
Then what else do you want?

127
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,400
Don't quit your job.

128
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,670
If they lose you, an employee who does it right, gets it done, and makes it work,

129
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,360
it will be a great loss for the company.

130
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,000
I heard it's your dream to make your own movie.

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,040
That's what CEO Lee said.

132
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,490
You know how many brilliant scripts never see the light of day.

133
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,280
Yet you'd give up an opportunity like this?

134
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Is that all your dream amounts to?

135
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,960
I also have other dreams.

136
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,810
Like what?

137
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:14,730
For the person I love to live a long, happy life.

138
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,040
Who is that?

139
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,770
It's a secret.

140
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,110
How is that related to quitting your job?

141
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,840
It is related. So, mind your own business.

142
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,190
Thank you for breakfast. When is your manager coming?

143
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,690
I'll drive you home. Let's go.

144
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,140
What? You said my shoes were in the van.

145
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,600
I hid them because I thought you might run away.

146
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,560
Aren't you coming?

147
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,000
- Are you moving into my place? 
 - I'm coming!

148
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:26,170
Have you seen a person who looks like this in the area recently?

149
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,720
I haven't.

150
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,120
We'll give you the apartment CCTV footage.

151
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,500
Could you investigate this quietly?

152
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,520
The residents will be sensitive about talk of "kidnapping."

153
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,820
 I said I'm fine. 

154
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,050
 I'll take you home. 

155
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,430
I can go by myself.

156
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,540
Why are you here?

157
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,970
Ryu Sun Jae?

158
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,250
Were you two together?

159
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,680
That's... well...

160
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,250
Isn't that Ryu Sun Jae?

161
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,370
It's Ryu Sun Jae.

162
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,260
- Last night... 
 - I'm... here for work.

163
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,840
I stopped by this morning to do some serious business talk.

164
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,330
Ryu Sun Jae is going to star in a movie I'm producing.

165
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,190
A movie?

166
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,130
I work at a film production company.

167
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,790
You could say I'm his business partner.

168
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,330
Please don't spread rumors just because I came from his place.

169
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,580
I'll lose my job!

170
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,800
So, you're not quitting after all.

171
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,620
Wait, why are you here?

172
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,100
I'm here for work, too.

173
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,780
You're done with work. Right?

174
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,260
Let's go. I'll drive you to work.

175
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,880
Yes!

176
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,770
Let me know once you've read the pitch.

177
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,470
Let's go.

178
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,250
 I thought you were my girlfriend. 

179
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,900
 Why am I your girlfriend? 

180
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,020
 Are you a boy, then? You're a girl. 

181
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,110
 Give me a freaking break. 

182
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,940
That guy?

183
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,470
Geez. She said she doesn't have a boyfriend.

184
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,850
 For the person I love to live a long, happy life. 

185
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,300
Geez! Seriously!

186
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,940
 Sun Jae... 

187
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,610
 Sun Jae... 

188
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,340
Calling my name so desperately like that...

189
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,810
Holding my hand that tightly...

190
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,930
Heartwrenchingly!

191
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,300
I'm going to wash all of these.

192
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,640
Why are you not eating the pizza crust and just piling them up like this? What a waste!

193
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,040
I won't force myself to eat something because it's wasteful anymore.

194
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,070
I think I've mistreated myself too much until now.

195
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,050
I'll treat myself like a VIP from now on.

196
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,880
Yes. From now on, we'll only eat the yummy middle part of the pizza.

197
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,780
We'll only eat the crispy outer edges of pancakes.

198
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,420
We'll only eat the sweet, red parts of strawberries and watermelons. Let's live like that.

199
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,070
Eat only the tender leg meat of chicken.

200
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,450
Let's only scoop out the soft insides of bread.

201
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,380
Why are you two acting crazy as a set this morning?

202
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,770
Bo Ah, want some yogurt?

203
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,840
What's wrong with your mom and dad?

204
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Mom! Don't lick the lid! It makes you look poor!

205
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,230
Do you two think you're millionaires or something?

206
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,650
Even Melon Musk wouldn't be like this!

207
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,160
Honey, when do we get the prize money?

208
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,940
The lottery ticket is from a year ago. Doesn't it expire soon?

209
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,880
Right. The prize money.

210
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,730
We need to claim it now.

211
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:06,130
You said I was your role model.

212
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:11,540
I've looked after you from the start. How can you do this to me?

213
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,370
I'm sorry about yesterday.

214
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,010
I shouldn't have spoken so emotionally.

215
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,440
If you're sorry, take back saying you'll quit!

216
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,290
   

217
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,600
I'll come in until you have my replacement.

218
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,760
I was looking through the apartment's CCTV footage.

219
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,180
Look at what was captured near the parking lot.

220
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,430
It's the guy in the sketch.

221
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,700
Is that a taxi? He's a taxi driver?

222
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,500
We couldn't make out the license plate.

223
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,600
I looked for other angles, but there weren't any.

224
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,940
This car's black box must have the footage of the license plate.

225
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,250
Oh, I looked for that already.

226
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,010
The owner of that car is super famous.

227
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,820
Who?

228
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,190
Ryu Sun Jae?

229
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,450
Gosh, that's good.

230
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,690
Bo Ah, do you like coming to the spa with Grandma?

231
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,050
I like it!

232
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,360
I like it!

233
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,230
So loud.

234
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,570
Seriously?

235
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,790
Mister, excuse me.

236
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,850
You can't snore here.

237
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,740
Mister, go snore at home.

238
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,540
Gosh, seriously amazing.

239
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,520
What? What was that?

240
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,970
There are lights in my eyes!

241
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,130
- What is going on? 
 - You can't snore like that in public.

242
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,280
You're not letting other people sleep. I thought a tank was passing by!

243
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,980
- Did I do that? I'm sorry. 
 - Yes.

244
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,580
I was so tired.

245
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,280
Grandma?

246
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,740
I like it!

247
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,160
Hold on. You're the owner of Gold Video!

248
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,800
   

249
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,570
What are you staring at?

250
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,300
Staring? I'm not staring at anything.

251
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,850
H-H-Hold on.

252
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,620
What?

253
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,620
You were staring at this.

254
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,290
No, I wasn't.

255
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,610
What? She left her medication here!

256
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,740
How can she leave her medication here when she's sick?

257
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,110
This is a pretty big deal.

258
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,000
This is pretty awkward.

259
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,860
Also, I don't think it's that big of a deal.

260
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,860
What? This isn't a big deal?

261
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,680
Do you even know how antibiotics work?

262
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,400
Prescribed antibiotics can't be stopped in the middle and must be completed to the end.

263
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,170
Even if you feel better, you can't skip a single dose!

264
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,410
Oh, really? Amazing.

265
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,500
If you stop it when you want, you'll develop a tolerance.

266
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,800
So, they don't work the next time you take them.

267
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,490
If Im Sol gets extremely sick or something, it'll weigh on me.

268
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:50,540
She'd never be in acrisis just because she skipped some pills.

269
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,260
Never say never.

270
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,770
All right. I'm exhausted and don't want to go anywhere,

271
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,930
but I have no choice but to take it to her.

272
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,010
Then get some rest. I'll drop it off on my way.

273
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,260
- Why would you go? 
 - You just said you're exhausted.

274
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,120
No, no. Your eyes are droopy.

275
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,930
I'll go.

276
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,020
- Dong Seok. 
 - Yes?

277
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,760
I don't want to make you run my little errands.

278
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,010
Leave it and go home.

279
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,950
It's fine. It's not the first time I've done it.

280
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,470
I'll go.

281
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,710
- Dong Seok! 
 - What?

282
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,800
I'm trying to respect your 9-6 hours.

283
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,130
It's already 8.

284
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,440
I'm going home. Thank you.

285
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,100
I knew it was Ryu Sun Jae.

286
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:55,320
I should have gotten an autograph when he dropped off Mom.

287
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,970
Stop by the restaurant sometime, and I'll get you an autograph.

288
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,450
Really? Thank you. We'll definitely drop by.

289
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,770
It must be so nice to have a famous son.

290
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,340
I was watching the entertainment news the other day.

291
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,690
They said Ryu Sun Jae owns a 10-story building in Cheongdam-dong.

292
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,500
- A building in Cheongdam-dong? 
 - Yes.

293
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,140
No, no.

294
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,920
- It's not true? 
 - No.

295
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,730
- It's a rumor, then. 
 - Not Cheongdam-dong, Seocho-dong.

296
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,120
Not 10 stories. Six.

297
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,440
I guess there are four underground floors, so it's 10 combined.

298
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,710
I don't know. I'm not good at math.

299
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,470
They just opened a Starbucks on the first floor.

300
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,600
- A Starbucks? 
 - Yes.

301
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,990
Wow, I'm so jealous! My goodness!

302
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,850
So, does your son have a significant other?

303
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,290
No.

304
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,580
I want him to find his match and get married, but...

305
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,940
it must be so hard for him to date when he's so busy.

306
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:55,550
Great. I happen to know a girl who's wholesome and smart.

307
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,010
- Should I introduce her to your son? 
 - What?

308
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,610
She's wholesome, sweet, smart, and...

309
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,310
works in film, so she'll have plenty to talk about with your son.

310
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,560
And most of all, she's stunningly beautiful.

311
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,910
- Really? 
 - Yes.

312
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,240
Who is it?

313
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,440
My daughter!

314
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,460
Oh, really?

315
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,290
No, thank you.

316
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:29,260
Sun Jae takes after me, so his standards are high.

317
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,540
When have you seen Sol?

318
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,210
When we were neighbors, I saw her come and go.

319
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,210
She would run around left and right all day long.

320
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,320
If I remember correctly,

321
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,520
she wasn't what I'd call "stunning."

322
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,240
Wow. Everyone's standards are different!

323
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,180
And who knows? Your son might be stunned by her!

324
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,890
Unless someone puts a stun gun on him, no.

325
00:22:52,890 --> 00:23:00,680
My son has worked with legendary beauties and hasn't blinked an eye at them.

326
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,070
I'm heading out now.

327
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,560
Those guys always end up falling hard for one woman.

328
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,640
I'm heading out, too.

329
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,900
How is a woman so strong?

330
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,560
I've never seen my son chase after a girl in my whole life!

331
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,080
Who's stunned by whom?

332
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,150
Gosh, I'm going to lose my mind.

333
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,820
What do I say?

334
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,670
I got it and came this way—

335
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,370
I mean, it was on my way.

336
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,590
Am I stupid?

337
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,510
The doctor said you need this, so I came even though I didn't want to.

338
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,480
Gosh, is this too rude?

339
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,310
Am I too dressed up?

340
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:50,500
Someone might think I'm going all out to impress her.

341
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,870
What? She has a kid?

342
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,570
Jae Ha, it's nice to take a walk with Auntie. Right?

343
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,480
 Auntie? Then he is her nephew? 

344
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,080
 What a relief. 

345
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,930
 What? What's a relief? 

346
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,940
How come you're still awake?

347
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,840
You should sleep early and wake up early.

348
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,830
 - She's sick and shouldn't be outside in this weather.  
 - Peek-a-boo.

349
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,150
 She's not dressed warm enough, either. 

350
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,780
Jae Ha, want Auntie to sing to you?

351
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,930
♫  Three bears live in one house  ♫

352
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,950
♫  Papa bear, mama bear, baby bear  ♫

353
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,870
♫  Papa bear is fat  ♫

354
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,270
♫  Mama...  ♫

355
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,130
Jae Ha, when are you going to fall asleep?

356
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,930
 Why are you hiding? 

357
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,760
 If she sees you, it'll be even weirder! 

358
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,630
I feel like someone was here.

359
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,940
 This is crazy. 

360
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,800
Excuse me, you dropped your phone.

361
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,890
I'll get it.

362
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,210
Just go.

363
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,110
What?

364
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,120
   

365
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,090
 Ryu Sun Jae, where are you? 

366
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,290
 Baek In Hyuk! 

367
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,720
 Hey, Sun Jae. 

368
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,270
 Sun Jae! 

369
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,720
 Why aren't you saying anything? 

370
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,240
 Ryu Sun Jae! 

371
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
- Come on... 
  - Hey, you! 

372
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,060
   

373
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,750
Ryu Sun Jae?

374
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,590
What are you doing here?

375
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,680
Can't you tell?

376
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,830
I was coming down the slide.

377
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:56,310
So, why were you going down the slide?

378
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,140
I like to do that from time to time.

379
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,500
- In the middle of the night? 
 - I can't do it during the day.

380
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,590
As you know, I'm pretty well known.

381
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,800
Are you here to see me?

382
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,400
Yes.

383
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,350
I mean, no.

384
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,640
Really?

385
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:21,990
Then, continue to enjoy the slide.

386
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,080
Wait!

387
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,170
Actually, I came here to give you this.

388
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,290
You need to take it for a few days.

389
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,420
You can't leave it behind.

390
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,580
Of course, I didn't come out just for this.

391
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,310
I was heading home after work, and I stopped by on the way.

392
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,680
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

393
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,340
Thank you.

394
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,580
I'm not getting the wrong idea.

395
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,770
Also, why are you out in this weather?

396
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,020
If you pass out again, who'd take care of you?

397
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:01,790
He'll only sleep in his stroller. What am I supposed to do?

398
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,940
He's not sleeping.

399
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,840
Goodness, Jae Ha, don't cry.

400
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,160
This is insane.

401
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,260
If you're done, go.

402
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,920
Haven't you ever calmed down a baby before?

403
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,710
Give him to me.

404
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,840
You have to hold him in a stable position to get him comfortable.

405
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,400
And if the person holding the baby is anxious, he can feel it, too.

406
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,630
So, no matter how much the baby cries,

407
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:56,670
keep your peace of mind, and calmly pat his butt.

408
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,970
Yeah? Pat, pat.

409
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,120
Cold!

410
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,300
Oh, no! Why is he vomiting?

411
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,990
Jae Ha, you feel better now?

412
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,970
So cute.

413
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,980
This is crazy. What is happening?

414
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,850
What is taking him so long to wash up?

415
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,250
I just got this!

416
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,290
Did you pour the whole thing onto yourself as a body wash?

417
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,350
I don't think you should say that.

418
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,330
Are you crazy? W-Why are you naked?

419
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:12,580
I don't have clothes to change into. What am I supposed to do?

420
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,060
I'm sorry.

421
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,260
- Put this on and go. 
 - I'm leaving even if you beg me to stay.

422
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,410
When you were sick, you wouldn't let my hand go.

423
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,030
When did I do that?

424
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,760
P-Put your clothes on. Now.

425
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,170
- Are they already here? 
  - Mal Ja, I'll do it. Step aside. 

426
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,340
Come here.

427
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,180
Over here!

428
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,300
You're home.

429
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,680
- Yeah. 
 - Where's Jae Ha?

430
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,920
- Sleeping in his room. 
 - What about Geum and Hyun Joo?

431
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,340
They rushed out somewhere.

432
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,360
Bo Ah, you have to brush your teeth!

433
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,820
I'll get some rest now!

434
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,630
Get some rest.

435
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,610
What are you doing?

436
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,000
Are we criminals or something?

437
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,190
How would you explain this to my mom?

438
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,030
I thought we were business partners.

439
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,810
Why is my "business partner" taking a shower in our house?

440
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,400
It's weird, isn't it?

441
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,790
Once everyone goes to bed, wait 10 minutes and leave quietly.

442
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,700
What should we do for the next 10 minutes?

443
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,260
D-Do what?

444
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,740
Let's just chill!

445
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,640
Have you got no manners? Stop snooping around a girl's room.

446
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,550
 I thought you didn't make friends with girls. 

447
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,870
Im Sol, you must see yourself as a girl to me.

448
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,790
What?

449
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,710
Nothing.

450
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,550
What is this?

451
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,470
Give it to me.

452
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,440
Oh, no.

453
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,960
It's okay. Just give it to me.

454
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,050
I think it's broken. I'll fix it for you.

455
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,500
No, just give it to me.

456
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,270
I don't like to feel bad about stuff.

457
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,460
I said it's fine.

458
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,480
Why are you holding my hand?

459
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,650
You shouldn't have tried to take it.

460
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,380
This must be from your school days.

461
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,930
It's the Jagam Girls' High School uniform.

462
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,790
- Stop looking! 
 - Cute.

463
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,670
Cute? What?

464
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,580
The uniform.

465
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,350
Right.

466
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,330
My school had cute uniforms.

467
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,850
So... you really never saw me back then?

468
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,470
What?

469
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,570
O-O-Of course not! That's why I said I never saw you.

470
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,810
I said stop looking.

471
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,070
Why not? It's cute.

472
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,780
Ryu Sun Jae, do you have a thing for schoolgirl uniforms?

473
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,190
No way. It's just cute on you.

474
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,740
How can you just say something like that?

475
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,310
You said we can't get caught.

476
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,390
 Im Sol, are you on the phone? 

477
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,720
Yeah, Mom! I'm done!

478
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,550
 It's late. Go to bed soon. 

479
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,730
I think everyone's asleep.

480
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,180
This is becoming a habit.

481
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,820
Pardon? What is?

482
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,110
Holding my hand.

483
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,120
You just go for it without hesitating.

484
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,970
Well...

485
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,200
Let's just go. Hurry.

486
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,990
What if someone comes out? Just go!

487
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,020
Hurry up!

488
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,760
Good night.

489
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,620
What is this?

490
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,900
Thank you.

491
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,200
That's Ryu Sun Jae.

492
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:09,580
"What does it mean to imagine kissing a girl?"

493
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,740
It wasn't my imagination, but it wasn't a dream, either.

494
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,350
I was totally clear-headed.

495
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,570
Did I hallucinate?

496
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,490
Were you fantasizing about kissing a girl?

497
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,530
When did you get here?

498
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,610
You don't need to fantasize. Just do the real thing!

499
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,060
I thought you had a girl.

500
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,460
I don't have a girl.

501
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,330
Who's the girl you brought home last time?

502
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,850
She's a business partner.

503
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,490
Are you fantasizing about kissing your business partner?

504
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:48,140
It's not like that.

505
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,780
Yeah, right.

506
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,560
It's just that...

507
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,450
every time I see her, I keep seeing these images

508
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:59,560
like a scene from a movie I saw a long time ago.

509
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,630
Really? How does it feel when they come up?

510
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,330
Maybe overwhelming? Or sad?

511
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,380
Why is this happening?

512
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,310
- You're smitten. 
 - What?

513
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,410
It's love.

514
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,340
- Go home. 
 - What?

515
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,690
Overwhelming? Sad? Your emotions are all over the place.

516
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,470
You're either smitten or crazy.

517
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,390
Fine, I'm crazy. You can go home now.

518
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,780
I'm here to tell you something!

519
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,000
You weren't picking up, so I came all this way.

520
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,630
What do you want?

521
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,270
Remember Kim Tae Sung from a band in high school?

522
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,780
He was an internet celebrity for being good-looking.

523
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,450
Anyway, he's a cop now.

524
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:40,220
He said he has a favor to ask you and wants to see you.

525
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,300
A cop?

526
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm Detective Kim Tae Sung from the Wonbok Station Homicide Squad.

527
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,660
- We meet again. 
 - That's right.

528
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,770
You two met?

529
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,360
Recently. Coincidentally.

530
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,950
What's this urgent favor you need?

531
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,040
We need the black box footage from your car.

532
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,340
Why would you need that?

533
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,700
Sun Jae, did you get yourself in trouble?

534
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,990
Shouldn't you tell me why you need it first?

535
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:10,000
A fan of yours was almost abducted in front of your home.

536
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,590
- What? 
 - Really?

537
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,100
Your black box camera likely captured the suspect's car.

538
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,810
We need to make out his license plate.

539
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,140
Is she okay? My fan.

540
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,160
Thankfully, she wasn't hurt.

541
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,720
What a relief.

542
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,330
I'll send over the video right away.

543
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,600
It's scary out there.

544
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,910
- I hope you get the guy soon. 
 - I hope so, too.

545
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,920
- I hope you get the guy soon. 
 - I hope so, too.

546
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,390
I heard you're starring in my girl Sol's movie.

547
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,610
 "My girl Sol?" What a joke. 

548
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,710
Yes. And?

549
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,400
You must be busy these days.

550
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,110
I'm always busy.

551
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,370
You don't even have time to go somewhere to talk about work?

552
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,420
That you'd make her come over to your place first thing in the morning?

553
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,220
Are you two close enough to meddle with her work?

554
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,580
Of course. That's my girl Sol.

555
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,770
Why do you keep calling her "my girl Sol?"

556
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,800
I'm just used to saying it.

557
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,670
I sense a bit of hostility in your face.

558
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,650
From me?

559
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,640
No way.

560
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,360
What's going on here?

561
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,500
- Did you come here to fight? 
  - No way. 

562
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,200
And why do you use honorifics?

563
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,280
You're my friends, so you're friends. Just speak comfortably.

564
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,430
Well, I didn't really come to make a new friend.

565
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:41,280
Right. It's not like this is a high school reunion.

566
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,560
Thank you.

567
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,990
Thank you.

568
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,960
Let's just have some tea.

569
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,630
So hot!

570
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,460
It's so hot!

571
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,120
Don't you think it's hot? You okay?

572
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,590
 Not really. 

573
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,030
It's freaking hot! Stop being such posers!

574
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,860
This is nothing.

575
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,880
It's lukewarm.

576
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,810
Crazy bastards.

577
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,610
- No one's here, right? 
 - No, no, no.

578
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,820
No one?

579
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,450
Let me see.

580
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,130
What is this?

581
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,320
   

582
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,120
It's the prize money!

583
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,540
What should we do with this money?

584
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,150
Mother, Grandma, Sol, our kids... let's get winter coats for everyone first.

585
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,890
Let's get dental implants for your mom.

586
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,380
We need to get a house, too!

587
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,790
But if we get a house with 400 million won, it'll turn zero real quick, huh?

588
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,770
Still, this is good, sweetie.

589
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:07,200
You don't have to live with your in-laws anymore.

590
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,360
But isn't the winning prize money usually in the billions?

591
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,250
I heard we got the lowest amount of prize money in history.

592
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,680
I heard there were 50 winners from the convenience store where you bought your ticket.

593
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,950
- Isn't that weird? 
 - Really?

594
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,700
   

595
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,840
   
 6, 18, 28, 30, 38, 40... 

596
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,510
   

597
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,640
 41! 

598
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,900
 What are those numbers? 

599
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:43,350
 Oh, my younger sister got them from a famous shaman. 

600
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:46,540
 I've tried them a thousand times, but nothing. 

601
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,870
 They're numbers from a famous shaman! 

602
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,380
 What were they? 

603
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,480
 They won't work anyway. 

604
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:01,170
 Listen up! 

605
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:04,890
 6, 18, 28, 

606
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:10,960
 30, 38, 40, 41. 

607
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,750
 One more time! 

608
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,230
 6, 18... 

609
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,440
That is weird.

610
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,660
That spot must be blessed!

611
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:26,220
Anyway, Honey, I think this year is our lucky year.

612
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,510
Gosh, what the heck. I'll let you do it.

613
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:33,410
The audition your friend mentioned? Go for it.

614
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,150
- What? Really? 
 - Yes.

615
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,370
Your luck seems to be finally shaping up, so go for it.

616
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:41,210
- Honey! 
 - But!

617
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,780
This is your last chance. Okay?

618
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,340
Honey! Thank you!

619
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,510
I have the best wife ever!

620
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,490
♫  I mobilize with your voice  ♫

621
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,640
We have to go pick up our kids now.

622
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,570
Yes. Let's go.

623
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:59,930
- Should we get BBQ today? 
 - Should we get beef?

624
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,350
 Thank you, little sister! 

625
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,730
Thank you for agreeing to star in our movie.

626
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,910
You'll forgive Producer Im's past mistakes. Right?

627
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,070
Sun Jae can hold a grudge...

628
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,620
Of course.

629
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:25,580
Your heart is as big as the ocean.

630
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,350
- Do you like the food? 
 - It's excellent.

631
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,110
When will you start filming?

632
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:38,580
While the script is being worked on, we'll find a director.

633
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:44,470
So, for the script, is there a possibility of the ending changing?

634
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,050
What's wrong with the ending?

635
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,700
I just think it's a sad way to end.

636
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,770
I mean, the world is so depressing these days.

637
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,140
People don't like things that are too sad.

638
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,810
I think the current ending is what's best for our protagonists.

639
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:04,310
Goodness, let's hear him out.

640
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:07,640
The male lead's opinions matter.

641
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,290
What kind of ending would you prefer?

642
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,880
The man who lost all memories of the woman

643
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,630
meets her again by coincidence, and falls in love with her again.

644
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,080
Inevitably.

645
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,860
Oh, my. It's a romantic ending.

646
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,320
I don't like it.

647
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:32,040
Isn't getting enmeshed again in their terrible fates the worst ending?

648
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,850
What if he dies again because he meets her again?

649
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,210
It's exhausting.

650
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:38,530
She saves him, and then he dies. She saves him, and then he dies.

651
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:42,220
Human beings are mortal from the day we are born.

652
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,930
Everyone dies at some point.

653
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,280
She wants him to have a long life.

654
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,690
Is living a long life that important?

655
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,550
It's better to be happy with the one you love, even for a moment.

656
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,920
She went through so much to untangle their fates.

657
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,740
If they fall in love again, all that work will be for nothing.

658
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,840
What is that?

659
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,720
That's just my personal opinion.

660
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,260
I respect the opinions of the producers.

661
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,240
- Of course, yes! 
 - Yes, right.

662
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:22,100
The producers will also take the male lead's opinions into deep consideration. Right?

663
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,990
- Of course. 
 - Yes.

664
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,560
These vegetables are so delicious!

665
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,260
Why are you following me?

666
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,930
Because I want to?

667
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,220
You said you can't do this in an open space.

668
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,920
If there are dating rumors, don't blame me.

669
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,560
I thought we were business partners.

670
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,050
I can say we talked about work.

671
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,740
- So, you want to talk about work? 
 - No.

672
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:57,980
I wanted to drive you home, but I don't have my car.

673
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,320
I'll see you get into a cab.

674
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,920
- Why are you doing this? 
 - What?

675
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,670
You know what I'm talking about.

676
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,920
Are you sure you don't have a boyfriend?

677
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,840
The cop you met in front of your house. You're not dating, right?

678
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,000
Why do you want to know?

679
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,260
I don't know.

680
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:22,210
Maybe I really am smitten with you.

681
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,110
Smitten? You just met me.

682
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,970
I know it's weird.

683
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,080
But I am interested.

684
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:40,250
I keep thinking about you... and worry about you.

685
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:52,860
I'm sorry, but... please stop being interested in me.

686
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,340
Why?

687
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,880
Three generations of your family might be destroyed if you get involved with me?

688
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:11,100
I... love someone already.

689
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:18,750
I love that person so, so much.

690
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:26,040
That's why I can't be with you, Ryu Sun Jae.

691
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,590
So, I'm begging you.

692
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,570
Please stop trying to get close to me.

693
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:41,200
♫  I fall asleep missing you  ♫

694
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,070
I've been rejected by you many times.

695
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,830
♫  Your low and deep voice  ♫

696
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:51,620
Okay. I can't forcefully hang onto someone who says they don't like me.

697
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,460
I won't cross your boundary again.

698
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:57,090
♫  I can't forget the traces of you  ♫

699
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:59,450
Thank you.

700
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:04,320
Also, it's true I've been rude to you, Ryu Sun Jae.

701
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,390
I'm sorry.

702
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,710
Are you saying your last farewell to me right now?

703
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:13,090
We'll see each other for work.

704
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,650
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

705
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:19,960
I rejected you. How awkward would it be to see each other?

706
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,020
♫  I want to turn back our time together  ♫

707
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,030
Ryu Sun Jae...

708
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,080
♫  I want to turn back our time together  ♫

709
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:32,000
Please stay healthy and be well.

710
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,270
I'll get going now.

711
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:44,050
♫  Your name is painted deep in my heart  ♫

712
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,500
You didn't have to come and get me when you're so busy.

713
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,190
You said you had a work dinner.

714
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,840
I didn't think you'd have your car.

715
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,560
Did you drink a lot?

716
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,650
A little.

717
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,340
Why are you looking after me so much these days?

718
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,250
Don't have a crush on this noona.

719
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,320
Am I not allowed to?

720
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:15,160
What?

721
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,740
Honestly, I get a little confused around you these days.

722
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,870
What are you talking about?

723
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:25,100
We've been friends for over 10 years.

724
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,490
But these days, my mind goes elsewhere.

725
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,420
Maybe I used to like you a long time ago?

726
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,050
I don't remember feeling that way.

727
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:34,690
But maybe I did?

728
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,740
I'm just in a weird place lately.

729
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,640
I think you're just confused.

730
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,660
I mean, I know you are.

731
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,150
Really? Want to date and find out if I'm confused or not?

732
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,100
I know you don't mean that.

733
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,900
I can't make any moves because

734
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,410
I'm worried I'd lose our friendship because of these confusing feelings.

735
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,500
I'm just in a weird place right now.

736
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,520
I thought you might notice, so I wanted to be honest.

737
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:16,940
You know... I have someone I haven't gotten over.

738
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:21,380
I know. That guy you won't tell me about.

739
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,940
I'm sure I'll be myself again soon.

740
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:30,120
 Yes. You will. You should. 

741
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:35,120
 You, Sun Jae, and me, too. 

742
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:47,030
Grandma, why aren't you in bed?

743
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,930
Hey, Sol! You're home.

744
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,210
Have you had dinner?

745
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,330
Grandma!

746
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,410
Grandma, do you remember who I am?

747
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,720
You'll poke holes in my face with those eyes.

748
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,960
It's been a while since you've remembered me.

749
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,940
You think Grandma forgot all about you?

750
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,720
- Yes. 
 - I haven't.

751
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,720
Memories don't disappear.

752
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,270
Millions of things you see, hear, and feel throughout your entire lifetime.

753
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,890
Where would all that go?

754
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:30,040
They all become a part of my soul.

755
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,780
So, my head might forget them,

756
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:38,060
but my soul never does. It holds onto them all.

757
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,120
 I... feel a little weird these days. 

758
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,050
 But these days, my mind goes elsewhere. 

759
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:46,540
 I'm just in a weird place lately. 

760
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,330
Is that really true?

761
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:56,370
Of course, it is.

762
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:03,600
I am traveling through my memories right now.

763
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:09,600
At one moment, I'm in my mom's arms at age three, playing with her.

764
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,640
In the next, I'm 18 meeting my future husband.

765
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,010
When I start missing my granddaughter,

766
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:25,590
I come back just like this.

767
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,200
Then come back more often. Okay?

768
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,860
Okay.

769
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:47,050
Let's do that.

770
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,820
Hey, Detective Seo.

771
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,270
When are we getting the black box footage back from forensics?

772
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,980
We just got them back.

773
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,280
With the name of the cab company, too.

774
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,290
We're thinking of starting filming early next year.

775
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:38,790
Regarding the director, we're in conversation with Choi Gi Sun.

776
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,650
You know, the one who directed "Again Love."

777
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:45,170
Or we could look for someone younger with great sensibility...

778
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,700
- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but... 
 - Yes?

779
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,280
When is Im Sol coming in?

780
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,900
Moving forward, I'm planning to be in charge of this movie.

781
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,850
Producer Im left the company.

782
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:00,580
She left the company?

783
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,690
Sun Jae, you didn't know.

784
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,940
I begged her to stay.

785
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:09,210
She said she wanted to go back to film school and quit.

786
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:17,720
 Ryu Sun Jae. 

787
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,280
 Please stay healthy and be well. 

788
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,510
 It really was a last farewell. 

789
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,570
How do I give this back to her?

790
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:36,180
I'm never going to see her again.

791
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:43,790
Hyung, get in.

792
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,740
   

793
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:01,580
   

794
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:04,300
   

795
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,200
What was that?

796
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,900
5663. Who drives this taxi?

797
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,850
Let me see.

798
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:29,660
   

799
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,710
We got him.

800
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:32,820
I think it's him.

801
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,780
Send the picture to the victim to confirm and get an arrest warrant.

802
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,320
Got it.

803
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,650
- Is Kim Young Soo driving right now? 
 - Yes.

804
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,950
When does his shift end?

805
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,440
 Ryu Sun Jae made a demo of the song in your pitch. 

806
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,850
 Check it out. 

807
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,560
How could he sing this song... 
    

808
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,880
   

809
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,130
 Memories don't disappear. 

810
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:21,430
 Millions of things you see, hear, and feel throughout your entire lifetime. 

811
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:24,260
 Where would that go? 

812
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:27,420
 They all become a part of my soul. 

813
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,130
 My head might forget them, 

814
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:36,040
 but my soul never does. It holds onto them all. 

815
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:07,320
It's been a while.

816
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:17,680
♫  I wished it would never end  ♫

817
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:23,740
♫  The day you first came to me  ♫

818
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:32,260
♫  I hoped it wouldn't just be a quick drizzle  ♫

819
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:37,540
♫  That was what I wished for, so deeply  ♫

820
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:41,020
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

821
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:46,490
♫  I've been thinking only of you every day  ♫

822
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:51,750
♫  You seep into my thoughts once again today  ♫

823
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:59,780
♫  You are a gift from the heavens  ♫

824
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:07,660
♫  In this lonely world I'll protect you  ♫

825
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:16,410
♫  You came into my life like a sudden summer rain shower  ♫

826
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:22,190
♫  I'm calling for you again today  ♫

827
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:30,800
♫  My precious one  ♫

828
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,910
Senior! We got an arrest warrant for Kim Young Soo.

829
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,200
I requested backup, too.

830
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,150
So, we just have to catch that bastard when he comes.

831
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:54,450
I noticed Kim Young Soo has a prior record.

832
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:57,910
In 2008, he was convicted of attempted murder and served six years.

833
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:03,040
The person who arrested him was Detective Kim Won Chul.

834
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,850
- Your dad. 
 - What?

835
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:07,350
What an surprising coincidence.

836
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,200
He's here.

837
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,460
What's going on?

838
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,470
Please step outside. Let's talk.

839
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:37,860
I have some questions.

840
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,870
Detective Seo, get in!

841
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,520
Requesting backup.

842
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,600
The suspect's car is moving from Hanchun Taxi Company toward Gangreung bridge.

843
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,800
Requesting backup immediately.

844
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:25,970
That crazy bastard!

845
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:35,720
Hyung, I'll bring the car here.

846
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,760
Okay.

847
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,750
 Passing time. 

848
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:06,320
 Thank you. For being alive. 

849
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,570
It's snowing.

850
01:02:56,450 --> 01:03:04,190
♫  If I miss you this much, will it come true?  ♫

851
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:06,170
 I was waiting for you. 

852
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:10,420
♫  I wanted to tell you before it got too late  ♫

853
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:15,200
♫  Love, I never let go even for a moment  ♫

854
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,410
 Mister! 

855
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:25,270
♫  I never forgot all this time  ♫

856
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:35,250
♫  If you come like the first snow I've been waiting for  ♫

857
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:41,660
 Sol!  
 ♫  Like a flower petal will you stay awhile by my side  ♫

858
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:49,590
♫  Love, I never let go, not even for a moment  ♫

859
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:56,250
♫  Will you remember this heart of mine?  ♫

860
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,100
 Sun Jae. 

861
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:03,380
♫  Crossing over all of time  ♫

862
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:08,900
♫  I'll find you, I'll run to you  ♫

Sol.

Sol!

865
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:22,300
♫  Maybe this time, I circle around you again  ♫

866
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,090
Sol.

867
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:28,660
♫  You're my destiny, I can't erase you  ♫

868
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:33,470
♫  Will I reach you one more time?  ♫

869
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,320
 Sol! 

870
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:42,100
♫  No matter where you are in time  ♫

871
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,200
♫  For me, it's you  ♫

872
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,260
Sol!

873
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,530
Get out of the way, bastard!

874
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:29,750
Get lost!

875
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,360
♫  This yearning I can't hide  ♫

876
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,420
 Why did you save me? 

877
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,040
 You should have left me to die! 

878
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,990
 Why did you save me and let me be like this? Why! 

879
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:44,010
♫  I fall asleep missing you  ♫

880
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,000
 Sol. 

881
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,000
 Why are you crying? 

882
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,140
♫  I can't forget the traces of you  ♫

 Sol, I like you a lot. 

884
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,550
 Sol! Im Sol! 

885

♫  If I could stop, even just for a moment  ♫

886

 Sol. 

887
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,150
 If I ever saw you again, I wanted to tell you... 

888
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:14,240
 that I liked you, too. 

889
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,020
 That I missed you. 

890
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:21,370
 I really, desperately wanted to see you, Sun Jae. 

891

♫  I want to turn back our time together  ♫

892
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:29,810
 Do I die because of you? 

893
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:32,450
 Trying to save you? 

894
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:35,410
 Sol, stop running away from me. 

895
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:37,710
 You can just like me. 

896
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:42,740
 If I die saving you, it's okay. I don't care. 

897

 Sun Jae!

 I like you. I like you, Sun Jae. 

899

 I love you. I love you, Sol. 

900
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:01,990
 Maybe we should have never met from the start. 

901
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:04,910
 No, we should have never met. 

902

♫  But at the end, please come back to me  ♫

903

 Is there such a thing as fate? 

904
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:18,460
 A certain destiny you can't change or cross? 

905
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,450
 If that's true, Sol... 

906
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:24,340
 my fate is that no matter when we meet, 

907
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:28,420
 the past or the present, no, in any moment in time...

 Stop right there, Kim Young Soo!

 Mark my words. Keep it a secret.

 Don't we look like newlyweds right now?

 Newlyweds? 

924

 - This is the right timing. 
 - Hey, by the way... 

925

 No, this is not the right timing.

 I get scared that you'll leave for another timeline.

 Sol, be with me for all of time from now on.
