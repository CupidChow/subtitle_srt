Hey!

7
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,000
 Why are you crying? I didn't make you cry. 

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,940
   

9
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,020
Why are you crying?

10
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,000
Why do you keep crying when you see me?

11
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,040
Hey! What did I do?

12
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,740
Hey! I think he made her cry!

13
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,390
I think it's a lovers' quarrel.

14
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,500
What? What did he do wrong?

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,820
- Come here. 
 - She's crying her eyes out.

16
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,730
Hey! Hey!

17
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,100
Sun Jae!

18
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,170
♫  I feel this strange feeling, I'm nervous  ♫

19
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,520
   

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,290
♫  My heart is beating fast, I'm dizzy, I'm just near  ♫

21
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:56,020
♫  Will it be embarrassing to say "I miss you"?  ♫

22
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,140
 I made such a scene yesterday, 

23
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,900
 and now I can't even say a word and keep crying. 

24
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,350
♫  You can look away, but you can still hear it  ♫

25
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:12,680
♫  The sound of my heart, can you hear it?  ♫

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,000
♫  Could I tell you how I feel inside?  ♫

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,180
 This is what you looked like at nineteen, huh? 

28
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,180
♫  This is just how I really feel  ♫

29
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,430
 Why is she staring at me like that? 

30
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,610
♫  I feel the warmth  ♫

31
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,700
Who are you?

32
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,240
What?

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,190
Oh... I'm a fan... no. 
  (Speaking formally) 

34
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,240
I'm your fan. "Piggyback Sun Jae and Run..." 
  (Switching back to informal speech) 

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,140
What?

36
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,390
That's my username for your fan club...

37
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,390
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,780
 Right. What nonsense am I spewing out? 

39
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,670
 This Sun Jae is just a regular student. 

40
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,130
 I can't do this. 

41
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,430
My name is Sol. Im Sol.

42
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,020
I know.

43
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,810
How?

44
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,630
   

45
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,800
Why do you keep crying in front of me?

46
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,130
You cried yesterday, too.

47
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,140
Oh... that...

48
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,270
You remind me of someone.

49
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,230
The one I liked a lot.

50
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,250
The one you liked?

51
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,960
A puppy?

52
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,770
A puppy? I remind you of a dog?

53
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,720
T-That's not it...

54
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,610
Well, that pup was a good swimmer.

55
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,070
So, you are saying I look like a dog that's good at swimming.

56
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,110
Something like that.

57
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,270
How did you even know where the match was yesterday?

58
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,320
Or what my name is.

59
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,840
 Okay, let's try to come back from this. 

60
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,610
 I can dupe a 19-year-old. Right? 

61
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,660
I'm a swim fan.

62
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,260
- A swim fan? 
 - Yes.

63
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,820
I told you, my dog was a good swimmer.

64
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,510
So naturally, I became a fan of the sport, looking up matches...

65
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,090
Naturally, I heard of you as the star of the swim team.

66
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,330
And naturally, I went over there to cheer you on.

67
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,300
And when I went there and saw you swim...

68
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,830
naturally, I thought about my dog and teared up.

69
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,870
Naturally, I told you that I loved—

70
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,800
None of this seems natural.

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,750
You...

72
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,570
Anyway, you must have been really flustered.

73
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,640
It was all because I thought of my dog.

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,420
What was the name of your dog?

75
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,490
His name? Name...

76
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,620
Name...

77
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,150
- Otter! 
 - You named your dog Otter?

78
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,420
Because they swim well! An otter, and my dog.

79
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,180
Then why not Seal?

80
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,930
Oh! Whoa!

81
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,870
Wow.

82
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,130
Here.

83
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,800
This was because of Otter, too?

84
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,590
 - Here. 
 - It's yours, take it. 

85
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,210
 No, Sun Jae! 

86
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,500
 Let's live together.  
  ("Live together" and "stay alive together" sound the same) 

87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,370
 Let's stay alive together. 

88
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,300
 Damn it. 

89
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,670
Gosh, I am going to be late.

90
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,310
I... I'm going to go. Sorry!

91
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,870
Hey, wait!

92
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,740
Where are you going? Darn it.

93
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,300
Hey!

94
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,870
I shouldn't have opened my mouth.

95
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,570
I made a fool out of myself.

96
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,510
Why did I even take this?

97
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,250
Sun Jae will be totally drenched.

98
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,110
I can't stand this!

99
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,910
Huh? Here it is.

100
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,600
I thought I was dreaming yesterday, so I didn't even get a good look.

101
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,550
- Here! 
 - You can't even pay to get this.

102
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,050
Wow, seriously?

103
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,160
I'm so jealous!

104
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,790
 Wow, it's been so long. 

105
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,670
Right, right, right.

106
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,730
Hey, guys! How have you been?

107
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,010
Oh, my goodness! Hi! Hi!

108
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,270
Wow! Da Hye, Bo Ram, long time no see!

109
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,040
Young Sun, you were such a good student.

110
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,820
Gosh! What was your name again?

111
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,200
Right, Kim Eun Joo!

112
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,440
You cuties, you!

113
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,450
Hi! Hi!

114
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,330
Sol! What happened yesterday?

115
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,560
Hyun Joo. Hyun Joo, Hyun Joo!

116
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,640
It's so good to see you!

117
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,940
Where did you go skipping class?

118
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,150
I went to your house to drop off your backpack, and you weren't there.

119
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,380
What in the world. Your skin looks amazing!

120
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,830
You were depressed about your dark spots, girl!

121
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,330
- Be honest. Something happened yesterday morning, didn't it? 
 - Huh?

122
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,420
 I wasn't myself yesterday morning. I don't remember... 

123
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,180
What did that guy say to you? Why did you go insane and skip class?

124
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,010
Yesterday? That guy?

125
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,050
Hello!

126
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,500
Oh, my! Teacher! Oh my!

127
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,400
Hey, Kwon, this place has been on the rental market forever. How come it's not rented yet?

128
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,950
Are you even trying?

129
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:25,580
Don't rent it out. Just sell and buy an apartment in Pangyo.

130
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,040
When they open a new subway route, prices will skyrocket.

131
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,990
Oh, you mean Pangyo in the middle of nowhere next to Bundang?

132
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,100
It did go up.

133
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,670
Seoul prices are on the decline. Why would I buy that?

134
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,850
Basic Instinct.

135
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,680
   

136
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,020
It's late by a month.

137
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,030
Who in the world is he?

138
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,200
   

139
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,570
This is Gold Video.

140
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,670
Please return your rental video.

141
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,270
I never rented from you.

142
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,690
Oh, no.

143
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,710
You did. That's why I'm calling you.

144
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,800
You rented "Basic Instinct."

145
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,010
I'm telling you, I did not.

146
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,020
Who's watching VHS these days anyway?

147
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,290
Even DVDs are out of fashion.

148
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,950
What did you say?

149
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,390
Someone else in your family could have rented it. Please check.

150
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,020
Please return it as soon as possible.

151
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,200
The late fee is 15,000 won.

152
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,810
What a funny man.

153
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,690
He's embarrassed about renting out an adult movie, so he's blatantly lying.

154
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,340
He must have watched until the tape got stretched.

155
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,000
Maha Prajna Paramita Pridaya...

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,930
He's here to ask for money.

157
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,540
Sir, we're churchgoers. Amen.

158
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,370
Hallelujah.

159
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,380
The Bodhisattva of Great Compassion...

160
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,730
I am the Buddha.

161
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,550
I am the Buddha for living with you. I am! I am!

162
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,440
Hey!

163
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,010
- Mom! 
 - Oh, my, is that you, Geum?

164
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,680
I almost fell for it!

165
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,230
What do you call it... method acting!

166
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,610
You were flawless!

167
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,380
Right? I'm good at it, right?

168
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,740
Good? As if!

169
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,020
What audition do have this time?

170
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,440
Why are you always going overboard trying to act when it never works out?

171
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
Mom. Mom. You never know with these things.

172
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,620
You never know. I could be stepping on the red carpet at Cannes.

173
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,720
You want to talk about being stepped on?

174
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,520
Go away! Go! Go!

175
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,610
I could bring my family along!

176
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,140
Cannes, my ass!

177
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,500
If you draw the graph according to the conditions, this is what it looks like. Let's see.

178
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,700
 The time is not changing... 

179
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,360
 Right, when I pressed this button, that's when I crossed over. 

180
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,050
 Is this a time machine or something? 

181
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,230
 Wait. If I press it again, will I go back to the present? 

182
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,570
 No, no. What if I go back and can't come back again? 

183
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,730
 Let's never press it. 

184
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,530
Number 15, come up here and solve this.

185
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,260
Hey, you're number 15.

186
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,760
It's the same.

187
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,280
- Im Sol! 
 - Yes?

188
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,430
- Come up here. 
 - Oh! Yes.

189
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,820
That could have been bad.

190
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,810
 Well, this is worse. 

191
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,290
 Time is a cruel thing. 

192
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,100
 How can I not remember anything? 

193
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,580
What's wrong? Are you sick?

194
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,920
Yes. I have period cramps...

195
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,850
They're really bad.

196
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,010
Go to the nurse.

197
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,240
Okay. I'm sorry.

198
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,930
Gosh, my back! Gosh...

199
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,810
Her period was over last week!

200
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:44,040
♫  I feel this strange feeling, I'm nervous  ♫

201
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,710
Where is my Sun Jae?

202
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,730
♫  I'm just me  ♫

203
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,820
There he is!

204
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,460
♫  Will that do?  ♫

205
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:58,110
I can see him whenever I want. This is nice.

206
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,900
Hey, the competition is around the corner.

207
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,320
- Gosh, he's a monster. 
 - Fighting!

208
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,300
Fighting!

209
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,960
Fighting!

210
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,190
♫  You can probably hear my heart  ♫

211
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,420
 I'll be right by your side and protect you. 

212
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,170
 I won't let you think horrible thoughts. 

213
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,510
Then, I'll need to be by his side for 15 years.

214
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,860
How can I get close to him?

215
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,870
♫  These are my sincere feelings  ♫

216
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,190
♫  I wish all day long   ♫

217
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,160
Am I smelling cigarette smoke?

218
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,360
♫   to fall for you   ♫

219
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,100
Huh?

220
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,650
Stop it! I'm serious.

221
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,210
 Are they seriously smoking right here? 

222
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,810
 The smell's going to get inside the gym! Those punks! 

223
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,970
Are you laughing at us?

224
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,570
Shit, I'll just—

225
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,470
♫   It's gonna be volatile I need you back around   ♫

226
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,020
♫  Sometimes I let you in and then you let me down  ♫

227
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,230
♫  And the more I do, and the more  ♫

228
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,470
Shit.

229
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,830
Hey, you guys!
 ♫  And the more, who... and the more  ♫

230
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,300
♫  And the more I do  ♫

231
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,710
Is this bitch crazy? You have no fear—

232
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,720
Where are your manners? Bitch?

233
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,450
You little punk! I'm older than you!

234
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,530
Coming to someone else's school to get into fights and smoke.

235
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,090
You're in front of a gymnasium.

236
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,900
Do you know how bad secondhand smoking is for the swim team's lungs?

237
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,990
You little pretentious... I'm confiscating this! Now go!

238
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,850
Go, I said. Why are you still here?

239
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,650
How dare you?

240
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,330
Noonim, I think you should run.

241
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,460
Hey! Hey!

242
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,710
♫  And the more I do, and the more I do  ♫

243
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,920
♫  And the more I do, and the more  ♫

244
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,100
♫  And the more I do, and the more I do  ♫

245
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,570
♫  And the more I do, and the more  ♫

246
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,200
♫  And the more I do  ♫

247
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,110
Kids these days are scary.

248
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,620
No, wait. Kids in the olden days, should I say?

249
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,250
Did you repeat a grade?

250
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,780
Try 15 years. All that work to take it, and you snatch it from me?

251
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,610
Try 15 years. All that work to take it, and you snatch it from me?

252
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,120
Give it back.

253
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,900
- You don't look older than me. 
 - Give it back!

254
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,410
I've seen you before.

255
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,640
You!

256
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,160
   

257
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,130
 Yes, I remember you. 

258
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,290
 The subject of my first stan experience, my old favorite. 

259
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,680
What was your name again?

260
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,060
   

261
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,730
That's right, Kim Tae Sung!

262
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,660
Oh, my gosh! I'm so happy to see you!

263
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,870
Hey! It's been so long!

264
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,200
- I saw you yesterday— 
 - I used to follow you around like crazy.

265
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,990
I thought you were so hot back then, but you're such a dork.

266
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,340
It is you. But why are you acting so different from yesterday?

267
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,550
It is you. But why are you acting so different from yesterday?

268
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,000
- Wait, multiple personality disorder? 
 - Wow...

269
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,690
I had on rose-colored glasses back then so I didn't know.

270
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,200
You were such a player!

271
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,670
Smoking and all.

272
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,180
Get it together. Cigarettes are no good.

273
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,610
Okay, noonim.

274
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,240
Then take this, too.

275
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,920
Good luck running by yourself this time. Okay?

276
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,170
- What? 
 - Hey, you two! I see you!

277
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,870
Skipping class during class hours?

278
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,220
What is that? Are you smoking?

279
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,590
What?

280
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,890
Oh, no, no, these aren't mine.

281
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,900
Huh! T-That punk!

282
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:42,340
I was only guiding troublemakers to the right path.

283
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,310
For the healthy lungs of our athletes.

284
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,500
I stood up for them to prevent secondhand smoke.

285
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,090
This is not fair, Teacher.

286
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:55,100
So, a female student came all the way to the boys' school just to correct their behavior?

287
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,510
How dare you lie to me?

288
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,640
I could just...

289
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,780
 I never got punished during high school, yet here I'm at over 30... 

290
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,460
 Oh, no. Just pass by, just pass by... 

291
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,750
Sit straight up!

292
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,130
Really?

293
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,530
 Just go! Please, go! 

294
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,510
 Just go! Please, go! 

295
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,560
Peekaboo.

296
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,940
Are you joking around with me?

297
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,740
You, stay here until the bell rings.

298
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,680
I can watch you on the security camera.

299
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,400
Don't get any ideas. You hear me?

300
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,280
Otter... must be so sad.

301
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,160
What?

302
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,320
That his owner leads a careless life.

303
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,050
Stop smoking.

304
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,540
No!

305
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,380
I don't smoke. I don't even use mosquito repellant incense in the summer.

306
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,020
I have an occasional drink when I have a hard day, but smoking—

307
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,740
Hey, Sun Jae. I don't smoke.

308
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,910
I was a model student. For real!

309
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,150
That's not real. It's fake. So go.

310
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,410
Wait! Let's clear up things first!

311
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,720
Sun Jae!

312
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,610
♫  You are getting far away  ♫

313
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,330
    
 ♫  Little by little  ♫

314
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,110
I told you to run. Why did you follow him just to get punished?

315
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,730
Did you wait around to rub salt in my wounds?

316
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,230
I waited around so I could get my lighter back.

317
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,440
I threw it away. Wow, how disloyal of you.

318
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,100
I threw it away. Wow, how disloyal of you.

319
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,110
I saved you from the bullies, and you ran off by yourself?

320
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,360
Oh, that was you saving me?

321
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,660
That's right.

322
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,450
I took you away because I was worried you'd get hit.

323
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,810
Oh, I get it.

324
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,700
You wanted my attention.

325
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,900
What?

326
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,370
 Is this how he was? 

327
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,790
You are so annoying!

328
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,610
Thanks for the compliment. But, noonim..

329
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,940
From now on, don't be extra, but keep yourself safe.

330
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,300
You might get hurt at this rate.

331
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,130
 Why was I so into this guy when I was younger? 

332
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,840
 Tae Sung! 

333
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,320
Gosh, what a hassle.

334
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,200
Hey, Tae Sung! Kim Tae Sung!

335
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,700
Hey. Out of my way.

336
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,000
You rude wench!

337
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,850
Hey. What did you just call me?

338
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,080
Hey. Look down.

339
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Oh, oh! How dare you?

340
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,980
Look down, I said.

341
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,070
 Let me keep myself safe. I could get hurt. 

342
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,120
I better not see you hanging around Tae Sung again.

343
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,170
Let's go.

344
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,680
Gosh! Kids in the olden days... They're scary!

345
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,470
I got a new keychain for my phone. Cute, right?

346
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,380
Not as cute as you!

347
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,790
 Hyun Joo, I can walk again. 

348
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,570
 You would have loved to see it. 

349
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,310
Should we get more bread? No.

350
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,840
I need to restrain myself. I might pop out of my uniform.

351
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,210
You'll lose weight when you get older. Just eat.

352
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,700
No, I'll hold back.

353
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,150
Oh, right, you know...

354
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,010
There's someone I need to be friends with. What should I do?

355
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:19,090
I haven't made a real friend in so long.

356
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,030
I don't know how.

357
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,350
First, your first impression is important.

358
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,770
First impression?

359
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,890
 Mom... no! 

360
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,100
 Let's live together. 

361
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,900
 Let's stay alive together. 

362
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,010
- It was the worst. 
 - Then, at least your second impression should be good.

363
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,510
 - Stop smoking.  
 - It was even worse.

364
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,930
- Give it up. 
 - I can't!

365
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,840
Then, proceed carefully.

366
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,850
Add him as a friend online!

367
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,540
What? Online friend?

368
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,720
Is it a boy?

369
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,080
Did you switch over already?

370
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,280
I thought you were down for getting rejected by Kim Tae Sung after confessing yesterday.

371
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,900
What?

372
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,240
 I saw you play at the festival last year. 

373
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,870
 I've liked you since then. 

374
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,880
 This is a g-g-gift for you... 

375
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,910
 Tae Sung! 

376
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,660
 Hey. Who are you? 

377
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,760
 Seriously? 

378
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,260
 Look at her! 

379
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,150
 If I catch you, you're screwed! 

380
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,450
 That tiny thing can run! 

381
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,180
Hyun Joo! Did I tell Kim Tae Sung I liked him yesterday?

382
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,520
 I wondered why there were no stars in the night sky. 

383
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,500
 They were all in your eyes. 

384
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,930
 That makes sense as to why they were too bright for me to look at. 

385
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,390
 Tae Sung, you are my star. 

386
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,160
 A big star. 

387
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,990
Why yesterday of all days?

388
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,920
I should have come back just a day earlier.

389
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,300
This is a dark moment in my history.

390
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,410
Why are there no stars in the night sky?

391
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,560
They were in your eyes.

392
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,050
What is this?

393
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,550
When did you come in here?

394
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,360
Give it back!

395
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,080
When did you open this?

396
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,560
Give it back.

397
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,940
Get out of here.

398
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,230
Get out, I said!

399
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,840
Hey! Hey!

400
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,310
Hey!

401
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,160
Geez, I could have eaten it.

402
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,740
 Then, proceed carefully. Add him as a friend online! 

403
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,560
   

404
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,350
He was really crazy about swimming back then.

405
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,870
   

406
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,920
   

407
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,280
   

408
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,400
♫  You're getting far away  ♫

409
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,240
     
 ♫  Little by little  ♫

410
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,790
He's just getting further away.

411
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,530
He declined my friend request.

412
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,920
I'll help you.

413
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,060
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

414
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,540
Wait!

415
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,440
We got on at the same bus stop.

416
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,360
Were we ever on the same bus?

417
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,250
Hey, have you seen me before?

418
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,850
Even if I had, I hadn't.

419
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,590
What? You have or haven't?

420
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,480
- Do you get on at this time every day? 
 - I usually leave earlier.

421
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,140
But it's the competition, so I don't have morning training.

422
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,540
 I'll get on at the time Sun Jae does from now on. 

423
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,090
 To get close to him. 

424
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,170
Is there a competition soon? What kind of competition?

425
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,310
If I told you, what? Will you run in again?

426
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,580
Oh, no.

427
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,120
Get off the bus.

428
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,040
We're here!

429
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,080
- Hey! Careful!  
 - Don't push!

430
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,520
- Let's go! 
 - One second!

431
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,200
Hold on! Hold on!

432
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,450
Excuse me, I need to get out.

433
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,580
Excuse me!

434
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,840
 Hey, this is my stop. 

435
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,510
Driver! Mister!

436
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,310
I couldn't get off yet.

437

444
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,040
Stop!

445
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,520
Sun Jae!

446
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,530
Sun Jae! Are you all right?

447
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,860
Hey. You need to pay attention. How could you not get off?

448
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,920
Still, thank you.

449
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,490
I didn't do it so you could thank me.

450
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,380
I stopped him so I could get my umbrella.

451
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,130
Oh, right. I was going to give it to you.

452
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,730
But don't do that again. It's dangerous.

453
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,880
Who gets in a running match with a bus?

454
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,290
You're an athlete.

455
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,540
You need to be careful. Always protect your body. Okay?

456
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,240
If someone hadn't stayed on the bus with my umbrella, I would have.

457
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,580
 Gosh. Was he like this when he was this age? 

458
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,410
You never let anyone have the last word.

459
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,360
You must've upset your dad quite a bit.

460
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,690
Not as much as you.

461
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,510
Just quit smoking.

462
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,690
How did I get so misunderstood?

463
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,080
Hey, is that why you declined my friend request?

464
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,240
What? Are you guilty?

465
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,250
I said no!

466
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,800
Want to smell my fingers?

467
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,480
I hear smokers even have smelly hands.

468
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,160
Smell my fingers.

469
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,840
Hey, look. They don't smell. Right?

Wow. 220V, huh?

Hey, stop annoying me!

480
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,300
You said there was nothing between you. You're coming to school together?

481
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,980
- I was just getting my umbrella back. 
 - Right, your umbrella.

482
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,400
Oh, I remember where I knew her from.

483
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,090
From my practice studio.

484
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,480
She likes Kim Tae Sung.

485
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,060
She came to our studio to secretly drop off chocolates.

486
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,930
I knew I saw her somewhere.

487
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,740
Who's Kim Tae Sung?

488
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,380
My band's bass player!

489

He's famous online for being good-looking.

490
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,930
- You don't know Kim Tae Sung? 
 - I don't.

491
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,050
- What's up? 
 - What do you mean what's up?

492
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,320
Why are you pissy?

493
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,390
When did I get pissy?

494
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,590
 Isn't it so fun? 

495
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,580
   

496
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,280
What?

497
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,720
   

498
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,050
    
  It was my first day back after my shoulder surgery. 

499
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:12,190
 That ended up being my last match. 

500
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,400
Was this the competition?

501
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,240
Sun Jae, can you talk for a second?

502
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,660
Do the thing I told you yesterday!

503
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,900
I have to go to practice right now.

504
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,070
Sun Jae!

505
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,050
   

506
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,740
Sun Jae!

507
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,150
You can't do this competition.

508
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,630
- Why not? 
 - If you do it, you'll get injured again.

509
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,650
You'll never be able to swim again.

510
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,930
So...

511
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,770
Don't do it.

512
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,900
Why not?

513
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,880
Didn't you hear what I just said?

514
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,430
- I don't understand... 
 - You're going to hurt your shoulder.

515
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:04,970
This will be your last match...

516
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,740
 What is this? Some kind of superpower? 

517
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,990
If you don't have anything to say, I'm leaving.

518
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,860
Sun Jae! Sun Jae, look at this for a second.

519
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,070
Hold on.

520
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,900
 If you do this competition, your swim career is over. 

521
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,960
Look at this for a second.

522
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,620
What do you want me to look at?

523
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,220
 If I tell the future, does time stop? 

524
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,680
   

525
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,980
Obama will be the President of the United States!

526
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,070
What the? That's scary.

527
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,590
 What was it like after you quit swimming? 

528
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,700
 Back then, I regretted pushing myself so hard. 

529
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,970
 But maybe I was meant to be a singer. 

530
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,560
 Perhaps that's why it happened. 

531
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:39,800
 If he kept swimming... maybe you would have stayed alive. 

532
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,690
You're in the early 1:50s.

533
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,220
Maybe you'll get under 1:49 this time!

534
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,330
- Yes! 
 - You'll set a competition record!

535
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,750
Hyun Goo, focus.

536
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,630
Hey, careful.

537
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,090
Sun Jae, what's wrong?

538
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,900
Nothing.

539
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,290
Okay.

540
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,850
I heard you're doing both categories this time.

541
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,190
I just found out.

542
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,420
You just had surgery. You're competing again already?

543
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,680
Because I'm ready.

544
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,690
Don't push yourself too hard.

545
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:53,860
If you smash your shoulder again, you can't even lift a spoon for the rest of your life.

546
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:59,390
What? Are you nervous you won't get a medal if I'm back?

547
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,120
Focus on yourself.

548
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,120
- She's back. 
 - You must have come to see Sun Jae!

549
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,450
Sun Jae should be here soon. Wow!

550
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,840
Sun Jae's right behind.

551
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,200
Will she tell him?

552
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,200
- Sun Jae! 
 - She's going to tell him how she feels.

553
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,600
Sun Jae, I know this is not my place.

554
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,680
Yeah, that's right.

555
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,190
But sometimes, you need to take a step back to jump higher.

556
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,320
If I take two steps forward, I could jump even higher.

557
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,220
Check your shoulder first. Make sure the bridge is solid before you cross it!

558
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,080
I'm not crossing a bridge. I'm swimming.

559
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,280
You think you're totally okay, right?

560
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,600
But that's not true!

561
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,600
- Are you going to be okay? 
 - What?

562
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,050
Oops!

563
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,540
If you're okay, keep following me.

564
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,260
That stubborn boy!

565
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,070
I don't think I can talk him out of it.

566
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:20,290
Mister, are you doing this because of the late fee?

567
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:24,000
That meager late fee is not the issue here.

568
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,200
Maybe you made a mistake.

569
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,750
I checked everything.

570
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,130
There are no customers with similar names. There's no way I made a mistake.

571
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,160
What a weird woman.

572
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,300
If I say it wasn't me, it wasn't me.

573
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,250
A weird woman? Come on.

574
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,090
Are you embarrassed that you rented an adult video?

575
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,450
W-W-What? Embarrassed?

576
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,980
I'm not a child!

577
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,010
If I wanted to, I wouldn't be ashamed to rent it.

578
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,800
And what? Basic Instinct?

579
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,820
I saw it with my wife at the Piccadilly Theater back when it came out.

580
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,100
You get into a fistfight because they spit on your motorcycle?

581
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,090
Wouldn't you punch someone who laid a hand on your child?

582
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,120
Who gave birth to your motorcycle?

583
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,640
My heart.

584
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,820
Wow. Are you the mother or father?

585
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,600
Plus, these guys started it.

586
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,330
- Shut your mouth. 
 - You started it!

587
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,990
Sit down. Sit down!

588
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,140
Seriously.

589
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,600
Hello!

590
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,970
Lieutenant Kim, what brings you here?

591
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,790
Are you still getting into trouble?

592
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,900
My guardian is here.

593
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,210
- I can go, right? 
 - Yeah.

594
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,930
Hey, Kim Tae Sung!

595
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,580
Lieutenant, is he your son?

596
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,170
Yes.

597
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,260
Dad, I did well today again.

598
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,940
I'm walking home after practice.

599
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,000
Bye.

600
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,320
Hey, kid. A penny for the Sacred Grandmother.

601
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,410
Oh, sure.

602
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,010
Thank you.

603
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,380
No problem.

604
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,100
You were born around when the first frost came.

605
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,780
There's bad aura surrounding you.

606
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,390
A ghost's gate has placed a deadbolt.

607
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,350
You have a bad luck of a ghost locking the gate.

608
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,380
- What? 
 - Doesn't your body hurt somewhere these days?

609
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:48,350
I mean, doesn't one of your shoulders feel heavy?

610
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,720
The Water Ghost!

611
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,600
A Virgin Ghost who drowned is stuck on you.

612
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,700
A ghost?

613
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,580
She's looking for a young man

614
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,060
to take with her to the Underworld once the 49 Days of Mourning are over.

615
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,130
You should avoid water for a while.

616
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,050
Three days will do.

617
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,100
The day after tomorrow is the 49th day.

618
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,990
I'm a competitive swimmer. I have a match tomorrow.

619
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,920
A match? That's not important right now!

620
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,140
Is it worth more than your life?

621
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,630
If you don't want to cross The River of Three Crossings in the Underworld,

622
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,380
don't even think of dipping your foot in water!

623
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,130
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

624
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,410
You will? How can I believe you?

625
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,980
I won't even shower. Are we done?

626
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,680
Thank you for the advice.

627
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,600
 I don't think he believes me. 

628
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,390
You have a mole under your collarbone, don't you?

629
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,360
A mole? Three out of ten people have that.

630
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,620
You also have a scar under your left foot.

631
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,650
- You saw that? 
 - She said she did.

632
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,990
That girl.

633
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,710
What?

634
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,260
I don't see anyone.

635
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,100
You're superstitious.

636
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Please believe me. Okay?

637
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,970
Are you a monk now?

638
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,350
You must have been in a fight.

639
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:39,070
Now, will you give me back my 1,000 won?

640
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,640
If I do?

641
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,090
Can you read my face? I want to know if I'll be lucky in love.

642
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,490
Your face is one that calls for a punch.

643
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,070
I thought you had a crush on me.

644
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,590
Did you read the letter?

645
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,520
"There are no stars in the night sky tonight."

646
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,330
"Are they in my eyes?"

647
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,770
- "They're so bright—" 
 - Stop it! Stop it!

648
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,730
You really read it thoroughly.

649
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,990
 He got into a group fight with kids from the next school over. 

650
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,940
 It was crazy. 

651
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,660
 He was almost expelled but they covered it up with him dropping out instead. 

652
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,980
Stay here for a second.

653
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,370
Give me your hand.

654
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,730
Be gentle.

655
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,210
I don't want my pretty hand to scar.

656
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:42,710
 That playboy. Giving me smiles with those eyes. 

657
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,370
 This is why girls went crazy over him. 

658
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,970
Why do you keep getting into fights?

659
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,480
Do you want to be expelled?

660
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,490
You should graduate from high school, at least.

661
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,320
You'll regret it so much later.

662
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,300
Are you my mom or something? Stop nagging.

663
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,510
Seriously. When even I'm worried, your parents must be worried sick.

664
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,760
I don't think they care.

665
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,300
I used to think that, too.

666
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,880
But that's not true.

667
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,350
When a child is in pain...

668
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,500
The parent feels as if all ten of their fingers are being pulled out.

669
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,000
The sound of their child crying feels like thunder.

670
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,450
That's what my mom said.

671
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,750
So, don't break your parents' hearts.

672
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:44,100
Don't get hurt, and don't get sick. Okay?

673
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,800
Not all parents are like that.

674
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,780
That's true, but...

675
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:56,880
When you grow up, you'll get it a little better.

676
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,100
Okay, we're done now.

677
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,200
Give me my money.

678
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,030
Here.

679
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,600
This bill was touched by my favorite hand...

680
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,390
I'm sorry. I'll give you a different one.

681
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,170
Your face is really begging for a punch.

682
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,090
It's fine!

683
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,800
I'll give you a different one!

684
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,400
Hey, wait.

685
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,550
I'll switch it.

686
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,620
Here. I'm feeling generous.

687
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,590
I'll trade you for 5,000 won. Good?

688
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,950
It's fine. You can go away now. Go!

689
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,700
What?

690
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,210
Grandma?

691
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,840
Gosh, we meet again, young man.

692
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,180
Oh. You are an old lady?

693
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,700
 This is crazy. 

694
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,700
You're Ryu Sun Jae, right?

695
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,900
In Hyuk's swimmer friend.

696
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,300
Who are you?

697
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,900
I'm Kim Tae Sung.

698
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
 She likes Kim Tae Sung. 

699
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,300
 She came to our studio to secretly drop off chocolates. 

700
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,880
Always be careful around water.

701
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,100
This old woman will now be on her way.

702
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,400
What are you doing?

703
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,270
What are you doing in disguise?

704
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,920
Grandma, I think you're busted.

705
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,610
What do I do?

706
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,210
Are you pranking me?

707
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,660
Is this funny to you?

708
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,130
I'm not pranking you.

709
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,850
Sun Jae, listen to me. I can really see ghosts.

710
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,680
You really have to be careful around water!

711
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,010
It's true! I'm telling the truth, Sun Jae!

712
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,560
What?

713
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,940
   

714
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,300
Sun Jae lives here?

715
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,900
Grandma, do you really see ghosts?

716
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,010
 Mom! 

717
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,000
- Mom! Mom! 
 - You scared me.

718
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,200
When did Mr. Bae move out of the house with the blue door?

719
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,160
What are you wearing? Are you joining the circus?

720
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,400
Mr. Bae moved out in the spring, and another family moved in.

721
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,600
- Didn't you know? 
 - No, I didn't.

722
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,910
Why was I not paying attention?

723
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,730
 One, two, three... 

724
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,910
 four, five... 

725
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:01,170
 six, seven, eight, nine, ten... 

726
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,200
 11, 12... 

727
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,200
 13, 14, 15, 16, 17... 

728
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,100
 18, 19... 

729
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,800
 You can't do this competition. 

730
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,270
Now he won't believe me, whatever I say.

731
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:30,510
What do I do?

732
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,620
Where is he going at this hour?

733
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,000
 Check your shoulder first. 

734
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,610
 Make sure the bridge is solid before you cross it! 

735
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,720
 You think you're totally okay, right? 

736
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,210
 But that's not true! 

737
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:16,910
 Don't push yourself too hard. 

738
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,970
 If you smash your shoulder again, 

739
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:22,040
 you can't even lift a spoon for the rest of your life. 

740
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,600
 That's my son! I'm so proud! 

741
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,820
 I knew you could do it! 

742
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,100
 The Water Ghost! 

743
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,800
 A Virgin Ghost who drowned is stuck on you. 

744
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,790
 I can really see ghosts. You really have to be careful around water! 

745
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,380
 It's true! I'm telling the truth! 

746
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:44,350
This bastard believes a jinx about wearing his swim trunks from the day before to win.

747
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:47,420
So he always practices with his competition uniform the day before.

748
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,820
So what?

749
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,790
If it's missing, he'll get mad flustered. Right?

750
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,710
Hey, what if you get caught?

751
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,800
If you keep your mouth shut, nobody will know.

752
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,800
Are you scared?

753
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,190
You want me to cut off your wrist?

754
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,380
Let go.

755
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,280
What is this? You let go!

756
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,400
You want me to tell the entire swim team? Or call the cops?

757
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
Drop it and leave quietly.

758
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,000
Seriously? Let go.

759
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,210
 Who is there? 

760
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,980
 - Huh? Who is there?  
 - Run!

761
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,830
 What do I do? 

762
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,500
Why are the lights off?

763
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:11,520
   

764
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,950
 My legs are cramping up... 

765
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,910
What?

766
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,790
Who are you?

767
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,700
   

768
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,490
What? That was you?

769
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:14,510
You're stealing my swim uniform now?

770
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:17,010
- I didn't steal it. 
 - What?

771
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:21,220
What's your excuse this time? Did a ghost steal it?

772
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,180
- Why are you doing this to me? 
 - Because I was worried about you.

773
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,560
I don't know how to explain this.

774
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,550
Yeah, a dream! I had a bad dream.

775
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,300
I dreamed that you got hurt in the arena.

776
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,100
It was so vivid that it felt real.

777
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,400
It felt like it was actually going to happen.

778
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,800
- I was nervous and worried... 
 - Why are you worried about me?

779
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,500
- Because I want to protect you. 
 - Why?

780
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,070
Why do you need to protect me?

781
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:51,500
- Am I going to die or something? 
 - Yes, you're going to die!

782
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,270
I'm the only person in the world who knows that.

783
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,600
But I can't even tell you.

784
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,100
But I still want to protect you.

785
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,630
Because I'm trying everything to keep you alive.

786
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,320
Why aren't you saying anything?

787
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,950
You think what you're doing is normal?

788
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,230
Doesn't it seem weird?

789
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:15,010
You come up to a stranger and tell me you're a fan.

790
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:17,870
Then suddenly tell me not to enter the competition?

791
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:19,720
Because of a trivial dream you had?

792
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,500
Who are you anyway?

793
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,500
Why do I need to listen to you?

794
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,890
My son!

795
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:56,980
Where is he? He needs to leave at the crack of dawn.

796
00:50:56,980 --> 00:51:00,700
My goodness. These taste the best when they're warm...

797
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:05,490
Goodness. He'll eat them if he's hungry later. At that age, you'll even eat a rock.

798
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,050
What is that?

799
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:15,550
What...

800
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:20,670
What is that?

801
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,850
What is this thing?

802
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:35,800
   

803
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,630
- What? 
  - You were at the pool, right? 

804
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,790
- Did you see Hyun Goo? 
 - What?

805
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:51,580
 He said he was headed there to screw you over. 

806
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,110
 - You guys didn't get into a fight, did you?  
 - He was there?

807
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,400
 Yes, he was trying to steal your uniform! 

808
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,210
 Nothing happened, right? 

809
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:03,370
 Seriously, he really crossed the line. 

810
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,380
 Hello? 

811
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,380
 Sun Jae, are you listening to me? 

812
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,120
 Why aren't you saying anything? 

813
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,380
 You think what you're doing is normal? 

814
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,370
Right, it's not normal.

815
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:38,890
I don't know what I'm doing, either.

816
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:59,070
One, two...

817
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:01,520
three...

818
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,190
four... five...

819
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,920
Hey! Im Sol!

820
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:10,140
Are you crazy? Why were you just standing there?

821
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:43,730
    
 34-1...

822
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,530
 This isn't the right address. 

823
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,950
   

824
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,510
 Mister! 

825
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:57,100
♫  That night, when everyone's gathered  ♫

826
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:04,660
♫  When you're not sitting in your usual seat  ♫

827
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:12,030
♫  When I catch your scent, the one that I liked so much  ♫

828
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:20,980
♫  I turn my head, wondering if it's you  ♫

829
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:25,970
♫  When I find myself in your neighborhood...  ♫

830
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:29,670
 That package is mine. Right? It is mine. 

831
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,960
 Mister, take this. 

832
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,240
 Come on. 

833
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:41,540
 Take it with you, and any time you can drop it off in the can outside this store. 

834
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,600
 Actually, consider it an apology in advance. 

835
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,900
 The next package is going to be heavy. I bought a bunch of used books. 
   

836
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:54,400
 Also, eat this. Bye! 

837
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,070
♫  I can do better  ♫

838
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:05,010
♫  I want to be brave and pick up the phone, but I can't  ♫

839
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:09,640
♫  Like a fool  ♫

840
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:32,570
♫  I found your email address by coincidence  ♫

841
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:41,130
♫  I wait for you all night in front of my screen  ♫

842
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,030
 - Hello. 
 - Welcome! 

843
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,990
 Can I have your name? 

844
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:45,010
 Geun Deok... Ryu Geun Deok. 

845
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,670
   

846
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,790
 Sun Jae! 

847
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:07,580
 What's going on? Am I dreaming? 

848
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,580
 Let's be friends! 

849
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,200
 My son! 

850
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,700
 Have some green juice.  
   

851
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,810
 Dad! You need to knock! 

852
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:28,950
♫  I want to be brave and pick up the phone, but I can't  ♫

853
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:36,940
♫  Do you know how it feels when I can't talk to you  ♫

854
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:48,140
♫  The person I've been waiting for is breathing in front of me  ♫

855
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:52,390
♫  That's right, I think I like you  ♫

856
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:55,630
 He's just getting further away. 

857
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:58,650
 He declined my friend request. 

858
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,480
He doesn't seem to have any desire to get close to me.

859
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:10,170
♫  I want to see you, I can do better  ♫

860
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:17,010
♫  I want to be brave and pick up the phone, but I can't  ♫

861
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:24,510
♫  You always make me dream  ♫

862
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:32,160
♫  To be a better man than I am now  ♫

863
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:38,950
♫  I practice while I'm on my way to meet you  ♫

864
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:47,940
♫  The words I kept inside my heart for so long  ♫

865
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:51,530
♫  I love you  ♫

866
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,050

♫  I'm running to you  ♫

869
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:24,660
♫  Standing at the end of the world that's fast asleep  ♫

872
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,780
 I'm doing the competition. I'm going to get a medal no matter what. 

873
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,000
 If I get a gold medal tomorrow, I'll tell you my true feelings. 

874
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,410
 Choose wisely. Timing is crucial when it comes to confessing your feelings. 

875
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:47,390
 - It's all about the timing. 
 - I want to... 

876
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,050
 Kim Tae Sung, the band bass player. 

877
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,380
 Are you his fan? Or do you like him? 

878
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:54,060
 Do you want to go out with me? I thought you liked me. 

879
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,750
 Where did Sun Jae go? I didn't see him at practice. 

880
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,620
 - I'm going to quit swimming. 
 - You bastard! 

881
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,940
 I stopped it! 

882
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:07,000
 I like you. I like you. 

883
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,650
♫  You are a beautiful memory  ♫
