1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,380
   

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,420
   

3
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,090
   

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,350
   

5
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,890
So... how did you know?

6
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,580
I saw you at the bus stop.

7
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,770
You were asleep and didn't get off the bus.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,700
You need to be aware of the time and place before you doze off.

9
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,470
Every time I see you, you're nodding off just anywhere.

10
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,060
If I hadn't seen you, what do you think would have happened?

11
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,810
I know. I'll never doze off again.

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,000


13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,330
By chance, have you ever seen me before the practice game?

14
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,370
We're neighbors, so I'm just wondering if we've seen each other as we've come and gone.

15
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,640
I have.

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,900
Really?

17
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,590
You mistook me for the package delivery guy before.

18
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,230
I don't think you remember.

19
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,370
When was that?

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,570
Spring, not long after you moved in.

21
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,600
I see.

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,380
I wish I had known back then.

23
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,420
You think so?

24
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,520
- Have you been to our store before? 
 - What?

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,000
I used to watch the store for my mom often.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,600
   

27
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,780
Have you ever rented a DVD from us?

28
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,360
I don't know why I'm so sleepy.

29
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,550
Are you...

30
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,430
Are you going to sleep?

31
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,790
Yeah, I'm so sleepy.

32
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,930
Go in.

33
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,280
 We live our lives missing so many things. 

34
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,100
 Sun Jae used to be someone so far away, like a star in the sky. 

35
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:09,640
 At the end of my teens, full of memories I wish I didn't remember, 

36
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,750
 Sun Jae was always there within my arm's reach. 

37
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:21,740
 Breathing the same air, looking at the same sky, every day. 

38
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,560
 Walking the same streets. 

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,790
 He knew my name. 

40
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,730
 Hey! Im Sol! 

41
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,490
 He saved me. 

42
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,940
 I didn't know that back then. 

43
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,830
 How many moments of connection have I missed in my life? 

44
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,840
 I realized it only after facing my past again. 

45
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,950
 Why are you crying? 

46
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,470
 Maybe those moments that I shouldn't have missed 

47
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,360
 were shining somewhere, 

48
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,890
 sending me signals all this time. 

49
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,010
 So that I won't miss those signals, 

50
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,870
 that may be why I'm here. 

51
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,560
 Could it be why you and I met again? 

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,090
   

53
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,130
 Sun Jae! Ryu Sun Jae! 

54
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,860
 Sun Jae! 

55
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,650
Sun Jae!

56
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,010
Oh, Sun Jae!

57
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,330
Sun Jae! Come outside for a second.

58
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,670
What is it now?

59
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,300
Sun Jae, look at the sky! There's a rainbow.

60
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,500
Isn't it pretty?

61
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,770
If I hadn't woken you up, you would have missed it!

62
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,050
Make a wish. Quick!

63
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,440
What is she seeing?

64
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,090
What? Can't you see it?

65
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,700
No.

66
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,740
One second.

67
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,600
Sun Jae!

68
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:35,430
♫  I can hear it anywhere, I can feel it  ♫

69
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,560
How is it? Can you see it now?

70
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,230
Yeah.

71
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,050
♫  Countless nights and darkness are alright with you here  ♫

72
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,400
♫  Even when it's exhausting  ♫

73
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,850
♫  I know I can reach you  ♫

74
00:05:52,850 --> 00:06:01,300
♫  You became my miracle  ♫

75
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,610
♫  Tell me, I love you  ♫

76
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,010
♫  I'll always be by your side  ♫

77
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,550
♫  All my time, all my days with you  ♫

78
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,690
♫  Just you and I, you and I  ♫

79
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,260
♫  You and I, just you and I  ♫

80
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,890
Oh, my! What? What is this cold water?

81
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,470
You brat!

82
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,760
You're too old to be playing with water! This is very cold! Hey!

83
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,010
Wait right there!

84
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,970
Hey! What are you doing?

85
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,430
- Mom! Mom! 
 - What are you doing with this!

86
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,300
Mom, I'll turn it off. I'll turn it off!

87
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,660
Mom, calm down. Seriously, calm down.

88
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,540
Mom, hold on! Hold on!

89
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,310
You are way too old to be playing with water!

90
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,160
Mom, listen to me.

91
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,700
 I'm begging you, please! 

92
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,240
 I'm sorry! I'm sorry! 

93
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,260
 - Please! 
 - Stop right there! 

94
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,130
Sun Jae!

95
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,090
Here.

96
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,270
What is it? What are you giving me this morning?

97
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,670
It flew off of your rooftop.

98
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,950
T-This isn't mine. It's my grandma's!

99
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,140
My grandma likes pink.

100
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,720
What? I didn't ask.

101
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,820
Crap!

102
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,960
I was going to ask you to walk to school together.

103
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,680
I have something I want to do with you.

104
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,530
What is it?

105
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,640
You'll see.

106
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,330
Thank you, Sun Jae.

107
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,550
For what?

108
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,300
For saving my life.

109
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,670
And I'm sorry.

110
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,050
I should have thanked you before.

111
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,450
I'm late.

112
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,490
You told me yesterday.

113
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,520
Yesterday is yesterday.

114
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,510
So, you're not avoiding me anymore.

115
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,310
I thought you didn't make friends with girls.

116
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,120
Who said I'd be your friend?

117
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,630
 So, all those "Just friends" rumors were all real romances. 

118
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,980
 You dated a lot of people, huh? 

119
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,520
Fine, then you can be my lifesaver.

120
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,730
I'll be the magpie that returns the good deed.

121
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,640
I thought it was a swallow.

122
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,560
Was it?

123
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,200
♫  If you never talk, I'll never leave you  ♫

124
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,920
That was dangerous.

125
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,430
Then... should I be a swallow?

126
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,230
You brought a whole gourd.

127
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,420
It's a time capsule.

128
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,400
I put a present for you inside.

129
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,600
In folktales, precious gems come out of gourds.

130
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,710
I thought it was a present.

131
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,490
Can't you just give it to me? Why work so hard to bury it in the ground? Is it kimchi?

132
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,860
It's not a kimchi jar. It's a time capsule.

133
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,110
Come on, help me dig.

134
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,320
What's in it, then?

135
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,300
Is it really a precious gem?

136
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,850
Something even more rare and special than that.

137
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,140
You'll be so surprised when you open it later.

138
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,550
When is later?

139
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,480
Maybe around 2023?

140
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,530
What kind of present sits there for that long?

141
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,290
It's like stock shares.

142
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,190
Like a blue chip! You want to sit on it for a long time.

143
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,700
Really?

144
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,550
No, it's fake.

145
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:04,450
At midnight on January 1st, 2023, let's meet on the Han River bridge.

146
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,220
Let's take it out together that day.

147
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,550
Why does it have to be that day?

148
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,930
   

149
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,410
 So that I can change your fate. 

150
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,640
 So please... stay alive just one more day. 

151
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,990
It's a gift that will only be meaningful on that day.

152
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,330
It's a very, very big gift, so look forward to it.

153
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,080
Don't take it out before that. Okay?

154
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,350
At midnight on January 1st, 2023. The Han River Bridge.

155
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,540
Remember. Okay?

156
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,350
On January 1st, 2023. The Han River Bridge.

157
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,600
At midnight, the Han River Bridge...

158
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:51,980
Wait, aren't you going to see me until then?

159
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,280
You never know what will happen.

160
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,300
Even if we drift apart from each others' lives,

161
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,570
please come meet me that day.

162
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,910
Like going to a school reunion. Okay?

163
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,860
Like going to see an old friend.

164
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,490
Who said I was your friend?

165
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,100
 Hey, I'm busy. 

166
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,210
 If you see Im Sol around the corner, see if she's hurt. 

167
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,390
 Why would I see her? Ask Kim Tae Sung. 

168
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,460
 He's not dating Im Sol because he likes her. 

169
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,700
 - He won't check on her. 
 - What? 

170
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,450
 There's a girl named Choi Ga Hyun who follows him around. 

171
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,770
 He just wants to date someone to get rid of her. 

172
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,680
Hey, you...

173
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,200
Never mind. Let's go.

174
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,710
She can't see through people.

175
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,150
Hey! Where are your eyes?

176
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,870
Here?

177
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,940
Wait for me!

178
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,770
What's with disciplinary lately? Always picking at our uniforms!

179
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,520
I know!

180
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,950
I forgot my tie!

181
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,070
I'm going to have to run laps.

182
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,850
Hold on.

183
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,330
What about you?

184
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,640
I was an athlete, you know.

185
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,190
I never wore my uniform anyway.

186
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,960
They won't pick on me.

187
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,600
Look at your tie.

188
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,230
Don't you wash your clothes?

189
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,830
You little bastards.

190
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,900
You.

191
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,920
Hey, Ryu Sun Jae. You're not an athlete anymore.

192
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,060
Wear your uniform properly, got it?

193
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,810
- Yes. 
 - Hello, Teacher.

194
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,060
What's up with you?

195
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,730
To what do I owe the pleasure?

196
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,980
You rats used to climb over the wall to get away.

197
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,910
We... are turning ourselves in.

198
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,500
You'll take that into consideration. Right?

199
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,560
Of course!

200
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,380
Come over here.

201
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,780
I thought I'd seen it all.

202
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,330
The last place does seven more laps.

203
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,590
Why did you drag me into this, dude?

204
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,940
You need to get some exercise.

205
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,220
Hey.

206
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,300
You won't even say hi?

207
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,800
Are we even close enough to do that?

208
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,720
Then, how do you know my girlfriend?

209
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,170
Why are you getting punished instead of her?

210
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,400
Right, aren't you neighbors with Sol?

211
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,080
What do you want to know?

212
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,090
What do I want to know?

213
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,370
Are swimmers better at swimming or running?

214
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,080
Turtles are fast in the ocean but mega slow on land.

215
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,990
Are you like that, too?

216
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,040
Quit smoking!

217
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,500
What the heck?

218
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,220
Why are you staring at me like that? Gross.

219
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,810
- Just confirming. 
 - You're crazy!

220
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,380
What do you mean, confirming?

221
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,040
I'm so right. You really like Im Sol, huh?

222
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,650
- What? 
 - Look at how you've been lately.

223
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,780
You never skip school. You don't smoke.

224
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,250
When girls want to see you, you run off by yourself.

225
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,400
You're acting weird.

226
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,920
Hey! Hey! Put your clothes on!

227
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,960
This is visual terrorism.

228
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,910
My eyes are bleeding.

229
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,280
- You don't like it? 
 - Get dressed!

230
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,420
 - Didn't he lose to him last time?  
  - Correct. 

231
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,390
 He must be looking for an opportunity for payback. 

232
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,090
 To the left, South Korea's Park Tae Hwan. To the right, the red cap... 

233
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,560
 Freestyle! 

234
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,290
 Ready... 

235
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,350
What?

236
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,980
Why isn't it turning off?

237
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,980
 Park Tae Hwan... 

238
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,430
 Zhang Lin's head emerges first... 

239
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,770
 We predict that much for the 200m. 

240
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,550
I'm home.

241
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,050
Hey. You're home.

242
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,440
What are you doing?

243
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,550
The TV is broken.

244
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,260
What's going on with the floor?

245
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,520
There was a rat.

246
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,510
 He's leading, leading, leading! 

247
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,390
Goodness, he is so good-looking.

248
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:49,260
His mother is so fortunate to have such a great son.

249
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,580
Oh, my, Park Tae Hwan!

250
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,370
Is he going to win the gold tomorrow?

251
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,880
Looks like it.

252
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,870
A gold medal for swimming for South Korea?

253
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,910
We were lucky to get through the first round.

254
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:00,910
It's possible!

255
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,310
 Gold medal? He even won the silver to win two. 

256
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,920
 That dumbass. 

257
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,180
 That's why you lost everything in the stock market. 

258
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,590
 Huh? Hold on. 

259
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,960
   

260
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,150
   

261
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,360
 Sun Jae, do you have time tomorrow? 

262
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,750
♫  I feel this strange feeling  ♫

263
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:00,270
♫  My heart is beating, I'm dizzy  ♫

264
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,680
♫  Will it be embarrassing to say, "I miss you?"  ♫

265
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,390
What's up?

266
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,210
Want to see a movie with me?

267
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,840
What? A movie?

268
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,610
Yes. I'll show it to you.

269
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,890
Oh...

270
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,930
I already bought the tickets. They're non-refundable.

271
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,160
Come on, let's go.

272
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,620
Let's go!

273
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,550
♫  I can't hide my feelings, can you hear it?  ♫

274
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,580
Is your boyfriend busy or something?

275
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,060
Why see a movie out of the blue?

276
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,440
Just because! I also owe you one.

277
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,740
 It's Park Tae Hwan! 

278
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,030
Sun Jae! Underneath your foot!

279
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,780
What?

280
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,320
Nice bow!

281
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,790
♫  I think I was hoping for it  ♫

282
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,850
♫  Remember me  ♫

283
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,620
That was funny, right?

284
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,930
Let's go. Hurry! Let's go.

285
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,460
Why did you want a bow?

286
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,670
♫  Love is you, love is you   ♫

287
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,850
♫  Will it be embarrassing to say "I miss you?"  ♫

288
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,990
♫  I keep thinking about you  ♫

289
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:13,080
♫  Even if I close my eyes  ♫

290
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,180
 Park Tae Hwan again? 

291
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,580
What?

292
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,630
♫  I can't hide my feelings, can you hear it?  ♫

293
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:27,190
♫  Can I tell you how I feel  ♫

294
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,590
♫  Didn't you feel it a little too?  ♫

295
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,100
Look, I can roll my eyes around like this. Cool, right?

296
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,690
♫  These are my true feelings  ♫

297
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,450
I can do it the other way, too! Look!

298
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,890
Like this... like this... like this.

299
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,210
 It smells like clean and fresh summer today. 

300
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,960
 Perfect weather for a date. 

301
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:58,870
 Listeners, are you enjoying this little piece of summer with your loved one? 

302
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,710
 In a moment, the men's 400m freestyle race 

303
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,410
 at the 2008 Summer Olympics will begin. 

304
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,890
 Competing is Park Tae Hwan, South Korea's rising swimmer. 

305
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:35,060
♫  That night, when everyone's gathered  ♫

306
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:42,570
♫  You're not sitting in your usual seat  ♫

307
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:49,860
♫  When I catch your scent, the one that I liked so much  ♫

308
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:57,080
♫  I turn my head, wondering if it's you  ♫

309
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,560
Why didn't you say you wanted to see a movie last night?

310
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,010
I was wondering all night what the secret was.

311
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,470
I was worried you wouldn't come out.

312
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,120
Of course, I would. Why wouldn't I?

313
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,690
I like movies.

314
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,030
Really? Good.

315
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:19,290
 Please take note of the location of the theater and closest emergency exits. 

316
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,740
 You are currently sitting in Theater 1. 

317
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,740
 You can follow the arrows to find your way out. 

318
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,480
 In the case of an emergency, please follow an employee's instructions for a safe exit. 

319
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,860
- What? 
 - What's going on?

320
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,070
Let's go out.

321
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,770
- What? Do we need to leave? 
 - What?

322
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,710
Sol, let's get out of here.

323
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,020
 The fire alarms were activated due to a system malfunction. 

324
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,940
 We apologize for the inconvenience. 

325
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,660
That's right! Let's go!

326
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,420
Park Tae Hwan, let's go!

327
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,940
Come on! Come on!

328
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,580
Park Tae Hwan, let's go!

329
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,160
Almost there!

330
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,400
Park Tae Hwan wins the gold!

331
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,400
 Gold Medal! Gold Medal! 

332
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,230
 South Korea wins the gold! 

333
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,890
You asked me to see a movie so I couldn't watch the match. Right?

334
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,640
You and my dad... why are you guys being so extra?

335
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,200
If I don't watch the game, then what?

336
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,700
If he wins the medal, the whole country will talk about it.

337
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,450
But still, I felt...

338
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:08,000
What? You think I'd cry from envy or something?

339
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,000
Even if... I knew I wouldn't be able to swim at age nineteen ahead of time,

340
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,180
I would have chosen to swim.

341
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,730
When I think about it, I was so happy while I was swimming.

342
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,410
I wouldn't have known that feeling if I didn't do it.

343
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,250
So, I don't have any regrets.

344
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,600
Not for getting into swimming, or now that I can't do it anymore.

345
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:44,820
So... I'm trying to say I'm fine.

346
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,410
- I'll see you and— 
 - Are you done with acting class?

347
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,550
Yeah. Did you have class today?

348
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,790
No. I came to give you this.

349
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,940
Here. It's a shirt.

350
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,420
I was wondering when you'd give it back to me washed.

351
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,710
I thought you went all the way to the Ganges River to do it.

352
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,230
I'm a senior in high school, and I'm super busy.

353
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,390
I'm not like you, who just hangs around doing nothing.

354
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,970
Hey. You don't get a crown for being a high school senior!

355
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,290
I don't like your tone when you speak to me...

356
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,460
Oh! You got me a new one?

357
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,670
Wow! You are so polite.

358
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,960
How did you know I like new stuff?

359
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,770
So, did your new tooth work out for you?

360
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,380
Yes.

361
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,510
Your uncle is great at what he does.

362
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,350
Good, then. See you later.

363
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,940
Hey! You can't ride your bike on the sidewalk!

364
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
Are you okay?

365
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,020
♫  My non-stop energy  ♫

366
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,850
♫  Standing by you, I'm loud and proud  ♫

367
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,800
♫  Taking strides with you  ♫

368
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,600
I-I-I'm fine!

369
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:10,150
- What's with her? 
  - Why is my heart beating for someone like him? 

370
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,990
I haven't seen a movie in the theater in forever. It's too bad.

371
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,010
- You must like movies. 
 - Yes.

372
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,060
I used to watch two or three a day.

373
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,430
My dream was to be a film director when I grew up.

374
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,680
Why is it in the past tense?

375
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:32,170
Right now, my goal is to walk into the collegiate exams on my two feet.

376
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,440
I'm going to have to take the exam, too.

377
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,390
The collegiate exam?

378
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,840
I'm going to send in a rolling application. For Physical Education.

379
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,440
Really? My brother majored in Physical Education!

380
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,900
Wait! Do you want to be a PE teacher?

381
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,260
You're getting ahead of yourself again.

382
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,360
I can't really imagine it.

383
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,780
Me, doing something other than swimming.

384
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,430
What are you talking about?

385
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,760
You could be in scrubs, a firefighter uniform, a police uniform, or a hanbok and look good in everything!

386
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,260
Your face has such range!

387
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,960
You sound like you've seen me in all of them.

388
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,230
No! Well...

389
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,820
So, if it's a rolling application, you just need to get the minimum grade. Right?

390
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,640
You must be starting to study soon. Want me to help?

391
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,740
- You're really going to help? 
 - Of course!

392
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,370
I mean, sure.

393
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,530
- I mean... 
 - I'm going to hold you to it.

394
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,200
Hello

395
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,440
What?

396
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,390
What should I do?

397
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,960
Uncle, what are you doing right now?

398
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,850
Go.

399
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,130
I asked what you were doing.

400
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,970
I said, go.

401
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,520
Sun Jae. Sun Jae!

402
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,840
Is my mom gone?

403
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,560
- Yes, she is. 
 - She is?

404
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,680
Thank goodness.

405
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,560
It's so scary up here.

406
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,980
I think I'm on the right step...

407
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,750
Oh! Oh! Sun Jae! No!

408
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,900
- It's okay! 
 - I didn't mean to step on you!

409
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,530
Oh, no! No! Sun Jae!

410
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,780
I'm sorry! My foot fell asleep!

411
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,170
Good job. So proud of him!

412
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,970
Long live Korea!

413
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,750
Long live Park Tae Hwan!

414
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,760
Long live!

415
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,100
I'm home.

416
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,260
Long live?

417
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,450
Long live my son!

418
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,350
Long live!

419
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,910
You're just coming home now?

420
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,420
Yeah.

421
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,510
But... why don't you just watch it on the TV?

422
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,080
Your eyes must hurt staring at the small screen.

423
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,350
What do you mean? I wasn't watching anything.

424
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,100
There's an antenna sticking out of your pants.

425
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:35,110
I heard a water vein is running below our house, so I'm looking for that.

426
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,050
Don't be self-conscious because of me. Just watch it.

427
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,580
This is making me more uncomfortable, you know.

428
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,660
Self-conscious? I am way too old for that!

429
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,690
The television is broken! That's why I'm not watching it...

430
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,760
It works just fine.

431
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,040
Oh! Amazing!

432
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,840
You fixed it on your first try!

433
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,010
Dad.

434
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,860
I'm really fine.

435
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,240
I'm fine, so don't worry about me.

436
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,580
You don't have to do this.

437
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,260
Get some rest.

438
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,780
Hey, come out and answer the phone.

439
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,180
It's the police or something.

440
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,520
The police?

441
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,730
Someone found this near the reservoir and brought it in.

442
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,480
But we couldn't find your phone.

443
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,360
I think the drunk guy took it. Can't you track him down?

444
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,850
Are there any CCTV cameras around?

445
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,200
There are no CCTVs in this kind of neighborhood.

446
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,810
Somehow, somebody knew that and buried a body.

447
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,070
- What? 
 - Huh?

448
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,490
Hey, there's a case going on right now. It's crazy. Go home.

449
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,060
Could I make a phone call?

450
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,350
Oh, sure. Sure.

451
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,370
Thank you.

452
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,520
Hello?

453
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,170
Hello? You're listening, right?

454
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,080
Excuse me—

455
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,210
Hello? Hello?

456
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,720
What was that?

457
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,680
Why would someone steal a crappy flip phone?

458
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,610
My mom is going to be so mad at me for losing my phone.

459
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,520
   

460
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,910
 What kind of incident is this? 

461
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,160
What's going on?

462
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,180
Nothing like this has happened before.

463
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,110
I know!

464
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,090
Since when was there a road over there?

465
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,790
Someone knew and buried a body there!

466
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,300
A body?

467
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,050
Anyway, it can't be someone who lives around here. Right?

468
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,350
It can't be!

469
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:10,690
Maybe it was the fishermen who hung around the reservoir.

470
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,600
What?

471
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,410
What is this memory?

472
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,940
 It feels like the day of the accident... 

473
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,320
It's been so long since I went shopping with you!

474
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,100
I know you just followed me out because you wanted a break from studying.

475
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,060
I'm here to help you out!

476
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,950
How can you misunderstand your daughter's love like that?

477
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,350
Love? Stop kidding me.

478
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,180
Hey, did you ever find your phone?

479
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,520
No. Just my wallet.

480
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,170
All right, fine.

481
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,720
I'm not getting you a new one until the collegiate exam is done.

482
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,560
Okay, okay.

483
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,160
Let's see! Goodness...

484
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,810
Maybe because it's summer, but the condition of the apples are...

485
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,390
   
   

486
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:46,190
Excuse me, I'll take this big one.

487
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,710
- Mom, are you seeing anyone? 
 - What?

488
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,430
I'm just saying! I wish you would find a handsome, rich guy.

489
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,890
Hey. How can you say that on the anniversary of your father's death?

490
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,600
If you meet a nice guy, you should date him.

491
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,990
You're still young! You're in your prime!

492
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,190
Prime?

493
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,770
 2008 Beijing Olympics, Women's Weightlifting. 

494
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:10,210
 South Korea's Jang Mi Ran is going for the gold. 

495
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,640
 Jang Mi Ran, clean and jerk first attempt, 

496
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,750
 she is going for 175 kilograms. 

497
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,570
 Step one, she lifts the weight confidently. 

498
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,610
 Continuing with the clean and jerk, it's a success! 

499
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,450
 It's a gold medal for South Korea's Jang Mi Ran! 

500
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,370
 Jang Mi Ran is collecting her breath... 

501
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,880
 as she's going for her second attempt, clean and jerk at 183 kgs. 

502
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,040
I'm so nervous.

503
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,160
 She's increased the weight by 8 kilograms... 

504
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,000
 Step one... 

505
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,830
 Momentum is key to getting into the clean motion... 

506
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,070
 She lifted it! 

507
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,980
 Jang Mi Ran sets a new world record! 

508
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,380
 Round 3, she goes for 186 kilograms this time. 

509
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,750
 She gets into the ready position as she vocalizes... 

510
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,610
 South Korea's Jang Mi Ran, continuing to challenge herself. 

511
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:02,140
 At least in this moment, all of us are together in mind and spirit cheering on Jang Mi Ran. 

512
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,100
 Step one... 

513
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,340
 She gets up! 

514
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,030
 And the clean... 

515
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,000
 Jang Mi Ran succeeds! 

516
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,110
 Beyond a gold medal, a new Olympic and a world record! 

517
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:22,010
 South Korea's Jang Mi Ran sets all kinds of new records! 

518
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,140
Wow, a world record!

519
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,410
A world record!

520
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,810
Hey, hey.

521
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,160
You're that guy. Right?

522
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,460
What?

523
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,050
The guy who gave my little sister alcohol!

524
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:43,130
Hey, I saw you bring Sol home when she was all drunk.

525
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,690
When did I...

526
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,900
 Oh yeah, this is nothing. 

527
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,000
Oh. That time?

528
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,410
Oh, you remember it now?

529
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,150
Hands behind your back!

530
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,750
Stand up straight!

531
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,460
Hands behind your back!

532
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,600
Stand up straight!

533
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,620
It really wasn't me who gave it to her.

534
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:05,090
Are you lying now?

535
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,170
Sit.

536
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,180
Stand!

537
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,170
Sit!

538
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,520
On your stomach!

539
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,860
I just got shoulder surgery, so...

540
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,710
Then, instead, get on your feet.

541
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,580
Are you Im Sol's boyfriend?

542
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,470
No. Not yet.

543
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,320
Not yet?

544
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,700
Look at this. Im Sol must take after me, seeing she's popular.

545
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,810
Wait, then. Who is her boyfriend?

546
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,380
- Some other dude. 
 - Some other dude? Who?

547
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,550
Oh! The guy who put out the fire in our house that time?

548
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,860
Oh! I liked that guy!

549
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,260
- How so? 
 - He's good-looking, dresses well, looks popular!

550
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,640
And when I saw him putting out the fire, he was brave and manly!

551
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,600
You really don't have an eye for people.

552
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,020
What? What did you say?

553
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,150
Stand up straight!

554
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,160
Stand up straight!

555
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,280
Im Geum!

556
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,390
Who are you to tell Sun Jae what to do?

557
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,410
You learned useless things while you were in the military, living off our tax money!

558
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,040
You brat, you want your brother to teach you a lesson?

559
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,620
Break it up, you two!

560
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,770
Mom, were you a volleyball player or something?

561
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,310
Why do you always land a spike on me?

562
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,320
Shut up!

563
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,860
Your father might come back from the dead

564
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,380
and run right back screaming after seeing you two.

565
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,620
Come here! I got you two good today.

566
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,310
Go make the pancakes. Go!

567
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,250
- Hold on, hold on... 
 - Mom!

568
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,980
- It hurts! 
 - Seriously, go!

569
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,350
Mom, let me go!

570
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,870
- I'm going to kill you! 
 - Let go!

571
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,750
Let me go!

572
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,630
 He's good-looking, dresses well, looks popular! 

573
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,710
Good looking?

574
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,070
No. Don't look.

575
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,790
Sun Jae, don't look!

576
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,720
   

577
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,220
   

578
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,380
   

579
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,310
   

580
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,140
 Did you have fun looking? 

581
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,880
No!

582
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,670
 - Isn't that Kim Tae Sung? 
 - It is! 

583
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,100
   

584
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,060
 It's Kim Tae Sung! He's so hot! 

585
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,380
Cute.

586
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,600
 He's so good looking. 

587
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:45,350
   

588
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,310
 The number you are trying to reach is not available... 

589
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:54,490
Man... I really can't figure her out.

590
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,850
 He's so cute. 

591
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,950
 Hey, where are you? 

592
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,260
 In your head. 

593
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,180
Stop fucking around and get here now.

594
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,400
What? I thought we were done with practice yesterday.

595
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,640
We just learned the chords. How can we be done?

596
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,750
Tomorrow is the performance. What are you going to do?

597
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,300
Get here within 15 minutes.

598
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,660
Hey. I have to go soon.

599
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,080
My mom thinks I'm studying, so she's coming to pick me up.

600
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,990
Then, let's practice vocals without the bass.

601
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:46,790
♫  I love you...  ♫

602
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:50,290
♫  Maybe we are...  ♫

603
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,880
Stop.

604
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,900
Dong Sup, that's not the right pitch.

605
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,570
Oh! I'm sorry.

606
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,020
I started out too high, huh?

607
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,830
No! You started out too low!

608
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,470
How can he be our singer?

609
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:19,010
 Should I get Sun Jae to be in the band? 

610
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:02,920
 Dad. Actually, I'm a little scared. 

611
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,530
 That I might not be able to protect myself or Sun Jae. 

612
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,610
 So, Dad, please help me. 

613
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,320
Are you good at riding a bike?

614
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,650
Yeah. You don't know how?

615
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,420
No.

616
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,220
When I was little, I practiced with my dad every weekend.

617
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,430
But I was too scared to actually ride it.

618
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,850
Dad said it was his wish to see me ride a bike. I didn't get to show him.

619
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:50,300
You can learn now. He'll see it from up there.

620
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,880
Sun Jae!

621
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,230
Get down.

622
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,630
What?

623
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,980
This is why it doesn't feel stable.

624
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,970
If the seat is too high, you'll hurt yourself if you fall.

625
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,260
Get back on.

626
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,620
- Better, right? 
 - Yeah.

627
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,360
I'll hold you from the back, so ride slowly.

628
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,210
You're going to teach me?

629
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:19,030
You can tell me if I'm cut out to be a PE teacher.

630
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,170
Are you going to yell at me if I'm bad at it?

631
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,750
Scolding me and stuff?

632
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,090
Do you know what my best quality as an athlete was?

633
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,840
- What was it? 
 - Com-po-sure.

634
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,590
   

635
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,250
Listen to me. The handle! Handle! Handle!

636
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,490
Left foot! Right foot!

637
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,930
Left foot right away! I mean, right foot!

638
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:42,540
Right foot! Right foot! Left foot!

639
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,080
Here, look.

640
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,100
As your left foot goes, your right foot follows right away.

641
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,900
Then, use the handle to balance at the same time. Can't you do that?

642
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,110
If I could, would I be learning from you at this age?

643
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:01,120
Such a temper. Did you sell your composure to the devil?

644
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,270
Okay, let's try again.

645
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,510
Let's go...

646
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,580
Did you sell your motor nerves to the devil?

647
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,900
I don't want to learn anymore.

648
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,170
What? Did you give away your endurance too?

649
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:25,650
How are you going to be a PE teacher like this? You lack the temperament!

650
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,790
I need to be told I'm doing a good job to get better!

651
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:32,140
Really? Okay, want to try again?

652
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,790
You're doing great! You're doing great!

653
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,770
You're doing great!

654
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,770
You're doing great!

655
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,410
You're—

656
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,820
You fell. That's... You fell nicely.

657
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,590
Just like this.

658
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,870
- Like this? 
 - Yeah, yeah.

659
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,480
You're doing great.

660
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:07,200
You haven't let go. Right? If you let go, you're in trouble.

661
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,270
I didn't.

662
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:14,340
Oh, you let go. Right?

663
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,510
You're doing great!

664
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,420
- You let go? 
 - Look in front of you!

665
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,760
Oh, oh.

666
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,100
Pick up speed.

667
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,440
Okay.

668
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,260
Wow, look at me!

669
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,050
♫  All these times that have been hiding...  ♫

670
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,060
 This moment. 

671
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,750
 A moment that I shouldn't let pass me by. 

672
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:56,910
♫  Wherever I am... ♫

673
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:03,120
♫  At the end, it's always you  ♫

674
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,730
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

675
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:08,650
Oh, careful.

676
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,860
You did it. Good job.

677
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:23,570
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

678
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:24,980
I want to try again.

679
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,070
Really? You might not be able to walk tomorrow.

680
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,460
Exactly.

681
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,410
Because I might not be able to walk tomorrow.

682
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,340
Oh, hey, hey. Watch out for the corner.

683
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,440
Want to race?

684
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,580
With a bike?

685
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,570
Yes.

686
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:47,170
Hey, you're already ready to race?

687
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,530
   

688
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:02,090
Let's remember. You got this.

689
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:07,290
 This morning, the results of the 2009 collegiate exams were distributed. 

690
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:10,530
 There is rising controversy over the difficulty level of the mathematics section. 

691
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:14,700
 After receiving the results, the students have said the exams were especially hellish... 

692
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,850
 Math section is hopeless. Just get through it. 

693
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,060
 Focus on other subjects. 

694
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,710
♫  I am your superhero  ♫ 
    

695
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:34,310
 Am I crazy? Why do I keep thinking about him? 

696
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:36,880
 Forget him. Forget him! 

697
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,560
Hey! What's wrong?

698
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,460
Can we skip studying today?

699
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,070
Thoughts, go away! Go away!

700
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:50,020
What's wrong?

701
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,350
I need to clear my head.

702
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,590
Hey, girlfriend.

703
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,740
New clothes? Who are you trying to impress?

704
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,250
You're always in workout clothes.

705
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,280
Hey, darling! Come on over here.

706
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,800
- Long time no see, come over here. 
 - Don't reply, don't make eye contact.

707
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,080
Just go straight until you see something you like.

708
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,590
Even if you want something, don't let it show.

709
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:19,390
If you don't, they'll rip you off.

710
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:21,200
What are you looking for?

711
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,980
That one!

712
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,150
Hey! Did you not hear me?

713
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,040
The matching set? Wow, bold choice.

714
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:39,570
It's 17, but I'll give it to you for 15. Come over here, come, come.

715
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:42,410
Hey, Sun Jae, I'm going to look around.

716
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:45,400
This is perfect for you.

717
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,530
Your boyfriend is performing, you should be there. Am I wrong?

718
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:53,150
I'm here because Hyun Joo wants to see the show.

719
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,610
Don't call us up again until the collegiate exam is done.

720
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,970
Okay, Noona.

721
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,940
Don't play hard to get.

722
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,220
Huh? Sun Jae!

723
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:14,690
Are you here for the show, too?

724
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,080
Yeah.

725
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:25,220
People might think the two of us are a couple.

726
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:37,450
   

727
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,880
You should change.

728
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,540
Why should I?

729
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:45,710
Where is this confidence coming from? You don't want to be compared to me.

730
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,610
Isn't it cringe to say something like that yourself?

731
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,960
Here are your drinks, enjoy.

732
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,610
Thank you.

733
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,950
Here.

734
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,840
What are you doing? Sit.

735
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,990
 There are cute boys like these two everywhere. 

736
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:18,210
 Im Geum? Makes no sense. 

737
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:22,140
Hi. I'm Lee Hyun Joo, Sol's friend.

738
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,530
- Nice to meet you! 
  - Hyun Joo! 

739
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:28,080
 She's always had that baby voice she puts on whenever she meets a cute guy. 

740
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,470
Cool.

741
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,070
Oh, wait.

742
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,800
Drink this one. You don't like sweet stuff.

743
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,150
Thanks.

744
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,580
Where's Baek In Hyuk? I thought you guys all came together.

745
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,070
He's busy shopping for clothes.

746
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:47,460
Right. You got my gift, right?

747
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,400
   

748
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,240
 Did you have fun looking? 

749
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,610
Gift?

750
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:57,130
It was fan service. He seems really interested in me.

751
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:01,640
I declined it. Didn't you check?

752
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,360
There's something on your face.

753
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:15,050
Wow, singles can go cry in a corner. Right?

754
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,880
Do you have a girlfriend?

755
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,140
No.

756
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,050
Really? Do you have a crush on anyone?

757
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,680
He doesn't want to answer! Okay.

758
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:02,660
Hey, where's In Hyuk and Dong Sup?

759
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,270
I don't know.

760
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,980
- Hey, guys! 
 - Whoa.

761
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,880
- There's a big problem. 
 - Your outfit is the bigger problem!

762
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,660
What kind of fashion trend is this? Are you going on a comedy special?

763
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,970
No, it's not that.

764
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:17,110
- Dong Sup can't come! 
 - What?

765
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,120
That mama's boy.

766
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,580
His mom won't let him perform, so he's stuck at home. What do we do?

767
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,150
We're screwed! What do we do?

768
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:31,330
- Oh! Hey, should I sing? 
 - You want to embarrass yourself onstage?

769
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:34,370
Just tell them we don't have a singer, and we can't go on.

770
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:37,920
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

771
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,700
Hello? Where are you?

772
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,880
Where's Sun Jae?

773
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:11,540
 What a passionate set from Black Tetra just now. 

774
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,440
 Let's keep up the heat with the next set. The next participants... 

775
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,260
They're about to start. Where is he?

776
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,450
 Eclipse! 

777
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:28,110
 What? Isn't that Ryu Sun Jae? 

778
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:50,360
♫  I'm so lonely  ♫

779
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:54,050
♫  I'm so lonely  ♫

780
00:52:54,050 --> 00:53:02,440
♫  Since that day you left me  ♫

781
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:11,640
♫  Even with the endless nights and sad heartaches  ♫

782
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:20,500
♫  I can't forget you. That I'm alone.  ♫

783
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:28,850
♫  I'll be there, you're the only one for me  ♫

784
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:32,970
♫  I'm always dreaming of you  ♫

785
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:37,580
♫  That's the life for me  ♫

786
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:41,870
♫  What a feeling, I feel love  ♫

787
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:45,740
♫  You know it too  ♫

788
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:50,330
♫  Even when many days have passed  ♫

789
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:58,980
♫  ♫  I'll be there, and I'll be there and wait for you  ♫ 

790
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,900
♫  I'll be there (I'll be there)  ♫

791
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:07,150
♫  You're the only one for me  ♫

792
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:11,250
♫  I'm always dreaming of you  ♫

793
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,810
I loved your set.

794
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:16,720
You're so good-looking.

795
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,850
Did they leave already?

796
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:22,980
We've met before.

797
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,380
In front of your school.

798
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:28,530
Ryu Sun Jae is such a good singer. Baek In Hyuk was amazing, too.

799
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:32,520
Can we talk for a second? Just a second.

800
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,530
Why is Manager Kim here?

801
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:37,820
 He was struggling with severe... 

802
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,530
No. No...

803
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,020
Sol!

804
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,390
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you okay?

805
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,340
What? Were you waiting for me?

806
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,070
Why are you home so late? Who did you meet?

807
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:21,510
- I thought you left, so I was with In Hyuk— 
 - The guy who gave you his card. You were with him. Right?

808
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:22,860
How did you know?

809
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:26,410
What did he say? Does he want to sign you? Do you want that?

810
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:30,820
What are you talking about? He asked for my contact info, but I said no.

811
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,100
Why do you want to know?

812
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,610
Just because. There are so many weirdos out there.

813
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,270
I hear a lot of them are scammers.

814
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:45,460
I just got worried.

815
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,520
I'm not a kid. You don't need to worry about me like that.

816
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,260
Here.

817
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,520
They gave us a prize.

818
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:12,790
Did you sing for this?

819
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:16,590
- Yeah. 
 - This isn't worth singing to all those people!

820
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:19,820
I've never done anything for you. Why?

821
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:23,540
- I thought you might need a phone— 
 - It doesn't matter what I need!

822
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,790
Why are you worried about me?

823
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,360
Why?

824
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,020
- Am I not allowed to worry about you? 
 - No, don't.

825
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,020
Don't worry about anyone else. Don't live for anyone else.

826
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,050
You'll hide your feelings and shove them aside. You'll take it.

827
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,990
You'll get hurt again, and you'll just keep taking it.

828
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:45,550
You'll suffer so much you can't sleep, then give it all up.

829
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,190
- So don't do that. 
 - I don't understand what you're saying.

830
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,730
Why is this little thing such a big deal?

831
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,900
I wish you only cared about yourself.

832
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:01,460
You should think about how you can be happier.

833
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,450
I wish that was the only thing you thought about.

834
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,410
Only think about myself?

835
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,480
Should I try that?

836
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:22,960
Forget it. I did all this for nothing.

837
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,410
You can throw this out or whatever you want.

838
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:35,280
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

839
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:43,380
♫  I want to go back to our time together  ♫

840
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,910
♫  No matter what happens, I will remember you  ♫

841
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,710
   

842
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:58,230
♫  Your name is painted deep in my heart  ♫

843
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:01,760
 Only think about myself? Should I try that? 

844
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:15,170
 - I thought you might need a phone. 
 - It doesn't matter what I need! 

845
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:17,350
 Why are you worried about me? 

846
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:20,640
 Why? Am I not allowed to worry about you? 

847
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,860
 It's my number one treasure. 

848
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,810
 Here we go again. 

849
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,340
What?

850
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,010
- This is still... 
  - You can talk. 

851
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:02,730
 Wow, you walked right out of an advertisement. You came alive. 

852
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:05,000
 Yeah, you are so funny. 

853
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,010
How do I delete it?

854
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:21,000


855
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:37,980
Sun Jae.

856
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,530
You told me to only think about myself. ight?

857
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,430
Can you break up with him?

858
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:53,100
If that's what I want, can you do that?

859
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:54,860
 I like you. 

860
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:59,470
Then break up with Kim Tae Sung.

861
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,490
 I... 

862
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,330
 like you. 

863
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:06,940
♫  Inside fleeting sense of time  ♫

864
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:15,350
♫  One moment, your scent came to me  ♫

865
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:21,400
♫  So you can't disappear, I won't go far away  ♫

866
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:28,690
♫  Don't let go of my hand  ♫

867
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:31,510
   

868
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,980
 How can Sun Jae like me? 

869
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:36,230
 Why does such an amazing boy like me? 

870
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,800
 So how do you feel? 

871
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,850
 - We need to talk.  
  - She doesn't like you. 

872
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:41,550
 - Why don't you back off? 
 - Follow me. 

873
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,290
 Let Kim Tae Sung deal with it. 

874
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,780
 What if she's getting beaten up? 

875
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,990
 Why are you being like this? 

876
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:49,780
 - Is that you? 
 - If Sol's not home, I'm leaving. 

877
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,740
 Don't leave. 

878
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:54,940
 I was going to wait, but I can't hide it anymore. 

879
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,670
 I... 

880
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:59,740
 Sun Jae, I'm sorry. 

881
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:03,130
 I can't come out today. Don't wait for me. 

882
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:09,080
♫  When I think of you  ♫
