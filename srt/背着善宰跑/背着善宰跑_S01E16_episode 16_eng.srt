Were you... coming to see me because I got into an accident?

Murder was his goal.

166
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,190
I knew it.

167
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,270
When I put him behind bars in 2008,

168
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,430
I said repeatedly that he'd kill again if he were released.

169
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,910
You can't rehabilitate bastards like that.

170
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,010
That devil.

171
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,150
Don't give him that kind of title and put him on a pedestal.

172
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,390
He's a loser and an outcast, not the devil.

173
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,430
When you work as a cop for a long time, you'll see it all.

174
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,990
I'm saying this just in case. It's not your fault.

175
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,340
It was his time to die.

176
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,000
Because he died, someone else might get to live.

177
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,290
Right?

178
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,380
    
 Geez!

179
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,210
   

180
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:05,050
   

181
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,970
 When will you be done? 

182
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,650
 I don't know. 
   

183
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,310
 I don't think I'll finish it today. 

184
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,940
What?

185
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,950
 Then I can't see you today, either? 

186
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,570
 I have to turn it in by tomorrow, so I'm so busy. 

187
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,470
 I'll text you when I'm done. 

188
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,300
 See you tomorrow! 

189
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,950
Sun Jae, I want to see you, too, but...

190
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,670
I have no choice.

191
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,470
He won't get mad. Right?

192
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,380
- Isn't that Ryu Sun Jae? 
 - Ryu Sun Jae?

193
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,100
- It's Ryu Sun Jae. 
 - Ryu Sun Jae!

194
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,330
It's really Ryu Sun Jae.

195
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:08,680
♫  I feel this strange feeling  ♫

196
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,180
♫  My heart is beating fast, I'm dizzy. I'm just in it  ♫

197
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,610
♫  Will it be embarrassing to say, "I miss you"?  ♫

198
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,420
 I had to come because I missed you. 

199
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,960
 He must be crazy. 

200

♫  No matter how I try to look away  ♫

205
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,190
I didn't order this.

206
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,040
- They're from Ryu Sun Jae. 
 - What?

207
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,140
I told him not to make it obvious.

208
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,110
He got one for everyone here.

209
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,220
What?

210
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,960
Ryu Sun Jae's fan service is top-notch!

211
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,720
Take pictures, or it didn't happen.

216
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,580
 I don't want your blood sugar to drop. Eat while you work. 

217
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,800
 I can't work like this! 

218
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,770

 (It means sweet) 

232
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,100
Why did you follow me all the way here?

233
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,950
You keep saying you're too busy to see me. I had to come to see you.

234
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,100
What if someone recognizes you?

235
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,780
I'm all covered up. Who'd recognize me?

236
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,590
Work. I'll just read and behave.

237
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,190
You said you'd behave.

238
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,650
I feel like we're back in college right now.

239
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,180
What?

240
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,110
That's true.

241
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,800
It's fun to have a secret romance. Right?

242
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,310
This isn't a film set, you know.

243
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,580
Could you take your "secret romance" outside?

244
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,780
Mr. Ryu Sun Jae?

245
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,420
T-T-This isn't Ryu Sun Jae.

246
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,660
He's my older brother.

247
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,880
Im Sol. Im Geum.

248
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,360
Everyone tells me my brother he looks like Ryu Sun Jae.

249
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,400
Older bro, let... let's go!

250
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,980
Brother, don't forget to put your book back.

251
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,380
Here. Let Brother carry it for you.

252
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,900
Where am I supposed to work now?

253
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,760
I can't work at home because of my cutie pie niece and nephew.

254
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,850
Take your time writing. I'll tell them I want to take this year easy.

255
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,000
I'll ask if we can start filming next year.

256
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,060
Does that even make sense?

257
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,580
I told them I'd definitely turn in the first draft by tomorrow.

258
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,400
Someone might see us. You should go.

259
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,560
Then, do you want to go...

260
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,940
somewhere quiet you can focus with Brother?

261
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,870
Where's that?

262
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,740
What? "Somewhere quiet you can focus."

263
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,480
- You meant your place? 
 - Of course.

264
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,400
Where would be more quiet than here?

265
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,840
Of course!

266
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,580
He just wants to be next to me any chance he can get.

267
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,300
Aren't you coming?

268
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,880
 What's the rush? 

269
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,990
 Gosh, he's so funny. 

270
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,940
Attention, attention, attention! My first big project as an actor, Im Geum,

271
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,480
- is about to begin! 
 - Goodness...

272
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,420
Are you getting all excited about being an extra or something again?

273
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,680
I know.

274
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,670
The legal drama his friend hooked him up with got canceled, too.

275
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,800
- Really? 
 - I auditioned and got myself cast this time!

276
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,030
I play an heir, the husband of the main character!

277
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,870
Oh, my, my, my. Really?

278
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,260
You play the husband of the lead in a weekday drama?

279
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,600
Oh, my! How did you book such a big role?

280
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,280
Now, now. Check it out with your own eyes.

281
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,210
- Oh! It's starting! 
 - Let's watch it.

282
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,680
   

283
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,890
That's brother.

284
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,690
Brother!

285
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,250
That thing? On the bed?

286
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,420
That's you! That's my son!

287
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,340
Oh, my, that's really him!

288
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,950
Honey, my goodness.

289
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,270
Holding onto your actor dreams all these years was worth it.

290
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,230
See? What did I tell you?

291
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,880
I told you I was going to make it someday.

292
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,410
I know. You never know what life might bring you.

293
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,530
Watching my son on a drama?

294
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,740
Be quiet. I'm watching the drama.

295
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,760
 Can we really do this? 

296
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,910
 Don't worry. 

297
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,570
 My husband will be asleep forever. 

298
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,780
 You're seeing someone else? 

299
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,920
 When my son is alive and well? 

300
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,660
 Just admit it. 

301
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,010
 Look. My husband, your son... 

302
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,870
 He might as well not be here. 

303
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,750
 You devil! 

304
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,530
Look at that mean woman.

305
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,790
That's it?

306
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,620
Honey, you never got up.

307
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,980
You're all wrapped up in bandages.

308
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,500
I can't tell if that's you or not. When do they come off?

309
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,990
They don't.

310
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,360
I just lie there like that and die in the last episode.

311
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,720
Look at the title! It all happens while the husband is asleep.

312
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,760
If he wakes up, the drama is over!

313
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,370
What?

314
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,620
What?

315
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,930
I mean, it's your first time starring in a drama ever.

316
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,510
That role? It's amazing.

317
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,600
I know! This is just the start.

318
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,280
- If you do this well, you'll get another opportunity. 
 - Right on.

319
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,160
But, Honey, how did you make lying down look so real?

320
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,310
I was going for "deep sleep," then got water all over myself,

321
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,860
then switched to "REM." You noticed the change in detail?

322
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,300
Of course!

323
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,140
I totally saw your eyelashes flutter ever so slightly.

324
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,630
- That's right! 
 - You look so good onscreen, Honey.

325
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,670
Even under all those bandages, we can see your nice nose bone structure.

326
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,200
Really?

327
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,810
Gosh, no wonder. The director did tell me that he loved how I looked.

328
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,170
Really?

329
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,820
Goodness, you two are a match made in heaven. A match made in heaven!

330
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:23,630
 What? I thought he brought me here to bother me. 

331
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,040
 Why is he leaving me alone? 

332
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,380
 Of course. 

333
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,610
 Should I play with him for a second? 

334
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,020
Eat while you work. I won't disturb you.

335
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,980
Go on. Work.

336
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,620
 What? He's really making me work? 

337
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,450
   

338
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,080
 Where did he go? 

339
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,150
Wow! I finished work!

340
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,760
Woo! It's finally done! Woohoo!

341
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,800
What?

342
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,880
Sun Jae.

343
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,250
What? Are you done?

344
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,250
Huh? Yeah.

345
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,640
See? If you focus, you can finish it within the day.

346
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,770
I know. I thought I'd have to stay up all night.

347
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,800
 Of course. 

348
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,170
 The time is here... 

349
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,690
Did you like the bread?

350
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,710
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

351
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,410
Go home?

352
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,630
Already?

353
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,280
He was being so clingy all day. What happened?

354
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,310
You have everything?

355
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,540
Let's go. It's late.

356
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,940
 Late? It's only 11:00. 

357
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,730
 Does he think we're still 19? 

358
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,540
Gosh! Gosh, no!

359
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,520
I spilled everything.

360
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,120
Oh, my car keys. Gather your stuff.

361
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,450
If the world were to end, he'd still drive me home.

362
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,880
I'm done with work.

363
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,960
I can stay longer.

364
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,520
Can you stay the night?

365
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,100
- Huh? 
 - Can't sleep over and go tomorrow?

366
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,810
 I knew it. 

367
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,260
Okay, if you really want me to...

368
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,580
I'll sleep over.

369
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,350
 Hey! What do you mean you're coming over tomorrow? 

370
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,750
 Everyone's here. 

371
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,110
 Get over here now. 

372
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,720
Oh, I-I-I m-m-misunderstood.

373
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,820
I'll just get a cab.

374
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,060
Where are you going? I thought you wanted to sleepover.

375
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,310
Oh, no, I thought you were talking to me.

376
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,380
If I was, were you going to sleep over?

377
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,760
When I said I'd sleep over, I meant...

378
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,030
I've been busy with work lately, and we haven't even gone on a date.

379
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,860
We could eat something yummy, watch a movie, hang out, and...

380
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,370
Hang out, and?

381
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,190
H-H-Hang out... and...

382
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,190
Right! We can catch up on variety shows together,

383
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,620
talk a little, and...

384
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,950
Talk a little, and?

385
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,060
Then, it might get too late.

386
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,170
And rather than go home so late,

387
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,920
I could fall asleep here. That's what I meant.

388
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,500
So, you are sleeping over.

389
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,770
"Sleeping over," not "sleeping like that...!"

390
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,120
Okay. Let's do whatever you want.

391
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,920
We can eat something yummy, watch a movie,

392
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,710
catch up on variety shows, and what else? Talk?

393
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,360
Yes. Yes. Talk.

394
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,120
Okay. We can do all that.

395
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,790
But...

396
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,770
This first.

397
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:57,780
♫  It wasn't how I felt, so I had to let it go  ♫

398
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:03,350
♫  I recollect that day, our night  ♫

399
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:11,740
♫  When I walk down the staircase of memories and call your name  ♫

400
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:18,960
♫  I can see a little clearer  ♫

401
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,910
♫  Maybe I was waiting for this, inside scattered passages of time  ♫

402
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:33,450
♫  One moment, your scent came to me  ♫

403
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:39,510
♫  So you can't disappear, I won't go far away  ♫

404
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,040
♫  Don't let go of my hands  ♫

405
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,100
Sun Jae.

406
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,670
I love you, too.

407
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,980
You're awake?

408
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,900
No, I'm not.

409
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,600
What? You're totally awake.

410
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,330
You said you were leaving tomorrow. Get some more sleep.

411
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,140
♫  I can hear it anywhere  ♫

412
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,130
It is already tomorrow.

413
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,260
Until I open my eyes, it's not.

414
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:03,340
I know you're just trying to get me to stay right here.

415
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,880
Stop! I'm awake!

416
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,600
I surrender! I surrender. I'm awake.

417
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,530
I surrender. I surrender.

418
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,790
♫  I know I can reach you  ♫

419
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:22,360
♫  You became my miracle  ♫

420
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,730
♫  Tell me, I love you  ♫

421
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,450
♫  I'll always be by your side  ♫

422
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,700
Why are you staring at me like that?

423
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,090
What? Do I have eye boogers in my eyes?

424
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,960
Yeah.

425
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,500
What?

426
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,680
♫  Just you and I, you and I  ♫

427
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,840
I'm kidding.

428
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,530
♫  Just you and I  ♫

429
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,140
You. Seriously!

430
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,450
♫  You and I  ♫

431
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,570
I was staring because you're pretty.

432
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,180
♫  You and I  ♫

433
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,890
♫  I remember that time, coming to me like fate  ♫

434
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,830
It doesn't feel real.

435
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,910
I feel like I'm dreaming.

436
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,840
Me, too.

437
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,160
♫  You help me not to fear my dream  ♫

438
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:20,180
Sometimes, I get scared... that you'll leave for another timeline.

439
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,660
And that I'll forget you again.

440
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,790
♫  You are my miracle  ♫

441
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,720
♫  Tell me, I love you  ♫

442
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,650
That's not going to happen anymore.

443
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,030
- Really? 
 - Really.

444
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,770
Even if I wanted to, I can't go.

445
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,120
I don't even have the watch anymore.

446
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,410
- That's true. 
 - By the way, where is that electronic watch?

447
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,910
I don't know.

448
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,660
I think I lost it a long time ago. I don't know where it is.

449
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,340
Maybe I dropped it somewhere. Maybe someone found it.

450
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,260
Gosh, I paid 3 million won  ($3k)   for it. What a waste.

451
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,630
I should've found it.

452
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,120
You don't need it anymore anyway.

453
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,890
Because we'll stay together like this.

454
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:09,590
♫  Tell me, I love you  ♫

455
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:14,290
I know, but... shouldn't we get up for real now?

456
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:17,410
No. Five more minutes.

457
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,170
No. Ten minutes.

458
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,840
No. Thirty minutes!

459
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,800
Mom! What are you doing standing over there?

460
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,620
Let's go.

461
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,730
Okay. Wait for me, unni!

463
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,600
♫  My heart is beating fast, I'm dizzy. I'm just in it  ♫

464
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:08,480
♫  Will it be embarrassing to say "I miss you"?  ♫

465
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,780
I'll shower now. Get out.

466
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,460
Okay.

467
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,220
Do you want to shower togeth...

468
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,450
I said get out! Get out!

469
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,610
Isn't it scary by yourself?

Sun Jae! I have to go.

472
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,770
You won't have breakfast?

473
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,800
CEO Lee wanted to meet this morning. I have to go. Sorry. Bye!

474
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,300
Hold on!

475
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,690
Here, take this for the road.

476
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,950
I'll drive you.

477
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,110
No. You want the residents to see us again like last time?

478
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,740
- Bye. 
 - Hold on!

479
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,330
Will you wear this?

480
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,000
Right.

Good?

485
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:07,060
Don't we look like newlyweds right now?

486
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,250
See you! Bye!

487
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,150
♫  I wish for you to welcome that  ♫

488
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,100
Newlyweds?

489
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,110
   

490
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,090
I can't even tell what she looks like.

491
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,360
A library date?

492
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,690
Seems like a wholesome, smart young lady.

493
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:34,410
If he took her home, he must be really smitten with her.

494
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,230
Whoever she is, even though her face is blurred out,

495
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,830
I can feel her beauty penetrating through the screen.

496
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:51,940
No wonder Sun Jae is smitten.

497
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,980
I thought he didn't blink an eye at legendary beauties.

498
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,430
I can tell by her silhouette that she's no beauty.

499
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,240
What's wrong with his taste in women?

500
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,860
He better not be smitten with a weirdo!

501
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,390
Hyung, how long do we have to stay like this?

502
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,470
I'm losing blood circulation in my fingers.

503
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:25,150
I can't find something that's perfect for Sol's vibe.

504
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:28,030
What is Sol's vibe?

505
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,850
Look.

506
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:43,210
Watch your eyes because her dazzling beauty might be too blinding.

507
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,890
Here we go.

508
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,710
Wait! What? Your girlfriend looks familiar.

509
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,290
I think I've seen her somewhere.

510
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:55,720
Where would you have seen such a dazzling woman?

511
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,140
Let me see.

512
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,380
Hey! Where are you touching? Don't touch her!

513
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,960
Huh?

514
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,310
I like this one.

515
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,810
- I'll take this one. 
 - Yes, just a moment.

516
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:16,040
Hyung, I don't care what gifts you get for your girlfriend, but...

517
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,910
You made the news this morning with your dating scandal.

518
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,900
Are you trying to actively create wedding rumors?

519
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,600
- Maybe they're not rumors. 
 - Sure.

520
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,720
What? What are you talking about?

521
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,510
Are you going to announce an engagement or something?

522
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,790
Does the CEO know?

523
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,810
You could let him know.

524
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,540
Right.

525
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,150
Are you serious? You're going to marry her?

526
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,030
I don't want to be away from her, not one more second.

527
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,190
That's what you think.

528
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,280
Dating is dating, but marriage is a whole other story.

529
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,320
Do you think I'm dumb? I know that.

530
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,160
That's why I'm trying to propose. Officially.

531
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,900
You think you propose, and that's it?

532
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,660
Have you asked her family for her hand?

533
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,740
No.

534
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,290
Hey. How will you survive without me?

535
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,040
Have you ever been married?

536
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,480
You haven't, either.

537
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,080
- Hey, Sol. 
  - Where are you? 

538
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,250
Me? I'm at the ring...

539
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,720
S-Studio!

540
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,110
In Hyuk's recording studio.

541
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,180
I'm here to help him work on a song.

542
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,940
You can hear it, right?

543
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,060
Hurry up.

544
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,860
♫  I'm running to you  ♫

545
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,550
 Come home right now! 

546
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,700
   

547
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,870
What are we going to do?

548
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,150
They should have done a better job airbrushing you.

549
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,500
They just blurred out your face!

550
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,400
- Is that important? 
 - No one knows it's you.

551
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,870
They covered up your pretty face.

552
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,860
That is not what matters right now!

553
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,560
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

554
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,180
How are you going to handle it?

555
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:05,410
- That's... 
  - You know the most important thing about proposals? 

556
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,910
 Keep it a secret. 

557
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:10,850
 The minute she realizes you'll propose, the fantasy is destroyed! 

558
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:15,090
 Until you propose, don't run your mouth just because you're dying to talk. 

559
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,880
 Mark my words. 

560
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,450
 Keep it a secret. A secret. 

561
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,710
I'll try a couple of things.

562
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,680
I won't let it affect you.

563
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,600
It's not about me.

564
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,590
I'm just worried about you.

565
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,830
Did you come running because you're worried about me?

566
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,460
Yeah.

567
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,740
Gosh, should I make you worry more often?

568
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,890
Whatever. We might get photographed again.

569
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,800
Hurry up and go.

570
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,010
Don't follow me out!

571
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,260
You're home late.

572
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,120
Tae Sung!

573
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,190
You were at my house? What's up?

574
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,000
I heard it's Jae Ha's first birthday tomorrow.

575
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,300
I just dropped off a present.

576
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,100
The kids must have been so happy to see their uncle.

577
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,070
Why do you celebrate a friend's nephew's birthday?

578
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,450
I'm also friends with Sol's sister-in-law.

579
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,510
I'm celebrating my friend's son's birthday.

580
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:35,840
Oh, my! Ryu Sun Jae, what are you doing here?

581
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,620
What a coincidence!

582
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,920
I can tell you're acting.

583
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,500
I saw gigantic headlines about your romance this morning.

584
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,520
- It's you. Right? 
 - How did you know?

585
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,550
Must I find out about my friend's new boyfriend from the news?

586
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,570
Aren't you going to introduce me?

587
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,890
What kind of celebrity dates so publicly?

588
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,180
Spreading gossip everywhere.

589
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,190
Are you jealous right now?

590
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,170
No, I'm concerned.

591
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,730
I'm not saying this because I feel threatened, so don't get it twisted.

592
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,670
You were just part of her life at one time.

593
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,990
An ex-boyfriend. Got it?

594
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,190
What?

595
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:21,310
I don't want you to hold onto the two weeks you dated her a long, long time ago.

596
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,020
Ex-boyfriend.

597
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,790
Current boyfriend.

598
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,650
Current boyfriend, ex-boyfriend!

599
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,970
Okay?

600
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,960
What are you talking about? I never dated Sol.

601
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,950
You didn't?

602
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:36,780
Did Im Sol say we dated?

603
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,320
What?

604
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,380
What?

605
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,790
Did you lose your mind?

606
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,090
Why are you laughing?

607
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,910
Nothing.

608
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,960
This is a good change.

609
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,420
What a relief.

610
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,680
What are you laughing about?

611
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,180
Have a seat.

612
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,730
I don't know.

613
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,840
I think your boyfriend is insane.

614
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,370
What?

615
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,650
Why did you take this off?

616
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:27,220
It's fine. All of Korea knows that I'm in a relationship now.

617
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,240
Still.

618
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,610
There are no other customers.

619
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,090
No one is watching.

620
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,790
Here.

621
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,950
Have a drink.

622
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,230
How long have you been together?

623
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,950
- Not too long. 
 - 15 years.

624
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,430
What?

625
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:53,080
Actually, we knew each other before.

626
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,140
We were neighbors.

627
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,850
Really?

628
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:02,590
So, the guy you said you'd never forget until you die.

629
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,290
Is this him?

630
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,960
- Yes. 
 - I had a feeling.

631
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,720
She was drunk and called out your name ever so desperately.

632
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,640
Be good to my girl Sol.

633
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,340
She's a friend I really care about.

634
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,940
So... when are you going to stop calling her "my girl Sol"?

635
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,440
I felt this last time, too, but... my guy Ryu Sun Jae.

636
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,810
You have some jealousy issues.

637
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,360
"Some" jealousy issues?

638
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,950
Let's tread carefully moving forward.

639
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:50,260
We haven't drank together before. Right?

640
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,540
♫  Don't go, don't go!  ♫

641
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,200
No way.

642
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,750
We don't know each other.

643
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,230
I guess.

644
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,980
So, can you hold your liquor?

645
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,300
Let me know if you can't take it.

646
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,520
Well, the only drink I don't like is makgeolli.

647
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,710
I can drink pretty much any other kind of alcohol.

648
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,200
I've never been drunk, actually.

649
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,040
What? Detective, are you a lightweight?

650
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,850
No way.

651
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:32,840
Then... should we go for it?

652
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,510
Is Hyung really drunk?

653
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:53,060
- Could you take him already? 
 - Yes, yes.

654
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,060
Hyung! Let's go. Come on. I'm sorry.

655
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,190
- Good night. 
 - Hyung, let's go.

656
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,020
Let me go!

657
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,460
Hey, Kim Tae Sung!

658
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,640
"Hey, Kim Tae Sung"?

659
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:17,190
Hey, Ryu Sun Jae, you can't do this here.

660
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,750
Thank you.

661
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:33,020
I said thank you.

662
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:37,220
For getting the criminal Kim Young Soo.

663
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,100
Geez. Don't thank me. It's my job.

664
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,880
Sol told me that, too. What's going on?

665
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,080
You ended it for us.

666
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,370
The twisted, unlucky fates.

667
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,320
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

668
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,710
Hey, Hyung!

669
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:06,220
I'm so sorry.

670
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,340
Let's go! Gosh, why are you so tall?

671
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:13,190
Hey. Don't let your boyfriend get drunk too often.

672
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,970
Okay. Bye. Thank you so much.

673
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:18,810
All right. Get home safe.

674
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,080
Gosh, you haven't changed.

675
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,630
You're a lightweight.

676
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,200
I'm not drunk.

677
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,620
If you're not, sit up.

678
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,810
Then, let's say that I'm drunk.

679
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:54,220
I'm so drunk.

680
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,190
Geez.

681
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,660
So, tomorrow's your nephew's birthday party?

682
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,220
Why didn't you tell me?

683
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,700
I didn't?

684
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,930
So what, though?

685
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,230
 You think you propose, and that's it? 

686
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:13,040
 Have you asked her family for her hand? 

687
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,240
- I should be there. 
 - It's not really a party.

688
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,410
It's just a family meal.

689
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:21,640
Then, I should really be there.

690
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,990
- Let's go! 
 - We're here!

691
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,710
What's this?

692
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,860
What's that?

693
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,300
Look over there!

694
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,000
Come here.

695
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,690
- Give me your hand. 
 - Sunglasses?

696
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:40,800
Goodness, sunglasses? So extra.

697
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,310
You were wrapped up in bandages. Who would recognize you?

698
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:47,740
Some ladies with razor eyes do recognize me!

699
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,290
We're having the party here?

700
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,970
You said it's a Galbi restaurant in Seouldong!

701
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,340
We're in Seouldong.

702
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,260
Geum, why did you pick this place out of all places?

703
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,780
You said the owner of this place used to be our neighbor, no?

704
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:02,240
He'll treat us well since we used to be neighbors.

705
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,720
The in-laws are on their way. Right?

706
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,900
They're running a little late because of traffic.

707
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,710
Let's go.

708
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,320
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go.

709
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,370
Let's go, let's go.

710
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:12,590
Let's go, let's go.

711
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,230
 I'm almost at Seouldong. Which restaurant is it? 

712
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,920
- Don't come! 
  - Why? What happened? 

713
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,850
Just don't come if I say so.

714
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:25,220
I'll let you meet them next time. Okay?

715
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,280
Everything's here, right? Silk thread, a stethoscope...

716
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,540
What's the watercress doing here?

717
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:38,030
This means the baby will grow up healthy and well. They put it out for babies.

718
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,970
- This is a judge's gavel... 
 - They're here.

719
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:41,340
- Hello! 
 - You're here!

720
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,150
Gosh, welcome!

721
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,080
I just finished setting the table.

722
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,810
Are you here for the one-year-old's birthday party?

723
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,500
Hello.

724
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:56,060
Do you remember me? I'm Im Geum from Geum Video &amp; DVD.

725
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,770
Very faintly.

726
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:01,890
Thank you for choosing our restaurant on this happy day.

727
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:04,080
Make sure the birthday table's not missing anything.

728
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,500
All right!

729
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,930
Thank you. Let's take a look!

730
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:12,550
Now that you're all dressed up, how should I say this?

731
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:14,950
Well, um...

732
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,670
Gosh, don't worry.

733
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,740
I know I look good in a hanbok.

734
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,230
Thank you.

735
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,980
Sure.

736
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:28,220
Goodness, this must be your wholesome, stunningly beautiful daughter.

737
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,980
- How have you been? 
 - Hello.

738
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,610
I think I've caught a glimpse of you before.

739
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,040
I also strangely feel like I saw you the other day.

740
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,250
Right?

741
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,430
My daughter has such a lovely face.

742
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,300
She gets that a lot.

743
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,180
What do you think? Don't you think you missed out?

744
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,230
Missed out? No way.

745
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:50,850
Did you see the news about my son's romance?

746
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:54,740
I think I'll have a beautiful daughter-in-law pretty soon.

747
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:00,090
My daughter's boyfriend is coming today, too.

748
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,530
Seeing as he volunteered to come to a family event,

749
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,770
my daughter might have a date on the books soon, too!

750
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:09,040
- Mom, no! 
 - Come on.

751
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,240
Sure, sure.

752
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,880
Our children seem to have each found their match.

753
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,020
Right?

754
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,720
- I'll be off, then. 
 - Bye.

755
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,290
My grandson-in-law!

756
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,860
Goodness, my son! What are you doing here at this hour?

757
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,130
Are you here to see dad?

758
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,250
What are you doing here? My goodness!

759
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:48,430
I've been thinking about how I feel so bad and grateful about last time.

760
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:51,270
I didn't even recognize Ryu Sun Jae, the star!

761
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,410
I'm such a big fan!

762
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,180
Wait, Ryu Sun Jae! The celebrity!

763
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,210
It's Ryu Sun Jae. You saw him on TV. Right?

764
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:04,390
How come you're so late?

765
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:09,980
- Ma'am, you can't just hug him like that. 
 - Mom? Come here, Mom.

766
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:14,110
- Mom, come here. 
 - We'll get you autographs later, so go on with your party.

767
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:17,050
- Okay, okay. 
 - Let's go.

768
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,950
Here.

769
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,630
Huh? M-Me?

770
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,720
Hello, Mother.

771
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:32,370
- M-Mother? 
 - M-Mother?

772
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,520
I told you not to come! What are you doing here?

773
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,240
Everyone's going to be so surprised.

774
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,610
Why not? It's good to meet both sides of the family all at once.

775
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,810
Still.

776
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,490
So... in this photo...

777
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,960
Is Sol the "mystery woman"?

778
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,370
Yes.

779
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:53,030
- My goodness, Mom! It's Sol! 
 - So pretty.

780
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:54,850
It's Sol!

781
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,030
Gosh, my goodness.

782
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:04,130
I think your son was definitely stunned by my daughter.

783
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,210
It looks like it.

784
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:10,970
So, when did you two start dating?

785
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:14,970
I've liked her since high school.

786
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:17,470
What? You were dating back then?

787
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,390
I don't remember that.

788
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,190
Was it a secret crush? Oh my goodness!!

789
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,220
I was so nervous that I couldn't even talk to her then.

790
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,840
Sol is so pretty, you know.

791
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,020
Oh, stop!

792
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,180
You're especially pretty today.

793
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,960
 That fool! Already? 

794
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,710
Now that we're sitting here like this,

795
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,840
it feels like a family introduction meeting for marriage. Right?

796
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:49,090
Should we just make it official?

797
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:51,060
I like that idea!

798
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,700
 Goodness, he's missing a screw. 

799
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,750
 - Our Prince Im Jae Ah...  
 - What are they doing in there having so much fun?

800
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,580
 Take a look. 

801
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,040
A judge gavel, a stethoscope, a soccer ball, a microphone,

802
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,120
a pencil, a book, and some silk thread.

803
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,650
But something is missing. What is it?

804
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,910
- Me! 
 - Money!

805
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,870
That's right! It's money!

806
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:19,310
Does anyone want to give Prince Jae Ah his first allowance?

807
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,750
Me, me, me, me!

808
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:22,640
Hold on!

809
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,590
Here, here!

810
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:28,400
Wow! A check? 
    ($1k) 

811
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,080
What? One million won?

812
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,720
Wow, we have a check for one million won here.

813
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,400
One million?

814
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,900
Wow! Applause for his future uncle, please!

815
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,100
As expected!

816
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,060
Future uncle?

817
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,740
He's already part of that family.

818
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,370
All right, folks, we're about to get the birthday party going.

819
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:50,920
Let's start it off with a round of applause!

820
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,370
What will Jae Ah choose?

821
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:55,360
Is it the microphone?

822
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:00,850
♫  I mobilize with your voice, I'm Super Ultraman  ♫

823
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:05,060
Prince Jae Ah has chosen the check, of course.

824
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,950
Next up, we have a quiz.

825
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,800
I ask for your enthusiastic participation.

826
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,970
Thank you, everyone!

827
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:15,980
Here we go with the first question!

828
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,510
What was Prince Jae Ah's weight when he was born?

829
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:20,760
- 3.4kg! 
 - Wrong!

830
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,270
- 2.8kg! 
 - Wrong!

831
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:23,730
- 3.5kg! 
 - I have the right answer!

832
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,170
Yes, future uncle!

833
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:28,200
- 3.48kg! 
 - Correct!

834
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:30,980
How did I get that?

835
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:35,140
Future uncle, I present you with a box of organic sea salt.

836
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:38,270
Gosh. He looks happy.

837
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:41,160
- He got it correct. 
 - Sea salt!

838
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,380
I understand why my son was stunned.

839
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,880
 Here we go with the second question. 

840
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,850
Sun Jae takes after me. He has such high standards.

841
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,620
- Boss? 
 - You scared me!

842
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:57,370
- It looks like you like your son's girlfriend. 
  - A tiger. 

843
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,550
I didn't think you'd like anyone he brought home.

844
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:03,250
- It's better than being alone and lonely. 
  - First one to yell out "Eagle" 

845
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,500
- Seeing Sun Jae smile like that... 
  - will receive a gift certificate. 

846
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,590
It's been a long time.

847
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:13,480
 Option 2, cat? No. What was option 3? 

848
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,120
Huh?

849
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,910
Goodness! What are you guys doing here?

850
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:31,870
- Are you guys here to eat? 
 - No, sir.

851
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,390
We're here for a gig.

852
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,320
You bought a ham? 
  (Sounds like "gig") 

853
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,100
- Why did you bring ham to a BBQ restaurant? 
 - What?

854
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,420
 Let's do a gig for my Sol's nephew's birthday party. 

855
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,930
 Is he out of his mind? 

856
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:44,400
 Hyung, just ignore it. 

857
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,300
 Are we cheap fodders for a baby's birthday party? 

858
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,750
 I'll remodel the studio as your pay. 

859
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:54,350
 Hey, he'll remodel the studio as our pay. 

860
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:57,730
 I'll switch out all the instruments and the gear, full set. 

861
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:00,720
 He'll switch out all the instruments and the gear, full set. 

862
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,620
 Where's the birthday party? 

863
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,320
Now, to finish off the event, we have a celebratory performance.

864
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,890
Wait a minute. These guys? Amazing.

865
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,820
They came all the way here just for our Prince Jae Ah.

866
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:17,010
Eclipse! A round of applause!

867
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,420
♫  You're like a shooting star  ♫

868
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:33,600
   

869
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:44,310
♫  Happy birthday, our handsome prince  ♫

870
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:48,840
♫  Happy birthday, our lovely nephew  ♫

871
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,560
♫  Strong feet, strong teeth  ♫

872
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,000
♫  Most precious baby in the world  ♫

873
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,230
♫  Thank you for coming into this world  ♫

874
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,900
I can't believe you called up Eclipse for a birthday party.

875
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,050
Their concert tickets are so expensive!

876
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,490
I can't believe you made them sing along to a karaoke track!

877
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,410
I was trying to win some brownie points with your family.

878
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:15,100
So? Do you think you did?

879
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:19,130
  I always cared for you whenever I saw you on TV. 

880
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,560
 Maybe it's because you were meant to be family. 

881
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,600
 Mom, stop. 

882
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,770
 Why? 

883
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,950
 I haven't done much for Sol, 

884
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:32,090
 but in place of our dad in heaven, 

885
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:35,070
 I'm going to watch you with an eagle eye. 

886
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:40,080
 The day you make my sister's eyes well up with tears... 

887
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,260
 - You're overreacting. 
 - Understood? 

888
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,570
 Yes. Don't worry. 

889
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:47,510
 Oh, I heard you started working as an actor. 

890
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:50,540
 I hope we can work together at some point. 

891
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,310
 Brother, I've always been a fan of yours. 

892
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,160
 Let's definitely work together at some point. 

893
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,000
 Of course. 

894
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,830
 Promise. 

895
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,120
 He promised! 

896
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,070
 Gosh, Jae Ah is crying. Let's go. 

897
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:06,710
 Okay. 

898
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,680
 - Good night. 
 - Get home safe. 

899
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,320
 - Let's go. 
 - Can I get his number? 

900
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,980
 Grandmother. 

901
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:25,290
 Have a good, long life now. 

902
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,320
 Be happy. 

903
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,830
 Laugh. 

904
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,380
 Thank you. 

905
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,160
Maybe?

906
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:18,710
What's up with the cruise ship?

907
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:22,010
Just because. We have a lot of memories of the Han River.

908
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:23,750
That's true.

909
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,300
 This is the right timing. 

910
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:39,010
Hey, Sol?

911
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,800
I want to...

912
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,440
 Propose, propose, propose... 

913
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,650
- Strike a pose! 
 - Propose?

914
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,790
- What? 
 - What?

915
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:50,460
Pose.

916
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,750
Oh. Pose?

917
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,100
W-What should we do? Should we do hearts?

918
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,620
Okay!

919
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,400
- Nice. Is it because it's at night? 
  - Are you stupid? You're stupid! 

920
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:20,540
Why... Why are you laughing?

921
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,700
Hey, by chance...

922
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,960
You won't try to propose right now, are you?

923
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:32,940
What?

924
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,630
 You know the most important thing about proposals? 

925
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:39,690
 Keep it a secret. 

926
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,120
- No. 
 - Gosh...

927
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,210
You know how they rent a whole ship and have fireworks go off in dramas?

928
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,610
Dong Seok brings in a three-tier cake, and In Hyuk throws petals around.

929
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:49,650
That kind of thing?

930
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:52,700
Dong Seok, come on out!

931
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,340
Baek In Hyuk, come out!

932
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,220
Dong Seok! Baek In Hyuk! Come out!

933
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,380
Baek In Hyuk...

934
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,270
But I'm...

935
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,320
I'm really not. What a shame.

936
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,560
Gos, I'm kidding! Don't panic.

937
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,340
Were you kidding?

938
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:10,610
That was a good one.

939
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:13,180
That was a really good one.

940
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:21,670
Hey, I have something to tell you.

941
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:23,660
 It's starting soon. What do I do? 

942
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:27,270
 Okay. Let's just say it before she notices. 

943
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:28,730
Sol.

944
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:31,440
- Would you— 
 - I'm going to make a movie!

945
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,130
What? What did you say?

946
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:36,660
I'm going to try directing a movie.

947
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,730
- A movie? 
 - Yeah.

948
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:41,840
I'll make a short film for a competition in the spring.

949
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,790
That's actually why I left the company and rushed the script.

950
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:50,260
 I haven't seen a movie in theaters forever. Too bad. 

951
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,490
 - You must like movies. 
 - Yeah. 

952
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:55,280
 I used to watch two or three a day. 

953
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,770
 I wanted to become a film director. 

954
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,250
Really?

955
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:05,500
I feel insecure about it, thinking maybe it's too late for me, but...

956
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,930
You said before that you were happy when you were swimming.

957
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:13,170
The kind of happiness you don't know until you experience it.

958
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,170
That's why I want to go for it.

959
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:20,090
No matter what the results are, I think I'll be happy.

960
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:29,200
If it's something that makes you happy, I support it.

961
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,260
Even if I get super busy again?

962
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,550
I might not be able to see you too often.

963
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:36,090
Then I'll come to see you.

964
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:37,960
I'll be cheering you on.

965
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,850
Thank you.

966
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,420
I think I'll be all over the place for a while.

967
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,590
Just wait for me a little. Okay?

968
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:48,050
Of course, as long as you need.

969
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,160
What were you going to say?

970
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,490
- Me? 
 - Yeah.

971
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:01,720
 5! 

972
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,420
 No. 

973
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,640
 This is not the right timing. 

974
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,160
 4! 

975
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:15,850
 3! 

976
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,970
 2! 

977
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,180
 1! 

978
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,740
Your ears are cold. Right?

979
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:30,960
It's okay!

980
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,500
No, it's cold!

981
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,830
It's cold. Cold...

982
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,620
 Go away! 

983
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:40,900
 Why? 

984
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,840
 Go away, please! 

985
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,620
Abort!

986
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,470
Abort, do not proceed, abort!

987
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,330
I'm not cold!

988
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:06,120
No! It's basically Siberia here.

989
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,070
You'll catch a cold.

990
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,920
But, Sun Jae...

991
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,730
I think I hear something exploding.

992
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,210
What?

993
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,740
It's the sound of my heart exploding!

994
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:27,000
   

995
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,790
What is that?

996
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:47,280
 Today is not the right timing. 

997
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,300
 Not yet. 

998
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:54,450
   

999
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,670
All right, stand by!

1000
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:59,380
Scene 23, take 1!

1001
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:03,770
Ready, action!

1002
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:09,590
It's so nice out. Right?

1003
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,820
♫  Fly towards the sun with all your strength  ♫

1004
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:17,110
Director, the coffee truck is here.

1005
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:18,970
The coffee truck?

1006
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,100
   

1007
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,300
What?

1008
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:28,750
♫  Bye-bye to tears of the past  ♫

1009
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:32,560
♫  Hi, the moment I've been waiting for. Right now  ♫

1010

♫  No more worries. Right now, running again, running again  ♫

1011
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,900
What is this? You didn't even call.

1012
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,310
I wanted to be a surprise cheerleader.

1013
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:50,290
♫  This unstoppable feeling  ♫

1014
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:52,800
Actually, it was just an excuse to see you.

1015
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,200
♫  I'm ready to run, run, embracing you beside me  ♫

 Thank you! 

1019
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,330
Can we go from the place where you don't recognize him?

1020
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:08,450
Ready...

- The camera! 
 - Cover it!

1024
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,440
The camera!

1025

I'm still in the editing room.

1030

It's late. Should I come get you?

1031
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,450
 What? 
   

1032
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,840
It's okay. I can just get a cab.

1033
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,640
You said you have a shoot tomorrow. Go to bed.

1034
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,340
 Don't come. Okay? 

1035
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:05,670
Got it. Just call me when you're done. Okay?

1036
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:07,950
 Okay.

Im Sol, you did it, finally!

1062
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:37,010
Im Sol... Good job, Im Sol.

1063
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:41,640
It's been so long since we've walked holding hands like this.

1064
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:45,920
You look even more handsome than before.

1065
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,350
Waiting around for my busy girlfriend...

1066
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,560
My insides burned black.

1067
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,880
Really? Let me see. Where?

1068
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,060
Not here. I'll show you later.

1069
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,250
What?

1070
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:04,920
Wow, I haven't been so relaxed in a long time.

1071
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,550
When do you hear back?

1072
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:08,460
Next month.

1073
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,390
You're going to get good news.

1074
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:14,310
I've been trying not to get my hopes up.

1075
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:18,790
But after I actually submitted it, I started getting my hopes up.

1076
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:21,230
I shouldn't do this to myself.

1077
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:27,190
Maybe make a wish, then?

1078
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:29,310
Like before.

1079
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:32,030
