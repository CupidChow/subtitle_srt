00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,570
 She's dozing every time I see her.

8
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,570
 We have to get out here. 

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,860
 Hey... 

10
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,930
 Hey. It's... 

11
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,530
 - Hey. 
 - You still didn't wake her up yet? 

12
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,300
 Hey, you're already there. Stay with her until she wakes up. 

13
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,040
 Pretend like you missed your stop, too. 

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,450
 You can come back with her. 

15
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,910
 Use this opportunity to talk to her, fool. 

16
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,520
 Bye. I'm going to wake her up. 

17
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,410
 Huh? When did she get off the bus? 

18
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,390
 Mr. Driver! Can you stop the bus? 

19
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,860
 I can't. 

20
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,320
 We're approaching a stop. You can get out there. 

21
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,740
 I have to get out right now! 

22
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,900
 Did the last bus already leave? 

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,730
 Should I call Mom to pick me up? 

24
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,840
   

25
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,800
 Taxi! 

26
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,700
 - Are you getting in? 
 - What? 

27
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,750
 My mom's picking me up. Sorry. 

28
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,590
 All right, then. 

29
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,540
   

30
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,330
   

31
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,840
 Has she gone already? 

32
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,320
 I think the last bus left. 

33
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,430
 She should be in a taxi, right? 

34
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,800
 Awake already? 

35
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,400
 Sol! 

36
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,620
 Im Sol! 

37
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,200
 No! 

38
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,510
 Sol! 

39
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,550
 I'm sorry. 

40
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,440
 I'm sorry... 

41
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,140
 Sol... 

42
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,580
 What? 

43
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,490
 Get him! Get him! 

44
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,400
 Let go, you bastards! 

45
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,010
   

46
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,100
   

47
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,680
Im Sol, I asked you to bring my charger!

48
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,700
What? When did she leave?

49
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,660
 It wasn't a car accident. 

50
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,220
Why is this...

51
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,750
You scared me!

52
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,370
Hey! What are you doing?

53
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,670
- Is Im Sol home? 
 - No.

54
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,700
She kept saying, "I can't go outside today." Where did she go?

55
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,970
- She said she can't go outside? 
 - Yeah.

56
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,920
She was overreacting, saying she couldn't go out today.

57
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,850
She's been saying for days that if she says she's going to a reservoir, tie her hands and feet and stop her.

58
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,800
 A reservoir? 

59
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,300
 What should we do? I think he took your phone. 

60
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,780
 - What's wrong? 
 - I just remembered the accident. 

61
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,080
 The car accident you mentioned? 

62
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,880
 - Did that happen here? 
 - Yes. 

63
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,500
 I think so. 

64
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,200
- Is it the reservoir where Sol was in a car accident in the past? 
 - A car accident?

65
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,300
What are you saying? She's never even had a scar.

66
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,900
- She's never been in an accident? 
 - Why? Did she say so?

67
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,760
Maybe she dreamed that she got into an accident at a reservoir.

68
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,300
 Yeah, a dream! I had a bad dream. I dreamed that you got hurt in the arena. 

69
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,040
 It was so vivid that it felt real. 

70
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,480
What was that?

71
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040
 Yes, I can escape. 

72
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,870
 I know everything. I can change it. 

73
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,510
   

74
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,850
So, someone is missing.

75
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,710
And you have a feeling she's here. Right? Purely because of your intuition. Right?

76
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,600
Can you just try to find her?

77
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,340
Is it because there was a murder around here?

78
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,520
Why does everyone think something is going to happen here?

79
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,170
Go look for her in a PC cafe or a karaoke.

80
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,100
But...

81
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,300
 The reservoir is that way. 

82
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,350
 If so... 

83
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,490
Is today September 1st?

84
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,670
The girl who came for her wallet also said something might happen today.

85
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,700
Excuse me?

86
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,840
Sol! Im Sol!

87
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,660
 Do I need to accept this? 

88
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,100
 Is this my inevitable fate? 

89
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,120
Sol!

90
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:38,570
- Are you all right? 
 - Hey, are you all right?

91
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,570
I'm alive.

92
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,520
 Where am I? 

93
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,000
Sol, are you all right?

94
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,600
Did something happen to you?

95
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,440
Where am I?

96
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,410
Who are you?

97
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,930
Im Sol!

98
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,970
Was it you who violated my lips that night, maiden?

99
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:36,280
No, Your Majesty! I did not mean to. I misstepped...

100
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,390
I did not think you would be sleeping there, Your Majesty.

101
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,320
 What in the world... no way... 

102
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,760
But what can we do? I happen to have a temper.

103
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,830
 Joseon Dynasty? 

104
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,200
 You've got to be kidding me. 

105
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,990
No!

106
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,760
Cut! What do you mean, "no?!"

107
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,540
Hey! Assistant Director, what is going on?

108
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,520
I'm sorry. Let's take a 10-minute break.

109
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,630
This is so annoying.

110
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,940
What is going on?

111
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,600
You should know better. What's going on?

112
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,810
It's New Year's, and we'll be behind schedule.

113
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,810
We're in 2023. Right? 
    

114
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,430
- We're not in the Joseon Dynasty. Right? 
 - What?

115
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,920
Oh, my goodness, thank God!

116
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,070
Thank God! You did well...

117
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,510
What's wrong with you?

118
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,850
Crazy lady.

119
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,080
Who is he calling a crazy lady?

120
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,570
You must be cold, Sol. Put this on.

121
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,460
You were great.

122
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,720
Hey, Sol. Why are you crying?

123
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,670
Did he flip out because of a bad cut?

124
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,470
They changed the entire script the night before.

125
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,050
He could at least say "thank you" to all the office employees who came out at the last minute.

126
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:01,590
If they wanted acting skills, they should have hired extras. Am I wrong?

127
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:06,590
- But who... 
 - What? Who's who?

128
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,350
Me?

129
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,140
 Can I help you? 

130
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,600
 I'm so excited to be here! 

131
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,430
 My fate changed again! 

132
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,690
What are you doing?

133
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,330
 I protected myself. 

134
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,770
 Sol! 

135
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,180
But what about Sun Jae?

136
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,470
   

137
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,610
   

138
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,350
   

139
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,810
   

140
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,660
Thank you, Sun Jae.

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,310
 The Han River Bridge. Remember. 

146
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,240
 Okay? 

147
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,130

Sun Jae.

161
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,060
When did you get here?

162
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,200
You didn't call.

163
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,400
Hey, do you think this is a spa?

164
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,750
Why do you keep taking baths here?

165
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,510
You have the best tub. With a view!

166
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,720
I'll pay the rent.

167
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,840
Can I move in?

168
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,550
You have one minute. Get out.

169
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,600
What?

170
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,090
Who is it?

171
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,310
Hey!

172
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,990
I'm sorry.

173
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,790
Hey, you!

174
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,050
The white puffer girl again?

175
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,970
I'd like to file a report.

176
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,180
Oh, hey—

177
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,960
You dropped...

178
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,310
   

179
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,280
Is she a fan of Sun Jae?

180
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,800
Take and run?

181
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,420
- Excuse me, you dropped this! 
 - I got you!

182
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,950
What?

183
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,820
Over here!

184
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,220
Someone reported trespassing.

185
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,660
I saw it happen.

186
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,340
What?

187
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,200
   

188
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,010
 Thank you for being alive. 

189
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,060
Your name?

190
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,600
Excuse me.

191
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,240
Sun Jae is pretty. Right?

192
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,420
You are critically ill.

193
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,570
Excuse me, your name?

194
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,230
Name!

195
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,820
- Sorry? 
 - Your name.

196
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,910
- Im Sol. 
 - ID, please.

197
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,010
What do you do?

198
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,640
I work at a company.

199
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,020
I woke up and found myself an employee at a film production company.

200
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,530
I used to dream of becoming a film director.

201
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,050
It's amazing.

202
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,630
One choice you make leads you to a different life.

203
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,460
A life without dreams, to a life where I'm chasing my dreams.

204
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,160
If you only have the willpower, there's no fate you cannot change. Right?

205
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,350
I don't think you can change the fate of going to jail.

206
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,060
Trespassing, you see...

207
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,260
If the victim presses charges, you will be punished for sure.

208
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,350
You need to be careful with your initial statement. Okay?

209
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,080
Trespassing?

210
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,810
Do luxury buildings arrest you for just standing by their entrance?

211
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,620
The entrance?

212
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,470
You tried to break into the front door of Ryu Sun Jae's apartment.

213
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,300
How did you figure out the keypad password?

214
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,620
What?! Who dared to break into Sun Jae's apartment?!

215
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,210
Was it a stalker? What a nutjob!

216
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,600
What kind of piece of shit—

217
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,450
- So, that's you. 
 - That is not me.

218
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,390
The crazy piece of shit, that's you.

219
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,990
If you ran a background check, she's good to go.

220
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,960
The victim doesn't want to press charges.

221
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,600
He doesn't want the noisy attention an article would bring.

222
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,190
You are so lucky.

223
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,190
Why is he not pressing charges?

224
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,240
Those people should all be arrested and locked up!

225
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,680
I can't believe he's still that tender-hearted and kind.

226
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,760
Could you please tell him to press charges?

227
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,540
Hyung, I told them you don't want to press charges.

228
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,210
I made sure to request that there wouldn't be any articles written.

229
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,790
It's a phone call!

230
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,150
Why can't you make a phone call?

231
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,450
Just one minute.

232
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,360
No! No!

233
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,240
- Why not? 
 - That must be her. The white puffer.

234
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,480
She looks normal for a stalker.

235
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,070
I feel like I've seen her before.

236
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,150
 Why aren't you pressing charges? 

237
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,260
You need to scare her so she won't do that again.

238
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:28,550
- What's this? 
 - If you're done, why are you still here?

239
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,010
Do you think I'm really here to use your tub?

240
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,960
I heard you suddenly said you wouldn't do the movie.

241
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,610
The CEO is about to shit in his pants.

242
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,520
He begged me to convince you.

243
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,130
You read it and tell me if I should be convinced.

244
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,510
What a diva.

245
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,580
"Hero!"

246
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,690
It's a great title!

247
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,110
Is it like a Korean superhero movie?

248
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,420
Superhero movie? As if.

249
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,810
What? What is it about?

250
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:03,160
A mermaid crosses the Imjin River and meets a North Korean general.

251
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,020
They fall in love?

252
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,470
But then there's a zombie virus epidemic.

253
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,960
The North Korean general and the mermaid start killing the zombies.

254
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,480
Oh, it's an action blockbuster?

255
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,920
No. It's Sci-Fi.

256
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,620
The North Korean general turns out to be an alien.

257
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,370
Wow, the story really takes a turn there.

258
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,570
 Sun Jae! Sun Jae! That trespasser! 

259
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,160
The stalker!

260
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,920
- What now? 
 - She's...

261
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,460
I'm so tired.

262
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,560
I think she's a vicious one.

263
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Why? Did she make a scene in front of the cops?

264
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,160
Scooch over.

265
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,390
Listen to this.

266
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,710
I think that woman works for this film production company.

267
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,850
- What? 
 - When we went to their offices last time,

268
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,870
she was the one who handed me this script.

269
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,490
I remember it as clear as day.

270
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,040
But why is someone from that company trying to break in here?

271
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,990
Maybe she's pissed that you said no to this movie and tried to commit a terror act.

272
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,950
Or maybe she's a real stalker.

273
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,150
They want to be close to their favorites,

274
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,550
so they purposefully get jobs in the entertainment industry.

275
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,400
I think you need to be very careful.

276
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,660
♫  I'm looking for the forgotten me  ♫

277
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,360
♫  Looking for me reflected in the memories  ♫

278
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,540
Everything is different.

279
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,010
♫  A day when it's clearer  ♫

280
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,410
Right. The watch.

281
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,510
♫  I won't try to go back in time  ♫

282
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:54,800
♫  Those reckless days  ♫

283
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,810
I guess I couldn't have that.

284
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,650
Because I wasn't a fan.

285
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:07,250
I don't have a reason to go back now.

286
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,310
I don't need it.

287
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:16,280
♫  My sighs are collecting, and I couldn't see the happy days  ♫

288
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,210
 This is all for the best. 

289
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,650
 This is good. 

290
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:25,340
♫  I won't let it be forgotten  ♫

291
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,540
 Sol! 

292
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,650
What was that dream about?

293
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,580
- Grandma. 
 - Hello!

294
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,880
 No matter how much I turn back time, 

295
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,920
 I can't change the passage of time. 

296
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,770
Grandma, why are you laughing?

297
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,550
You are ugly.

298
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,230
You look like a baby octopus.

299
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,980
What?

300
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,060
What? I'm pretty!

301
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,220
Have you ever seen a baby octopus this pretty?

302
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,520
Baby octopus!

303
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,400
Baby octopus!

304
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,210
So pretty.

305
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,480
Your legs are fine now!

306
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,560
- What did you say? 
 - You're walking!

307
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,590
Grandma, do you remember that?

308
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,790
I used to be in a wheelchair. I couldn't walk.

309
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,830
Do you remember that?

310
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:06,450
Don't leave.

311
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:11,360
Stay and play with me, unni.

312
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,350
She can't do that. She'll get fired.

313
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,850
Mal Ja, it's snack time.

314
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,920
Snack time!

315
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,750
Here's your snack.

316
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,590
What are you doing? Go to work.

317
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,660
What? Oh, right. I should go.

318
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,090
Mom,

319
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:42,930
remember the guy who kidnapped me?

320
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,820
Do you remember what happened to him?

321
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,310
Why all of a sudden?

322
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,240
Just because. I can't really remember anymore.

323
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,960
What do you mean what happened?

324
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,660
He was caught and was locked up.

325
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,380
 He did get caught. 

326
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,630
 Thank goodness. 

327
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,490
Why are you thinking about what happened 14 years ago?

328
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,780
Go to work.

329
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,450
14 years? Not 15?

330
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,880
Hurry and go!

331
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,340
Oh, okay. Bye.

332
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,450
All right.

333
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,970
Wait! Your car keys.

334
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,570
Here you go.

335
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,860
My car?

336
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,620
Yes!

337
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,600
See you later.

338
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,850
Okay.

339
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,960
Drive safe!

340
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,820
Bye!

341
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,360
She never talks about that.

342
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,970
Why now?

343
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,080
   

344
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:43,080
My, my. This is amazing.

345
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:48,100
You are my dream car.

346
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,360
But I have to drive.

347
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,530
I can probably drive?

348
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:56,760
♫  Taking strides with you  ♫

349
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,390
 I passed my road test on the first try. 

350
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,560
 I've been driving for 10 years with no accidents. 

351
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,720
 I can do this! 

352
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,070
Oh, wow!

353
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,220
Why am I so good at driving?

354
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,920
This is awesome!

355
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,690
- Good morning! 
 - Good morning!

356
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,370
- Good morning! 
 - Good morning!

357
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,690
Good morning!

358
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,180
Good morning!

359
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,630
Good morning! Oh, my goodness.

360
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,560
Good morning, Senior.

361
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,880
I've already seen too much this morning.

362
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,380
The CEO is looking for you.

363
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,950
He's up to here.

364
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,890
 It wasn't me! 

365
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:34,990
What do you mean?

366
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,480
You got taken to the police station.

367
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,490
He doesn't want to do the movie because of you.

368
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,960
I did go to the building, but...

369
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,760
They mistook me for the real stalker.

370
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,770
- Really? 
 - Yes.

371
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,780
I couldn't even get inside.

372
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,370
So why did you go there and have that kind of mistaken circumstance?!

373
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,030
I'll set up a meeting, then.

374
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,990
You can explain yourself and clear the air.

375
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,110
Ryu Sun Jae has to be cast.

376
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:11,580
What? You want me to meet Ryu Sun Jae?

377
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,770
   

378
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,270
Sun Jae.

379
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,500
Who are you?

380
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,430
Do you not remember me?

381
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,090
Have we met before?

382
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,090
He's not here yet. Right?

383
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,880
Why are you crying?

384
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,220
Something got in my eye.

385
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,610
Let me go freshen up real quick.

386
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,790
Will you cry like a crazy woman in front of Sun Jae?

387
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,880
   

388
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,750
Hello?

389
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,180
Hyun Joo, what's wrong?

390
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,620
I couldn't get in touch with anyone.

391
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,820
Come quick!

392
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,380
What happened?

393
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,510
I'm in a cab on the way to the hospital.

394
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,040
It's going to come out.

395
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,410
Come out? What is?

396
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,960
My baby! What else?

397
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,710
My water broke!

398
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,160
What?

399
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,060
Oh, my goodness.

400
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,330
I'll be right there. Where are you?

401
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,300
Yes. We stepped out in the middle of rehearsal for a second.

402
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,270
Just hold on.

403
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,980
I can't hold a baby that's coming out.

404
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,370
Where is the hospital?

405
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,210
Hyung! Hyung!

406
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,730
I'm on my way.

407
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,500
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!

408
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,200
How can you shove someone in the water and walk away?

409
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,840
What?

410
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,840
Oh, my god! I'm so sorry. I was in a rush...

411
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,060
Wait. White puffer.

412
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,610
Huh?

413
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,570
Hyun Joo...

414
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,970
I'm so sorry. I have an emergency.

415
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,950
Call me, and I will pay for the damages.

416
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,960
- I'm sorry. So sorry. 
 - Excuse me!

417
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,340
Hyun Joo! Take a deep breath, deep breath.

418
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,050
Keep breathing.

419
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,520
Hyung! Are you okay?

420
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,120
Whatever.

421
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,800
Hyung, it's her. The production company employee.

422
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,610
What?

423
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,720
Damn, she can't get enough, huh?

424
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,080
She did this on purpose, huh?

425
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,300
Of course. She'd recognize you on a passing high-speed train.

426
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,190
It's all clear now.

427
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,390
You turned down her movie, so she's resentful and acting out this way.

428
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,740
Geez.

429
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,650
Do you want to call her and cuss her out?

430
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,620
No. She said she'd pay for the damages, so get the money.

431
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,520
Including money for my underwear, got it?

432
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,460
- Your underwear? 
 - I'm cold!

433
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,950
So childish.

434
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,970
 Is that Sun Jae? 

435
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,910
 Sun Jae! 

436
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,120
 Sun Jae-sama! 

437
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,480
 You're so handsome and amazing! 

438
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,800
 Sun Jae-sama! 

439
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:26,860
My bastard of a husband is making me go through this hell! Fuck!

440
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,340
I'm going to kill him!

441
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,270
Who is that bastard? I'll kill him for you!

442
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:34,210
Get Im Geum here. Hurry up!

443
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,610
What? Im Geum?

444
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:41,550
Honey! Hyun Joo! Hyun Joo!

445
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,980
Why are you so late, you dumbass?

446
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,500
I'm sorry! I was in a meeting, so my phone was off!

447
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,600
I'm here now. It's going to be okay.

448
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,530
It's not okay!

449
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,740
You bastard of a brother! When did you seduce my friend?

450
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,480
Why are you doing that to my husband?

451
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,370
What did I change? How can you two be married with a kid?

452
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,770
Mom!

453
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,660
It's Auntie! Auntie!

454
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,700
Goodness, your second is going to come faster than the first!

455
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,060
Her second?

456
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,040
Yes. Her second.

457
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,500
Your second?

458
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,420
I'm sorry, Senior.

459
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,460
 I'm glad the delivery went smoothly. 

460
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,450
Ryu Sun Jae never showed up anyway. Something happened on his way or something.

461
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,330
Something happened? Like an accident?

462
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,120
 Of course not. It's an excuse. 

463
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,180
Should I go see him and apologize?

464
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,730
It's fine. The CEO said she'll take care of it.

465
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,730
 She wants you out of it moving forward. 

466
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,310
Okay.

467
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:58,400
I won't be running into him again.

468
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,740
   

469
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,190
718,000 won?

470
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,770
Why is it so expensive?

471
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,510
Wait.

472
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:23,140
   

473
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,500
7,180,000 won?

474
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,870
7,180,000?

475
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,120
Who is this?

476
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:44,780
 Hello, I tried to call, but you didn't pick up, so I'm texting you. 

477
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:49,920
 First, I sincerely apologize for the mishap due to my careless mistake. 

478
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,100
 But I wanted to confirm the cost of your clothes. 

479
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,690
Wow, he really told her to pay for my underwear? He's so literal.

480
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,280
 It's fine. I just hope I never run into you— 

481
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,810
 Actually, I didn't get a good look because I was in a rush. 

482
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:10,950
 Were you actually wearing these clothes? 

483
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,480
What?

484
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:21,080
Instead of a bill for dry cleaning, what the heck is this?

485
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,620
How is his underwear 400,000 won?

486
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,060
 Do you think I'm scamming you or something? 

487
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,940
 Not at all! It's a lot of money, so I needed confirmation. 

488
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,640
 Forgive me, but could you send a photo of the wet clothes? 

489
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,950
She is so politely infuriating.

490
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,390
 I know you're not that kind of person. 

491
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:45,800
 But there are so many scammers these days. 

492
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,260
 Please and thank you. 

493
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:52,260
How dare she treat me like a scammer?

494
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,220
Hyung, let's go—

495
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,040
What are you doing?

496
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,410
What?

497
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,190
What am I even doing?

498
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,670
There's an article. They didn't even retouch it!

499
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,780
   

500
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,990
When did they take a photo?

501
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:42,940
Forget about the money. Press charges right now. Got it?

502
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,840
Leaving me on read?

503
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,650
Did I scare him off because I asked for photos?

504
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:57,350
That's right. You fumbled the bag while looking for a payday.

505
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:03,150
Hey, he's cute because he looks like me. Right?

506
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,400
You have no shame.

507
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:10,410
Sweet dreams.

508
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:11,750
   

509
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,110
I can't believe you're a dad, Im Geum.

510
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,110
It's been a while.

511
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:21,270
I'm just saying. If I hadn't gotten hurt, you might still be an aspiring actor.

512
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,260
A door closes and a door opens.

513
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,760
There's no happiness without paying a price.

514
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,660
- He must be happy. Right? 
 - What?

515
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:44,690
I can't believe that idiot became a celebrity.

516
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:45,940
   

517
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,270
He donated 1 billion won? He must be rich.

518
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,960
Why didn't you hold onto him back then?

519
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,650
What do you mean, hold onto him?

520
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,320
I should have been nicer to him back then.

521
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,860
Then Ryu Sun Jae could have been our kids' uncle.

522
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:06,600
Hey, baby. Daddy is sorry.

523
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,330
So you really haven't talked to him since then?

524
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,360
Since what?

525
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:19,070
You should go see him. He liked you back then, you know.

526
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:23,890
You never know. When he sees you, all his feelings might come back.

527
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:29,730
 Don't come. If you continue this, I'd feel uncomfortable and pressured. 

528
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,290
 So, just stop liking me. 

529
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,220
 I couldn't possibly go and see him. 

530
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:54,610
♫  This yearning I can't hide  ♫

531
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,670
♫  I fall asleep missing you  ♫

532
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:08,860
♫  Your low and deep voice  ♫

533
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:17,770
♫  I can't forget the traces of you  ♫

534
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:25,090
♫  If I could stop, even just for a moment  ♫

535
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:31,310
♫  I would embrace you right there and then  ♫

536
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:39,250
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

537
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:47,400
♫  I want to go back to our time together  ♫

538
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:55,940
♫  No matter what happens, I will remember you  ♫

539
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,420
 Thank you, Sun Jae, for being alive. 

540
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:05,260
 I'm glad that you're alive. I'm overflowingly happy. 

541
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,950
 But still... 

542
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,590
 It's true, but... 

543
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,220
   

544
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:20,210
♫  You keep getting further away that I can't reach you  ♫

545
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:23,720
 Sol. I like you a lot. 

546
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:30,500
 I miss you. 

547
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:37,830
♫  I sigh and try my best to smile  ♫

548
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,240
 Look at the camera! Smile! Just try it! 

549
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:51,930
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

550
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:59,640
♫  I want to go back to our time together  ♫

551
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,770
 Today's weather is expected to be sunny and clear. 

552
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:07,670
 The high will be around 1 degree Celcius. 

553
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:13,300
 In the east, the land is expected to get drier. 

554
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,310
 There may be strong winds... 

555
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,760
 Please make sure small flames do not turn into fire.. 

556
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,990
 Be safe when using indoor heaters. 

557
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:23,220
 - Take precaution against indoor fires.  
 - What is this?

558
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,240
   

559
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:33,440
Hello?

560
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:38,390
Yes, this is her.

561
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,090
What? Where?

562
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:47,250
I promise not to approach the victim, Ryu Sun Jae's household,

563
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:51,000
or 100 meters within his presence.

564
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,030
In the case that this agreement is violated...

565
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,940
I'm not the stalker, I swear.

566
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,700
So why didn't you just keep still?

567
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:05,370
You call him up to apologize, then you shove him into a fountain?

568
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,850
What?

569
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,380
That was Sun Jae?

570
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,300
Why is this happening to me? Where were my eyes?

571
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,720
He was going to press charges for real but he's giving you one last chance. Okay?

572
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,020
Sign it, and you're done.

573
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,670
Okay.

574
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,970
   

575
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:39,240
When you say 100 meters, is it the straight line distance or the walking distance?

576
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,190
Hey! Miss! Stop talking and just sign it.

577
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,880
Also, he was busy that day rehearsing for a concert.

578
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,500
He made time to go there, and then this happened.

579
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,900
If you had malicious intentions, you could get additional—

580
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,970
Hold on. Rehearsals for a concert?

581
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:58,090
But they already had a concert in December.

582
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:04,980
   

583
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,890
   

584
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,340
It was delayed?

585
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,680
   

586
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:27,330
Excuse me! Excuse me!

587
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:30,280
I work for a company that produces Ryu Sun Jae's movie.

588
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,450
I have some extremely urgent business to tend to.

589
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,670
Could I go in for a second?

590
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:37,420
Do you have a ticket?

591
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:39,150
No. I don't.

592
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:42,130
You can't go in without a ticket.

593
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,470
What? Where?

594
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:53,800
I'm a friend of Sun Jae's.

595
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,570
 I want to see him and apologize and need to check something. 

596
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:59,810
Could I just have a minute?

597
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,480
Excuse me. Didn't you agree to a restraining order?

598
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,560
I did. But...

599
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:11,260
But still, a sincere apology should be made face-to-face.

600
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,050
You can see him on television.

601
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:17,610
Please don't get within 100 meters of him, like the agreement. I'm sincerely asking you.

602
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:21,240
Then! Can I talk to him from 100 meters away?

603
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,840
 Please? 

604
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,570
H-Hello? Hello? No.

605
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,170
H-H-Hello?

606
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:32,850
What do I do?

607
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,640
Hyung, the crazy one from the production company,

608
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,910
says she's your friend. She's begging to see you.

609
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:44,380
Should I just let her in? Want to see her face to face

610
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,030
- and tell her off? 
 - Are you insane?

611
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,590
Go tell her very clearly.

612
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:51,970
He'll press charges tomorrow. Understand?

613
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:53,840
Hold on!

614
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,110
Then please give Sun Jae my name, at least.

615
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:58,660
Here.

616
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:02,740
Im Sol. That's my name. He'll remember when he hears it. It'll clear up everything.

617
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,310
So, just trust me this one time and give this to him. Please?

618
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:12,250
Yes, yes, I trust you. So go inside and wait a short while for the court papers. Okay?

619
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:16,070
Hey! I'm asking you like this!

620
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,090
Hyung.

621
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:27,050
Sun Jae?

622
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,250
Damn, they must be on standby already.

623
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,490
It's starting already.

624
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:10,080
♫  Tonight, you shine so bright  ♫

625
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:14,600
♫  Sometimes when we feel like hiding  ♫

626
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:18,630
♫  Like those night skies that embrace us  ♫

627
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:28,500
♫  I wished the rain would never end  ♫

628
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:34,420
♫  The day you first came to me  ♫

629
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:42,960
♫  I hoped it wouldn't just be a quick drizzle  ♫

630
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,000
♫  That's what I sincerely wished for  ♫

631
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,630
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

632
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:56,970
♫  I've only been thinking of you every day  ♫

633
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:02,150
♫  You seep into my thoughts once again today  ♫

634
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:10,230
♫  You are a gift from the heavens  ♫

635
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:16,830
♫  In this lonely world I'll protect you  ♫

636
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,130
The forecast didn't mention snow.

637
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,600
 It's the first snow of the year. 

638
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,110
 Sun Jae must love this. 

639
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,520
 It's exactly like that day. 

640
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,370
No, it can't be.

641
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:02,430
It can't be.

642
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,630
- Good job. 
 - Great work.

643
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:41,390
   

644
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,680
   

645
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:54,610
Don't come, Sun Jae.

646
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:04,160
 Im Sol, you are the last person Ryu Sun Jae saw before he died. 

647
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:07,530
 Please don't come here. 

648
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,900
He should have passed by here already.

649
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,190
Maybe he just left.

650
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:30,370
That's good, then...

651
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:38,380
   

652
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,840
Hello?

653
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,510
Hello?

654
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:48,220
 It's me. 

655
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,780
♫  All these times that have been hiding...  ♫

656
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,470
 You can't be here like this.

♫  Are calling us back again  ♫

658
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,770
♫  Wherever I am... ♫

659
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:35,250
♫  At the end, it's always you  ♫

660
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:41,870
♫  Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

661
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:49,530
♫  You're my spring that I've been waiting for  ♫

662
00:59:49,530 --> 00:59:50,570
Long time no see.

663
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:54,430
♫  Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

664
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:57,510
Yeah. Long time no see.

665
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,240
Right.

666
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,470
♫  All my life, it's you  ♫

667
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,840
Why are you standing here like this?

668
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,490
Is your car broken?

669
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:12,100
No.

670
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:16,630
I was waiting for you.

671
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,540
How did you know I would come here?

672
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,290
I just thought you might.

673
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:26,000
 But I wish you hadn't. 

674
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,360
What if I hadn't seen you?

675
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,730
♫  All my life, it's you  ♫

676
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,610
You haven't changed.

677
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,010
Want to get a cup of tea somewhere?

678
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,090
Or is it too late?

679
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:45,410
No. I'm okay.

680
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:48,330
Hyung!

681
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:50,830
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

682
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:54,690
Everyone is asking why you're not at the after party.

683
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:58,080
- We have to hurry over! 
  - I can't let him go like this. 

684
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,410
- One second. 
 - No! Don't go.

685
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,320
You can't go.

686
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,840
What?

687
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,830
I just mean...

688
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,580
Hyung!

689
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,770
Let's be together tonight!

690
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:18,780
You and me. Let's be together tonight.

 That girl told Sun Jae, "Let's stay together tonight..." 

694
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,090
 Where are we going? 

695
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:00,800
 - Somewhere we can be alone and quiet? 
 - I'm not coming home tonight. 

696
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,450
 I'm sleeping somewhere else. Don't worry. 

697
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:04,940
 Who is that? 

698
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,140
 Fine. Let's say you changed fate. 

699
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,610
 But how do you know this life is better? 

700
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:14,320
 If I ever met you again, I wanted to tell you. 

701
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,270
 I liked you, too. 

702
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:21,050
 So, you're saying you felt the same way I did. 

703
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:24,210
 So, what about now?
