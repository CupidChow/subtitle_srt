00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,170
Have you ever been in a car accident?

7
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,570
Yes. Fifteen years ago.

8
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:05,380
But how it happened, or how badly it hurt...

9
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,800
I don't remember it at all.

10
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,930
Maybe it's for the best.

11
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,420
I'm sorry about earlier.

12
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,000
I misunderstood you about my swim trunks.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,700
You had good reason to misunderstand.

14
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,900
You said you did it because you were worried about me.

15
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,010
I was.

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,160
I'm still going to go through with the competition.

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:49,330
I'll enter it... and win a medal.

18
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,140
But don't worry about me.

19
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,560
I'll make the opposite of your dream happen.

20
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,350
Believe in me, just once.

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,400
 We will begin the final 200m match of the male high school division.

31
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,560
 It was my first competition match after my shoulder surgery.  

32
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,000
 That match ended up being my last. 

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,080
 Back then, I regretted pushing myself so hard, but 

34
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,270
 I wonder if maybe it was because I was meant to be a singer. 

35
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,180
 Is there such a thing as destiny? 

36
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,500
 A fate we can't change or go against? 

37
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,500
 His life was full of struggles, having to deal with many rumors and online abuse. 

38
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,430
 Even so, Sun Jae. I want to believe in you.

 This is my house. 

58
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,030
 We're neighbors. I don't know how we've never run into each other as we've come and gone. 

59
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,990
 Isn't that weird? 

60
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,450
 Good night. 

61
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,700
 Okay. Sleep tight, and see you at the arena tomorrow. 

62
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,250
 Okay. 

63
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,610
   

64
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,220
 Hey, she used to chase Kim Tae Sung around. Are you cool with that? 

65
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,730
 Now she's chasing me around. 

66
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,740
 She's a fan of mine, apparently. 

67
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,390
 But liking you as a guy isn't the same as being a fan. 

68
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,530
 It's not like we're dating. 

69
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,840
 Wow. You sound like a real man. 

70
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,600
 Hey. Have you ever told someone you liked them? 

71
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,470
 - Can you do it? 
 - My goodness. 

72
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,090
 My dad said I took my first steps like I was a groom making an entrance (at a wedding). 

73
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,750
 Because I walked so well. 

74
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,700
 - So what? 
 - I can do it well even if I have never done it before. 

75
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,100
 If I get a gold medal tomorrow, I'll tell her that I like her. 

76
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,130
 Hey, do you think it's easy to confess (your love)? 

77
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,450
 You need to assess the situation carefully. 

78
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,920
 Timing is crucial when it comes to confessing your feelings. 

79
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,700
 Ti... mi... ng! Timing. 

80

81
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,550
Yeah!

82

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,600
Yeah.

88
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,380
How's your shoulder? Do you feel okay?

89
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,240
Yeah.

90
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,280

91
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,290

00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,570
Yeah.

What?

94
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,740
Didn't I mention it?

95
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,790
Let's go eat.

96
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,070
 He was cranky because he was hungry. 

97
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,630
Right, we should eat.

98
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm hungry, too. What should we eat?

99
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,390
Let's just go somewhere that looks good.

100
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,520
 Where is it? 

101
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,060

I looked up a nice place for nothing.

You just finished a match. You should eat something nutritious.

Here it is!

Blow on it to cool it down.

There is truly no stan more successful than me.

113

What?

114
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,130
I'm sharing a meal with you.

115
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,090
I'm a successful stan.

116
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,200
A stan? What is that?

117
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,740
Oh. It's similar to "fan."

118
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,370
I told you I'm your fan.

119
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,820
A swim fan. For swim.

120
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,360
 But liking you as a guy isn't the same as being a fan. 

121
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,150
You know Kim Tae Sung? The band bass player?

Yeah. Why?

123
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,310
Are you a fan of his?

124
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,500
Or do you like him?

125
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,460
That was ages ago. Not at all.

What?

160
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,200
Isn't that for taking passport photos?

161
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,820
Take one with me.

00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,400
 I've been so jealous of fans who got a selfie with you at fan signings. 

164
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,200
- You want a picture with me? 
 - Yes!

165
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,030
I don't like getting my picture taken.

166
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,950
Oh, okay.

167
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,980
- Then never mind. 
 - The sun!

168
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,680
Wow. It's scorching.

169
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,850
Let's go inside for a moment.

170
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,210
The path is that way... Sun Jae!

171
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,120
   

172
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,410
   

173
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,590
 - Ready to shoot.  
 - Got it!

174
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,640
It's going to take it now.

175
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,220
- Look at the camera now! 
  - One... 

176
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,400
- What? Where? There? 
  - two, three. 

177
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,190
No! Over here!

178
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,060
- Oh. Here? 
 - Yes.

179
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,890
 One, two... 

180
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,210
- Smile! 
  - three. 

181
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,700
What's wrong? You're a master of pictorials.

182
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,560
Then, at least do this.

183
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,870
What is that? A lump?

184
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,380
Lump? What do you mean? It's a heart!

185
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,000
You want me to act cute?

186
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,180
I don't want to.

187
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,000
 - Ready to shoot.  
 - It's taking it right now!

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,950
- Just try it! 
  - One... 

189
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,800
 two, three... 

190
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,720
Is that good?

191
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,820
 Is this the right timing? 

192
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,570
Hey.

193
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,800
 This is the right timing. 

194
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,020
I have something to tell you.

195
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,570
Yeah?

196
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,360
I...

197
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,130
- like you— 
  - Your photos are ready! 

198
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,720
It's done! One second.

199
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,390
So cute!

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,900
They're such good photos.

201
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,600
Where should I put them?

202
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,310
 Did your confession go well? 

203
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,730
 Yeah, right. 

204
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,010
 Yes. This timing is not too bad. 

205
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,030
- Hey. 
 - Don't say anything.

206
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,620
What?

207
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,720
I'm going to lose my mind.

208
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,350
There must have been an accident.

209
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,210
This isn't usually a traffic-heavy area.

210
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,350
What?

211
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,150
What's wrong?

212
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,390
No, it's nothing.

213
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,040
 How am I going to divulge about my nature calls with my bias? 

214
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,800
Mommy, I need to pee.

215
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,970
Oh, no. Can you hold it until we get to a rest stop?

216
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,510
I can't hold it.

217
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,320
Should I ask them to stop the bus?

218
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,430
 Yes, yes. Please stop the bus for me. Please? 

219
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,840
You really can't hold it?

220
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,400
 Say it's urgent. Hurry! Hurry! 

221
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,500
Mommy, it's urgent.

222
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,140
I think I'm going to wet my pants.

223
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,400
Okay, hold on, hold on.

224
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,890
 Please, please? 

225
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,810
Here.

226
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,080
Pee here. I'll cover you.

227
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,610
Driver!

228
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,280
Could you stop the bus?

229
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,350
Here? Why now?

230
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,020
I... The situation is a bit urgent right now.

231
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,960
What? You should have gone at the rest stop earlier.

232
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,390
Please, Driver.

233
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,760
   

234
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,080
- Thank you! 
 - Here.

235
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,920
Thank you.

236
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,700
Go over there. I'll get some fresh air over there.

237
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,320
It's dangerous over there.

238
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,280
Go over there.

239
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,710
What?

240
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,810
Hurry up.

241
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,550
I'll keep a look out for you here.

242
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,590
Keep a look out?

243
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,570
I'm ruined!

244
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,050
This... probably isn't the right timing.

245
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,330
No.

246
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,670
   

247
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,540
 I told you, it gets stolen. 

248
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,970
   

249
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,650
Let's unclog it first and do the construction later.

250
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,790
Is there a little rat (thief) in our neighborhood?

251
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,960
What was that?

252
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,830
   

253
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,760
It is him!

254
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,150
How funny, huh?

255
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,590
We're here.

256
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,290
Really good job today, Sun Jae.

257
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:03,000
Congratulations on the gold medal.

258
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,910
♫  All these times that have been hiding...  ♫

259
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,110
In the summer?

260
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,320
Im Sol.

261
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,390
♫  Because you're at some place  ♫

262
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,240
Thanks for coming today.

263
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,220
I could even follow you to the ends of the earth.

264
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:47,610
Or... even if you were in another time altogether,

265
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,890
I'd jump over everything to come and see you.

266
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,960
♫  When I look at you, the one I've waited for  ♫

267
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,460
♫  Because I'm falling slowly in love with you   ♫

268
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,600
 I told you I'm your fan.  
 ♫  Because I'm falling slowly in love with you   ♫

269
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,800
So, how long will you be my fan?

270
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,060
What?

271
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:09,010
I... don't want you to be my fan anymore.

272
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,220
Why not?

273
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,130
 What do I do? 

274
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,410
I...

275
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,450
 But I have to stay by your side. 

276
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,940
- like you. 
 - Do you want to be friends, then?

277
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,290
Let's be friends.

278
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,980
What? You can do it well even if you've never done it before?

279
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,940
I didn't get a reply, so I assumed you weren't able to do it.

280
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,400
So, this hyung... laid out the grounds so you could get in the mood!

281
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,930
What? "I don't want you to be my fan anymore"?

282
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,670
Goodness, what a line.

283
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,720
So cringe. It's totally pathetic.

284
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,290
- Hey. 
 - Hey! Who told you to spy on us?

285
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,770
Stop it. She didn't reject you yet.

286
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,430
She didn't?

287
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,730
Gosh, come on...

288
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,090
You can't be rejected if you haven't tried.

289
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,530
You didn't even tell her how you feel.

290
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,710
That's true.

291
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,520
 Even if you were in another time altogether, 

292
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,880
 I'd jump over everything to come and see you. 

293
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,080
   

294
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,980
- Amazing! 
 - He'll set a new record.

295
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,140
Sun Jae! Sun Jae!

296
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,930
   

297
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,160
Why don't I see Sun Jae?

298
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,590
Grandma, how's the view?

299
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,540
What?

300
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,830
I didn't know this was your hobby, Grandma.

301
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,960
I thought you were here to see me.

302
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,780
I thought the boys' school had classes at this hour.

303
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,180
Don't play hooky and go inside.

304
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,670
I'm telling you that as someone with more life experience.

305
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,180
Some people can't go to school even if they want to.

306
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,550
Do your best while you have the chance.

307
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,720
Later, when your life is tough,

308
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,830
don't regret it being like, "I should have tried harder back then."

309
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,980
When you told me you liked me, you couldn't even look me in the eye.

310
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,900
This method isn't going to work with me.

311
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,270
You're not my type.

312
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:32,990
Sure, sure, thank you so much. Thank goodness I'm not your type.

313
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,690
Speaking of, let me tell you something.

314
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,500
I cancel my confession (of love) to you.

315
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,500
I must have lost my mind for a minute.

316
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,380
Sure, sure. I reject the cancellation.

317
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,500
You can't reject it when you're not even going to accept it.

318
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,020
I don't like having things taken away.

319
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,470
My goodness.

320
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,600
 Kim Tae Sung, why aren't you answering your phone? 

321
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,590
Grandma, how do I get rid of someone annoying?

322
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,450
Give me some advice.

323
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,960
Like this.

324
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,730
- What is that? 
 - Refusing to deal with them, man!

325
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:22,080
Gosh, I have no idea what I saw in him.

326
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,610
Huh?

327
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,200
Oh?

328
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,100
Are you here to see Sun Jae again?

329
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,800
Yes. Where is Sun Jae? I didn't see him at practice.

330
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,920
Oh, that...

331
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,370
Sun Jae was taken to the hospital this morning.

332
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,690
What?

333
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,910
The rotator cuff where you had surgery before ruptured again.

334
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,190
It's not looking good right now.

335
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,590
You need to have another surgery as soon as possible.

336
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,990
Another surgery?

337
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,600
Yes. You will have some residual after effects from the surgery

338
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,400
but it's your left arm so you should be able to do everyday activities without too much difficulty.

339
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,100
Everyday activities?

340
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,150
Then, what about his swimming career?

341
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,140
 You know this since I told you this before. 

342
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,600
 If we re-operate, you'll have to rehabilitate for at least two to three years. 

343
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,380
 And even if you do, the rotator cuff will only regain 80% of its function. 

344
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:20,550
If so, it will probably be impossible to regain its original level of function.

345
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,670
I heard he went to the hospital in the morning. Isn't he back yet?

346
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,030
   

347
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,560
   

348
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,150
Here is our star!

349
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,180
Here he is!

350
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,920
What a blessed occasion!

351
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,250
This is for you— no, you hand it to him.

352
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,560
Your aunt.

353
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,870
Sun Jae, congratulations.

354
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,750
- Thank you. 
 - My son has been taking a break from competing to recover.

355
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,070
But as soon as he got back into the game, he won the gold!

356
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,400
He set a new record! 
    

357
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,200
He flipped the whole arena upside down!

358
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,240
- Applause! Applause! 
 - Applause!

359
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,700
This year's Olympics are in Beijing. Where's the next one?

360
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,400
- London! 
 - Right!

361
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,290
Four years later, we're going to London.

362
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,090
We're planning on sweeping the gold medals.

363
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,820
Get your autographs and pictures while you can.

364
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,850
Me too! Over here!

365
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,480
Get in line!

366
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,390
Auntie, you first.

367
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,920
Next, ladies first.

368
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,790
 Ryu Sun Jae! Ryu Sun Jae! 

369
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,310
 Ryu Sun Jae! 

370
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,350
For Sun Jae!

371
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,420
Gold medals are all for Sun Jae!

372
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,240
Sit down for a second.

373
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,260
We can talk when all the people are gone.

374
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,310
I can't keep this to myself.

375
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,160
I have good news for you.

376
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,940
Don't be too surprised.

377
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,770
You're going to Australia over break.

378
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,620
- What? 
 - You know Coach Michael from Australia?

379
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,770
The national team gets lessons from him.

380
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,060
I signed you up for lessons with him.

381
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:14,310
You should start acting like a famous athlete. Train abroad.

382
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,110
Get private lessons.

383
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,800
Cancel it.

384
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,600
Why?

385
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,800
Is it because of money?

386
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,110
Gosh, don't worry.

387
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:32,390
You are my only child. Where else would your father spend all this money he saved?

388
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:36,000
- It's all for you. 
 - Don't do it.

389
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,480
- Just cancel it.  
 - What are you talking about? I already paid for the lessons.

390
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,070
I even booked business-class plane tickets.

391
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,750
Why did you decide all this without even asking me?

392
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,460
Well, that's because...

393
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,210
I thought you would be happy.

394
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:01,710
I'm... going to quit swimming.

395
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,070
W-What?

396
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm going to quit swimming.

397
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,300
So...

398
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,570
cancel everything.

399
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,780
But...

400
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,900
Sun Jae! Sun Jae!

401
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,500
   

402
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,600
I came here once on a fan pilgrimage.

403
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,000
I guess it always looked exactly the same.

404
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,920
Sun Jae! Sun Jae!

405
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,520
What do you mean you're going to quit swimming?

406
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,390
How can you joke around with such a serious face?

407
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,350
I'm not joking.

408
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,700
I'm not going to swim anymore.

409
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,700
Wait! Did something happen?

410
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,800
Are you in your right mind right now?

411
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,410
- Yes. 
 - If you are, how can you say such a thing?

412
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,820
Fine. I know it's been hard recovering and competing.

413
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,500
You're protesting because you want a break. Right?

414
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,890
- I'm not. 
 - Then what?

415
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,480
W-Why? Why do you want to quit?

416
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,410
- Are you going through puberty? Why are you rebelling? 
 - I'm sick of it!

417
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,960
What? You're s-sick of it?

418
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,800
Yeah!

419
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm tired of training. I'm so tired of rehabbing every day—

420
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,930
I'm sick and tired of swimming.

421
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,600
Since I set a good record,

422
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,900
I'll quit before I embarrass myself.

423
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,820
Absolutely not.

424
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:37,090
Do you know what a crucial time it is? Those stupid reasons are why you're quitting?

425
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,300
This is my life. Why can't I do what I want?

426
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,000
You've been only swimming for the past ten years.

427
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,150
If you quit, what will you do with your life?

428
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,900
I'll figure it out!

429
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,400
If there's nothing else...

430
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,500
- I'll just work at your restaurant— 
 - You bastard!

431
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,500
How dare you say that.

432
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,810
If you ever say you're quitting swimming one more time,

433
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:03,710
don't even think about coming home. Got it?

434
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,700
Sun Jae...

435
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,820
   

436
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,110
 Raise your arms to the front, just ten centimeters on each side. 

437
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:57,290
 Tighten your core. 

438
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,440
   

439
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,350
 Two! 

440
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,880
 Eight! 

441
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,780
   

442
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:37,480
♫  I was swaying and flowed down to somewhere while I cried  ♫

443
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:43,450
♫  My sighs are collecting, and I couldn't see the happy days  ♫

444
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,600
 His fate did not change. 

445
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,310
 As if to laugh at my desperation and your damnedest effort. 

446
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,380
 With no room for change. 

447
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:02,070
♫  I'll hold onto them, never let them go  ♫

448
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:05,780
♫  Even when the night is gone  ♫

449
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,570
   

450
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,250
   

451
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,790
   

452
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,070
   

453
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,720
I can't stop my accident, and I can't save Sun Jae?

454
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,010
How can that be?

455
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:45,850
If I can't change anything, why did I come back here?

456
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,370
 Have you not heard yet? 

457
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,320
Huh? Aren't you the umbrella girl?

458
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,560
Hi.

459
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,440
- You look better onscreen. 
 - What?

460
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,180
 When you think about it, it's all his fault. 

461
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,700
Your fans incited everything.

462
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,170
Leaving nasty comments, making up rumors, and even sending him poison!

463
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:55,810
If it weren't for your fans, Sun Jae wouldn't have had depression!

464
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,170
Your eyes are scary.

465
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:02,130
Never mind. What would you know right now?

466
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,080
Sun Jae went to your house last night. Right?

467
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,360
How did you know?

468
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,500
How is he? Is he really upset?

469
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,110
I don't know what's going through his head.

470
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,970
He doesn't say anything.

471
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:16,110
If you don't want to regret it later, be good to Sun Jae now.

472
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,500
Take care of his heart.

473
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,400
- You should take care of what's behind you. 
 - Why?

474
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,910
Hey!

475
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,970
There's blood!

476
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,610
I'm sorry! Are you okay?

477
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,800
   
 (It means firefighter) 

478
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,560
 Huh? I know this scene... 

479
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,410
Hey! Are you okay?

480
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,640
 I'm sorry! Are you okay? 

481
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,550
 What? There's a fire at home? 

482
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,870
Hey!

483
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,370
Hey! Are you okay?

484
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:04,550
I'm starving. Smells good...

485
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,200
- Hello? 
 - Did you finish cleaning the building?

486
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,810
Of course! Even the stairs and the windows are sparkling.

487
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,650
Mom! Mom! I even got all the gum off!

488
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,580
Then, go to unit 202 and unclog their toilet.

489
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,130
They keep complaining it gets clogged.

490
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,100
They want us to renovate, but we can't do that.

491
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,940
Why won't you answer your phone?

492
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,470
Mom! I know I've sinned...

493
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,300
 but to unclog someone else's toilet? 

494
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,030
It's my building. If I tell you to unclog it, unclog it!

495
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,000
 And if the rags are fully boiled, 

496
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,480
turn off the gas and dump cold water.

497
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,700
Oh, M-Mom—

498
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,070
How can she make me do this?

499
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,980
So disgusting!

500
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,840
Why isn't anyone answering their phones?

501
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,530
Grandma, going somewhere?

502
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,300
Great to see you. Can you give me a ride?

503
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,090
I want to, but I'm super busy right now.

504
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,690
Sorry.

505
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,610
There's a fire at my house. Please?

506
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,390
Really? If there's a fire, report it.

507
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,930
You don't know 911?

508
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,730
Write it down. 9. 1. 1.

509
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,880
I'm not sure if there is a fire yet.

510
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,530
But I need to stop it this time.

511
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,700
I have to stop it.

512
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,530
Hey, isn't that Im Sol?

513
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,730
Im Sol!

514
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,660
Im Sol!

515
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,640
Im Sol!

516
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:59,610
Where did she go? We were supposed to sign up for study rooms together.

517
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,300
 Where are you? You skipped the study group again. 

518
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,530
It's sparkling white now.

519
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,220
When did you get here?

520
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,150
The smell... did you poop your pants?

521
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,120
I'm a grown adult. You think I pooped my pants?

522
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,780
Here, here, here. Don't you see it?

523
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:25,610
How disgusting! Wash it or something! You're the worst!

524
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,810
Hey. Why do you treat me like a bug every time you see me?

525
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,370
Let me ask why while we're here!

526
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,400
Don't you remember drinking and vomiting on my shoes? I was traumatized.

527
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,010
I washed them clean! Are you still not over that?

528
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,600
Plus, there are five types of people I despise.

529
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,750
One, people who don't have good hygiene. Two, people who are lazy.

530
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,920
Three, people who are immature.

531
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,140
Four, people who are delusional.

532
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,550
Five, the person who is all of the above! Im Geum!

533
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,720
W-Wow! I'm d-delusional?

534
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,180
Do you even know what my dreams are?

535
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,650
I know you stole your tuition to sign up for acting classes.

536
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,470
- How do you know that? 
 - They're right in front of the math academy!

537
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,010
Your acting isn't even that good—

538
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,360
Hey! Were you the spy?

539
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,030
Wait, I smell something burning.

540
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,970
My insides are burning!

541
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:44,320
I've been nice to you because you're my sister's friend...

542
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,590
What? Huh? Hyun Joo!

543
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,550
Fire! Fire!

544
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,770
Hey, Hyun Joo! Hyun Joo!

545
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,660
- Get out of the way! 
 - Hyun Joo!

546
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,410
It's dangerous! Get away!

547
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,790
Hey, Hyun Joo! Hyun Joo!

548
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:35,780
Breathe! Breathe!

549
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,870
Get away.

550
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,540
This is crazy!

551
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,710
Oh, screw it!

552
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,200
What are you doing?

553
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,040
My tooth!

554
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,990
I stopped it!

555
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,870
What is this? My goodness!

556
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,280
Was there a fire?

557
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,620
What happened?

558
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,790
 Mom! 

559
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,060
Are you two okay? Are you okay?

560
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,550
Thank you so much for today.

561
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,830
Thanks to you, my fate changed.

562
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,950
Come on, what fate?

563
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,010
Anyway, I will treat you big time soon.

564
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:05,380
Is this your way of getting a date with me?

565
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,600
Nice try.

566
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,090
No worries if not.

567
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,960
Bye!

568
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,810
- What? 
 - Over there.

569
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,560
You have something next to your nose.

570
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,890
Where?

571
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,370
- Here. 
 - Here?

572
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,130
Right here.

573
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,520
Did I get it?

574
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,340
Yeah. It's clean.

575
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,240
You look pretty.

576
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,890
You player. I bet you tell everyone they're pretty.

577
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:10,590
You skipped school... just to lie around here.

578
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,990
Dad...

579
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,540
Why did you hide such important information from me?

580
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,580
If you need to have surgery again for your injury, who would be mad at you?

581
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,470
Who would scold you? Huh?

582
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,590
Gosh. You little fool.

583
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:54,950
You think you're an adult just because you're a head taller than me, huh?

584
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,020
If you were in pain, you should have told me you were in pain right away.

585
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:02,400
Why do you have to make me a bad father?

586
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,340
I'm sorry.

587
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:16,340
I had no idea, and I called up all those people and made a fuss.

588
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:30,660
They said your shoulder must hurt a lot right now.

589
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,580
Is it true?

590
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:42,860
You should have gotten it treated right away!

591
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,810
Do you want a useless arm for the rest of your life?

592
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:56,650
I made a doctor's appointment on Monday. Schedule the operation.

593
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,950
Fix your shoulder first, so it doesn't hurt.

594
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,620
Then do rehab, or quit. You can decide then.

595
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,740
I'm sorry.

596
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:16,540
Sorry? You must be sick to your stomach.

597
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,620
Let me see.

598
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,650
At least it didn't leave a bruise.

599
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:42,530
You've gotten weaker.

600
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,850
It felt like cotton candy.

601
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,920
That's because when I hit you, I didn't snap!

602
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,530
If I did, you would be out for eight weeks minimum.

603
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:00,570
Let me pour you one, Dad.

604
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:10,620
I returned your video for you.

605
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,440
If you're going to watch that kind of thing, get a DVD and don't hide it.

606
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,840
Secretly renting a video? The late fee was 15,000 won.

607
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,980
Dad, that's not it.

608
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,140
That damn broad, collecting all those late fees...

609
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,450
She could produce an entire film with that money.

610
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,040
- I didn't watch it, Dad! 
 - Shut it, kid.

611
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,920
   

612
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,210
The rotator cuff was successfully re-attached.

613
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,830
But your supraspinatus and subscapularis...

614
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,200
were ruptured beyond 90%.

615
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,530
There was severe SLAP (superior labrum anterior and posterior) damage as well.

616
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:46,220
Doctor, you're saying...

617
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,160
Realistically, your shoulder is completely broken.

618
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,770
 This must be very hard, 

619
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:57,410
but as a doctor, I can't guarantee that you'll be able to compete again.

620
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,400
I'm sorry.

621
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,360
Why are you crying more than me?

622
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,350
♫  I feel this strange feeling  ♫

623
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,730
Crazy!

624
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:17,900
♫  My heart is beating fast, I'm dizzy, I'm just near  ♫

625

628

Thank you!

629
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,920
Thank you!

630
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,710
    
 Someone who says she is your fan brought them.

631
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,420
It's pretty tasty.

632
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:46,830

636

Hello!

637
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:03,400
Who...

638
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,130
Oh, right! You're Sun Jae's fan!

639
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:10,670
Right, the cupcake! Everyone enjoyed them very much.

640
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:12,240
But what brings you here?

641
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,490
Oh, I actually live across from you.

642
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,160
Sun Jae must have been discharged?

643
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,730
I see. We were neighbors!

644
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,180
He was discharged. Should I get him for you?

645
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,220
No, he should rest up.

646
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:31,330
My grandma boiled some chicken.

647
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,260
Eat this together with Sun Jae.

648
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,060
C-Can I really take this?

649
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,300
Of course, you can!

650
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,480
I boiled three chickens.

651
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,790
Why is there just one?

652
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,700
Enjoy.

653
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,300
Sure. Please tell your grandmother we say 'thank you.'

654
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,930
Oh, wait. Wait a second. Wait.

655
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,050
Here. This is some goji berries I brewed.

656
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:02,970
A cold glass of this in the summer...

657
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:06,730
Your whole body goes like...

658
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,170
It's just the best.

659
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:10,800
Okay, thank you so much.

660
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,980
He brewed it really nice and tart.

661
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:44,030
Is it the heat? I feel like I have a fever all over.

662
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:51,960
What?

663
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,580
When did I drink all of this?

664
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:03,060
Oh, I'm hot.

665
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,400
That feels nice.

666
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:40,830
You again?

667
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,550
Me again.

668
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:46,630
Sorry. I wasn't trying to get in your way.

669
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:50,580
Have you been drinking?

670
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,090
No.

671
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,860
You smell like alcohol.

672
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,980
Gosh, what are you talking about?

673
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,040
Your face is red.

674
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,560
I drank the berry tea your dad gave me.

675
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,700
Maybe that's why I feel hot?

676
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:20,600
- The berry tea my dad gave you? 
 - Yes.

677
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:27,760
Hey. That's alcohol!

678
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,690
What? It didn't taste like that at all!

679
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:34,790
Do you know how many bottles of liquor went in there?

680
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,540
- Are you okay? 
 - Come on!

681
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:39,480
This is nothing.

682
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,100
- Oh, hey. 
 - I'm fine.

683
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,120
You're drunk.

684
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,740
Come here.

685
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,200
Sun Jae.

686
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,700
Yeah?

687
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:19,430
Seeing you so down all of a sudden...

688
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:21,430
I feel like there's a wall.

689
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:22,990
What?

690
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,220
A wall of perfection.

691
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,920
What kind of drunken behavior is this?

692
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,430
You are all talk!

693
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,410
- Don't do it. 
 - Unbelievable!

694
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:36,600
I told you to stop.

695
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,190
Why do you dislike my zingers so much?

696
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:42,310
- I really don't... 
 - Amazing!

697
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,790
It's no fun. Stop it.

698
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:54,240
This used to make you laugh immediately.

699
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,430
How come it's not working?

700
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:02,260
Want to listen to music?

701
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,530
Here.

702
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:35,970
 It's a song he used to sing for his fans. 

703
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:49,530
♫  That night, when everyone's gathered  ♫

704
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:57,120
♫  When you're not sitting in your usual seat  ♫

705
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:04,370
♫  When I catch your scent, the one that I liked so much  ♫

706
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:11,500
♫  I turn my head, wondering if it's you  ♫

707
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:19,800
♫  When I find myself in your neighborhood...  ♫

708
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,900
What a relief.

709
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:26,600
This side works fine.

710
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:33,840
♫  That's right, I think I like you  ♫

711
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:41,850
♫  Day by day, all I think of is you  ♫

712
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:48,650
♫  I want to see you, I can do better  ♫

713
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:55,620
♫  I want to be brave and pick up the phone, but I can't  ♫

714
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,470
♫  Like a fool  ♫

715
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:09,220
It's my number one treasure.

716
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,700
Let's go. It's getting late.

717
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,360
You can talk.

718
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:28,600
Wow, you walked right out of an advertisement. You came alive.

719
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,470
Yeah, you are so funny.

720
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:12,900
♫  We didn't seem to feel the same way  ♫

721
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,570
♫  So finally I had to let go  ♫

722
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,260
♫  I recollect that day, our night  ♫

723
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,180
I like you.

724
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,420
♫  When I walk the stairs of memories  ♫

725
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:30,710
I... like you.

726
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:38,820
♫  It seems lucid again  ♫

727
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,560
Keep smiling like this.

728
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,260
♫  Inside scattered sense of time  ♫

729
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:48,370
I'll... be by your side.

730
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:51,200
When you're struggling, I won't let you feel alone.

731
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,620
I won't let you think dark thoughts.

732
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:59,340
I'll stay by your side your whole life.

733
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,960
Please stay alive for a long time...

734
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:09,590
♫  This moment, everything  ♫

735
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:21,320
♫  I might hug you. Be with you  ♫

736
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:33,610
My head...

737
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,940
I remember listening to music together...

738
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:59,010
It's been a while since I drank so much. I can't remember...

739
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:03,900
Wait. Did I get drunk and throw a fit?

740
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,130
Gosh, I don't know...

741
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,300
 It's my number one treasure. 

742
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,700
 Again? 

743
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,160
 - Let's go. It's getting late.  
 - What's this?

744
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,340
When did this record?

745
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,800
 You can talk. 

746
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,670
- I am insane! 
  - Wow, you walked right out of an advertisement. 

747
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,500
 You came alive. 

748
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:56,590
Hey, Kim Tae Sung. My friends told me they saw you with a girl recently.

749
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:58,400
Who is she?

750
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,910
Someone you don't need to know.

751
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,720
It's that Im Sol, isn't it?

752
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,930
I saw you give her a ride on your motorcycle.

753
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:11,950
You've never given me a ride. Why does she get one?

754
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:15,550
Are you dating her or something?

755
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,810
What kind of question is that? Am I not allowed to date her?

756
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:25,110
Of course not. Why would you date someone like that? It makes no sense.

757
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,710
Want me to make it make sense?

758
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:17,280
 Yeah, you are so funny. 

759
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:22,210
I'm so embarrassed. What am I going to do?

760
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,300
Nice to run into you, Grandma.

761
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,080
- What? 
  - I like you. 

762
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,970
Do you want to date?

763
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,280
What?

764
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:46,840
 I... like you.

 Sol, what have you done?

01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,260
 Girlfriend, are you okay? I didn't realize you liked me this much. 

780
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,610
 What a joke. Don't look.

 Here! Stop!

 So you were drunk and can't remember anything?
