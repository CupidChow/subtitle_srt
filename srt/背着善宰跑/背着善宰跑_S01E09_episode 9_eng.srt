1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,000
   

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,450
   

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,170
   

4
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,070
   

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,570
 Breaking news. A shocking incident occurred where singer and actor Ryu Sun Jae 
   

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,390
 was attacked by an unidentified man in a hotel in Seoul. 

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,160
 The police are now looking for the suspect, who fled the scene. 

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,770
 Let's hear from Reporter Kim Eun Joo. 

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,260
 The scene of the crime is a 5-star hotel, 

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,580
 where it is not easy to get through security. 

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,270
 The police suspect the perpetrator stole a master key from a hotel employee 

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,820
 and broke into the suite room that Ryu Sun Jae was staying in. 

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,560
 Inside the room, they found a handkerchief with traces of a sedative the suspect used 

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,580
 and evidence of foul play with the victim. 

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,330
 Fingerprints on the weapon found on the scene indicate that 

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,110
 the suspect is a convicted murderer from 2009 and was released from jail a few days ago. 

17
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,110
 A male in his 40s, Kim. 

18
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,540
 But why? Why Sun Jae? 

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,190
   

20
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,580
Gauze.

21
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:34,940


22
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,800
   

23
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,990
I have to rewind this.

24
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,480
   

25
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,760
No. Maybe he still has it?

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,940
What if he got rid of it?

27
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,020
Where is it?

28
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,040
Im Sol. What are you doing?

29
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,350
Do you know where Sun Jae's watch is?

30
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,700
- What? 
 - The electronic watch Sun Jae used to wear.

31
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,220
He has worn it all the time since high school. Remember?

32
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,780
I need to find that right now.

33
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,460
Why are you suddenly asking about a watch?

34
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,570
Who do you think caused this?

35
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,130
- Get it together! 
 - I'm trying to rewind everything!

36
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,600
If you want to save Sun Jae, we need to find that watch right away.

37
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,190
What does the watch have to do with saving Sun Jae?

38
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,770
I don't have time to explain. Where is that watch?

39
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,860
Is it with his family? Where does his father live?

40
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,470
Okay. Fine. I'll figure it out.

41
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,840
You won't find it!

42
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,670
What?

43
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,880
He lost that a long time ago.

44
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,330
He lost it long ago!

45
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,410
Sun Jae looked thoroughly for it everywhere long ago.

46
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,560
But he never found it.

47
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,340
I-I-It doesn't exist?

48
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,380
Really?

49
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,610
Yes.

50
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,510
What's with that watch anyway?

51
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,810
 According to an inmate who knew the suspect in jail, 

52
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,530
- Sol! 
  - Kim has held a grudge since May 2009, 

53
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,660
 when Ryu Sun Jae witnessed his crime, 

54
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,270
 and eventually led to his imprisonment. 

55
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,980
 What does that mean? 

56
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,960
 I thought they caught the culprit then. 

57
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,530
 How did Sun Jae see Kim Young Soo in 2009? 

58
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,860
Mom, when was I kidnapped? Was it 2009?

59
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,120
Yeah, it was a little bit after you started school.

60
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,850
 I came back to the present. That's why it wasn't reported. 

61
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,400
 Then, did Kim Young Soo find me again in 2009? 

62
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,170
 If Sun Jae saw me then and saved me... 

63
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,140
 The police think this is a clear motive for vengeful murder. 

64
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,690
The motive for vengeful murder?

65
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,600
There's no way...

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,580
After Kim Young Soo left prison,

67
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,360
I was worried he would go after you.

68
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,410
I meant to tell you to request protection.

69
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,070
I never thought he would go after Sun Jae.

70
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,780
What about what I asked you?

71
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,930
Oh, right.

72
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,350
One second.

73
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,670
Yes.

74
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,350
   

75
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,810
   

76
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,400
   

77
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,900
   

78
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,170
   

79
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,700
 The evening of May 10th, 2009. 

80
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,340
 On my way home, I found a backpack. 

81
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,200
   
 I saw Sol's name written on a book. 

82
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,890
 Then I heard her scream. 

83
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,210
 I immediately called the police, and ran toward the scream. 

84
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,470
   

85
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,000
 I looked around while calling Sol. 

86
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,520
 I heard a phone ring inside a building under construction. 

87
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,830
 I ran inside, following the ring. 

88
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,250
Sol!

89
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,330
 Then, I found Sol as she was escaping. 

90
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,420
 I looked over Sol as she collapsed. 

91
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,060
 Then, I saw a man run away. 

92
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,740
 I ran after him and started fighting him. 

93
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,580
 I think he dropped something during all that. 

94
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,310
   

95
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,800
Die!

96
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,940
 - The man got on top of me  
 - Die!

97
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,030
 and started strangling me. 

98
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,970
Die!

99
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,830
 I reached out and hit the man's face with what I could grab. 

100
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,880
 You must be doing better now. 

101
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,160
 After what happened, you were afraid to see me. 

102
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,700
 So you really haven't talked to him since then? 

103
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,140
 Why are you suddenly asking about a watch? 

104
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,990
 Who do you think caused this? 

105
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,190
Sun Jae...

106
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,170
Did you die because of me?

107
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,470
It should've been me.

108
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,320
I should have died instead.

109
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,310
    
 What's this?

110
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,220
   

111
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,640
 Hello? 

112
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,070
Detective Kim, I have a question.

113
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,840
There's a photo of something as evidence in the police report.

114
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,750
Does the police hold onto those items?

115
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,890
 No, we return them once the investigation is concluded. 

116
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,140
 - But why?  
 - N-Nothing.

117
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,370
By chance...

118
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,790
 did I get it back? 

119
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,750
Sol! What's wrong? What?

120
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,470
Mom, where do you keep our old stuff?

121
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,000
Why? What are you looking for?

122
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,930
I...

123
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,370
Grandma!

124
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,880
I kept it safe for you, Unni.

125
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,570
Mom, you took something that belongs to Sol again?

126
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,990
Give it back, please.

127
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,950
- Here. 
 - Grandma, one second.

128
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,740
I found it.

129
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,820
   

130
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,110
 How are you? Are you okay? 

131
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,360
 Hey... 

132
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,080
 When I see you, I keep remembering what happened. 

133
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,400
 I get scared. 

134
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,060
 That's why I can't see you anymore. 

135
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,570
I'm sorry, Sun Jae.

136
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,200
This is all because of me.

137
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,770
I'll change it for good this time.

138
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,770
 Where am I? Am I back? 

139
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,890
 Is she insane? 

140
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,700
 This is crazy. What's going on? 

141
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,360
 Careful! Careful! 

142
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,820
What? Why am I up here?

143
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,500
2009? 
    

144
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,860
Yeonseo University?

145
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,060
Sol! Oh, no, no!

146
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,680
 Is this how I die as soon as I come back? 

147
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,840
 This can't be... I can't die before I save Sun Jae... 

148
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,560
Nice catch.

149
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,290
Thank you!

150
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,870
Ryu Sun Jae?

151
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,610
Hey, where are you going? Thank you!

152
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,560
Hey, it'll be more embarrassing if you run off alone!

153
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,970
 Wait for me! 

154
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,180
   

155
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,580
Why did I have to fall right there?

156
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,440
Hey!

157
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,940
How can you run off without even saying thanks to Ryu Sun Jae?

158
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,370
He saved you from hitting the ground and dying.

159
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,320
I know. Why does he do that every time?

160
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,520
But why is Sun Jae here?

161
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,430
Ryu Sun Jae is majoring in physical education like Geum.

162
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,010
- I thought you knew. 
 - What?

163
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:03,350
 In the past, he signed with a label and never went to college. 

164
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,060
 When you go to auditions, don't take Sun Jae along. 

165
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,530
 I wasted precious time chasing waterfalls. 

166
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,710
This is fate. You should say hi—

167
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,060
No.

168
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,390
I can't look at Sun Jae.

169
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,800
Because I feel guilty.

170
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,870
Wait! Is it because you rejected him before?

171
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,760
You quit the study room last year and avoided him. It was so obvious. Still?

172
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,960
Yeah. It's the right thing to do.

173
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,230
Being around me isn't good for Sun Jae.

174
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,470
You are so extra.

175
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,030
Cute girls are everywhere. Why would he chase you when you rejected him already?

176
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,850
That's good, then.

177
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,780
I have to go somewhere.

178
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,110
Right now? Hey, hold on!

179
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,780
Make sure you bring this tomorrow.

180
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,520
But her major class is next.

181
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,480
Are you skipping class?

182
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,460
She was quiet for a while. Why is she acting up again?

183
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,230
   

184
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,840
   

185
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,940
 They need to catch Kim Young Soo before he comes to find me. 

186
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,090
 Then, nothing will happen to Sun Jae. 

187
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,210
So, on September 1st, 2008,

188
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,320
you were abducted in a cab in front of your home.

189
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,580
- Yes. 
 - But instead of reporting then,

190
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,820
why are you reporting it now, months later? I don't get it.

191
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,060
At the time, I lost my memory from the shock.

192
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,360
But the memories came back.

193
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,650
All of a sudden?

194
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,940
Is that really possible?

195
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,160
My abductor is also the person behind the Jooyang Reservoir incident.

196
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,300
- What? 
 - I know who it is.

197
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,800
I remember his face, name, occupation, everything.

198
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,060
This is his car key.

199
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:10,530
   

200
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,170
I handed over all his information. He'll be caught soon. Right?

201
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,110
He will be.

202
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,560
But you never know.

203
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,380
I'll protect myself.

204
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,980
Hey, let go of that right now!

205
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,090
Kim Tae Sung?

206
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,920
My ex-girlfriend?

207
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,900
- What... you... 
 - Why are you here?

208
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,300
You pathetic fool, are you still up to no good?

209
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,280
- What's wrong with you? 
 - I told you to get your life together.

210
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,910
You're well over 20 and stealing money from kids? Geez, seriously.

211
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,640
Thank you for helping me find my money.

212
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,720
"Thank you"?

213
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,130
Give me that.

214
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,850
I'm sorry I misunderstood.

215
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What kind of guy do you think I am that you treat me like this every time?

216
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,730
Because I'm worried about your life.

217
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,560
Your fate was to waste your life away!

218
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,340
Did you even graduate?

219
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,180
That's a funny way to ask to see my graduation photos.

220
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,640
Wow, you actually graduated!

221
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,260
My goodness!

222
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,480
Goodness! Good, I'm so proud of you, Kim Tae Sung.

223
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,600
- You really pulled yourself together. 
 - What?

224
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,160
Oh, I get it.

225
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,990
What now? Are you attracted to me again after all this time?

226
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,100
- What? 
 - You're doing this on purpose.

227
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,880
To plant the memory of our reunion in my head.

228
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,400
- Are you trying to plant a punch in your head? 
 - Wait.

229
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,370
I feel a strange feeling that the mature version of Sol is back.

230
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,340
Something is different about you.

231
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,550
 He's psychic. Did he figure it out? 

232
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,170
What? W-W-Why are you looking at me like that?

233
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,190
You got even prettier, ex-girlfriend.

234
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,030
Gosh. That personality hasn't changed, I see.

235
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,320
I bet you say that to every girl.

236
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,060
So what are you doing with your life now?

237
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:48,180
Gosh. Seeing how you're dressed, you must drink and party every night.

238
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,900
How I'm dressed?

239
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,110
This is the best-selling item of the season.

240
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,420
Best-selling?

241
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,250
- Do you run a business? 
 - All right.

242
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,720
Look up "2 Men Man Kim Tae Sung online shop."

243
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,490
   

244
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,250
   

245
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,530
♫  If you never talk I'll never leave you  ♫

246
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,140
Wow! Totally slaying it!

247
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,410
I have to go.

248
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,700
If you wanted a fiery reunion, you got it.

249
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,790
See you later, Noona.

250
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,390
What a relief that he's doing well.

251
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,290
Why would she run away from me like that, as if she'd seen a ghost?

252
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,290
Why are you talking to yourself?

253
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,610
Why? Did Im Sol run away from you or something?

254
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,400
Yeah. She used to just get all icy and avoid me.

255
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,200
But this time, she ran off, hurriedly.

256
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,860
Okay, can you explain the difference?

257
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,650
It was definitely different.

258
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,740
I felt it in the moment she ran off.

259
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,330
Something about her back carried some emotion.

260
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,520
I think her face was slightly red, too.

261
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,300
What do you think?

262
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,490
Okay. Let me put this in clear terms for you.

263
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,670
When she's icy and avoidant, she doesn't like you.

264
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,760
But her running off, hurriedly?

265
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,300
Is she conflicted or something?

266
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,670
She despises you.

267
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,620
Get out of my way. So annoying.

268
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,900
Hey, I'd run away from you, too.

269
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,720
If a guy I rejected is still not over me?

270
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,830
And he even came to my school?

271
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,180
I'd freak out, too!

272
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,560
Don't you have any pride?

273
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,570
No. I have no such thing.

274
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,800
What's this?

275
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,770
Whoa, I teach you a few chords, and you write a song?

276
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,400
- Hey! Give that back! 
 - What are these lyrics?

277
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,650
"Rain Shower"?

278
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,570
You wrote this as you thought about Im Sol, didn't you?

279
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,460
No.

280
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,510
I wrote it just watching the rain.

281
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,330
Yeah, right. It hasn't rained in forever.

282
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,870
You are especially annoying today.

283
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,710
You keep seeing Im Sol at school, so you're not getting over her.

284
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,880
Out of sight, out of mind, you know?

285
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,080
Why don't you take some time off and join our band?

286
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,350
You should be the singer instead of Dong Sup.

287
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,360
Why are you bringing that up?

288
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,240
See you later.

289
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,290
Get over her!

290
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,970
Don't sit around writing songs like this, you loser!

291
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,510
It's spring here.

292
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,890
 By the time this spring ends, I probably won't be here. 

293
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:40,800
 This is the last time for real. 

294
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,360
♫  So I had to let it go  ♫

295
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,950
♫  I recollect that day, our night  ♫

296
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,430
♫  When I walk down the staircase of memories and call your name  ♫

297
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:04,620
♫  I can see a little clearer again   ♫

298
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:11,540
♫  Maybe I was waiting for this, inside the scattered passage of time  ♫

299
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:20,100
♫  One moment, your scent came to me  ♫

300
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:26,170
♫  So you can't disappear, I won't go far away  ♫

301
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:31,170
♫  Don't let go of my hands  ♫

302
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:37,510
♫  This moment, everything  ♫

303
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,630
♫  I might embrace you  ♫

304
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:49,580
 I can't let Sun Jae and Kim Young Soo meet until May 10th. 

305
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,800
Try knocking.

306
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,860
Knock, knock.

307
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,190
My little sister.

308
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,610
My little sister, can I get your autograph?

309
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,150
My autograph? What are you talking about?

310
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,000
The picture of you wasted on top of the statue!

311
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,800
It's all over the school message board in capital letters.

312
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,130
You went viral!

313
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,230
You're basically a celebrity.

314
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,520
I knew you had more star quality than me. Respect!

315
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,150
What? The school message board?

316
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,430
- This is crazy. 
 - Gosh, good job.

317
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,070
How will you show your face for four years?

318
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,580
Mind your own business.

319
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,710
- Wait... Did you re-enroll already? 
 - Yeah, why?

320
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,530
I heard Sun Jae is majoring in PE. Have you run into him?

321
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,400
Hey, I'm in the entering class of '04!

322
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,180
Why would I run into those babies?

323
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,930
Right? Even if you run into him, don't bully him. Okay?

324
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,420
Don't act like you know me at school, all right?

325
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,200
Hey, little sister. Look.

326
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,680
- What do you think? 
 - Sucks.

327
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,360
Whoa. You're into it.

328
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,540
Wow, how did that pathetic guy seduce Hyun Joo?

329
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,970
The baton didn't really work.

330
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,040
How do I use this?

331
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,930
How about this?

332
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,510
Ow! It burns!

333
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,170
Ouch! It burns!

334
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,310
Whoa, it's pretty good!

335
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,860
Sun Jae.

336
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,310
Remember what I mentioned the other day?

337
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:51,880
- What? 
 - Doing rehab in the US.

338
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,230
Have you thought about it?

339
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,490
Wouldn't that just be torturing us with unrealistic hope?

340
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,880
Hey, look. Sit down for a second.

341
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,570
Coach Ahn dropped this off. Take a look.

342
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,240
   

343
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,840
It's a place that specializes in treating athletes.

344
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,600
Like you, a famous tennis player who had to retire young because of a shoulder injury...

345
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,870
She got rehab treatment there and came back the next season.

346
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,940
She won the tournament right away.

347
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,570
Stem cells or something, they say it even heals your DNA.

348
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,760
It sounds like it's not impossible.

349
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,710
How about you take next semester off and go?

350
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,270
Let me keep thinking about it.

351
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,970
Oh, all right.

352
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,580
Okay. Well, then...

353
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,510
Give it some thought.

354
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,030
Get some rest, son.

355
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,740
Okay.

356
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,400
   

357
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:36,510
♫  I wished the rain would never end  ♫

358
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,790
 You know what I used to hate? 

359
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,530
 Rain. 

360
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,700
 But it rained the day I met you. 

361
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,900
 I liked the rain that day. 

362
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,170
 Sol... 

363
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,150
♫  I hoped it wouldn't just be a quick drizzle  ♫

364
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:57,760
 I... like you a lot. 

365
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,390
 I can't accept your feelings. 

366
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,720
 If you continue this, I'd feel uncomfortable and pressured. 

367
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,360
 So, just stop liking me. 

368
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,010
♫  You seep into my thoughts once again today  ♫

369
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,210
   

370
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:20,550
♫  You are a gift from the heavens  ♫

371
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:28,980
♫  In this lonely world I'll protect you  ♫

372
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,120
I just grabbed some stuff.

373
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,760
Go buy some clothes or come home yourself and get them.

374
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,760
We haven't solved the case. How am I supposed to go home?

375
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,380
It's always work first.

376
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,330
I'm off.

377
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,780
Hey, Tae Sung!

378
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,900
I told you to bring me underwear. What is this?

379
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,220
It's underwear!

380
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,240
   

381
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,040
 Im Sol! 

382
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:01,440
Hey! You can't still be in bed!

383
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,150
Get up right now.

384
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,920
You haven't even packed yet, have you?

385
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,390
Get out of bed and wash up.

386
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,010
What time is it?

387
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,390
 The case has been transferred to the criminal department. 

388
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,810
 The investigation is planned to begin soon. 

389
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,570
 The investigation is progressing fast. 

390
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,650
 That's good. 

391
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,700
We're going to be late!

392
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,820
Want to start off your freshman year by getting picked on?

393
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,340
What is going on?

394
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,910
What is going on? To welcome freshmen,

395
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,870
it's the retreat for new students. How could you forget?

396
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,570
The retreat?

397
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,010
Go wash up.

398
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,510
What happened to the thing I gave you?

399
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,200
What is this?

400
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,640
Everyone sit in your assigned seats, please.

401
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,180
   

402
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,580
Rock, paper, scissor, shoot!

403
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,520
Rock, paper, scissor, shoot! Hurry! Hurry!

404
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,570
 Rock, paper, scissor, shoot! 

405
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,850
 Why are we on the same train? 

406
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,910
One more time!

407
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,500
If you don't go, you get a blow! Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

408
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,720
Hold on! Hold on!

409
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,620
Yeonseo! Yeonseo University, listen up!

410
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,220
Do you know this?

411
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,800
There's a legend that's been passed down at our school.

412
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,960
-A legend? 
 - If you kiss on the first freshman retreat, you get married.

413
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,800
Stop lying!

414
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,880
It's real!

415
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,300
The entering class of '05 senior who got married kissed his wife here.

416
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,770
Also, among the '01 business major graduates,

417
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:55,160
there's another married couple who kissed on the first retreat.

418
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,860
But they got divorced within a year and married another classmate.

419
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,580
It turns out he also drunkenly kissed that classmate at the first retreat!

420
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,860
What?

421
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,400
Also, also, on some department's first retreat a long time ago,

422
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,020
two guys kissed as a dare. What do you think happened?

423
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,490
What happened?

424
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,560
Ten years later, they entered into a same-sex marriage abroad!

425
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,500
Anyway, if you kiss on this trip, you get married!

426
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,160
So don't get drunk and kiss just anybody.

427
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,780
Let's keep security tight around our lips, all right?

428
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,990
We need to be careful, too.

429
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,820
You guys don't have to be careful.

430
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,590
Sun Jae, do you believe in that legend?

431
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,400
Why would you believe that nonsense?

432
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,760
This will be a retreat overflowing with love.

433
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,020
Hey, Sol.

434
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,140
Oh, right...

435
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,500
Well...

436
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,220
Your brother. How are he and his girlfriend these days?

437
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,890
I was looking at his girlfriend's blog.

438
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,510
She deleted all the photos they were in together.

439
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,750
Did they break up?

440
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,980
- Why does it happen to be Im Geum? 
 - What?

441
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,310
There are lots of good guys in the world.

442
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:07,130
I definitely warned you.

443
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,780
What are you talking about?

444
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,250
I swear, I'm not interested in Geum at all!

445
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,790
Stop staring at me!

446
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,650
That burns!

447
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,270
What are you doing? I swallowed my mouthwash!

448
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,600
Junior, I'm warning you. Don't develop feelings for me.

449
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,630
I'm sorry, so sorry.

450
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:53,020
 Let's just stay out of sight until we get to the lodge. 

451
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,910
- What? 
 - Let's unpack and gather back here!

452
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,410
PE Department, let's unpack and then meet back here!

453
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,840
We're in the same lodge?

454
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,930
   

455
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,240
It's Geum!

456
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,950
He must have been on a different train.

457
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,740
What is wrong with him?

458
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,300
He's crazy.

459
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,220
Hey, stop drinking.

460
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,770
Put it all down here.

461
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,400
She's here.

462
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,630
Why didn't I see her on the train?

463
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,810
Hey, you.

464
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,280
Do you know about the Yeonseo legend?

465
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,570
Oh, that thing?

466
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:32,210
If you try to get to my sister, you know the consequences.

467
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,770
Keep your mouth away from her!

468
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,130
You are already permanently banned from my brother-in-law list.

469
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,810
If you love your sister that much, be nicer to her.

470
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,590
You're talking back to your senior?

471
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,940
Hey, Hyun Joo! It's so nice and big here.

472
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,200
Thanks for recommending this place.

473
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,350
What? It was your idea?

474
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,910
Yeah!

475
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,490
- Damn you. 
 - You all put your mouths away also.

476
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,340
Hello, Senior.

477
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,520
Is she running away from me?

478
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,060
Hey! I swallowed my mouthwash again!

479
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,530
My insides are burning!

480
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,230
I-I'm sorry.

481
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,780
But why do you keep holding mouthwash in your mouth?

482
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,400
Hey, junior. Are you trying to run away?

483
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,880
Wow. This is not good.

484
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,200
Darn it.

485
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,190
   

486
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,860
Sir.

487
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,590
The victim of the attempted kidnapping said her perp is the

488
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,350
same guy behind the Jooyang Reservoir case, so it's our case now.

489
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,550
Attempted kidnapping?

490
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,180
She said she met you on the day of the kidnapping.

491
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:47,640
- What? 
 - I guess she had temporary memory loss from the trauma.

492
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,300
    
 Im Sol?

493
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,460
 Are you all right? 

494
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,110
 Where am I? 

495
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,880
 Was that day, by chance... 

496
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,660
I thought there was something strange about that day.

497
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,590
I looked into this Kim Young Soo guy.

498
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,420
He matches the description exactly.

499
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,560
The moment I put this key in the taxi Kim Young Soo was driving...

500
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,330
It fit perfectly. Wow, I got goosebumps.

501
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,600
I think he might really be the Jooyang Reservoir culprit.

502
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,910
Where is Kim Young Soo now?

503
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,400
After the day of the kidnapping, his whereabouts are unclear.

504
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,710
He quit the taxi company and canceled his phone.

505
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,150
This is where the victim pointed to as the crime scene.

506
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,240
It might be hard to find since the address isn't registered. So she drew a map.

507
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,000
If we find some kind of evidence here,

508
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,590
she's basically solving our case for us.

509
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,880
- Hello, hello, hello! 
  - Aye! 

510
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,630
- One Yeonseo United! 
  - Aye! 

511
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,260
- We are righteous Communications majors! 
  - Aye! 

512
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,520
- We are the world's greatest Communications department! 
  - Aye! 

513
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,360
I am the bob haircut fairy of Yeonseo University,

514
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,660
- Kang! 
  - Kang! 

515
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,770
- Soo! 
  - Soo! 

516
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,270
- Ji! 
  - Ji! 

517
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,720
 I am in no mood to enjoy this retreat. 

518
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,560
- Hello, hello, hello! 
  - Aye! 

519
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,290
- One Yeonseo United! 
  - Aye! 

520
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:12,180
- We are righteous Communications majors! 
  - Aye! 

521
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,080
I'm the entertainment fairy of the Communications department!

522
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,450
- Kim! 
  - Kim! 

523
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,660
- Han! 
  - Han! 

524
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,910
- Sol! 
  - Sol! 

525
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,100
 That's my name! 

526
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,270
 Let's get out of here. 

527
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,130
Where is it?

528
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,530
 Let's go inside, drink, and play games! 

529
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,240
Come on in!

530
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,600
What's with her? Is she drunk and passed out already?

531
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,510
Come on in! Set it up! Come on.

532
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,020
Make sure you're sitting next to a newbie!

533
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,100
 Let's play a random game! 

534
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,760
 What game? Game start! 

535
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,300
 I'll slip out quietly so no one will see me. 

536
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,810
2, 3?

537
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,040
So cute! Let's go to 31!

538
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,340
25, 26.

539
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,330
- 27, 28. 
 - 29!

540
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,240
30!

541
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,610
 Drink! Drink! 

542
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,180
 Drink it up! Chug! Chug! 

543
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,570
 Chug! Chug! 

544
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,740
 How long are you going to make me dance? 

545
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,050
- 007! 
 - Bang!

546
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,790
- 0, 0, 7... 
 - Bang!

547
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,070
0, 0, 7, bang!

548
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,110
 Drink it up! Chug! Chug! 

549
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,310
 Drink it up! Chug! Chug! 

550
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:47,270
Black knight! I'll do it for her!

551
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,280
What does the rabbit from the sky say?

552
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,470
 Chug! Chug! Chug! 

553
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,750
Bunny, bunny, bunny!

554
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,010
Bunny, bunny, bunny!

555
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,370
 Carrot! Carrot! 

556
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,360
 Drink it up! Chug! Chug! Chug! 

557
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,830
 Chug! Chug! Chug! 

558
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,490
 How long are you going to make me dance? 

559
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,970
 Look at me dying waiting! 

560
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,990
 A little more! I'm almost there! 

561
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,160
Hey, I see you!

562
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,190
I thought you were drunk and passed out.

563
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,740
Were you pretending to be asleep so you don't have to drink?

564
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,970
Oh, no, no!

565
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:35,080
Right, no one would ever do that!

566
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,550
No, of course not. No way.

567
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,940
 Damn it! 

568
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,610
All right, all right. Let's switch it up.

569
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:46,810
Now, if you lose, we'll add a dare on top of drinking.

570
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,050
The first dare is to go to the PE lodge next door...

571
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,500
Drumroll please...

572
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:59,590
and dance!

573
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,610
 I cannot lose. 

574
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,220
Let's get started!

575
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,280
Four strawberries!

576
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,000
Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry, strawberry!

577
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,740
Two grapes!

578
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,660
Grape, grape!

579
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,330
Four lemons!

580
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,880
Lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon!

581
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,410
Eight grapefruits!

582
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,530
Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit!

583
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,210
Five strawberries!

584
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:32,750
Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry, strawberry, strawberry!

585
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,930
Three grapefruits!

586
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,060
Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit!

587
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,540
Eight strawberries!

588
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,620
Strawberry, strawberry, strawberry, strawberry, strawberry, strawberry, strawberry, strawberry!

589
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,650
Seven grapefruits!

590
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,950
Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit!

591
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,420
One strawberry!

592
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,130
Strawberry, stra—

593
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:59,710
 Drink it up! Chug! Chug! Chug! 

594
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,180
 How long are you going to make me wait? 

595
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,140
Oh, hello!

596
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,250
Our newbie Communications major wants to entertain you all.

597
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,320
Applause, please!

598
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,730
 Sun Jae isn't here. I'll just make this quick. 

599
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,680
♫  Uh, let's go   ♫

600
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,160
♫   You're so so handsome, my eyes are blinded   ♫

601
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,790
♫   I can't breath because I'm trembling  ♫

602
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:49,380
♫   Gee gee gee gee baby baby baby  ♫ 
 ♫   Gee gee gee gee baby baby baby  ♫

603
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,010
♫  I'm so embarrassed I can't look at you   ♫

604
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,730
♫  I feel so shy  ♫

605
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,050
♫  Because I've fallen for you  ♫

606
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:06,750
♫   Gee gee gee gee baby baby baby  ♫ 
 ♫   Gee gee gee gee baby baby baby  ♫

607
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,620
♫  I'm so embarrassed I can't look at you  ♫

608
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,840
Junior! You can't just quit in the middle of it.

609
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,310
You have to complete the dare!

610
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:17,470
I told you I'm leaving!

611
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,700
How dare you act like an elder when you're a year or two older?

612
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,310
If you were born a few years later,

613
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,980
you would get canceled on social media.

614
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,070
Also, why force people to drink? Did anyone deserve that?

615
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,300
If someone dies from this, what will you do?

616
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,050
You don't know how dangerous alcohol is, you young dumbass!

617
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,830
I'm leaving, so curb the drinking and get them to bed. Got it?

618
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,150
Answer me!

619
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,890
Yes.

620
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,630
Let's just play foot volleyball.

621
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:58,580
Hey, hey. Foot volleyball! Over here!

622
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,380
- Hey, hey! 
 - Are you good at foot volleyball?

623
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,230
   

624
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,050
Hey, guys, I'm sorry.

625
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,360
I have to go to the TOEIC class.

626
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,600
Good job today. Peace out, Eclipse!

627
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,570
I could slap him!

628
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,720
He's going to get us cut from the lineup. TOEIC?

629
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,360
CEO said he'll disband us if we don't fill the venue this month.

630
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,050
Should we make promotional content or something?

631
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,180
Maybe we should try out for that.

632
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,980
   

633
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,170
Superstar K?

634
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,250
Gosh, why can't I find the trail?

635
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,890
Let's look at the map...

636
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,700
Right! This is before smartphones!

637
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:53,370
Sun Jae! Oh, no, Sun Jae!

638
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:56,150
Sun Jae! Wake up!

639
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,200
Help! Is anyone there?

640
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,910
What do I do? There's no service.

641
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,700
   

642
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,410
Please just go.

643
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,940
Hold on tight.

644
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:45,950
Okay.

645
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,350
I'll loosen it.

646
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,060
Okay.

647
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,430
Why would they install something like this?

648
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,590
This has to be illegal.

649
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,500
Here.

650
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:46,080
If you're going to carry it for self-defense, get batteries for it.

651
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,100
I thought you fainted from the electric shock.

652
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,750
I just fell.

653
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,670
You hit me right in the vital spot with that.

654
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,980
Sorry.

655
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,570
So, why are you in a wild boar habitat in the middle of the night?

656
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,730
Oh, well...

657
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:11,570
I'm not feeling the retreat vibes, so I'm going home.

658
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,860
I know you're running away from me.

659
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,250
I saw you.

660
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,900
You kept avoiding me all day.

661
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,420
Do you need to get away this badly?

662
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,370
There's no trail here. Follow me.

663
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,360
Hey! Do you hate me that much?

664
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,410
You can't even stand to run into me?

665
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,410
 How could I ever hate you? 

666
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:43,810
 It's because you might die because of me. 

667
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,060
It's late.

668
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,570
Let's go.

669
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,380
 - The call is not going through. You'll be connected...  
 - This is weird.

670
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,330
Is Chae Won's phone broken?

671
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,950
Hey! W-W-What?

672
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:12,890
Why are you two crawling out of the dark? Huh?

673
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,330
H-Hey! That girl—

674
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,880
Hey, Ryu.

675
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,450
You didn't put your lips on my sister in the woods, did you?

676
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:31,420
Never mind. Judging from your face, you blew it.

677
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,600
You sure are normal-looking for a weirdo.

678
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:37,170
It's not like that.

679
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,730
Hey! I understand why Sol doesn't like you.

680
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,150
- Let me give you some advice as your senior. 
 - No thanks.

681
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,510
Hey!

682
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:49,570
A woman's heart is not so simple like a straight road.

683
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:55,260
Don't put your foot on the gas on a complicated off-road course.

684
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,840
What do you think will happen? Your car just goes splat!

685
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,440
When you approach her, vroom! Then brake and retreat, beep!

686
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,700
Vroom, beep! Vroom, beep! Vroom, beep!

687
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,550
You need to modulate the speed.

688
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:12,620
I'm good at this. That's why women go crazy over me!

689
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,740
I'm about to lose it.

690
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,820
Hey, hey. Being simple and clean instead of being clingy.

691
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,860
That's my style.

692
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,280
When you get dumped or break up, just walk away clean.

693
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,630
Make them think, "What is he doing?"

694
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,430
Make them wonder. Got it?

695
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:32,090
Sure.

696
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:35,860
Hey, Ryu. Can I borrow your phone?

697
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,900
- Then, you'll let me go? 
 - Hand it over.

698
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,710
Thanks.

699
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,760
 - Hello?  
 - My little Chae Won!

700
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,670
My princess! It's been so long since I heard your voice!

701
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:58,500
I couldn't reach you for days. I thought your phone was broken!

702
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:03,150
But it was my phone that was broken!

703
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,180
 Oppa, our phones aren't broken. 

704
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,070
 I've been avoiding your calls. 

705
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,090
What? Why would you do that?

706
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:14,750
 Oppa, I have feelings for someone else. I'm sorry. 

707
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,310
Someone else? Who? What are you talking about?

708
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:18,830
Wait, w-w-wait!

709
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,920
Chae Won, don't hang up! Are you breaking up with me?

710
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,240
Is that what you mean? Say it again!

711
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,090
Chae Won! Princess Chae Won!

712
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,310
   

713
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:35,420
Are you and Jin Sang going to become a campus couple?

714
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:38,430
He's been holding mouthwash in his mouth all day.

715
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:40,930
He's determined to declare his love for you and get a kiss.

716
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:46,690
What? I hate public romantic gestures. Really...

717
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,240
 Hey! Do you hate me that much? 

718
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,430
 You can't even stand to run into me? 

719
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,220
Sol! Why are you drinking alone all sad?

720
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,480
Come here! Drink with us.

721
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,500
No thanks.

722
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,160
What's wrong with her?

723
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,430
We ate all the chips.

724
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:15,380
Let me get some more.

725
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,090
Chae Won!

726
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,120
Princess Chae Won...

727
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,690
How can you end it like this?

728
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:31,340
Don't abandon me.

729
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,730
How pathetic.

730
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,250
Can I have my phone back?

731
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:44,800
Hey, Ryu. I'm in pain.

732
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,870
You reek of alcohol.

733
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,490
Why does she not love me anymore?

734
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:56,580
How can I get back my woman's heart?

735
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,330
I don't know.

736
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,390
My heart hurts so much.

737
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:08,010
I feel like I've been shot.

738
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,330
I need to do something.

739
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,990
I'm going to go see Chae Won right now!

740
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,740
Right now!

741
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,720
What? Right now?

742
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,590
Chae Won!

743
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,610
Geum, where are you going?

744
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,570
Oppa, there are wild boars out there!

745
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:47,020
Where did he go?

746
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:58,080
Eun Ji! It's Jin Sang!

747
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,820
My heart is going to burst because of you!

748
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,840
 - Please go out with me!  
 - Go outside.

749
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,380
Get out there!

750
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,780
This is so embarrassing.

751
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,740
 Where are you? 

752
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:14,380
 Don't make me wait too long! 

753
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,420
Eun Ji! Come outside!

754
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,050
Eun...

755
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,820
That is not what I asked to come out...

756
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,900
My stomach...

757
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,920
Maybe it's because I swallowed all that mouthwash.

758
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,790
Eun— no, I can't.

759
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,260
Hey! Hey!

760
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,080
You, PE major! One Yeonseo United!

761
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,360
Can you help me? Hold the door, please?

762
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,580
Gosh, I thought I'd seen it all.

763
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,870
Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

764
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:06,090
Hold the door.

765
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:08,150
- Okay. 
 - Thanks.

766
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:17,880
It is him.

767
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,660
Hey! Where are you going?

768
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,340
Hey!

769
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,860
Okay, I'm here!

770
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,620
What?

771
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:42,010
What is he doing?

772
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,800
Finally, some quiet.

773
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:57,090
Im Sol?

774
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,100
Why does the ground keep coming up?

775
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,900
Is she drunk?

776
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,670
 Hey, I'd run away from you, too. 

777
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:25,630
 If a guy I rejected is still not over me? 

778
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:30,210
 And he even came to my school, I'd freak out, too! 

779
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:37,210
♫  This yearning I can't hide  ♫

780
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,230
So pretty.

781
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,520
♫  I fall asleep missing you  ♫

782
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,190
 Should we just meet up now? 

783
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:45,550
 - What? 
 - Just say, "I miss you." 

784
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:49,330
 I'll drop everything and come to you. 

785
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,460
 Go, go. 

786
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,180
Right then...

787
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,140
I should have told you, "I miss you."

788
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,610
Then maybe nothing would have happened.

789
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:08,070
Oppa! Geum!

790
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:12,360
I saw him go this way. Where is he?

791
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,610
Oppa!

792
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,290
Oppa! Oh, no!

793
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,620
What are you doing? Are you okay?

794
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,930
Oh, no! What do we do?!

795
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,610
Chae Won...

796
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:30,550
How can love change?

797
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:34,960
Do you really love that man that much?

798
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,170
Oppa, did your girlfriend break up with you?

799
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,940
For real?

800
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,540
Your girlfriend cheated on you?

801
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:46,120
Don't abandon me, Chae Won...

802
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:48,890
Stop saying her name!

803
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:51,340
She left you for another man. Why call after her?

804
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,740
Chae Won...

805
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,850
I told you, stop saying her name.

806
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,380
Do you have any pride?

807
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,530
Princess Chae Won...

808
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,060
Princess? What princess?

809
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,020
- Princess Chae Won! 
 - Stop saying her name!

810
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:05,250
If you say her name one more time...

811
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,540
Chae Won!

812
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,800
You almost fell off.

813
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,090
Why are you here?

814
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,490
You shouldn't sleep here. It's not safe.

815
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,900
I asked why you were here.

816
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:25,640
Stop making me worry!

817
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,530
Why are you following me?

818
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:31,500
Why do you keep coming to me?

819
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,830
I was so mean to you.

820
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:38,610
So why do you keep worrying about me?

821
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:41,550
Are you stupid? Huh?

822
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:44,140
Are you really that stupid?

823
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:51,610
I told you to just think about yourself.

824
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:59,060
Just tell yourself that I'm horrible and forget about me.

825
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:03,900
Why did you stay and let terrible things happen to you?

826
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,690
Terrible things?

827
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:09,920
Please.

828
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,420
Please, Sun Jae. Please...

Okay, fine.

832
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:32,310
I'm sorry for everything. So...

833
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,830
don't cry.

834
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:41,560
Just pretend like you don't know me.

835
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,630
Don't worry about me.

836

No matter where I am, what I'm doing, or what happens to me. Please.

Please just leave me alone.

I'm back.

843
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:27,080
Oh, hey. Did you have fun at the retreat?

844
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,050
I don't know.

845
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:39,370
Hey, Sun Jae. That song you wrote? Drizzle, rain shower, something?

846
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:43,400
Want to apply to this with that song?

847
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:47,210
I thought you said it sucked.

848
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,430
Did you play it for someone else?

849
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:57,200
What? Who?

850
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,350
Anyone! Did you let anyone else hear it?

851
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:02,040
Hey. I only heard it a few days ago.

852
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,170
Why would I do that?

853
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:07,220
You didn't?

854
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:13,590
So, how about we go on that show and let the whole country hear it?

855
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,660
W-What is that?

856
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,980
Oh, no, this bastard!

857
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,590
- Hey, make a report. 
 - Yes, sir.

858
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:39,880
Gosh, this bastard...

859
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,410
Hi, there's a fire. Please come right away.

860
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:46,750
At the Jooyang Reservoir bus stop, across the bridge,

861
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,790
and to your right, you should see an abandoned lot.

862
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:52,930
Yes, please hurry.

863
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:01,910
Yes. I just called to see how the investigation was going.

864
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:04,720
We're trying to pin down Kim Young Soo's location right now.

865
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,240
Also, we visited the crime scene that you told us about.

866
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,670
 But it was already burned down. 

867
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,120
What? Burned down?

868
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,230
 No, the case file didn't say that. 

869
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:18,870
 They're supposed to find the evidence there. 

870
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:20,740
That's not possible.

871
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:23,290
You haven't found any evidence at all?

872
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:25,010
Not yet.

873
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:29,340
I think he noticed that someone reported him.

874
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:40,560
 I wonder if he's going to come and find me? 

875
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,730
 What if he comes across Sun Jae? 

876
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,380
   

877
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,370
Sun Jae.

878
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:06,220
I waited for you to check something.

879
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:09,950
- I'm in a hurry right now. 
 - That song.

880
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:12,410
How do you know that song?

881
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:18,030
What song?

882
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:21,620
I haven't played it for anyone except In Hyuk.

883
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:23,740
How do you know it?

884
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:28,240
♫  You are a gift from the heavens  ♫

889

 I'm going to change it this time. 

890
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:51,030
 For sure, this time. Before I go back. 

891
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:52,060

892

♫  I wished the rain would never end  ♫

893

01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,700
 To my time. 

895
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:05,610
♫  I hoped it wouldn't just be a quick drizzle  ♫

♫  That's what I sincerely wished for  ♫

come from the future?

911
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,550

918
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:42,570
 What would you do if the girl you liked was from the future? 

919
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:44,670
 That is such a bullshit thing to say. 

920
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:46,410
 Great to see ya! 

921
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:48,430
 Look at her. I think she likes Ryu Sun Jae. 

922
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:49,790
 Sun Jae, want to go out with me? 

923
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:53,800
 Was it good? Was it good? 

924
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,570
 Don't waste your energy on me because you're jealous. 

925
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:57,870
 Take care of yourself. 

926
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,520
 Let me ask you one last thing. 

927
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,880
 In all the times you've lived, did you ever like me? 

928
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,330
 No. Never. 

929
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:07,040
 I'll leave so you can be free. 

930
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,270
 Don't come! Stop! 

931
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:12,560
♫  You're my only star, yeah  ♫

932
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,070
♫  You're my only star, yeah  ♫
