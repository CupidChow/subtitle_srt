1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,470
   

2
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,550
   

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,130
   

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,990
   

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,910
   

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,020


7
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,920
Could I grab something for a second?

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,710
Oh, sure.

9
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,580
Thank you.

10
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,650
Isn't that Ryu Sun Jae?

11
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,550
Why is he shoveling?

12
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,150
What is that?

13
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,770
Is that an egg? A gourd?

14
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,600
   

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,480
Oh, you're here.  You came? 
    

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,180
You made it.

17
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,690
Long time no see. Long time no see.

18
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,120
Long time no see.

19
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,520
I'm freezing to death.

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,120
It's long past midnight.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,050
Where is she?

22
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,730
- Hey, what's up? 
  - Hyung. 

23
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,340
What are you doing holding an egg?

24
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,960
What?

25
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,550
- How do you know that? 
 - A reporter saw you with an egg

26
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,000
 on top of the Han River Bridge. 

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,710
 They're asking what you're filming. 

28
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,050
Hey, Dong Seok.

29
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,970
If you were supposed to meet someone,

30
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,030
and they're not here after an hour, did I get stood up?

31
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,370
 An hour? 

32
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,140
Looks like they forgot.

33
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,410
 When did you make the plans? 

34
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,660
- Fifteen years ago. 
  - Sorry to hear that. 

35
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,250
If they said to meet 15 years later, that means they don't want to see you again.

36
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,620
 Don't act so naive. 

37
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,300
- Is that what that means? 
  - Unless you want a fan meetup there, 

38
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,740
go home now. Someone will take a photo—

39
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,130
It's posted already.

40
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,070
 Where did you even get that egg? 

41
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,100
I'm hanging up!

42
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,810
 Time that's passing again. 

43
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,610
 This is my gift for you. 

44
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,050
 Will this gift make its way to the future you? 

45
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:20,080
 I pray and hope so desperately... as I write this letter. 

46
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,800
 If you're reading this... I want to tell you this. 

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,460
 Sun Jae, thank you... for being alive. 

48
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,000
 "Time that's passing again." 

49
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,530
The forecast didn't mention snow.

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,890
 It's the first snow of the year. 

51
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,130
 Sun Jae must love this. 

52
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,930
 What is this? 

53
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,810
 It's exactly like that day. 

54
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,830
No, it can't be.

55
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,990
It can't be.

56
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,540
   

57
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,880
   

58
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,000
Dong Seok.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
Huh? Yeah, yeah.

60
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,630
The film production company employee.

61
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,590
Is her name Im Sol?

62
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,050
Yes.

63
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,090
Do you actually know her?

64
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,400
She said you would remember her if you heard her name.

65
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,610
Hyung! Hyung!

66
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,010
   
   

67
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,350
 You have to remember. Okay? Han River Bridge. 

68
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,130
 Even if we drift apart from each other, please come. 

69
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,220
 It's Sun Jae! 

70
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,280
Hyung, over here!

71
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,030
   

72
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,990
Why the Han River Bridge all of a sudden?

73
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,660
He should have been here already.

74
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,970
Maybe he just left.

75
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,360
That's good, then...

76
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,610
♫  This yearning I can't hide  ♫

77
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,160
♫  I fall asleep missing you  ♫

78

Hello?

80
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,860
♫  Your low and deep voice  ♫

81
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,790
Hello.

82
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,690
 It's me. 

83
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,880
♫  I can't forget the traces of you  ♫

♫  If I could stop, even just for a moment  ♫

85
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:14,010
♫  I would embrace you right there and then  ♫

90
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,610
Long time no see.

91
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,290
Yeah.

92
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,460
Long time no see.

93
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,100
Right.

94
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,980
Why are you standing here like this?

95
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,510
Is your car broken?

96
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,140
No.

97
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,530
I was waiting for you.

98
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,350
How did you know I would come here?

99
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,990
I just thought you might.

100
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,620
What if I hadn't seen you?

101
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,180
You haven't changed.

102
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,460
Want to get a cup of tea somewhere?

103
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,580
Or is it too late?

104
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,740
No. I'm okay.

105
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,730
Hyung!

106
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,170
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

107
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,950
Everyone is asking why you're not at the afterparty.

108
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,610
 Im Sol, you are the last person Ryu Sun Jae saw before he died. 

109
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,860
- We have to hurry over! 
  - I can't let him go like this. 

110
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,340
One second.

111
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,540
No! Don't go.

112
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,280
You can't go.

113
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,880
What?

114
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,730
I just mean...

115
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,550
Hyung!

116
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,770
Let's be together tonight!

117
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,400
You and me. Let's be together tonight.

118
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,600
What do you mean?

119
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,120
It means what I just said.

120
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,720
You... and me, alone?

121
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,320
Yes.

122
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,800
Don't go. Stay with me.

123
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,570
♫  No matter how I try to look away  ♫

124
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,320
♫   I’m feeling ashamed   ♫

125
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay. Let's be together.

126
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,550
Hyung, what if somebody sees you?

127
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,650
Tell them I can't make it.

128
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,200
What?

129
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,770
Hyung, where are you going?

130
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,920
♫  My heart is beating for you  ♫

131
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,590
♫  That my feelings are sincere  ♫

132
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,100
- Aren't you getting in? 
 - What?

133
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,600
♫  I wish for you to know that, my love  ♫

134
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,670
Yeah. I am!

135
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,180
What?

136
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,070
Hyung.

137
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,310
How have you been?

138
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,350
What do you think?

139
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,180
You seem good.

140
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,740
Then I must be.

141
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,820
Is anything bothering you these days?

142
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,960
Not really.

143
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,070
 You're not lying. Right? 

144
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,750
 You're okay. Right? 

145
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,630
How about you?

146
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,080
I'm fine, I think.

147
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm healthy, and I have a job.

148
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,350
That's good.

149
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,920
So, where are we going?

150
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,970
Somewhere we can be alone and quiet?

151
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,140
We're here.

152
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,570
Huh?

153
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,340
 A hotel? 

154
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,310
You must come here often. You know where you're going.

155
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,330
I prefer going to a place I'm a regular.

156
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,050
You're a regular?

157
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,620
I like the atmosphere.

158
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,410
 What atmosphere? What for? 

159
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,380
   

160
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,540
Hey, Sun Jae!

161
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,820
Well...

162
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,060
Want to go somewhere else?

163
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,980
Why? You don't like it?

164
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,150
It's not that I like or don't like it...

165
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,740
Then let's go inside.

166
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,680
It's the only place where we won't have eyes and ears on us.

167
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,610
Sun Jae!

168
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,030
I know that I asked you to be with me tonight.

169
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,280
But when I said, "Be with me tonight..."

170
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,040
Well, um...

171
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,180
I didn't mean a s-night.

172
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,020
A s-night?

173
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,370
Yeah. A sexy night.

174
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,330
I mean, we're not strangers.

175
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,320
We had a little thing in the past.

176
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,780
I've heard of old classmates that meet up years later

177
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,100
and skip right to the end, if you know what I mean.

178
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,850
I'm sorry, but I'm kind of conservative.

179
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,880
- What on earth are you thinking of— 
 - But!

180
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,100
I am not criticizing you for thinking in that direction.

181
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,620
We just have different values.

182
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,880
Two consenting adults get together, the vibes are right, and...

183
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,720
things can happen!

184
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,820
But when I said, "Stay with me tonight,"

185
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,640
I didn't mean a sexy night. I'm sorry.

186
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,730
You don't have anything to be sorry about.

187
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,530
I know, but I'm sorry for misleading you.

188
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,220
Take us to the good seats.

189
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,640
Yes, sir.

190
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,730
This is bad.

191
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,900
Sorry for bringing you here, of all places, when you are so conservative.

192
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,910
I don't feel comfortable in crowded places. You understand, right?

193
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,120
Of course.

194
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,400
I forgot that you're famous.

195
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,670
So why did you come to see me?

196
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,350
Well, I wanted to apologize.

197
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,250
Pushing you into the fountain yesterday

198
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,040
wasn't about you not doing the movie.

199
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,920
It was a mistake.

200
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,360
I was rushing out. I didn't realize it was you.

201
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,190
Sure. I know you wouldn't have done that on purpose.

202
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,740
Forget about the charges.

203
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,340
I called them about something else.

204
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,750
I don't know how the police ended up with you.

205
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,010
I'm sorry for putting you in that position.

206
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,130
I'm okay.

207
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,860
But is that the only reason you came to see me?

208
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,080
What?

209
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,070
Well, I thought...

210
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,950
The time capsule?

211
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,350
I thought that's why you came to see me.

212
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,190
You remember that promise?

213
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,860
Were you there that day?

214
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,200
No.

215
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,380
I'm busy! Very.

216
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,780
You weren't there.

217
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,790
That's a relief.

218
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,680
How about you?

219
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,800
Were you there?

220
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,950
No, I wasn't there, either.

221
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,700
You acted as if you put something grand in there.

222
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,110
Is it okay if we don't open it?

223
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,400
It's okay.

224
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,360
Because my wish had already come true.

225
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,510
Seeing you again like this...

226
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,400
It's really nice.

227
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,710
You must be doing better now.

228
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,850
After what happened, you were afraid to see me.

229
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,360
After what happened?

230
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,120
Never mind.

231
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,060
I remember you wanted to be a film director.

232
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,650
You actually work in the film industry.

233
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,610
 Get in! Get in! 

234
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,260
 Here, here. 

235
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,190
 Ready? One, two, three! 

236
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,060
   

237
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,270
   

238
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,400
   

239
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,490
 Our first full band concert in five years. 

240
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,490
 We lit it up. 

241
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,340
 Thank you. We love you. 

242
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,020
 - Eclipse, we love you forever! 
 - Thank you! 

243
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,160
 Where is Ryu Sun Jae, though? 

244
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,020
 He skipped the party and went to a hotel with a woman. 

245
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,340
   

246
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,590
One second.

247
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,040
- Hey. 
  - You're at the Shelton Hotel. Right? 

248
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,700
 It's all over social media that you're there with a girl. 

249
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,660
 I didn't realize you had someone to run over to. 

250
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,590
Who is it? Who is it!

251
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,350
You don't need to know.

252
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,390
Hey, I'll find out from the news tomorrow anyway.

253
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,480
 Reporters are probably swarming the hotel right now. 

254
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,380
Bye.

255
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,110
What's wrong?

256
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,230
I'm sorry. I think I need to go.

257
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,550
Already? But we barely caught up.

258
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,740
I think the media caught on. You first...

259
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,000
No. I'll go out first.

260
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,860
Take your time and go out slowly.

261
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,810
 I can't let him go like this. 

262
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,540
Can you stay a little longer?

263
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,870
If they write about this, it'll make your life harder.

264
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,070
Sun Jae, one second.

265
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,610
Cover your face when you leave just to be safe.

266
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,480
I'll call you.

267
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,680
Let's talk more another time.

268
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,570
Be safe.

269
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,050
 Hello? 

270
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,990
Thank you.

271
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,780
Excuse me!

272
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,570
Reporter Kim, watch the van. I'll watch the entrance.

273
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,300
Okay.

274
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,360
What is that?

275
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,380
Huh? Hey!

276
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,830
Hyung! Here! Hurry up!

277
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,530
What are you doing? You could get photographed.

278
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,570
If you don't want to be photographed, get in!

279
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,600
Get in now!

280
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,610
What are you thinking?

281
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,790
If we don't get photographed together, no one will believe it even if they write an article.

282
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,300
What is going on?

283
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,590
What else?

284
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,640
I'm driving, and you're in the passenger seat.

285
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,810
Exactly.

286
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,290
Why did you drag me in here? Are you a kidnapper?

287
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,930
I can't send away a celebrity on his own without a car.

288
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,270
My manager was there.

289
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,010
Oh, my! Oh, really? I didn't see him.

290
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,690
Well, you're here now, so I'll drive you home.

291
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,800
I'm a good driver! No accidents in the past 10 years.

292
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,560
Then and now, you're still a bulldozer.

293
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,030
 Let's be a bulldozer. 

294
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,000
You want to come up to my house at this hour?

295
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,250
Why?

296
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,560
W-Well...

297
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,270
Actually, it's kind of urgent.

298
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,180
Can I use your bathroom?

299
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,780
What?

300
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,030
I need to go.

301
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,970
I need to go right now!

302
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,060
It's coming out!

303
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,270
- Are you serious? 
 - Of course I am.

304
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,660
That girl pleaded to Sun Jae, "Let's stay together tonight..."

305
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,300
So, where did they run off to?

306
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,710
Where else would they go to spend the night other than a hotel? They probably went to his place.

307
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,370
His place?

308
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,430
Sun Jae's place?

309
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,640
Not there!

310
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,860
Why not?

311
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,290
So, I got a gift from a gaming company after I did an ad for them.

312
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,310
- And? 
 - This morning...

313
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:52,240
I left it at Sun Jae's place.

314
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,110
Gosh, my stomach...

315
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,750
Where is the bathroom?

316
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,490
Bathroom?

317
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,520
This way. Go.

318
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,750
Take your sweet time.

319
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,780
 Oh, right here. 

320
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,080
Why is this thing here?

321
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,760
Baek In Hyuk, dude!

322
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,990
Careful, careful, careful.

323
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,170
Gosh, what is all this at this hour? Seriously.

324
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,520
I'm hungry.

325
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,020
Let's go to Geum's place. Okay, Mom?

326
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,540
   

327
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,740
   

328
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,500
   

329
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,910
I bulldozed my way to his place.

330
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,310
I wanted to meet again as my best self.

331
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,380
I can't think about my image right now.

332
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,300
I can't leave Sun Jae alone tonight.

333
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,690
   

334
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,830
Hi, Mom.

335
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,950
 - Im Sol, where are you?  
 - I'm out. Why?

336
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,530
The pipes are broken.

337
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,580
I'm in a cab with Grandma going to Geum's.

338
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,910
 So come over there later. 

339
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,590
 I'm not coming home tonight. 

340
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,500
 I'm sleeping somewhere else. Don't worry. 

341
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,600
She's sleeping here?

342
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,010
 Where are you sleeping? 

343
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,620
 Do you have a man? 

344
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,440
If that's the case... your mother grants permission.

345
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,520
Yes, I'm with a man. Okay?

346
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,230
Anyway, I'm not going home, so don't look for me.

347
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,160
 Let's be together tonight! 

348
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,020
 You and me. Let's be together tonight. 

349
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,960
 She said it's not that kind of night! 

350
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,070
What?

351
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,970
 Okay. See you tomorrow. 

352
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,860
Hey. Are you done?

353
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,470
Yeah.

354
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,410
 How do I kill the time? 

355
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,440
 What is she doing? 

356
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,860
 Is she really planning to stay over? 

357
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,150
Wow, your place is so well decorated.

358
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,480
Can you give me a tour?

359
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,660
 I'm not coming home tonight. 

360
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,400
 I'm not coming home tonight. 

361
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,890
Please?

362
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,780
Yes, I can.

363
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,020
♫  I am your superhero, a problem solver  ♫

364
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,550
The TV is as tall as I am!

365
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,270
♫  I'm a super ultra man who moves people with my voice  ♫

366
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,530
Wow! This is ginormous!

367
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,230
Organizing your closet must take all night.

368
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,140
♫  Standing by you, I'm loud and proud  ♫

369
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,710
What?

370
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,990
What do you think?

371
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,700
You'll stay up all night looking at my clothes. Come out.

372
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,770
Come out.

373
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,110
♫  It feels like flying, Super Ultra man  ♫

374
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,260
Hey, how do I look?

375
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,780
This painting keeps pulling my attention.

376
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,240
How do I put this?

377
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,640
I feel like my soul has been captured.

378
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,650
They say people stare at famous paintings for hours on end.

379
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,060
I get why.

380
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,830
Want to take it home?

381
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,390
Huh?

382
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,200
I mean, well...

383
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,790
Wow, this view is incredible.

384
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:13,450
Oh! I see Namsan Tower over there! Are we facing south?

385
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,140
West.

386
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,580
Right.

387
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,310
Oh, my! What kind of plant is this?

388
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,500
I love the smell of phytoncide.

389
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,380
It's fake.

390
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,600
I see.

391
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,230
It looked so real. I got confused.

392
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,570
That one's real.

393
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,790
Are you hurt? Let me see.

394
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,810
 Are you hurt anywhere? Let me see you. 

395
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,910
I'm okay.

396
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,040
Thank you.

397
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,120
Let's finish the tour! Where haven't we been?

398
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,960
The bedroom.

399
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,820
Do I need to show you there, too?

400
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,320
Huh?

401
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,320
Oh, I mean, no.

402
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,960
Then we're done. Should we go?

403
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,980
Hey, Sun Jae.

404
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,770
Are you...

405
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,030
Are you hungry at all?

406
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:31,920
Can I have some ramen or something?

407
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,480
 I'm not coming home tonight. 

408
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,980
 I'm not coming home tonight. 

409
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,360
Can I?

410
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,580
- You can. 
 - He can't!

411
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,280
Not her. Not Im Sol. No!

412
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,370
Did something happen back then?

413
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,710
Something? Yes.

414
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,990
He saved her life, and she wasn't even thankful...

415
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,590
Anyway! He can't be with her.

416
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,270
What is wrong with Ryu Sun Jae?

417
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,290
It's been more than a decade, and he just falls for her like that?

418
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,010
He's not making her food like a pushover, is he?

419
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,340
 What are those pills? 

420
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,530
 They can't be antidepressants. Right? 

421
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,770
Are you interested in my medication?

422
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,730
What?

423
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,400
I was just wondering what they were.

424
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,810
Multivitamins.

425
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,070
Omega-3.

426
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,310
Lutein.

427
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,240
Supplements.

428
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,360
You're taking the right supplements.

429
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,420
That's good.

430
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,770
- You're not having any? 
 - How could I eat any?

431
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,320
What?

432
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,370
I'm on a diet!

433
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,670
Oh, right. I mean, you have to since you're a celebrity.

434
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:15,030
I don't need to diet, so I'll eat this.

435
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,140
 He's going to tell me to leave. 

436
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,890
 Wait. Why is it so quiet? 

437
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,400
 Why is he not reacting? 

438
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,270
Get up.

439
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,160
I know you're not asleep.

440
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,590
You should get up before it gets more embarrassing for you.

441
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,870
Wow, I dozed off for a second!

442
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:13,220
I would have slept all night if you hadn't woken me up.

443
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,090
Are you really going to stay over?

444
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,310
Who is that?

445
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,630
Excuse me. Can I help you?

446
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,110
W-Well, um...

447
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:45,970
You said this isn't "That kind of night," so that can't be it.

448
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,740
Or is it because of the movie?

449
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,450
Are you still trying to get me to sign the contract?

450
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,020
No. That's not it.

451
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,230
Fine. Tell me what it is, then.

452
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,280
- You... 
 - I?

453
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,550
I thought...

454
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,910
you might die tonight.

455
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,420
Die?

456
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,830
Yeah, that's right.

457
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,350
So I'd feel assured only if I stayed by you tonight.

458
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,540
I thought if I let you go alone, I might regret it.

459
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,000
That's why I chased you home.

460
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,390
 Yeah, a dream! I had a bad dream. 

461
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,110
 I dreamed that you got hurt in the arena. 

462
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,910
 It was so vivid that it felt real. 

463
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,120
 It felt like it was actually going to happen. 

464
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,090
 I was nervous and worried... 

465
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,520
Then and now.

466
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,460
I guess you dreamed that I died this time, huh?

467
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,100
 How can I explain this? 

468
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,030
 The day you left this world. 

469
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,890
 That horrible day. 

470
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,370
Why would I die?

471
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:06,320
What do you usually ponder that you even have a dream like that?

472
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,910
Celebrities talk about their mental struggles all the time in interviews.

473
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,960
Sometimes, that leads to them making bad choices.

474
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,020
There are a lot of rumors about you.

475
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,220
Ryu Sun Jae has depression, Ryu Sun Jae has panic disorder.

476
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,510
- Stuff like that... 
 - I don't have those things.

477
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,810
Depression, panic disorder...

478
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,870
Oh, yeah? Really?

479
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:31,520
Why believe rumors like that?

480
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,420
That's good, then.

481
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:45,970
But... why are you concerned about me anyway?

482
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,000
Why now?

483
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,550
I know.

484
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,680
Why now.

485
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:05,380
You must be tired. I'm sorry I kept you up.

486
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,960
I'll clean this up and go.

487
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,930
Don't go.

488
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,850
It might be too big, but just put it on.

489
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,340
You can change here.

490
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,020
Thanks.

491
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,050
No!

492
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,960
Hey! Are you dressed?

493
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,570
 Yeah, I am. 

494
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,760
If you are, get out.

495
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,400
Oh. Okay.

496
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,780
Wait, Sun Jae. I left...

497
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:10,340
You're into that?

498
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,410
No!

499
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,010
I understand.

500
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,570
Don't! It's not what you think!

501
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,560
Hey. No, I would never!

502
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,110
Let me explain!

503
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,000
The important thing is, it's not mine!

504
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,980
I didn't know this thing was here before I got home!

505
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,940
It's okay.

506
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,990
It makes sense that a single guy would have one of these.

507
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,420
I told you it's not mine!

508
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,510
Let's talk outside.

509
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,070
Let me see it!

510
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,300
What? Stop! It's not mine!

511
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,300
- Come on. 
 - Stop looking at it!

512
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,370
 Sun Jae! 

513
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,320
Stay here.

514
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,310
Sun Jae.

515
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,590
 Am I interrupting right now? 

516
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,950
Interrupting what?

517
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,050
 I think I saw you with a girl. 

518
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,150
What are you talking about?

519
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,550
It was this thing.

520
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:03,250
No. I saw her... and one more!

521
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,840
How many?

522
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,340
- Two! 
 - Wrong. One.

523
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,240
You're drunk and seeing things.

524
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,180
Really?

525
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,680
Wait, I heard you saw Im Sol earlier.

526
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,690
 Did you bring her home? 

527
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,990
No. We had tea, and then I left.

528
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,320
You're drunk. Go home.

529
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,360
Hey! You!

530
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,030
You're not...

531
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,910
You can't still be hung up on Im Sol...

532
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,160
No! I said no!

533
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,420
Go. Now.

534
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,980
No?

535
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:37,120
Then I'll take a shower while I'm here!

536
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,270
Why do you keep using my bathroom? Just go!

537
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,410
I already told you!

538
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:46,480
Your bathtub is my dream tub.

539
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,360
How much did you drink?

540
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,030
- What's wrong? 
 - Please, just go take a shower.

541
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,520
Can I take a bath?

542
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,480
Sure. Do whatever you want.

543
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,130
Yay!

544
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,600
Sorry. Let's go.

545
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,630
 Hey, Ryu Sun Jae! 

546
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,900
What now?

547
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,120
What's wrong?

548
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,620
What's this?

549
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,560
What is this!

550
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,840
Why is that over there?

551
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,670
Honestly, is Im Sol that pretty?

552
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,670
I really don't get it.

553
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,010
There are a million girls around you who are hotter than her.

554
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,010
Millions! Everywhere!

555
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,280
 That jerk! 

556
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,650
So why are you still hung up on her?

557
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,930
- It's not like that. 
 - Yes, it is!

558
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,480
Don't you remember what happens every time you drink?

559
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,110
   
   

560
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,030
 Im Sol! 

561
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,500
   
 Sun Jae! 

562
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,260
 I'm so sorry. 

563
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,350
 Hey, wake up! Come on! 

564
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,130
 - No. 
 - What do you mean no? 

565
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,400
 Let go! Sol! Sol! 

566
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,120
   

567
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,130
 Mom! 

568
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,400
 Seriously? 

569
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:18,690
 Are you a salmon? Did you come back here to spawn? 

570
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,110
 What is this, your natal instinct? 

571
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,280
 You've been getting drunk and coming to Im Sol's old house for ten years. 

572
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,630
 I'm not coming anymore! 

573
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,150
 Today's the last day. 

574
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,610
 I'll forget her. 

575
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,010
 Stand up. Stand up! 

576
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,170
 Just a little longer. 

577
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,630
 - Come on, man! 
 - A little longer! 

578
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,230
Am I still wrong?

579
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,800
You never got over your first love.

580
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,000
Now, you're over 30 and have never had a real relationship.

581
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,360
What?

582
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,240
Hey! Hey!

583
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,140
Put me down! Hey!

584
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,730
Hey, come on!

585
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,430
Hey!

586
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,410
Hey, dude!

587
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,810
Shut up and enjoy your bath.

588
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,550
Should I?

589
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,250
So warm.

590
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,320
So warm!

591
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,370
 How are you? Are you okay? 

592
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,740
 - You haven't been at school lately. 
 - Hey. 

593
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,260
 Thank you. 

594
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,830
 Thank you so much, but... 

595
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:15,640
 when I see you, I keep remembering what happened at that time. 

596
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,560
 I get scared. 

597
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,260
 That's why I can't see you anymore. 

598
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:39,320
That tree wasn't there anymore.

599
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,730
I went to grab it before.

600
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,070
I see.

601
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,390
So, at midnight on January 1st...

602
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,350
I went there.

603
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:59,580
That night, I went there.

604
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,050
Hey, Sun Jae.

605
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,190
Go ahead inside.

606
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,460
I went there that day, too!

607
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,550
To see you.

608
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,450
I was a little late.

609
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,980
I think we missed each other.

610
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,100
Right. We must have.

611
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,930
Also,

612
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:28,270
I... liked you, too.

613
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,390
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you at that time.

614
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,930
I'm sorry I hurt you.

615
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,100
I know it probably doesn't mean much now.

616
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,320
But still, I'm sorry.

617
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,300
But I had no other choice back then.

618
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,910
I really had no choice.

619
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,270
I was struggling and in pain.

620
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,490
If I ever saw you again,

621
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,000
I wanted to tell you...

622
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,180
that I liked you, too.

623
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,580
That I missed you.

624
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,760
I really, desperately wanted to see you, Sun Jae.

625
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,900
Just like this.

626
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,300
♫  If I could stop, even just for a moment  ♫

627
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,720
♫  I would embrace you right there and then  ♫

628
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,330
Someone might see you.

629
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:25,650
Thank you for the ride. Bye.

630
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:32,400
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

631
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:40,610
♫  I want to go back to our time together  ♫

632
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,840
♫  No matter what happens  ♫

633
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,020
 I liked you, too. 

634
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,170
 I really, desperately wanted to see you, too, Sun Jae. 

635
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,200
 Just like this. 

636
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,720
♫  Your name is painted deep in my heart  ♫

637
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:14,780
♫  You keep getting further away  ♫

638
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:23,180
♫  But at the end, please come back to me  ♫

639
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,860
So, you're saying... back then,

640
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,720
you felt the same way I did. Right?

641
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,760
You said you missed me.

642
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:50,300
So? What about now?

643
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:05,040
♫  It wasn't how I felt  ♫

644
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,660
♫  So I had to let it go  ♫

645
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:14,150
♫  I recollect that day, our night  ♫

646
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:22,590
♫  When I walk down the staircase of memories and call your name  ♫

647
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:28,720
♫  I can see a little clearer again  ♫

648
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:35,790
♫  Maybe I was waiting for this, inside scattered passage of time  ♫

649
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:44,300
♫  One moment, your scent came to me  ♫

650
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:50,390
♫  So you can't disappear, I won't go far away  ♫

651
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:55,360
♫  Don't let go of my hand  ♫

652
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:01,610
♫  This moment, everything  ♫

653
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:08,780
♫  I might embrace you  ♫

654
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,230
W-W-Who is it?

655
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,040
 It's security. 

656
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,780
 I heard your pipes broke last night. 

657
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,300
Oh, right.

658
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,450
I-I'm sorry, could you come back a little later?

659
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,100
 I can't. 

660
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,010
 This is the only time I can fix it. 

661
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,790
Why isn't she answering?

662
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,620
Hello!

663
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,380
It's cold out. Bye, Brother!

664
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,350
- Brother? 
 - Brother?

665
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:05,920
Yes!

666
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,460
You remember my brother? He just had his second baby.

667
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:09,970
What? Your older brother?

668
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,080
Yes.

669
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,010
I've known him for years.

670
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,900
He looks totally different.

671
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,710
He changed his entire face.

672
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,920
Plastic surgery!

673
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:23,770
Go on, Brother!

674
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,780
Bye! Go! Hurry!

675
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,730
Come on in.

676
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,420
- Brother out! 
 - Bye, Brother!

677
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,790
- I'm really leaving! 
 - Bye!

678
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:41,010
Gosh, it must be good to be young.

679
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:24,600
Oh, my. What a fancy car.

680
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,050
I've never seen that kind before.

681
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:48,020
Sorry, keep going.

682
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,370
Seriously...

683
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,360
What's with him?

684
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:01,360
Why are you laughing?

685
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:06,090
Is this situation funny to you?

686
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:08,620
What will you do about this movie?

687
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,350
   

688
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,960
   

689
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,570
He must be busy. Right?

690
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:32,130
   

691
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,220
Yeah, Mom.

692
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,970
 Can you go see Hyun Joo at postnatal care during lunch? 

693
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:38,450
 Your brother is about to get divorce papers. 

694
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:39,850
What do you mean?

695
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:42,580
 Geum took out their savings to invest in a friend's business, 

696
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,720
 and blew half of it. 

697
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,320
 Hyun Joo caught him and kicked him out of the house. 

698
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,100
What?

699
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:59,160
So, are you really going to divorce him?

700
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,900
Are you crazy?

701
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,710
Divorce is no joke.

702
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:08,090
He must have panicked about having another kid.

703
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,900
Adding a family member to a small place.

704
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,710
Single income and hard to save money.

705
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,390
He couldn't have known this would happen.

706
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:18,970
   

707
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,280
I'm jealous of you.

708
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,770
Gosh! I should have gone to interviews with you.

709
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,830
Then, we could have been classmates and colleagues.

710
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:33,290
It would have been nice.

711
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:37,760
Why was I in such a rush to get married?

712
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:46,020
If you could go back, would you still have married my brother?

713
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,200
If I hadn't married him, would my fate have changed?

714
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,630
Probably.

715
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:59,310
Right, let's say you changed fate.

716
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:02,330
But how do you know if that life is better?

717
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:04,470
Maybe that particular day, you're happier.

718
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,950
But what about tomorrow?

719
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:08,640
Who knows? All kinds of bad things could happen to you.

720
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,140
You never know what the future has in store.

721
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,840
You don't know until you get there.

722
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,160
My baby, did you pee?

723
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,370
Let me see you. Mommy's here.

724
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:30,620
Even if someone sent me back in time,

725
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,030
I would never gamble with my fate.

726
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:40,120
If I hadn't gotten married, I wouldn't have met my cute babies.

727
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:01,980
   

728
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,520
   

729
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:17,060
Hello?

730
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,320
 It's me. 

731
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,420
Yeah.

732
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,870
This morning was crazy.

733
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:23,870
Did you get to work okay?

734
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,110
Aren't you tired?

735
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:26,910
I'm okay.

736
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,420
You must be busy.

737
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,550
I have to work late today.

738
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,030
 I see. 

739
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:34,440
I didn't let you rest at all after the concert yesterday.

740
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,880
You must be exhausted.

741
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,550
No, not at all.

742
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:38,940
Liar.

743
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,150
Look at you, pretending like everything's fine again.

744
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,930
 You do that to everyone. Right? 

745
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,380
 If you're struggling, you have to say so. 

746
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,430
If you don't, no one will know.

747
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:50,030
♫  The one I've waited for  ♫

748
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,850
Hello?

749
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,860
 Why aren't you saying anything? 

750
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,680
♫  Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

751
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,640
Because...

752
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,590
I like this.

753
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:03,350
♫  Even when the day is tiresome  ♫

754
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:05,780
♫  All my life is you  ♫

755
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,450
By the way, that gift. The wind-up clock.

756
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:10,620
What does it mean?

757
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:19,730
I hoped that your time... would keep going without stopping.

758
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,330
That's weird.

759
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,370
 What is? 

760
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:25,940
Now that I hear you say that,

761
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:29,300
I feel like time was standing still until now,

762
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,820
and now it's passing like it should.

763
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,000
Really?

764
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,890
 Yeah. 

765
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,170
Can I see you tomorrow?

766
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,920
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

767
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,090
 No, can I see you tonight? 

768
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:42,050
When are you done?

769
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:44,550
I don't know.

770
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:46,940
 You'll be exhausted, then. 

771
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:50,280
No, I want to see you even if it's late.

772
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,730
I'll come to you. See you later.

773
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:54,800
Okay, see you later.

774
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,530
 Hyung! We're almost there. 

775
00:56:58,530 --> 00:56:59,640
Yup.

776
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,020
 Don't you have to go? 

777
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:04,960
Just a little longer.

778
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,370
Come on. You'll see me later.

779
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:11,770
Should we just meet up now?

780
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,180
- What? 
  - Just say "I miss you." 

781
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,320
I'll drop everything and come to you.

782
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,790
Go, go.

783
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,640
See you later.

784
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,420
How about the fish scales?

785
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,570
The mermaid's tail will be hard to generate because of the reflections.

786
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,200
So, we'll...

787
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:48,840
   

788
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,690
I'm so sorry.

789
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:54,200
- Let's focus. 
 - Yes.

790
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,250
So what did you do?

791
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:59,950
We used silver foil to create the fish scales...

792
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,540
 Over here! 

793
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:12,660
♫  I can't hide my feelings, can you hear it?  ♫

794
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:16,420
♫  I want to tell you how I feel  ♫

795
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,200
Good night!

796
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,100
♫  Didn't you feel it a little too?  ♫

797
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,370
♫  Beating toward you, my heart  ♫

798
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:30,200
♫  These are my true feelings  ♫

799
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,950
♫  I hope you know, my love  ♫

800
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:35,150
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

801
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:38,600
Her phone is still off. Did something happen?

802
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,410
Her battery must be dead.

803
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:43,360
Keep your eyes on the road.

804
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,670
That startled me!

805
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,700
How do they even get in here?

806
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,080
The security should be top-notch!

807
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,820
- Is she here again? 
 - Yes.

808
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:00,830
She tried to break in when In Hyuk was asleep this morning.

809
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:04,050
Did she not leave or what?

810
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,690
I'm pissed.

811
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:07,260
Don't be pissed.

812
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,440
Call the police and let's go to the hotel.

813
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,310
I want to change and go see Sol.

814
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,640
Oh, right.

815
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,660
I left my car at Sun Jae's.

816
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,840
He must not be home yet, right?

817
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,960
Oh, no. My phone was off this whole time?

818
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,290
   

819
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,220
   

820
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,770
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

821
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,590
He must not be done yet.

822
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:26,650
Where did I park my car?

823
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:30,020
I found it!

824
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,720
   

825
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,780
   

826
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,900
I didn't hit her.

827
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,070
She fell over on her own.

828
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,950
Hey! Are you okay?

829
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,740
Stop right there!

830
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:00,770
That stalker! The bain of my existence.

831
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,210
Stalker?

832
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:03,900
Yes.

833
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,810
   

834
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:22,270
- What's up? 
  - Hyung, which room are you in? 

835
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:24,330
2510...

836
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,340
Why did you ask if you knew?

837
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,370
 What do you mean? 

838
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,050
Isn't that you?

839
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:56,410
- I got you! 
 - Let go!

840
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:19,060
When did you run away from home?

841
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,510
A month.

842
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:23,310
How old are you? Fifteen? Sixteen?

843
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:25,260
Fourteen.

844
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,160
I'm in seventh grade.

845
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:31,940
No matter how young you are, this is a crime. You know that?

846
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,530
It's because I like him so much.

847
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,470
That doesn't make it okay.

848
01:03:35,470 --> 01:03:38,950
You're bothering the person you like, torturing him.

849
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,550
If you like him, how can you be like that?

850
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:50,330
Eat slowly. I'll get you some water.

851
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:55,250
- Oh, my, my. What in the world! 
  - Breaking news. Singer and actor Ryu Sun Jae 

852
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:59,970
 was attacked by an unidentified man in a hotel in Seoul. 

853
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:02,750
 The police are now looking for the suspect, who fled the scene. 

854
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:04,410
 Let's hear from Reporter Kim Eun Joo. 

855
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:06,900
 The scene of the crime is a 5-star hotel, 

856
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,160
 where it is not easy to get through security. 

857
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:13,410
 Ryu was found bleeding heavily and transported to the hospital. 

858
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:16,080
 We hear that he is going into emergency surgery. 

859
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,180
 Fingerprints on the weapon found on the scene indicate that 

860
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:22,930
 the suspect is a convicted murderer from 2009 who was released from jail a few days ago. 

861
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,430
 A male in his 40s, Kim. 

862
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:27,990
 The police believe there is a possibility of another crime 

863
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:31,630
 and have decided to publicly release his identity. 

864
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,550
 But why? 

865
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:38,570
 Why Sun Jae? 

866
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:10,610


867
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:14,850
♫  It wasn't how I felt  ♫

868
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:18,500
♫  So I had to let it go  ♫
