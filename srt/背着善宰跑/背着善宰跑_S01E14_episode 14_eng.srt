1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,500
   

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,560
   

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,190
   

4
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,390
   

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,040
 Sun Jae! 

6
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,170
 Sun Jae! 

7
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,630
 Sun Jae! 

8
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:58,080


9
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,020
 No way... 

10
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:14,150
 Sun Jae, maybe we should have never met from the start. 

11
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,500
 No, we should have never met. 

12
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,420
 Hey, Im Sol! 

13
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,650
Wake up!

14
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,370
34-1.

15
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,040
   

16
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,130
I think they delivered it wrong.

17
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,000
   

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,180
♫  I fall asleep missing you tonight  ♫

19
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,510
♫  Your low and deep voice  ♫

20
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:45,280
♫  The traces of you that I can't forget  ♫

21
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,750
♫  If I could stop, even just for a moment  ♫

22
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,690
♫  I would embrace you right there and then 

23
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,730
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

24
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:14,910
♫  I want to go back to our time together  ♫

25
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:22,160
♫  No matter what happens, I will remember you  ♫

26
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:31,070
♫  Your name is painted deep in my heart  ♫

27
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,360
♫  You're getting far away, out of reach  ♫

28
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,710
♫  At the end, please come back to me  ♫

29
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,930
 Sun Jae, listen to me. I can really see ghosts. 

30
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,640
 You really have to be careful around water! 

31
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,350
 I don't need to be consoled. 

32
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,580
 Did I ask you to take care of me? 

33
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,670
 Honestly, when I look at you, I feel like you can see through my despair. 

34
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,280
 It's embarrassing and uncomfortable. 

35
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,200
 - Here. 
 - This isn't worth singing in front of all those people! 

36
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,480
 Why are you worried needlessly about me? 

37
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,230
 Why? Am I not allowed to worry about you? 

38
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,160
 No, don't. 

39
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,490
 Let me ask you one last thing. 

40
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,930
 In all the times you've lived, did you ever like me? 

41
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,570
 No. Never. 

42
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,590
 Sol, stop running away from me. You can just like me. 

43
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,890
 If I die saving you, I'm okay with it. 

44
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,210
 I don't care. 

45
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,680
Im Sol, what are you doing? Get in the car.

46
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,410
Okay.

47
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,950
♫  Please come to me again  ♫

48
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,640
♫  I will hold your hand tightly  ♫

49
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,540
♫  Like fate  ♫

50
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,030
I guess they are moving.

51
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:11,270
♫  You can just embrace me like nothing happened  ♫

52
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:18,510
    
 ♫  No matter what happens, I will remember you  ♫

53
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:27,300
♫  Your name is painted deep in my heart  ♫

54
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,120
Here is the winning title.

55
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,920
   

56
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,450
Don't open it ahead of time.

57
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,420
Got it.

58
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,080
What a beautiful night!

59
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,290
 Sun Jae? 

60
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,530
Who are you?

61
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,680
I saw everything.

62
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,800
You stole that.

63
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,670
Are you a thief?

64
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,850
Oh, no, no.

65
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,600
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,750
Where are you running off to?

67
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,690
Want me to call the cops?

68
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,580
Why are you crying?

69
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,920
I didn't make you cry, did I?

70
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,570
 Why are you crying? 

71
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,870
 I didn't make you cry, did I? 

72
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,720
You think I'll go easy on you if you cry?

73
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,900
Ryu Sun Jae, you're here!

74
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,670
Please go to the waiting room now.

75
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,410
Please give this to CEO Lee of Bon Cinema.

76
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,310
Also, the security here is very inadequate.

77
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,700
- I saw a petty thief go around. 
 - A petty thief?

78
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,430
I avoided him like the plague. How did we somehow meet again?

79
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,610
I didn't hear that Sun Jae was coming to the film festival.

80
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,360
Why is he here?

81
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,840
Is he here to present an award?

82
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,200
She's...

83
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,840
 I'm honored to participate in the White Dragon Film Festival again since last year. 

84
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,060
- I'm home. 
  - This year was especially... 

85
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,600
Hey, you're home. Have you had dinner?

86
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,100
I'm not hungry.

87
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,240
 First, these films lit up the screen this year. 

88
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,380
- Did you retrieve your resignation letter? 
 - Yeah.

89
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,180
 Here are the best picture nominees. 

90
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,690
Why did I ever write this thing?

91
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,780
 A Survival Story in Seoul 

92
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,580
 In Search of Utopia 

93
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,450
 To Study Good and Evil in the Human Nature... 

94
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,450
 Among these outstanding nominations, which film will win? 

95
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,810
 I can't wait to see, either. I'm holding the result here. 

96
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,820
 - The 45th White Dragon Film Festival.   
 - Oh, no, no...

97
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,870
 The award for Best Picture goes to... 

98
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,760
What do I do!!!

99
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,090
"Get it Done; Do it Right; Make it Work!" Congratulations!

100
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,440
Wow, this is crazy.

101
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,040
- Won't you turn that off? 
 - Just one more time.

102
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,890
There's an article about it already.

103
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,990
"The highlight of the festival, Ryu Sun Jae, left the crowd in disarray."

104
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,130
They even rhymed it!

105
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,980
"He muddied the occasion" vs. "It was a hilarious accident."

106
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,500
"Netizens are debating."

107
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,160
"Do it Right, Get it Done, Make it Work wins Best Picture?"

108
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,740
"Is Ryu Sun Jae's brain not right, not working?"

109
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,110
- Will you read that all night? 
 - Hey, Hyung.

110
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,380
You can tell this looks wrong right away. How can you make a mistake like that?

111
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,530
Let me see.

112
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,100
You think I'd notice that while I'm on live television?

113
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,730
Who cares if someone stole CEO Lee's bag?

114
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,910
Why butt in and cause all this chaos?

115
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,830
How can I see something unjust and sit back?

116
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,120
Congratulations on being a man who won't sit back.

117
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,560
- Seriously! 
 - Wow...

118
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,050
Someone obviously wrote this drunk.

119
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,530
Sounds like a terrible workplace, though.

120
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,170
No wonder she quit!

121
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,880
Give it back. Whose side are you two on anyway?

122
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,660
I became a national embarrassment because of a weird woman.

123
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,600
Are you going to sue her or something?

124
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,580
Don't do it, Hyung.

125
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,210
She's just a sad office worker.

126
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:42,680
Besides, everyone has a version of this letter inside their hearts.

127
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,050
Give it now. I'll get it. I said I'll get it for you.

128
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,550
Hyung!

129
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,960
Should we release this resignation letter to the press and explain?

130
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,870
Forget it. People will lose interest in a day or two. It'll die down.

131
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,170
That's right, go easy on her.

132
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,310
- Who said I'd go easy on her? 
 - Then what?

133
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,810
She will have to pray that she will never run into me ever again.

134
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,140
So scary.

135
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,070
He's scary.

136
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,070
It's the white puffer girl again.

137
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,450
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,120
The investors want to decide once they see who we will replace Park Do Jun with.

139
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,440
But everyone in the industry knows he'd be replacing Park Do Jun.

140
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,170
 I'm sorry, Sun Jae. 

141
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,000
 - Why am I alive? I should just go die.  
 - Wouldn't it be tough?

142
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,350
 - Hello, Bo Ah's mom.  
 - Who'd want to step in for Park Do Jun?

143
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,320
 Bo Ah threw up, and I can't get in touch with her dad. 

144
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,780
 Im Geum, where is he, doing what? 

145
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,020
Any ideas on who?

146
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,760
Oh, well...

147
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,220
I mean...

148
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,680
How about Ryu Sun Jae?

149
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,920
 Sun Jae? It can't be Sun Jae. 

150
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,000
Ryu Sun Jae?

151
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,990
You think Ryu Sun Jae wants to be Park Do Jun's replacement?

152
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,570
It might still be worth sending him the script.

153
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,450
When he passed on our offer for "Hero" last time,

154
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,670
he said, "I hope we can work together next time."

155
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,980
I'm sure he just said that to be polite.

156
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,130
But if Ryu Sun Jae wants to do it, the investors will love it!

157
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,800
Yes.

158
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,570
Then send Ryu Sun Jae the "Shall We Kiss?" script right now.

159
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,680
Okay? I'll get in touch separately.

160
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,160
Hey, Producer Im, did you edit your pitch?

161
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,230
Producer Im!

162
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,820
What?

163
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,160
Oh. Yes. I uploaded it on the team mail.

164
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,710
I'll read it.

165
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,300
Okay.

166
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,820
- Okay! 
  - There's no way... 

167
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,620
 he'd say yes. Right? 

168
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,230
 - Thank you! 
 - Good work! 

169
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,420
   

170
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,240
Hello, Teacher.

171
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,210
I am so sorry.

172
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,900
I'm at work right now. I'll tell my husband to go right away. 
    

173
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,670
Yes, I'm so sorry.

174
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,630
Goodbye.

175
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,290
   

176
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,300
I don't think this was the title. 
    

177
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,270
 The story of a man whose life tragically ended 

178
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,630
 and a woman who went back 15 years into the past to save him. 

179
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,220
 A fantasy romance following them as they meet again in time 

180
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,730
 and fall in love traveling back and forth between the past and the present. 

181
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,380
 When I knew I would never walk again, 

182
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:26,430
 I prayed every night that the morning would never come. 

183
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:32,670
 That morning, the sunlight pouring through the hospital windows felt desperately sad. 

184
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,550
 Then, a man told me, through a random call on a radio show. 

185
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,400
 Stay alive today. 

186
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,780
 Because it's too nice outside. 

187
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,100
 I hear it's going to rain tomorrow. 

188
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,280
 Then wait until the rain stops, and stay alive again. 

189
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,610
 Then, someday, a day might come when living doesn't seem so bad. 

190
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,860
 In the middle of the Han River bridge, 

191
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,290
 I was shivering in the cold in the endless snow. 

192
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:09,670
 He marched toward me and put an umbrella over my head. 

193
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,970
 Sometimes you know the consequences but make the same choice anyway. 

194
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,330
 You can't help it because of your feelings for her. 

195
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,480
 I love you. 

196
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,320
 The man falls off the edge of the cliff. 

197
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,550
 He dies once more while saving her. 

198
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,640
 In 2009, the past. 

199
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,440
 Maybe we should never have met from the start. 

200
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,590
 No. We should have never met. 

201
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,700
 As she realizes that meeting her is what leads to his death, 

202
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,130
 she's determined to never cross paths with him... 

203
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,690
 by erasing herself from his life. 

204
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:08,090
 Having lost all memories of her, he lives his life in this world. 

205
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,670
 As she watches his brilliant life from afar, she thinks... 

206
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,600
 This is right. 

207
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,710
 We should have never met from the start. 

208
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,480
 A song that only exists in her memories... 

209
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,330
 "Rain Shower" softly plays. 

210
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,000
   

211
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,350
What is this?

212
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,030
Hyung! They sent that as a mistake.

213
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,250
They sent this one instead...

214
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,630
- Hyung. 
 - Dong Seok.

215
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,180
What?

216
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,620
Am I... crying right now?

217
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,850
I think so.

218
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,970
These are tears, right?

219
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,750
The water's coming out of your eyes, so it's not snot.

220
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,340
I can't stop crying.

221
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,510
Dong Seok.

222
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,160
You're treating me to lunch somewhere this expensive?

223
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,650
Is this a special occasion?

224
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,700
And is someone else coming?

225
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,780
So, instead of "Shall We Kiss?" we accidentally sent him your pitch.

226
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,880
What?

227
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,010
So?

228
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,360
Ryu Sun Jae read your pitch and is interested!

229
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,190
What?

230
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,910
What? It's her?

231
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,100
Do you know her or something?

232
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,560
"Do it right, get it done, make it work!"

233
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,200
She's the one who wrote the resignation letter!

234
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,620
Really? Wow.

235
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,290
- Go in. 
 - Tell them I'm not doing it.

236
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,700
- Wait! Just like that? 
 - Yes, just like that; I don't want to do it.

237
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,980
Hyung, even if you are angry, don't bring your personal feelings into this.

238
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,000
It's not about my personal feelings.

239
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,880
This pitch doesn't have mainstream appeal. I don't like it.

240
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,310
Wait.

241
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,090
No.

242
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,180
I'll turn it down myself.

243
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,280
She has to pay for humiliating me, right?

244
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,520
Gosh, welcome, Sun Jae!

245
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,290
 - No.  
 - Gosh, it's been a while.

246
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,220
 We can't meet like this. 

247
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,070
Have a seat.

248
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,160
Over here.

249
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,020
Nice to meet you.

250
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,470
Actually, no, we've met.

251
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,610
Oh, my, you've met already?

252
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,790
Where?

253
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,850
Maybe not.

254
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,810
I think I got it wrong.

255
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:59,110
So, Mr. Ryu, you must have really loved the pitch.

256
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:02,830
You even brought these flowers.

257
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,100
Actually, I think the wrong message went through.

258
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,990
- I'm here to turn it down— 
 - I'm sorry.

259
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,100
Ryu Sun Jae, I don't want you to star in this movie.

260
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,610
What?

261
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,520
- I'm sorry! 
 - Why are you joking...

262
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,520
- Sun Jae, sorry to scare you! 
 - I'm not joking.

263
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,110
You're far from what I imagine the main character to be.

264
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,700
The pitch wasn't meant to go to you in the first place.

265
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,290
Please just forget about this project.

266
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,220
Are you... rejecting me right now?

267
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,420
Yes. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

268
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,660
Are you out of your mind?

269
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,190
You didn't hurt my feelings at all.

270
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,970
I came here to turn it down anyway.

271
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,380
I got flowers so your feelings won't get hurt after I turn it down.

272
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,350
Thank goodness we're on the same page.

273
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,070
Also, if you ever see another pitch with my name on it,

274
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,060
please just filter it out.

275
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,020
Are you saying you never want to work with me?

276
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,570
If that's what you think, and I hurt your feelings,

277
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,190
that's even better.

278
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:35,660
I'm sure you never want to associate with me again.

279
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,180
I'll be off, then.

280
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,550
I have work to do.

281
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,750
Oh, my, w-what's with her...

282
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,680
I'm sorry. Give me a minute.

283
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,860
Sun Jae, just give me a minute, please.

284
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,470
Just wait one minute. Sol...

285
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,700
 Sol! Sol! Sol! Im Sol! 

286
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,540
What? What?

287
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,140
I think she rejected you.

288
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,480
Let's go.

289
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,380
 His ego must be bruised. 

290
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,380
 He must have been really offended. 

291
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,040
 But... 
   

292
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,700
 I did the right thing. This is right. 

293
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,820
 I'll never see him again anyway. 

294
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,910
Hyung, you haven't been rejected to your face since your debut. Right?

295
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,590
No, even back then, no one trampled all over you like this.

296
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,040
Maybe this is an opportunity to rethink things a bit.

297
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,920
You might be stuck in a rut without knowing.

298
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,600
What? In a rut?

299
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,790
I mean, you kind of deserved to be rejected.

300
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,800
That company is romance-focused. I've been watching you for years.

301
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,240
Despite your looks, your love life kind of sucks.

302
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,120
It's not your forte.

303
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,030
N-Not my forte? What do you mean?

304
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,970
What do you know about my love life?

305
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,030
- Pay attention to driving! 
 - Oh, right.

306
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,430
So, will you let her reject you like this?

307
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,570
Who's rejecting whom? In my mind...

308
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,430
I rejected her first.

309
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,440
I think she rejected you a million years ago.

310
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,430
- What? 
 - The pitch.

311
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,060
It seemed to hit home with you.

312
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,460
If you don't want to miss out, go and try to convince her.

313
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,620
Convince her? No thanks.

314
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,200
Is that the only project I can do?

315
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,220
Why do I need to crawl back to someone who passed on me?

316
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,310
Can we talk for a second?

317
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,540
I have nothing to say to you.

318
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,660
I think you do.

319
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,800
If it's about the movie, I already told you.

320
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,580
You can talk to my CEO.

321
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,490
"Do it right, get it done, make it work."

322
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,270
You said that was the type of employee I am.

323
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,360
If I'm that kind of employee, how can you treat me like this?

324
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,300
Seriously, I'm getting the ick."

325
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,840
What does "getting the ick" mean?

326
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,900
Oh, no! My resignation letter!

327
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,300
You really want me to talk to CEO Lee?

328
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,030
 Cover your face when you leave just to be safe. 

329
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,540
 I'll call you. 

330
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,100
 Of all places, why here? 

331
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,060
You're going home quite late.

332
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,360
Do you really do it right, get it done, and make it work?

333
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,530
Get to the point. I'm busy.

334
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,150
I want to know why you're so against me.

335
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,660
You waited for me to get out of work for that?

336
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,380
You think I waited for you to have a cup of tea at a bar?

337
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,660
What relationship do you think we have?

338
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:06,360
Is this because I thought you were a thief at the ceremony?

339
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,080
That's not fair.

340
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,190
You're the reason I had an incident on live TV.

341
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,450
The envelope switch was a mistake.

342
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,640
I'm sorry.

343
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,530
I accept your apology.

344
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,350
I'm sorry I mistook you for a thief.

345
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,160
Sure. Well...

346
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,890
Good, then.

347
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,540
Now, you have no reason to be against me.

348
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,950
That's not true.

349
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,350
That was that. I have plenty of reasons to be against you.

350
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,980
Let's hear them.

351
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,700
As I said, you don't fit the image of the main character I thought of.

352
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,810
If not me, who were you thinking of?

353
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,400
What?

354
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,170
Well, that is...

355
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,000
well...

356
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,210
S-S-Sung Jae Kyung.

357
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,870
Who? Sung Jae Kyung?

358
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,160
You're just pulling that out of thin air.

359
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,330
He's almost 50. He can't do a youth romance.

360
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,720
W-What's wrong with being 50? Who says he can't?

361
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,820
He has to play a high school student 15 years ago in the past.

362
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,390
Isn't your company producing it?

363
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,310
CGI is very advanced these days!

364
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,420
Besides, Sung Jae Kyung still looks really young!

365
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,920
If we airbrush his wrinkles, he could even play a middle schooler.

366
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,460
Fine. Let's say he can.

367
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,330
And what else?

368
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,780
To be honest with you,

369
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:46,270
I would prefer an actor who's better at the romance genre.

370
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,390
What else?

371
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,610
I'm looking for a fresh face.

372
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,040
- I'm an old face? 
 - You're not all that fresh, I guess.

373
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,750
Are you grocery shopping? Are you picking out fish?

374
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,610
- Fresh? 
 - And most crucially!

375
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,000
The heavens are against it. They say "never" to Ryu Sun Jae.

376
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,440
- Who? 
 - The Heavenly Granny!

377
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,900
She's pretty accurate.

378
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,810
My natal chart says if I associate with a man born in the Year of the Horse, three generations will be doomed.

379
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,280
And the family of the man, too.

380
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,720
You were born in the Year of the Horse!

381
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,610
Year of the Horse?

382
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,920
Looking at compatibility? Are we getting married?

383
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,860
Compatibility is important to this business!

384
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,650
Im Sol, do you believe in fate, that kind of thing?

385
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,010
Yes, I do.

386
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:43,220
I'm not doing anything fate doesn't want me to do.

387
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,460
I trust you've understood plenty. I'm leaving.

388
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:54,330
♫  The clear picture of myself is fading  ♫

389
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,050
Unbelievable. I'm going to lose my mind.

390
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:02,300
♫  The dreams that filled countless nights  ♫

391
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,330
 Im Sol, do you believe in fate, that kind of thing? 

392
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,530
 Yes, I do. 

393
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,900
 I'm not doing anything fate doesn't want me to do. 

394
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:25,700
♫  I was swaying and flowed down to somewhere while I cried  ♫

395
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:38,820
♫  My sighs are collecting, and I couldn't see the happy days  ♫

396
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:44,650
♫  I'll get them back, I won't let them get away  ♫

397
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:50,400
♫  I'll hold onto them, never let them go  ♫

398
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,800
♫  Even when the night is gone  ♫

399
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,950
What kind of dream was that?

400
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,440
- That girl must really hate you. 
 - What?

401
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,170
Unless she truly hates you as a person, she wouldn't reject you like that.

402
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,920
Why would she hate me? She's never met me.

403
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,150
Why does she have to like you? She's never met you.

404
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:16,520
Buddy, stop assuming everyone in the world likes you.

405
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,010
Anyone has the right to dislike us.

406
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,300
Geez. Seriously.

407
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,240
The Year of the Horse thing is a little ridiculous.

408
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,510
Sung Jae Kyung was born in the Year of the Horse, too.

409
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,940
What? He's a horse, too?

410
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,910
Yeah. He was born in 1978.

411
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,320
Wow, I thought that was a crazy excuse.

412
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,840
This is how she's going to play it?

413
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,350
   

414
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,570
   

415
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,620
   

416
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,640
Hello?

417
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,930
 It's Ryu Sun Jae. Can we— 

418
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,080
Why is he calling me?

419
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,070
- What was that? 
 - What else? She hung up on you.

420
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,280
Wow, she hung up on you hearing your name.

421
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,530
She's really icing you out.

422
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,150
Dong Seok!

423
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,580
You call her.

424
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,330
You want to invest in the film?

425
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,800
You must have more money than you can spend.

426
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,050
Yes, I think so.

427
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,330
 No thank you. 

428
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,140
 We can make the movie on our own. 

429
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,650
 It's not a blockbuster or anything. 

430
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,010
She says no thank you.

431
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,540
Say they can cut my fee in half.

432
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,120
- His fee— 
 - Wait.

433
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,240
Tell her I'll do it for free.

434
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,780
 He'll do it for free. 

435
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,330
Again, no, thank you.

436
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,850
 Please tell him that puts us in an uncomfortable position. 

437
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,600
I did.

438
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,800
I'll cancel my vacation and clear my entire calendar.

439
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,000
I'll devote myself to the movie. Tell her!

440
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Enjoy your vacation. Please tell him he can devote himself to the rest of his calendar.

441
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,240
- Can we talk in person? 
  - Goodness, I have a meeting. Bye. 

442
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,740
She hung up.

443
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,160
- Hyung. 
 - Why?

444
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,260
Why does she hate me so much?

445
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,980
Maybe because you were born in the Year of the Horse?

446
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,600
That's not it. Don't ever say "horse" in front of me ever again.

447
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,110
Hyung, just give up before things get uglier.

448
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,510
Sometimes, you get rejected.

449
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:45,250
Why are you insisting on humiliating yourself?

450
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,500
You must have your reasons.

451
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,880
Your makeup looks great today.

452
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,890
Hey! Stop right there!

453
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,630
Hey!

454
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,450
Hey!

455
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,680
When did you sneak in here again?

456
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,070
Let's go. Careful.

457
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,460
Mom, stay right here.

458
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,360
Stay right here. I'll be right back after I throw this out.

459
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,130
Yes, ma'am!

460
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,810
Mal Ja!

461
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,050
Mal Ja!

462
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,360
I'm going home.

463
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,040
Get home safe.

464
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,360
   

465
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,540
Yeah, Mom.

466
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,130
 Sol! Grandma disappeared in the blink of an eye. 

467
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,290
 What do I do? 

468
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,110
Hey. Come.

469
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,660
- Grandma! 
 - Grandma!

470
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,110
Grandma!

471
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:29,950
- Grandma! 
 - Grandma!

472
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,280
Grandma!

473
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:41,060
Boss, the old lady by herself at table 5.

474
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,120
She's eaten five orders by herself. It's weird.

475
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,050
I think her mind isn't fully there.

476
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,520
Okay, let me go see.

477
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,810
Watch the counter.

478
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:58,440
Ma'am, how is everything?

479
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,070
I've only had a bite. How would I know?

480
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:04,030
Let me judge after I've eaten some more.

481
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,810
Oh, sure, of course.

482
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:11,070
Gosh, you've eaten five orders by yourself.

483
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,520
Do you need anything else?

484
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,500
Oh, I... Gosh, thank you.

485
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,280
Blue door?

486
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,080
What?

487
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,130
That's right! You're the guy across the street.

488
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,730
I'm from Gold Video &amp; DVD.

489
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,280
Don't you remember me?

490
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,610
Gosh! The grandma across the street!

491
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,370
Gosh, what a coincidence!

492
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,680
How have you been?

493
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:48,320
My goodness, your son turned out so well.

494
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,890
I don't like bragging about my child.

495
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,020
But my son is just famous enough that

496
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:05,260
1, no, 11 out of 10 people in Korea know who he is.

497
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,670
He's just as popular as Na Hoon Ah in his heyday.

498
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,510
No, he has a long way to go until he can catch up to Na Hoon Ah.

499
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,160
But there were 50,000 people at his last concert.

500
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,350
That's like a neighborhood kid's birthday party.

501
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,730
Grandma, we haven't seen each other in years. Let's do cheers.

502
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,990
May you live long and healthy! Cheers!

503
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,690
Gosh, stop, stop.

504
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,060
Wow, speaking of the devil!

505
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,410
My son is here!

506
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,610
Son! Come on!

507
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,930
Dad, how much did you drink?

508
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,720
Hey, I'm not drunk.

509
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,270
Also, I still have the side dishes you gave me last time.

510
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,920
I don't want to take more home.

511
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,330
Stop it, brat.

512
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,310
Hey! Say hello.

513
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,900
Remember the video place across the street when you were young?

514
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,070
She's the grandma of that family. Say hi.

515
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,220
- Hello. 
 - My son.

516
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,500
Husband! 
  (Sounds like "stand up") 

517
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,890
Stand, stand. Stand up straight.

518
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,220
My man, where have you been all night?

519
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,370
You were gambling again, weren't you?

520
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,890
Grandma, let go of him.

521
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,240
You reek of women's makeup.

522
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,920
Maybe you weren't at the gambling house. You were at the coffee shop.

523
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,420
Which bitch were you with? Was it that Kkot Bun girl?

524
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,200
Was it Cho In? Which bitch were you with?

525
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,790
- Grandma... 
 - Gosh, falling for this smooth face,

526
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:45,680
I'm the fool for marrying you at 18.

527
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,520
Sun Jae.

528
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,890
She must have dementia.

529
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,740
Grandma. Grandma.

530
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,830
Hold on, maybe she took the bus.

531
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,530
Wait.

532
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,350
That's it. The 27 bus.

533
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:16,480
Check the CCTV along the bus line and see where she got off.

534
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,580
Hey, Mom.

535
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,280
I'm watching the CCTV footage with Tae Sung.

536
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,390
 Sol, we found Grandma. 

537
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,500
What? You found her?

538
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,710
Where?

539
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,670
 Someone read her ID tag. 

540
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,370
 She was eating at a restaurant. 

541
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:38,730
 The owner is going to bring her home. Come home now. 

542
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,100
Thank goodness.

543
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,830
Sol.

544
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,340
Thank you for today. I know you're busy.

545
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,160
I have time to take you home.

546
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,190
And try to drive your car.

547
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,570
It's dangerous out there.

548
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,740
- Did something happen? 
 - Attempted kidnapping of a woman.

549
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,340
There's no evidence, so we haven't narrowed down a suspect.

550
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,010
So, when the sun goes down, go home right away. Okay?

551
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,970
If you're working late, call me.

552
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,990
If I have time, I'll pick you up.

553
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,750
No thanks. Save that for your girlfriend.

554
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,650
I thought you were my girlfriend.

555
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,080
Why am I your girlfriend?

556
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,280
Are you a boy, then? You're a girl.

557
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,660
I'm a friend to you. Not a girl.

558
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,120
Yes, Chief. Right now?

559
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,850
Go, go.

560
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,910
I'll be right there.

561
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,880
Get home safe. Let me know how your grandma's doing.

562
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,810
- You, too. 
 - Bye.

563
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,660
Bye!

564
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,430
That must be your boyfriend.

565
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:07,210
How did you know...

566
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,900
- What a sweet boyfriend. 
 - He's not!

567
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,810
Also, if you show up at my house like this,

568
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,830
I feel a little taken aback.

569
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,520
Oh, really?

570
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,820
What are you doing?

571
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,440
I'm not getting in that car.

572
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,590
I have nothing more to say to you.

573
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,400
So, please go.

574
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,640
You're really letting me go?

575
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,030
- You won't regret it? 
 - Of course not.

576
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,630
I already said no.

577
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,340
We don't ever need to see each other again.

578
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,870
I'm not getting in!

579
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,780
Why? Are you going to threaten me with my resignation letter again?

580
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,960
Is this funny to you?

581
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,850
Yes. It is.

582
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,450
Are you having fun toying with someone's livelihood?

583
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,880
Why don't you just tell the CEO everything?

584
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,240
You keep coming to find me. I can't take this anymore.

585
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,870
I might as well get fired!

586
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,480
 His whole personality is different. 

587
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,490
Let me go! I'm not a doormat!

588
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:16,660
I don't care how much you beg and plead. It won't work!

589
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,840
Unni! Where are you going?

590
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,480
I thought the owner of the restaurant was driving you home...

591
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,540
My dad has a restaurant.

592
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,770
That must have surprised you.

593
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,610
I hadn't visited my dad in a while.

594
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,140
This surprised me quite a bit.

595
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,450
   
   
   
   

596
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,600
Gosh, you're here!

597
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,560
I should have gone over there.

598
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,660
Thank you so much for bringing her home.

599
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,790
I should thank you before you leave. Would you like to come up?

600
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,720
That's all right. Have a good night.

601
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,990
Unni, I need to pee.

602
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,470
Okay, okay.

603
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,230
It wouldn't be polite to just let you go.

604
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,220
My bladder is going to explode.

605
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,710
Okay, Mom, just hold on a second, Miss Mal Ja.

606
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,910
Sol, get him a warm cup of tea before he leaves. Okay?

607
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,260
We'll go upstairs, then. Thank you so much.

608
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,650
Thank you!

609
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,430
Let's go. Let's go, Miss Mal Ja. Let's go.

610
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,870
 - I'm going to explode! 
 - No, no. Hold it, hold it. 

611
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,410
Take it.

612
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,280
I misunderstood.

613
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,120
Thank you for bringing my grandma home.

614
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,090
Don't you need to get me a cup of tea?

615
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,840
Here's the tea.

616
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,530
Is this how you thank someone?

617
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,100
Nothing around here is open this late.

618
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,010
If we sit out like this and rumors start about us dating,

619
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,170
will you be responsible for it?

620
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,900
- No one's around. 
 - We have to be careful.

621
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,650
I don't want a scandal.

622
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,980
Romance is my specialty as an actor.

623
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,490
Since when?

624
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,040
   
 (It means "sweet") 

625
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,560
- What about it? 
 - All right.

626
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,690
Look into my eyes.

627
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,020
I hear that I have the "eyes for romance" a lot.

628
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,720
What?

629
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,890
Huh?

630
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,650
Good timing. 
    

631
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,540
You saw that, right? Advertisers approved. I. Am. A. Fresh. Face.

632
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,670
Are you trying to convince me to cast you in my film?

633
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,320
No, not at all.

634
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,530
I'm just spitting facts.

635
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:41,580
I'm still fresh, and I can do romance.

636
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,720
If you let me go, it's your loss.

637
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,650
Oh, really?

638
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,000
Darn, they recognized me.

639
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,700
We could be in an unnecessary scandal.

640
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,070
- Just pretend like you're my stylist. 
 - What?

641
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,430
It's not like you have style, but...

642
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:02,800
Hey, girls! Don't be shy, come over here.

643
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,370
Oh, my god!

644
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:09,080
You want a photo? An autograph?

645
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,430
Mister, could you get us a pack of cigarettes?

646
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,130
You don't know who I am?

647
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,040
- What? 
 - What is he talking about?

648
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,360
   

649
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,890
Oh! I get it!

650
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:33,660
You can get yourself a coffee with the change, Mister.

651
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,900
It's a tip.

652
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,730
You're too young to be smoking!

653
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,520
Go away!

654
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,460
Go! Now!

655
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,840
- How annoying. 
 - Let's go.

656
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:50,260
Is this funny to you?

657
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,670
Yes, it is.

658
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,690
I've never seen you laugh before.

659
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,560
- Are you done laughing? 
 - Yes.

660
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,310
Good night, then.

661
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:31,770
My dad mentioned that we used to be neighbors.

662
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,980
Your mom used to run a video store. Right?

663
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,890
I lived across from your house.

664
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,320
Did you ever see me back then?

665
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,930
No, I didn't.

666
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,910
Maybe I've seen you before.

667
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:49,140
I thought maybe that's why you looked familiar.

668
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,860
I've never seen you. How would you have seen me?

669
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,890
Right.

670
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:59,110
By the way, that Heavenly Granny might be a quack.

671
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:04,530
Whether we've met before or not, it might be fate at this rate.

672
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:10,390
I think... it's just a coincidence.

673
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,200
Coincidence.

674
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,940
I won't change my mind just because we were neighbors once.

675
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,230
Even if my CEO offers you the movie, please say no.

676
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,780
I'm asking you.

677
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:28,470
What if I want to do it, whether you approve or not?

678
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:30,810
What happens then?

679
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:35,770
I hope you won't do that.

680
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:40,550
I'll get going now.

681
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,260
 Look into my eyes. 

682
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:58,510
 Is this funny to you? 

683
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,280
 Yes, it is. 

684
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:19,590
 I don't care how much you beg and plead, it won't work! 

685
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,830
I'm home.

686
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,730
You're home already?

687
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,720
Did you just let him go?

688
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,120
Yeah. He said it was okay and just left.

689
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,590
Oppa and Hyun Joo are home, too. Right?

690
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,110
They're putting the kids to bed.

691
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,430
Hey, he's not the owner of the restaurant. Right?

692
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,190
It wasn't him on the phone.

693
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,010
He's probably an employee or something.

694
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,850
No way. He had a lot of charisma.

695
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:13,560
His face, height, and voice...

696
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,310
Plus, I feel like I've seen him before.

697
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:18,830
I've seen him...

698
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,660
Right! The TV drama!

699
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,260
Ryu...

700
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,200
Ryu...

701
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,300
Ryu Sun Jae! It was him. That's right! Ryu Sun Jae.

702
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,970
Of course, that wasn't him. That's crazy.

703
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:34,960
It totally was.

704
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,410
Mom, stay here for a second.

705
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,630
I'm hungry.

706
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:41,560
Grandma, Grandma.

707
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,280
Stop going places by yourself.

708
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,110
How did you even know that BBQ restaurant anyway?

709
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:50,600
Don't ever go there again. Got it?

710
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,320
Yes, ma'am.

711
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,790
Grandma did a good job, though. Right?

712
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,980
- What? 
 - You missed him.

713
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,440
 Mom! Get in here! 

714
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,440
Yes, ma'am.

715
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:30,130
 Yes, you are right, Grandma. 

716
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,530
 I missed him. 

717
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:40,150
 It might be fate at this rate. 

718
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,270
 I shouldn't do this. 

719
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:50,530
 But the more I see him... the more I miss him. 

720
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,830
 She's a runaway middle schooler. 

721
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:03,080
 I think it's the same perp as the attempted kidnapping last time. Same method. 

722
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:09,230
 Thankfully, she yelled at a passerby for help and ran away. 

723
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,240
Are you feeling better?

724
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:17,400
Should we talk when your parents get here?

725
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,100
No.

726
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:22,310
I can tell you now.

727
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:23,990
Okay.

728
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:29,640
Did you get a chance to see his face?

729
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,610
Yes.

730
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:36,480
I know it might be hard to remember, but can you try to describe it in detail?

731
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,290
 Honey! Honey! 

732
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,370
Honey, Honey, Honey, Honey!

733
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,950
I got Bo Ah ready for school already!

734
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,750
I did a good job braiding her hair. Right?

735
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:48,660
Hearts! Heart on the cheek!

736
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,520
Want a shoulder massage? You must be so tired!

737
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,480
Bo Ah! You are so pretty.

738
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,290
Bo Ah, Mommy's busy today, so Daddy's taking you to daycare.

739
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,390
Okay.

740
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:06,530
Daddy, I don't think Mommy can see you.

741
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,890
It's because Daddy is wearing an invisibility cloak.

742
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:13,330
Only pretty people can see me!

743
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,120
Bo Ah, let's go. Say bye to ommy.

744
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,800
- Bye-bye! 
 - Bye-bye!

745
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,820
Give Mommy a kiss.

746
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,830
- Have a good day! 
 - Daddy wants a kiss, too!

747
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:30,320
Fighting, Honey!

748
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,440
Geez! So frustrating.

749
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,690
Where could my scarf be?

750
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,550
What is this?

751
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,900
He spent money on something useless again.

752
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,750
 Hyun Joo, are you going to work? 

753
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,060
I'm coming.

754
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,680
What? Why?

755
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,660
What do you mean, why?

756
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,000
Ryu Sun Jae wants to do it. Why do you need a reason?

757
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,660
He likes your pitch.

758
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,180
I'm still going to say no.

759
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,680
Then what? What are you going to do?

760
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:12,580
You think it's easy to get a top star cast in a romance film?

761
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,750
I heard you kept saying no.

762
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,690
Not to mention last time.

763
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,180
What are you doing without discussing it with us?

764
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,530
Is this a joke to you?

765
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,810
Especially after what happened with Park Do Jun,

766
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:28,440
we need to get Ryu Sun Jae, no matter what.

767
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,150
It doesn't matter if you're against it.

768
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,320
Sure. Then please go ahead with the movie.

769
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,930
I'll leave the company.

770
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,610
What? Are you protesting or something?

771
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,400
It's not that.

772
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,940
I really can't work with Ryu Sun Jae. I mean, I shouldn't.

773
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,490
So, I'll just give up this project.

774
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,900
I'll let it go and leave.

775
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,660
What? H-Hey, are you serious?

776
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:07,260
Thank you... for everything.

777
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,750
Hey!

778
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,510
Sol.

779
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,520
Sol!

780
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,960
What are you doing? Are you thinking clearly?

781
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,660
Yes, I am.

782
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,290
Why did you do what you did?

783
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:26,010
If you hadn't sent him my pitch, this wouldn't have happened!

784
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,630
Hey.

785
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,120
But wasn't that a good thing for you?

786
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,980
No.

787
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,600
You have no idea what it took to cut him off. What it felt like to end it!

788
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,730
I can't cross paths with him again.

789
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:44,330
Sol.

790
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:47,090
What's wrong? Is something going on?

791
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:51,100
It's the middle of winter.

792
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,020
Why are they filming a commercial outside?

793
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,890
Today might be a little warmer, though.

794
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:59,810
Hey. Do you know a song called "Rain Shower"?

795
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,090
It's a common title.

796
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:05,890
There must be quite a few like that. Which one?

797
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:07,680
Never mind.

798
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,660
By the way, CEO Lee from Bon Cinema wants to set up a meeting.

799
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,890
But someone else is the producer in charge now, not Im Sol.

800
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,430
- Why? 
 - She doesn't want to be a part of this movie.

801
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,330
It's her movie. She doesn't want to be involved?

802
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:27,170
No. What is this movie about? Why are you being like this?

803
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:37,750
A woman travels 15 years to the past to save the man she loves.

804
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,320
It's not a novel concept.

805
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:45,350
Right. It's not very novel at all.

806
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,400
It's strange.

807
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,170
Her phone is off, too.

808
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,350
She's not going to actually quit. Right?

809
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:56,890
There's no way.

810
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:00,670
I don't think the CEO is taking it seriously, either.

811
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,860
Let me talk to her at home later.

812
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,740
She said her dream was to be a film director. How can she throw this opportunity out the window?

813
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,820
It's so strange.

814
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,050
Did something actually happen between her and Ryu Sun Jae?

815
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:15,500
    
 She's not the kind of person to dislike someone for no reason.

816
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:18,470
What?

817
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:22,000
What's wrong?

818
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:44,230
This place hasn't changed at all.

819
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,780
 When we meet again in the future, we can come together. 

820
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,590
♫  So I had to let it go  ♫

821
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,890
It's too bad I don't even have a photo of it.

822
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:17,620
I guess there can't be one.

823
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:28,740
♫  I call your name, I can see a little clearer  ♫

824
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:33,860
♫  Maybe I was waiting for this, in these lost times  ♫

825
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,640
Oh, my.

826
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,640
I must have been here for hours.

827
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,180
♫  One moment, your scent came to me  ♫

828
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:49,300
♫  I won't let it disappear, I won't let it get away  ♫

829
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,000
♫  Don't let go of my hands  ♫

830
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,180
 Sol! 

831
00:55:54,180 --> 00:56:01,360
♫  This moment, everything  ♫

832
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,220
Hyung, I think the shoot's going to be canceled.

833
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:09,110
- Why? 
 - The actress got into a collision on her way here.

834
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:11,100
- Is she okay? 
 - Yeah.

835
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,390
Oh, well. There's not much we can do about it then.

836
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:15,020
It's cold. Let me get the car out.

837
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,780
I'll take that. I'll be right back.

838
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,360
It's this bastard.

839
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,210
Senior!

840
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:36,120
- Here's the sketch. 
 - Let me see.

841
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,490
It's him.

842
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,470
Just wait a moment.

843
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:51,500
You can get in now.

844
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,400
- Closing the door. 
 - I'm with her.

845
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,810
What? How did you...

846
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:03,720
Are you worried I followed you or something?

847
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,500
I'm here to film a commercial, but the shoot got canceled.

848
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,800
I was thinking about the Ferris wheel scene in the pitch.

849
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,000
We meet again.

850
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,240
I told you that Heavenly Granny is a quack.

851
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:18,280
At this point, I think the heavens are setting us up.

852
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,960
Fine, let's say you happened to see me.

853
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,770
You should've gone on your way. Why follow me?

854
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:28,190
Riding a Ferris wheel car together? We're not that close.

855
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:36,350
You want to run away, but you can't just hop off.

856
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,640
That's what you are thinking. Right?

857
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:46,490
You can't run away until we've done a full circle.

858
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:53,320
Do you really hate me that much?

859
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,600
I heard you're not going to be involved in the production.

860
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,200
Yes.

861
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,280
- I quit the company, so... 
 - Why?

862
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,340
I don't want you to.

863
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,660
Why does it matter to you?

864
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,390
Are you sick?

865
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:16,720
No. Let's just sit in silence until we get off.

866
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:24,510
So, is that really how it ends?

867
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,750
- What? 
 - The ending.

868
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:32,280
Does that man really forget everything about the girl he loved

869
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,620
and goes on living like that?

870
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,320
Yes.

871
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,630
What a sad ending.

872
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:46,060
From her perspective, it's a happy ending.

873
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,800
She saved his life.

874
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,600
But lost her love.

875
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:59,350
After she loses her love, is she happy?

876
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:02,910
See? It's a sad ending.

877
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:05,270
I don't like how it ends.

878
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:07,620
If you don't like it, just don't do the movie.

879
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,050
Why are you being so pushy?

880
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,090
I was being pushy before, but now I'm sincere.

881
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,580
I really want to do this movie.

882
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,090
Why do you want to do this movie so badly?

883
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:19,540
You must have many more great pitches, directors, scripts, and writers who want you.

884
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:23,920
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly love with you  ♫

885
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,010
I...

886
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:32,960
feel a little weird these days.

887
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,510
After I read your pitch, something weird happened to me.

888
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:41,030
I keep tearing up.

889
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,650
I have dreams, too.

890
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:46,130
Vivid dreams as if they actually happened to me.

891
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,890
And, this place...

892
00:59:55,220 --> 01:00:00,120
♫  I'm dreaming again  ♫

893
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:06,070
♫  No matter what happens  ♫

894
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:12,200
♫  I will find you  ♫

895
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:19,090
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

896
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:24,040
♫  I've been waiting for this for so long  ♫

897
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,880
It's my first time here, but it feels familiar.

898
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,640
Like I've been here before.

899
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,590
 Sun Jae... 

900
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:37,300
Maybe that's why I'm drawn to it more than any other project.

901
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,400
Is that not allowed?

902
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,580
You might die.

903
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:49,270
If I told you,

904
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:52,710
you might die if you get involved with me,

905
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,000
would you still want to do it?

906
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,850
In order to be close to you, do I need to be ready to die?

907
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:02,170
What if I said yes?

908
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:13,070


909
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:21,120
 Why aren't you saying anything? 

910
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,180
 It's so pretty. 

911
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,460
 It's so pretty that I'm at a loss for words. 

912

♫  If I miss you this much, will it come true?  ♫

♫  I want to tell you someday before it's too late  ♫

914
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:51,950
♫  I never let go, not even a moment  ♫

♫  I never forgot all this time  ♫

916
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:03,480
Maybe we might die together right here.

917
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:10,710
♫  When you fall like petals, like I've been waiting for  ♫

918
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:13,310
 At that moment, I thought... 

919
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:20,680
 our fates are like this Ferris wheel, going round and round.

 Sun Jae... 

928
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,540
 You'll feel better soon. Get some sleep. 

929
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:00,770
 He's really famous. 

930
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:02,930
 I heard you're starring in my Sol's movie. 

931
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:05,720
 She told me she doesn't have a boyfriend. 

932
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,580
 I got it then came this way, I mean, I was passing by. 

933
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:10,950
 Producer Im left the company. 

934
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:14,440
 Ryu Sun Jae, please stay healthy and be well. 

935
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,050
 I'm leaving now. 

936
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:19,400
 I think it's him. 

937
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,160
 - Is there such a thing as fate? 
 - Sol! 

938
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,020
 A certain destiny you can't change or cross?
