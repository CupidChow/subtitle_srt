00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,070
 You should have left me to die!

 Why did you save me and let me be like this? Why!

I didn't make you cry, did I?

I should be the one thanking you.

But you like this, right?

 Also, eat this. Bye!

You were passed out.

Wait just a minute. We'll treat you and run some tests.

What year is it now?

65

It's 2023.

Where is my child? My Sun Jae...

70
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,870
Visitors aren't allowed in there. I'm sorry.

71
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,510
Okay.

72
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,740
Excuse me, Im Sol?

73
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,380
This is from Ryu Sun Jae's belongings.

74
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,520
How... How did this...

75
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,820
 It wasn't a dream. 

76
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,120
Baek In Hyuk saw the photo and recognized you right away.

77
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,390
We heard you two used to know each other.

78
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,950
 The future has changed. 

79
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,300
Did you notice anything strange about Ryu Sun Jae last night?

80
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,950
Im Sol, you are...

81
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,710
 the last person Ryu Sun Jae saw before he died. 

82
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,840
 I could have saved him. 

83
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,170
 I need to go back! 

84
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,120
   

85
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,980

86
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,770
Why isn't it working?

87
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,770
 This is the first news item of 2023. 

88
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,520
 Last night, we heard the tragic news of Ryu Sun Jae's death. 

89
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,950
 He was struggling with severe depression and insomnia. 

90
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,860
 Many are grieving for him. 

91
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:44,250
 Sun Jae struggled with the rumors and cruel comments. 

92
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,870
 I wish I remembered you yesterday. 

93
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:22,120
 If I did... I would have held onto you and not let you go. 

94
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,310
 Take this with you. 

95
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,520
 I wouldn't have let you be alone. 

96
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,850
   

97
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,550
Hello?

98
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,810
 It's me. Baek In Hyuk. 

99
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,220
 I heard you saw Sun Jae yesterday. 

100
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,980
 How was he? 

101
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,320
 Did he look like he was in a bad place? 

102
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,960
 I didn't know he wanted to die. 

103
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,430
Do you know?

104
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,210
 Sun Jae wanted to apologize to you so badly. 

105
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,320
What?

106
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,480
 You have to know that. 

107
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,920
What are you talking about?

108
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,440
Why did Sun Jae—

109
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,280
Baek In Hyuk!

110
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,320
 The person you are calling is not available. 

111
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,080
 Please try again later. 

112
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,360
   

113
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,900
 Does it only light up at midnight? 

114
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,500
 Then, maybe... 

115
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,000
   

116
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,990
I pray, I pray, I pray to the gods of Heaven and Earth.

117
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,070
Please look after our Sol.

118
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,570
I pray, I pray, I pray to Buddha...

119
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,530
Am I back?

120
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,810
I'm back!

121
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,240
I came back!

122
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,330
When is this? Is this 2008?

123
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,450
Little wench, you're finally coming out of hiding. You evil thing.

124
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,800
- What? 
 - Goodness, ancestors!

125
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,250
How dare you latch onto a human's body? Leave this body right now!

126
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,510
Leave! Leave!

127
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,670
- Go away! Go away! 
 - Why are you hitting me?

128
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,470
Go away!

129
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,490
I'm not an evil spirit!

130
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,300
I can't be doing this right now.

131
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,600
You're ruining an exorcism. Where are you running off to?

132
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,580
What exorcism?

133
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,950
You said that chunks of your memory were gone.

134
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,410
As if you were possessed. You were terrified and shaking!

135
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,520
You asked for an exorcism, so we're doing one. Where do you think you're going?

136
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,240
I did?

137
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,400
 Please help me. Please? 
   

138
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,900
 I feel like someone is controlling my body. 

139
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,710
 You did get a visit. Someone got inside you. 

140
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,980
 Someone very, very unfortunate... 

141
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,330
 I see a Virgin Ghost full of sorrow who lived a rough life. 

142
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,900
Wow, you really are good.

143
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,230
Sol.

144
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,930
Are you not remembering things again?

145
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,910
I do remember. I remember everything now.

146
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,600
I think all that studying overloaded my brain a little.

147
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,650
That's it, right? What a relief.

148
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,330
Mom, she's okay now.

149
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,530
- Goodness... what in the world. 
 - Goodness...

150
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,850
Sun Jae.

151
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,490
Get out of my way.

152
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,000
How dare you knock over the Virgin's table?

153
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,500
 Im Sol! 

154
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,200
Sun Jae!

155
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,700
 We need to talk. 

156
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,910
 I have a boyfriend. Please stop flirting with me. 
    

157
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,180
 I just need a minute. 

158
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,320
 You creep! I said no! 

159
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,470
I must have been insane.

160
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,510
What did you do, Sol?

161
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,200
Wait! How much time passed?

162
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,600
Ten whole days?

163
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,480
 Right. This wasn't about time. It was about opportunity. 

164
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,890
 An opportunity to come back to the past. 

165
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:56,830
 So, if I go back after this, do I just have one more? 

166
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,600
 Last time, I was here for almost two months. 

167
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,630
 How long will I be able to stay this time? 

168
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,600
Okay.

169
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,080
The future can change.

170
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,300
I'll try anything.

171
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,800
Sun Jae!

172
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,090
You took your shoulder brace off. Is it feeling better? Does it still hurt?

173
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,920
I have a couple things for you. Look.

174
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,070
Okay. It's heavy. I'll carry it for you.

175
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,140
These are books you might find helpful, plus stuff for cupping.

176
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,390
I read cupping is so good for people who've had shoulder surgery.

177
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,460
Since it's too much hassle to get them from the hospital, you can just do this at home,

178
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,440
like this.

179
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,200
What are you doing?

180
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,760
- This is— 
 - Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

181
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,250
You must be really upset.

182
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,130
I'm sorry.

183
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,340
I can explain everything.

184
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,300
Pretending like I didn't know you, calling you a creep... That wasn't me.

185
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,140
- What? 
 - That was just a 19-year-old child. She doesn't know you.

186
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,520
Then, who are you now?

187
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,640
I'm Sol from the future, the year 2023.

188
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,360
This is a time machine.

189
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,630
Your watch brought my soul back to the past.

190
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,760
To save your life!

191
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,500
You are completely nuts.

192
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,100
 As if he would believe that! 

193
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,300
I was possessed.

194
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,290
- That evil spirit again? 
 - It's true, Sun Jae.

195
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,290
We even did an exorcism on our rooftop last night.

196
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,440
Look at this.

197
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,170
- What is that? 
 - This is...

198
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,170
This is a charm that chases away evil spirits.

199
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,240
Can you see why I had to go through it?

200
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,520
I've been possessed, unable to see clearly. I couldn't recognize people I know.

201
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,200
So, I guess spirits can date?

202
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,760
What?

203
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,060
It was a Virgin Ghost, Sun Jae! Sun Jae—

204
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,970
Girlfriend, are you okay?

205
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,300
 Do you want to date? 
   

206
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,500
 I do. 

207
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,260
You!

208
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,220
- It's you! 
 - What? Are you hurt?

209
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,060
Let's go now.

210
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,700
Don't look.

211
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,500
- Seriously! 
 - What?

212
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,300
 I can't believe I'm your girlfriend. It's so dreamy! 

213
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,030
 Is your tummy going ding-dong? 

214
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,130
 Have a good lunch, baby! 

215
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,070
 This is Sol, your morning alarm clock! It's time to wakey. 

216
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,920
What? "Wakey"?

217
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,790
This is a disaster.

218
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,000
Okay, pick.

219
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,190
One, my healing hands.

220
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,010
Two...

221
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,500
Three, shut your mouth.

222
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,200
I have a hand, too. Give it to me.

223
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,910
I said no thanks.

224
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,540
How was number two?

225
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,960
Y-You...

226
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,570
This is how you seduced my Sol!

227
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,580
So, is Grandma back again?

228
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,160
H-How did you know?

229
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,100
You're so different from yesterday.

230
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,380
Here.

231
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,470
Where did those heart eyes go?

232
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,810
Hey, do you like my Sol?

233
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:24,100
I do like my Sol.

234
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,110
- You're lying, right? 
 - What do you want me to say?

235
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,270
That you're in here?

236
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,260
Number three! Number three!

237
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,280
Such an old pick-up line.

238
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,010
Anyway! I do not approve of this relationship.

239
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,330
I will never give my blessing, so...

240
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,290
 You said chunks of your memory were gone. As if you were possessed. 

241
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,990
 You were terrified and shaking! 

242
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,000
Can I just do whatever I want?

243
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,400
I'll be going back soon.

244
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,110
Excuse me... I have a question.

245
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,260
Do you know which unit Sol lives in?

246
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,110
I have something to give her.

247
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,890
That pot is mine.

248
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:16,040
My daughter brought you over a potful of samgyetang. 
  (Whole chicken ginseng soup) 

249
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,300
That was forever ago. You're just returning it now?

250
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,750
Her mom runs the video store?

251
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,000
What is he grumbling about?

252
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,950
I've been busy with work and forgot. I apologize.

253
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,340
- Here. you go. I washed it and everything. 
 - Sure.

254
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,180
Goodbye.

255
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,160
Hold on.

256
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,360
You only paid 15,000 won out of your late fee.

257
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,750
W-What are you talking about?

258
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,600
You returned the video a few days after I told you how much the late fee is.

259
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,320
You owe me an extra 3,000 won.

260
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,920
I have no idea what you're trying to say— Ow!

261
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,580
Ouch!

262
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,810
Oh, no! That one stings.

263
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,420
Let's please try to do this in one take.

264
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,780
Stand by...

265
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,570
Action!

266
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,580
You said you were a dentist. Right?

267
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,260
I heard you just opened a clinic.

268
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,940
Come visit sometime.

269
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,400
I'll give you a teeth cleaning.

270
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
- Cut for a second. 
 - We're cutting!

271
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,240
It's good, very good. Just be more relaxed.

272
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,270
Take a sip of the coffee in front of you.

273
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,020
When you smile, go bigger.

274
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,220
Smile. Okay?

275
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,170
Smile? Yes.

276
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,720
- Okay! 
 - Action!

277
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,950
You said you were a dentist. Right?

278
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,110
I heard you just opened a clinic.

279
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,810
Come visit sometime.

280
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,120
I'll give you a teeth cleaning.

281
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,500
What is that?

282
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,960
What?

283
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,650
Cut!

284
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,500
What kind of dentist is missing his front tooth? Huh?

285
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,740
Switch him out!

286
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,640
We're going to switch out the actor.

287
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,180
I can put it in right away!

288
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,040
- Come out, please. 
 - Just give me one more chance!

289
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,880
- Hurry up! 
 - Just one more chance!

290
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,960
I said to finish the scene quickly!

291
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,090
 Give me back my front tooth! 

292
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,490
Ridiculous!

293
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,200
He lost his rotten tooth. Now he wants a new one?

294
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,490
Seriously. What do I do...

295
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,760
I haven't gone to the bathroom because of stress.

296
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,500
This damn constipation...

297
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,190
It looks exactly the same.

298
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,560
Are you here to see Kim Tae Sung?

299
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,360
   

300
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,150
No. I'm here to see you.

301
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,440
Me? Why?

302
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,070
 Do you know? 

303
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,080
 Sun Jae wanted to apologize to you so badly. 

304
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,370
 What? 

305
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,380
 You have to know that. 

306
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,730
 What was it that I had to know? 

307
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,110
 In Hyuk, what were you trying to tell me? 

308
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,580
What? Why are you staring at me like that?

309
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,370
In Hyuk, if you ever need to say something to me, say it right away.

310
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,870
I have nothing to say to you.

311
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,910
In the far future.

312
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,500
Around 2023, you might have something to say to me.

313
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,150
Don't hesitate and just call me.

314
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,290
Oh, I have something to say now.

315
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,930
Stop coming to see Sun Jae.

316
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,100
Right, Sun Jae.

317
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,090
When you go to auditions, don't take Sun Jae along.

318
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,150
Don't let Sun Jae step foot in that world. Got it?

319
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,220
What do you have to do with Sun Jae or me?

320
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,880
In Hyuk, think about it.

321
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,870
If you take along a good-looking guy like Sun Jae,

322
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,380
you'll get rejected after all that hard work, and only Sun Jae, who tagged along, will get it.

323
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,570
You know why?

324
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:02,270
A producer always wants to find the hidden gem rather than go with a rock that rolled in.

325
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,970
- True. 
 - Right?

326
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,610
Wait! So I'm the rock and Sun Jae is the gem?

327
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,490
Anyway, if you want to protect your dear friend,

328
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,600
if you don't want to have regrets, mark my words.

329
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,620
I'm really trying to help.

330
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,820
Bye.

331
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,210
Hey!

332
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,760
Don't you dare go looking for Sun Jae!

333
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,010
Hey, Sun Jae! Long time no see.

334
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,640
Looks like you got an award or something.

335
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,160
I'm so jealous, man.

336
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,250
Should we throw you a party or something?

337
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,180
- I'm busy. 
 - Off to study?

338
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,040
I guess swimming is over, and you need to find something else.

339
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,570
Mind your own business.

340
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,120
I'm just heartbroken for you, man.

341
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,210
I told you to be careful.

342
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,300
You should have followed my advice.

343
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,860
Why did you push yourself to compete and mess up your shoulder like that?

344
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,650
A person needs to be humble.

345
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,750
Act arrogant, and you get punished.

346
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,370
It must hurt.

347
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,880
You should watch out, too. Don't let your guard down.

348
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,100
You have no stamina. Don't push yourself to do loping strokes.

349
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,850
You might blow out your shoulder if you overuse one side like that.

350
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,090
Like me.

351
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,650
- Hey, Sun Jae! You're here! 
 - Hey!

352
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,500
You said in an interview after you won the national competition medal.

353
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,980
Your mom's wish was for you to be on the national team.

354
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,280
Don't waste your time giving me useless advice.

355
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,910
Go to your mom's grave and beg her for forgiveness, you bastard!

356
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,920
Geez, that son of a bitch.

357
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,700
- Hey, hey, hey! 
 - Sun Jae, wait! Wait!

358
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,090
- Hey! Sun Jae, cool it. 
 - Let go! Let go!

359
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,120
Sun Jae, cool it. Stop.

360
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,200
Let go, it's okay.

361
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,120
Don't let go. Throw a punch, asshole.

362
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,910
Hey!

363
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,630
♫  I am your superhero, a problem solver  ♫

364
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:18,200
♫  I am your superhero, a problem solver. I'm a super ultra man  ♫

365
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,420
How dare you mention his mom?

366
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,800
There are things that a person should not say.

367
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,320
Just how low can you go?

368
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,300
I knew it when I saw you steal his swim trunks.

369
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,670
You shouldn't have gotten away with that, you lowlife!

370
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,110
I have a nosebleed!

371
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,880
Do you want to die?

372
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,870
Do you need me to hit you one more time?

373
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:41,790
If I see you mess with Sun Jae one more time, you'll regret it.

374
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,100
Hey!

375
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,110
Hey, what's going on?

376
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,500
Cigarette girl!

377
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,150
Hey, come here!

378
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,550
That little rat!

379
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,940
Come here! Where are you going?

380
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,210
 You! 

381
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,400
 Stop right there! 

382
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,550
I didn't even get to talk to him.

383
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Let me go!

384
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,430
 Sol, why did you decide to date a punk like that 

385
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,260
 and endure this humiliation? 

386
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,440
Hey, pretty, can you let my hair go before we talk?

387
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,210
I warned you. Right?

388
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,260
I guess you didn't hear me when I asked you nicely.

389
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,350
You didn't ask me nicely. You asked me meanly.

390
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,860
Seriously?

391
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,110
What is she saying?

392
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,210
What a funny bitch.

393
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,790
You really like Kim Tae Sung, huh?

394
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,330
I'll break up with him today. Okay?

395
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,630
So can you let me go?

396
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,370
Let go, and let's have a conversation.

397
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,520
How can I trust you?

398
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,630
You were just sobbing, saying you'll never break up with him.

399
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,100
This is your last chance.

400
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,330
If you let go while I count to three, I'll go easy on you.

401
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,410
What are you saying?

402
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,120
One...

403
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,180
two, three!

404
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,730
You!

405
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,210
Why are you bullying someone over a boy?

406
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,320
You with a pretty face!

407
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,850
Let go! Let go!

408
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,200
I said let go!

409
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,950
Hey!

410
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,570
Are you in a fight?

411
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,470
No, we're just playing.

412
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,580
- It's a game. 
 - We were just playing.

413
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,770
Really?

414
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,530
Be nice to each other!

415
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,590
Huh?

416
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,900
I've seen him before.

417
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,120
CEO Kim? Why is CEO Kim here?

418
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,340
- What is she saying now? 
 - Where are you going?

419
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,940
Let go. I'll break up with him! Move out of the way!

420
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,760
It freaking hurts!

421
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,510
Here.

422
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,440
Call me. Okay?

423
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,890
What is she doing now?

424
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,370
Sun Jae!

425
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:22,150
 Sun Jae struggled with the rumors and cruel comments. 

426
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,660
Hello.

427
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,820
   

428
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,550
 Gosh, she looks just like her mom. 

429
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,740
Hi, how can I help you?

430
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,050
Is Sun Jae home?

431
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,850
Goodness, no.

432
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,750
He just changed and left for physical therapy.

433
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,150
Do you know where...

434
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,600
Wait.

435
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,540
He changed?

436
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,990
   

437
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,290
I have something to give Sun Jae. Could I come in for a second?

438
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,390
You don't need to. He's not here.

439
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,290
Give it to me. I'll make sure he gets it.

440
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,940
Since I'm here, let me drop it off in his room.

441
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,680
You can't do that. It's a grown man's room.

442
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,520
If you really want to give it yourself, wait until you see him.

443
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,760
My stomach...

444
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,090
Could I use your bathroom?

445
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,950
Go do your business at home! You live right across.

446
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,780
Wait, talking about it makes me want to go, too...

447
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,510
Oh, my stomach!

448
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,850
My stomach! It's coming out!

449
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,000
It's coming out! It hurts!

450
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,340
 Now I've broken into his house. 

451
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,600
 Sun Jae's room must be on the second floor. Right? 

452
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,380
 Oh, no! 

453
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,860
Lee Byung Hun and Lee Min Jung are getting married!

454
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,490
Won Bin and Lee Na Young are getting married!

455
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:21,330
Kim Tae Hee and Rain are getting married!

456
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,150
It's like I have some super power.

457
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,750
There it is!

458
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,530
   

459
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,640
What do I do?

460
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,450
Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin are getting married!

461
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,900
There's something in the air.

462
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,330
 I told you to come so I can give you this. 

463
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,410
 They only give it to athletes who set a new record. 

464
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,820
 They must have been behind on production. I just got it. 

465
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,640
 I'll be by your side. 

466
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,510
 When you're struggling, I won't let you feel alone. 

467
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,210
 I won't let you think dark thoughts. 

468
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,140
What a joke.

469
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,370
Gosh, it's summer, so you only wear things once...

470
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,950
The laundry is endless...

471
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,380
- Hey! How was physical therapy? 
 - Good.

472
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,180
Hey, why are you so sweaty?

473
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,590
I ran around the block.

474
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,960
Just breathing makes me hot. Why run?

475
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,330
I must have a heat stroke or something. I'm seeing things.

476
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,800
What?

477
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,300
Why is she in my room?

478
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,450
Hey.

479
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,860
Wake up.

480
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,900
Hey, wake up.

481
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,430
This is crazy.

482
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,350
Is she hot?

483
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,380
She's in deep sleep.

484
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,390
- Hello? 
  - Tae Sung! 

485
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,600
 I miss you! 

486
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,630
Hey, is this funny to you?

487
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,640
Strike!

488
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,560
Hey, you've been staring at your phone for hours. What's up?

489
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,690
She was always texting me.

490
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,180
Then, she stopped overnight.

491
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,730
Really? You haven't broken up?

492
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,100
You said it was weird that she changed as soon as you started dating.

493
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,900
It was like that until yesterday. But she's cute again.

494
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,710
What? Didn't you pick someone random so you could get rid of Ga Hyun?

495
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,850
- Whatever. 
  - That bastard! 

496
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,790
I'm sorry.

497
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,430
I will leave right now.

498
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,200
How? My dad is on the first floor.

499
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,690
I'll go through the window. I'll tie something around my waist and jump.

500
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,610
Don't come close!

501
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:56,840
Sit over there.

502
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,900
Don't you dare come close.

503
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,840
After the news, my dad will go work out. You can go then.

504
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,620
Okay.

505
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,530
Now, explain yourself.

506
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,590
Well...

507
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,410
I wanted to give you these.

508
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,950
So that's why you came.

509
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,880
But then, why were you fully asleep?

510
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,720
I didn't mean to fall asleep.

511
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,480
You want me to believe that?

512
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,190
I know it's unbelievable, but it's true.

513
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,720
Also, this might sound unbelievable,

514
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,630
I am truly ethical and have perfectly normal values.

515
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,500
But with you, I've shown you all sorts of my pathetic self.

516
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,320
Exactly. Why are you showing me all sorts of your pathetic self?

517
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,210
Those pathetic things... can you forget all about them?

518
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:02,800
 I like you. 

519
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,970
 I... like you. 

520
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,680
You want to forget what happened at the pool? Is that easy for you?

521
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,110
The pool?

522
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,290
 Come on, this is nothing. 

523
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,450
 I'm not drunk, really. 

524
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,740
Have you been mad since then?

525
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,570
That may have meant nothing to you,

526
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,580
but it's not like that for me!

527
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,360
I'm sorry, Sun Jae.

528
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,920
It's fine.

529
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,400
Did I throw a terrible drunken fit?

530
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,640
By chance, was I terrible?

531
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,950
Honestly, I blacked out. I can't remember anything.

532
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,560
What?

533
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,670
I'm sorry.

534
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,530
I don't hold homemade wine very well...

535
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:06,060
So... you were drunk and can't remember anything?

536
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,250
Sure.

537
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,170
That's a relief, honestly. H-Hey, that's a relief!

538
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:22,810
You know how you can't really feel homemade wine, then it hits?

539
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,560
Be quiet until you leave.

540
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,550
 I did a whole song and dance when she doesn't even remember. 

541
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,330
♫  I wished it would never end  ♫

542
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,910
These books...

543
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,850
Read them when you can't sleep.

544
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,450
Why?

545
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:25,700
You think my life is going to get harder now?

546
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,220
Everyone goes to a dark place at least once.

547
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,620
Like...

548
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,420
a moment where it feels like the world turns its back against you.

549
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,500
 Can you make me walk again? 

550
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,130
 That's what I want! 

551
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,490
 Thank you for being alive. 

552
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:48,010
♫  You seep into my thoughts once again today  ♫

553
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,870
But someone told me once.

554
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:55,370
"Stay alive today because it's nice outside.

555
00:42:55,370 --> 00:43:00,640
If it rains, stay alive to wait until it stops."

556
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,900
 Then, someday... 

557
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,990
 a day might come when living doesn't feel so bad. 

558
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,880
 So, Sun Jae... 

559
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,560
 when you want to die, just hang on one more day. 

560
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:23,220
 So, I can go back and save you. 

561
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,440
I want to get along with you again.

562
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,240
If you don't want to... can you at least not push me away for the next few months?

563
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,570
♫  Don't forget that I'm here  ♫

564
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,100
 She has no idea how I feel. 

565
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:24,000
♫  It wasn't how I felt  ♫

566
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,480
♫  So finally I had to let go  ♫

567
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,380
I told you not to get close.

568
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,990
Well...

569
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,400
I thought you might get a mosquito bite.

570
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:42,000
♫  When I walk the staircase of memories and call your name  ♫

571
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,030
This won't do.

572
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:48,390
♫  It seems lucid again  ♫

573
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:54,870
♫  Was I waiting? Inside scattered sense of time  ♫

574
00:44:54,870 --> 00:45:03,780
♫  One moment, your scent came to me  ♫

575
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,900
What? Are you airing out your comforter?

576
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,480
♫  So you can't disappear, I won't go far away  ♫

577
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,420
♫  Don't let go of my hands  ♫

578
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:20,910
♫  This moment, everything  ♫

579
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,760
Get along?

580
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,840
Get along how?

581
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,600
- I mean— 
 - I don't make friends with girls.

582
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,300
A guy and a girl can't be friends.

583
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:41,280
I don't need to be consoled.

584
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,450
Did I ask you to take care of me?

585
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,340
Honestly, when I look at you,

586
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:49,000
I feel like you can see through my despair. It's embarrassing and uncomfortable.

587
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,640
Can we just go back to being strangers? Why are you doing this?

588
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,340
What do I need to do?

589
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:58,450
There's nothing I can do besides try to make you feel better.

590
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:03,620
The only thing I can do is buy those books that won't impress you now.

591
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,380
My two legs are free now, but I feel like my lips and hands are tied.

592
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,090
I can't breathe. I feel helpless.

593
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:14,670
♫  This yearning I can't hide  ♫

594
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,220
You're right.

595
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,290
What I really want, you can't do.

596
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,410
So...

597
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,130
if you feel helpless...

598
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:28,710
you don't need to try to get along with me.

599
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,260
Just go now.

600
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:37,860
♫  I can't forget the traces of you  ♫

601
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,980
♫  If I could stop, even just for a moment  ♫

602
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,100
Here, put these on.

603
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,790
♫  I would embrace you right there and then  ♫

604
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,440
Put them on and go already!

605
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:59,170
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

609
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:41,540
♫  You keep getting further away that I can't reach you  ♫

610
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:49,970
♫  Please just come back to me  ♫

611
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:58,040
♫  I sigh and try my best to smile  ♫

612
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,960
 I don't need to be consoled. 

613
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,470
 Did I ask you to take care of me? 

614
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:04,260
 Honestly, when I look at you, 

615
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,130
 I feel like you can see through my despair. It's embarrassing and uncomfortable. 

616
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:13,570
 So, you don't need to try and get along with me. Just go now. 

617
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:20,060
♫  I want to go back to our time together  ♫

♫  Your name is painted deep in my heart  ♫

620
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:40,400
My constipation reminds me of my body shape.

621
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,150
When it should pop out, it doesn't, and when it shouldn't, it does.

622
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,870
Why isn't it coming down?

623
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:50,570
Hyun Joo! I'm glad to see you!

624
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,510
Why are you ignoring my calls?

625
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:53,960
Hey, where are you going?

626
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,400
What are you going to do about my tooth?

627
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,940
I already told you that I talked to my uncle.

628
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,050
Hey! Hey! How busy can your uncle's dental office be? Why is it taking so long?

629
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:03,780
It would be faster to be born again and grow a baby tooth.

630
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,590
Saturday! Saturday! Okay?

631
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:09,560
Hey! I missed an important opportunity in my acting career because of my tooth.

632
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,180
What are you going to do about that? What?

633
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,820
He'll clean your teeth...

634
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,590
- for free! 
 - Hey!

635
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,370
Hey! That's not enough!

636
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,760
Free whitening, too!

637
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:29,620
Why is it locked?

638
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,080
It's Yoo Hyun Joo. Hey.

639
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,270
Why are you standing there like that?

640
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:51,730
No!

641
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:54,430
Don't come close!

642

 I really wanted to go to Korea this year to celebrate your birthday.

 I'm sorry.

00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,740
 I'm always missing you. 

652
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,060
You were so late that I thought you were going to be dolled up.

653
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,680
Sorry to mislead you.

654
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,640
Be honest.

655
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,250
You have multiple personality disorder, right?

656
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,850
Like that guy, Jekyll and Hyde.

657
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:59,000
Yes. I have multiple personalities.

658
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,380
I'll explain it to you, so listen up.

659
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:06,330
Inside me, there is an innocent and young self and a mature self.

660
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,500
- Okay. 
 - From the point of view of my mature self,

661
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,340
I don't like the fact that young and innocent Sol is dating you.

662
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,380
Being obsessed with a boy instead of studying?

663
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,180
Doesn't that seem concerning to you?

664
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:20,820
Oh, so the innocent you who is obsessed with me,

665
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:24,370
and the mature you who have to study are fighting inside you?

666
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,490
Gosh, you are so smart.

667
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:28,500
Yes. Something like that.

668
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,290
- So who won? 
 - I did.

669
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,110
Congratulations.

670
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:36,440
So, I think we should stop dating.

671
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,220
You said you really wanted to see me for my birthday.

672
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,340
Why now?

673
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,770
What? Your birthday?

674
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,450
   

675
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,170
- No! 
 - No what?

676
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,520
No, no, no, no, no.

677
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:53,900
Don't do it!

678
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,110
I said don't do it!

679
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:57,900
Hey, stop!

680
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,440
 A customer has prepared a surprise event. 

681
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,240
 Please excuse us for a moment. 

682
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,150
- Let's go. 
 - There's an event. Let's see it.

683
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,590
I'll buy you something yummy. Let's go!

684
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:20,080
   

685
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,500
♫  I don't like Hyun Bin  ♫

686
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,630
♫  I don't like Gong Yoo  ♫ 
 Don't look!

687
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:26,620
♫  I don't even like Gang Dong Won  ♫

688

689

690

691
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,450
Is that you?

692
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,890
Wow, you are really nuts.

693

702
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,610
 I love you! 

703
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,530
What the heck is this high school senior doing? You immature kid!

704
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:16,750
Time to blow out the candle.

705
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:23,360
Happy birthday!

706
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,630
Be honest.

707
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,040
You broke up with me so you could film a hidden camera. Right?

708
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,280
Right, I see why you would think that.

709
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,930
I didn't realize you liked me this much.

710
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:39,910
Right. I didn't, either.

711
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:43,320
Why? Are you embarrassed now that you've done this?

712
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,620
Want to go eat?

713
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:51,750
- Have you had seaweed soup? 
 - Seaweed soup?

714
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:56,270
I don't even know if my dad knows it's my birthday.

715
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,610
Really?

716
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,970
You feel sorry for me. Right?

717
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:09,090
 - Two orders of pork over rice here... 
 - Thank you, come again. 

718
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,340
Why aren't you eating, and just staring at it?

719
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:18,780
You're the first girlfriend who bought me seaweed soup in a drivers' diner on my birthday.

720
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,180
Do you think just any restaurant sells seaweed soup?

721
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:25,150
Hurry and and eat, so you can age a year and be a little more mature.

722
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,180
Is it good?

723
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:40,580
Aren't you supposed to put side dishes on my spoon and stuff?

724
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,420
Why are you looking at me like that?

725
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,330
Did you fall for me all over again?

726
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:53,290
I don't know what my old self saw in this poser.

727
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,650
You keep talking like you don't like me anymore.

728
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:59,700
Anyway, if the innocent Sol comes back, be good to her.

729
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,570
Don't hurt her.

730
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:05,510
Act your age and be appropriate. Only go on dates to libraries, bookstores, and places like that.

731
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,770
- And? 
 - It's dangerous, so don't get her on your motorcycle.

732
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,420
Make sure she gets home before sunset.

733
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,300
- And? 
 - In terms of touch...

734
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:17,280
- How far? 
 - What do you mean how far? These young kids...

735
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,150
Huh? Don't you dare!

736
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:27,210
She is me, and I am her. What am I talking about?

737
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:30,240
I guess he changed management, after all.

738
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,050
Marine Boy. Doesn't he swim anymore?

739
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:34,300
- What? 
 - Here.

740
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,390
Isn't this Ryu Sun Jae?

741
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,210
I don't think he has the talent to go into entertainment.

742
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:42,750
 Baek In Hyuk must be on his way to an audition. LOL 

743
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,760
Where is this?

744
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,680
Did you go to an audition?

745
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,430
- What's with you? 
 - Why did you bring Sun Jae here?

746
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:58,800
- I told you! Don't step a foot— 
 - What are you talking about?

747
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,470
Sun Jae got a call from his dad and left.

748
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:03,460
What? He left?

749
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:08,130
- Thank goodness. 
 - Why do you keep butting into Sun Jae's business?

750
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:11,000
Are you dating Kim Tae Sung and messing with Sun Jae?

751
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,930
What?

752
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:15,230
What are you talking about—

753
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,750
Hey! Are you okay?

754
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,020
- Here are your side dishes. 
 - Can we have some water here?

755
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:27,510
- Sun Jae, water to table 10. 
 - Water to table 10!

756
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,940
- Hello? 
  - Are you still at the restaurant? 

757
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:34,430
- Yeah, I'm busy. 
  - Did you tell Im Sol you came here with me? 

758
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:36,650
- Are you still talking to her? 
  - What? 

759
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,520
She came to see you! She ran over like she was being chased.

760
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:45,570
She rolled down some stairs and made a scene. I was going to see if she got hurt, but she must've felt embarrassed and vanished.

761
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:50,050
- Can we have some water, please? 
 - Yes, one second. I'm sorry.

762
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:52,880
Hey, I'm busy. And...

763
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,200
Don't talk to me about her anymore. Bye.

764
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,340
Hey, hey!

765
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,830
Let me change your pan.

766
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,930
 She came to see you! 

767
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:04,250
 She rolled down some stairs and made a scene. 

768
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:08,040
 I was going to see if she got hurt, but she must've felt embarrassed and vanished. 

769
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,680
Excuse me. The meat is burning.

770
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,730
Hey, son! Where are you going?

771
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,280
Im Sol! Im Sol!

772
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,330
Where am I?

773
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:55,320
- Mr. Driver! What stop is this? 
 - We're almost at the last one.

774
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,890
Gosh. Did you fall asleep and miss your stop?

775
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:01,940
Really? Gosh, this is nuts.

776
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,300
   

777
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,900
Why does it feel like I've been here before?

778
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,000
Let me go back.

779
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,520
   

780
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:09,110
Hi... Are you a student?

781
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,390
Hello!

782
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,490
Hey! ey!

783
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:22,790
Hey! Hey! I'm not a weirdo!

784
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:25,070
Why are you running away from me?

785
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,480
- You're offending me! 
 - Why are you following me?

786
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,330
Young lady!

787
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:30,800
- Hold on! 
 - Why are you doing this?

788
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,700
I'm not a bad guy.

789
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,080
Don't come close to me. I'm calling the police.

790
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,820
The police? Why would you do that?

791
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,130
- I just want to talk. 
 - Let it go!

792
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:42,690
I mean it!

793
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:46,140
 I just want to talk! 

794
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,160
Mr. Driver, please stop here!

795
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,750
 - Let me go!   
  - Why would you call the cops? 

796
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:55,310
 I just wanted to talk for a minute! 

797
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:57,730
Why would you call the cops?

798
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,790
 Sol! Im Sol! 

799
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:53,740
 You know, the person who saved me at the accident? 

800
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:56,350
 Do you remember his name or anything? 

801
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,530
Are you okay?

802
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,530
What am I going to do with you?

803
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,800
Are you hurt anywhere? Let me see you.

804
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:01,640
 Go! Go away! 

805
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,760
 Why did you save me? 

806
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,050
 You should have left me to die! 

807
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:09,250
 Why did you save me and let me be like this? 

808
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:15,100
 Was it my memory that I lost... 

809
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:19,040
 or was it you? 

810
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,970
Are you in pain? Or are you in shock? Let's go to the hospital.

811
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:28,680
♫  Was I waiting? Inside scattered sense of time  ♫

812
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:37,120
♫  One moment, your scent came to me  ♫

813
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:43,250
♫  So you can't disappear, I won't go far away  ♫

814
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:48,250
♫  Don't let go of my hands  ♫

815
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:55,530
♫  This moment, everything with you  ♫

816
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:06,440
♫  I might know you from somewhere. Be with you  ♫

817
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,110
After In Hyuk...

818
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:19,190
How about you, Sun Jae?

819
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,240
Sure.

820
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:31,520
- Hello? 
  - What's this? 

821
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,580
Hello! My name is...

822
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:36,910
 Ryu Sun Jae. 

823
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:39,460
 So? 

824
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:40,700
Do you know who I am?

825
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,760
 No, I don't. 

826
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:49,860
 Sol... 

827
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:57,150

830
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:14,240
 This moment. One that I shouldn't pass by. 

831
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,440
 - Hey!  
  - I owe you my life. 

832
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,030
 - I'll be the magpie that returns the good deed. 
 - I thought it was a swallow. 

833
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:22,420
 He's not dating Im Sol because he likes her. He just wants to date someone. 

834
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:24,990
 - You won't even act like you know me? 
 - Are we even close enough to do that? 

835
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,340
 I thought she was great. 

836
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,250
 You have no taste. 

837
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,450
 Stand up straight! 

838
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,570
 Why does it have to be that day? 

839
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:34,010
 So that I can change your fate. 

840
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:37,160
 - That's why I don't have any regrets. I'm saying, I'm okay. 

841
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:41,200
 Right. I can change it. That's why I came here. 

842
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,950
 That's probably the reason you and I met again. 

843
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,850
♫  Honestly for me  ♫
