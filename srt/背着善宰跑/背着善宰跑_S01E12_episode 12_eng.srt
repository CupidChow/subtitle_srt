1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,350
   

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,570
   

3
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,430
   

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,520
   

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,350
   

6
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,300
You look happy.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,140
Yeah, I am. I am really, really happy.

8
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,370
So... are you really not going to say anything?

9
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,210
"You were amazing." "I was so touched."

10
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,650
You could say some corny stuff like that.

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,950
Of course, you were amazing.

12
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,010
How much?

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,890
This much.

14
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,340
That's it?

15
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,960
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

16
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,470
♫  You're the spring that I've been waiting for so long  ♫

17
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,380
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

18
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,560
That much?

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,290
Wow. I must have been really amazing.

20
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,380
♫  Even if it's erased again  ♫

21
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,070
When you go back, do I have to sing to 20-year-old Im Sol?

22
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,360
Will she fall for me then?

23
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,700
Did you sing just to show off to me?

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,340
Of course.

25
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:54,340
And I just wanted to sing onstage one more time.

26
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,770
How did it feel?

27
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,350
I don't know if I was moved,

28
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,380
or if it only felt that way because I know my future,

29
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,650
but I know for certain is... my heart was beating.

30
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,550
See? I told you.

31
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:17,060
Oh, and someone gave this to me on my way out.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,000
This is CEO Kim's business card. Right?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,860
What did he say?

34
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,640
He wants to help Eclipse debut. He wants us to sign the contract.

35
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,050
Really?

36
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,560
That's great, Sun Jae! That's so awesome!

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,920
Are you that happy?

38
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,600
Of course!

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,330
I was so scared that I got in the way of your future.

40
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,060
I told you to stop saying stuff like that.

41
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,800
Sun Jae, I want nothing more.

42
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,490
I do.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,430
I wish time would go slower.

44
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:05,820


45
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,230
The flowers are already wilting, too.

46
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,820
   

47
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,400
   

48
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,390
Excuse me.

49
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,360
Where's my dad?

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,090
He's a cop. I heard there was an accident.

51
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,640
All the way down there behind the curtain.

52
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,770
   

53
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,630
Dad...

54
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,880
Are you crying?

55
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,770
Why am I yawning so much?

56
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,880
Huh? Oh, hi Dad.

57
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,680
Did you cry because you thought I was dead?

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,770
Me? When did I cry?

59
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,970
I had to run an errand around here.

60
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,240
- What are you doing here? 
 - Stop putting on a show, man!

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,870
I know you ran over here all worried.

62
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,520
The paramedic made it sound like you were about to die! I got so scared!

63
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,020
I got 20 stitches on my forehead.

64
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,370
I strained my neck a little, too.

65
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,590
I'm the Never Die of the Homicide Department, you know.

66
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,450
"Never Die"? You're not immortal.

67
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,900
So? What happened?

68
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,110
 The Jooyang Reservoir murder suspect was arrested today 

69
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,140
 but escaped as he was being transferred. 

70
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,260
 As they drove on mountainous terrain, Kim, the suspect 

71
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,940
 - caused the vehicle to collide on purpose...  
 - Goodness, what happened?

72
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,410
The front of the car is totally smashed.

73
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,040
Is everyone okay?

74
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,860
 The suspect has been deemed publicly wanted by the police. 

75
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,940
Is it broken? Dad, the bathroom door isn't working.

76
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,980
It's because it's an old house.

77
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,990
- We should move to an apartment or something. 
  - His name is Kim Young Soo. 

78
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,550
 He is around 180cm tall with an athletic build. 

79
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,200
 He can be recognized by the long, monolid shape of his eyes. 

80
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,590
 - Police have asked regional precincts for support... 
 - Kim Young Soo? 

81
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,950
 as they search for the suspect who fled. 

82
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,450
 If you have seen this man, please contact the police immediately. 

83
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,280
 Once again, this is a photo of him. 

84
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,560
 Suspect Kim Young Soo is publicly wanted. 

85
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,470
 To prevent more victims of his crime, 

86
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,510
 please contact the police immediately if you have seen him. 

87
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,470
 Jooyang Reservoir murder suspect, Kim Young Soo. 

88
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,390
   

89
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,860
 My dad is chasing after Kim Young Soo, so don't worry about it. 

90
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,190
What? You want me to be here?

91
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,390
Yes. On May 10th.

92
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,750
Could you do a stakeout around this building on that day?

93
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,530
On the 10th? For what?

94
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,870
Are you worried he's going to come back?

95
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,920
He's not going to come back to where he was caught.

96
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,920
He'll... probably come.

97
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,030
If you're anxious, I already made a safety plan for you.

98
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,800
If you're still worried,

99
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,970
how about talking to your family and staying somewhere else for a while?

100
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,590
If Kim Young Soo notices that there are cops around, you won't catch him.

101
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,590
I'm asking you, not because I'm anxious, but because you have to catch him.

102
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,710
Are you thinking of leading him here?

103
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,760
No. That puts you in danger!

104
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,650
You can stop him!

105
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
What are you thinking?

106
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,810
Even if I wanted to explain why I'm being like this or what's going to happen here, I can't.

107
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,600
Please don't ask me any questions and just...

108
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,400
For my safety! Can you just do what I'm asking you?

109
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,950
That's the only way we can catch Kim Young Soo.

110
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,310
 What happens here that day? 

111
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,910
 I told you to just think about yourself. 

112
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,610
 Why are you acting foolishly and letting terrible things happen to you? 

113
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,790
 Just pretend like you don't know me. 

114
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,880
 No matter where I am, what I'm doing, or what happens to me. 

115
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,130
 Please. Please just leave me alone. 

116
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,100
 No matter what happens, Sol... 

117
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,110
 How could I turn a blind eye on you? 

118
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,570
 Why are you trying to handle it by yourself? 

119
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,520
Oppa!

120
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,830
♫  I am your superhero  ♫

121
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,750
Oh, no! She's too cute!

122
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,560
Hyun Joo!

123
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,660
Oppa!

124
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,160
I missed you!

125
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,360
I missed you, too!

126
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,210
♫  Standing by you, I'm loud and proud  ♫

127
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:09,690
♫  Taking strides with you  ♫

128
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,090
♫  It feels like flying, super ultra man  ♫

129
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,740
 What's going on? 

130
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,910
 Did they fall into the water? 

131
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,140
Hey, Sun Jae.

132
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,200
Hyun Joo! Are you okay?

133
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,960
Hey, did you eat something you shouldn't have?

134
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,450
Why did you jump into the water together? Are you Nongae? 
  (16th century patriotic heroine who sacrificed her life by embracing a Japanese general and jumping into water) 

135
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,190
No.

136
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,770
I saw Sol walk by and panicked.

137
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,900
Sol walked by?

138
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,880
Wow, that's a relief.

139
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,340
See, my darling gold bar?

140
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,070
What would you do without me?

141
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:54,360
I know! Princess Hyun Joo is the only one for me.

142
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,320
Wait! Our clothes are all wet. What should we do?

143
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,440
Are you c-c-cold? Should we hug?

144
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,130
H-Hug? Yes?

145
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,990
- So cold! It's too cold! 
 - Cold? Okay, let's go.

146
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,240
- Is it for your major? 
 - No, GE, but it's canceled.

147
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,620
I wish they let us know earlier so I'm not lugging the heavy books around.

148
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,410
Let me.

149
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,640
Let's go.

150
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,810
Mom! Grandma!

151
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,140
Im Geum!

152
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,320
Did they all go out?

153
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,370
I'm coming in.

154
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,100
Hold on a second. I'll drop off the books.

155
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,150
I want to look in your room.

156
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,900
What? Hey, no!

157
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,230
Look at what? There's nothing to look at.

158
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,800
I'm just curious. What does Im Sol's room look like?

159
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,900
It's not always this messy. I'm usually super clean.

160
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,410
Why is this so flimsy? I need to install secure windows first.

161
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,540
What did you say?

162
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,740
Do these windows even lock?

163
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,580
Yeah. They do.

164
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,750
Make sure you lock them before you go to bed.

165
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,710
Oh, the taser you used to carry around. Where is it?

166
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,360
What?

167
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,160
- This thing? 
 - Yeah.

168
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,010
Keep this by your pillow while you sleep.

169
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,090
What's going on with you?

170
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,000
Because someone might take my girlfriend and run.

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Because she's too beautiful.

172
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,370
You know corny lines like that?

173
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,970
Who's going to take me and run?

174
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,600
Who is that?

175
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,150
I thought you said Im Sol was in her GE class.

176
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,660
Maybe it got canceled. What do we do...

177
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,810
Stay here. I'll take care of it.

178
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,980
My hair got caught.

179
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,970
Careful, careful...

180
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,810
Here I go.

181
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,620
Stay here. Don't come out.

182
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,560
I'm sorry.

183
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,870
I told you to stay inside.

184
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,910
Was that door... closed before?

185
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,710
What the heck?

186
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,090
- There's no one there? 
 - No.

187
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,890
Let's go outside.

188
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,170
It's dangerous here. Go call the police. Now.

189
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,560
Oh, okay.

190
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,170
No!

191
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,930
You?

192
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,200
Disgusting.

193
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,670
Hey! How can you say your brother is disgusting?

194
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,510
So, this is when it started, huh? Right here!

195
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,080
You really had to go after my friend?

196
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,280
No, Sol. I pursued him.

197
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,500
What were you two doing in this empty house?

198
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,430
Why is Hyun Joo wearing my clothes?

199
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,060
We came here to change because of unforeseen circumstances.

200
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,690
Look at the pot calling the kettle black.

201
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,550
What about you? What were you doing with him in this empty house?

202
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,480
Sol's books were heavy, so I was helping her drop them off.

203
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,280
Weren't you trying to take advantage of the fact that no one's home?

204
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,510
Do you have 300 of those weenies in there again?

205
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,430
I already explained that those weren't mine.

206
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,950
Don't talk back to me!

207
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,380
Sister, let's just settle this nice and clean.

208
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,760
I approve of your relationship.

209
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,530
You approve of our relationship.

210
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,110
We don't need your approval. We're not breaking up.

211
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,780
Why do you keep talking back to me?

212
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,900
Don't you dare act like you're the boss of him.

213
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,830
"Dare"? Sol, he's your older brother. That's so rude.

214
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,340
W-W-What? Rude?

215
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,040
Cool down. Cool down.

216
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,910
Princess Hyun Joo, you are the only one who cares about me.

217
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:28,750
Sweet gold bar, why do you get treated so badly at home?

218
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,340
You two...

219
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,130
Do you want to get tased again? I don't think you've had enough of the shock!

220
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,290
- Give me your neck. 
 - Sol, calm down.

221
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,950
- Your neck! 
 - Put that thing down.

222
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,880
- What will you do with an apple? 
 - I'll throw it!

223
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,340
- I can throw it, too! 
 - Whoa!

224
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,780
Gosh, that brat! I warned her, and yet—!

225
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,340
If you're really against it, break them up.

226
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,490
 A door closes and a door opens. 

227
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,850
 There's no happiness without paying a price. 

228
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,690
 If I hadn't gotten married, I wouldn't have met my precious babies. 

229
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,610
To do that, the little ones bother me.

230
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,410
The two of them are fated, I guess.

231
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:19,390
If there's a fate that won't change no matter how hard you try,

232
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,510
- it means your choice hasn't changed. 
 - What?

233
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:26,860
Sometimes you know the consequences but make the same choice anyway.

234
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,440
Because you want to.

235
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,350
You're right.

236
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,150
I gave her a chance, but she kicked it out the window.

237
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,170
What can I do?

238
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,000
I guess they're just crazy for each other.

239
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,410
That's right. Just accept that.

240
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,830
By the way, when do you sign?

241
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,890
We haven't heard from In Hyuk yet.

242
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,900
I haven't heard from him for days.

243
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,540
Is something going on with him? I'm worried.

244
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,320
 Who's worrying about whom right now? 

245
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,000
Sol.

246
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,640
- You know... 
 - What?

247
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,320
Nothing. Never mind.

248
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,530
   

249
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,980
   

250
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,560
 May 10th. 

251
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,990
 Could you do a stakeout around this building on that day? 

252
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,320
 He'll probably come. 

253
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,710
May 10th.

254
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:55,510
   

255
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,230
   

256
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,960
Hey, Baek In Hyuk!

257
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,970
What's going on?

258
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,340
Hey, were you home this whole time?

259
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,400
What are you doing here?

260
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,370
- Good morning. 
 - Why are you here?

261
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,970
In Hyuk moved out.

262
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,670
We're using it as our office. Why?

263
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,940
Im Sol, you're here, too?

264
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,770
Are you okay—

265
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,780
He moved out? All of a sudden?

266
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,880
He went into shock after he watched the broadcast.

267
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,360
He packed up and went home. You didn't know?

268
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,670
The broadcast? What broadcast?

269
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,420
   
   

270
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,610
   
   

271
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,620
 Amazing. 

272
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,890
 Hey. Are you crying? 

273
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,870
 Go away. 

274
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,760
Too busy romancing to pay attention to your friend, huh?

275
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,430
Crazy for love, who cares about friendship. Right?

276
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,040
Do you know where In Hyuk's family lives?

277
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,990
How would I know if you don't?

278
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,290
I know.

279
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,850
I was in the first cohort of the Official Eclipse Fan Club.

280
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,990
I even know the color of Baek In Hyuk's family home's roof!

281
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,960
What? Fan club?

282
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,930
Where is it?

283
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,560
But it's a bit far. How do we get there?

284
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,730
Should we take a bus? Or a train?

285
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,890
You can take a car. Why suffer for nothing?

286
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,480
You get rich and the first thing you buy is a foreign car?

287
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,680
You should've invested that money in an apartment.

288
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,390
Geez, you still haven't come to your senses.

289
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,540
What do you think? Awesome, right?

290
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,960
Hey.

291
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,110
Let me introduce you to my Sunny.

292
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,600
Sunny? What the...

293
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,460
- Did you offer to drive so you could brag? 
 - Of course.

294
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,440
If I can't brag, why would I drive you?

295
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,860
The bird poop smell is really not coming out.

296
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,230
Geez! That crappy bird! Seriously!

297
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,220
Pooping on me...

298
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,890
What?

299
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,410
What? Why isn't water coming out?

300
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,790
Is the water out?

301
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,470
My eyes sting.

302
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,870
There's no water in here, either.

303
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,970
Gosh, it stings!

304
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,870
Right, bottled water. Bottled water.

305
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:56,680
Where there's a will, there's a way.

306
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,730
What?

307
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,710
 Dad, the bathroom door isn't working. 

308
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,040
Gosh! No!

309
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,330
My eyes!

310
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,980
No, no, that's just wrong.

311
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,610
No matter. No way.

312
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:29,610
Even if my eyes burn off...

313
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,620
this isn't it...

314
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,400
What should I do about the door?

315
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,840
My phone is outside, too.

316
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,370
Help!

317
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,120
Someone's stuck in here!

318
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,030
 Help! 

319
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,810
 Someone's stuck in here! 

320
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,170
Gosh, du-du-du-du-du. Gosh, my face...

321
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,890
Gosh, my head is shaking with the noise.

322
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,380
I can't tell I'm eating with my mouth or my nose.

323
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,980
Hey!

324
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,250
Tell the dog to stop barking!

325
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,560
Hey, you stupid dog!

326
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,050
No one is going to hear me over all this noise.

327
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:47,480
Construction... The stupid dog...

328
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,030
Gosh, my throat...

329
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,790
I guess I have no choice.

330
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,890
I'll just wait until Sun Jae gets back.

331
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,410
Are you kidding me? Step on the gas!

332
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,500
Hey, what if we hit a rock and it scratches Sunny?

333
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,320
We'll never get there at this pace.

334
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,760
Why did you even get a new car?

335
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,180
Don't let it go to waste.

336
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,220
You know, Korean people are so impatient.

337
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,840
You don't know how to relax.

338
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,050
Look out the window. Enjoy the scenery.

339
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,860
The scenery?

340
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,050
At least, we should be faster than the tractor. Right?

341
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,620
Hey, are we going to the right address?

342
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,540
I think we're almost here.

343
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,010
It's a house with a red roof. You can see it from the beach.

344
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,420
Hey. Isn't that In Hyuk?

345
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,380
- What is he doing? 
 - Baek In Hyuk!

346
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,380
Baek In Hyuk!

347
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,280
Baek In Hyuk!

348
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,310
Hey, Baek In Hyuk!

349
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,610
Hey! Hey, Baek In Hyuk!

350

- Baek In Hyuk! 
 - In Hyuk!

352
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,700
Sun Jae! Are you okay?

353
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,270
- I'm okay. 
 - Baek In Hyuk!

354
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,800
In Hyuk!

355
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,610
- Hey, Baek In Hyuk! 
 - Hey!

356
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,800
Oh, no, no!

357
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,000
Grab him. Get out of there.

358
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,240
What? What are you guys doing here?

359
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,950
Hey, hey, hey.

360
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,600
Get out of there, dude!

361

Hey!

362
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,860
What the?

363
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,380
- Are you guys okay? 
 - Is this why you moved home?

364
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,150
- What? 
 - It's not the end of the world!

365
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,320
You have to give your all! Why die?

366
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,550
What? Who's dying anyway?

367
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,500
I lost my favorite floatie because of you guys!

368
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,750
Where did you all just come from, messing things up?

369
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,420
Seriously?

370
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,160
Geez! You should have told us! My clothes are all wet.

371
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,270
Tell you what? You guys just jumped me!

372
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,610
No! It can't be!

373
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,050
Oh, no! Look over there!

374
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,560
What? What!

375
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,050
What? Sunny!

376
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,950
Sunny! No!

Sun Jae, I heard your father treats In Hyuk like his own son.

391
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,940
I've been meaning to go thank him but haven't.

392
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,110
You like makgeolli. Right?

393
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,500
Here you go.

394
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,210
I'm sorry we don't have much.

395
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,650
I'd have prepared a feast if I'd known you were coming.

396
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,670
I know! In Hyuk's friends are here all the way from Seoul.

397
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,590
They're going to badmouth us for not treating them well!

398

What are you talking about? This is too much!

399
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,880
It's a feast fit for a king.

400
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,040
I still don't think it's enough.

401
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,590
Let me go kill a chicken.

402
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,190
Stop! They'll be stuffed.

403
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,030
Hurry up and eat before he goes to kill a chicken.

Danpo Village? Where's that?

Why did you guys go so far?

417
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,940
How did you manage to sink a car in the ocean?

418
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,160
Also, I know you're a grownup now,

419
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,330
but you can't just stay overnight with a boy!

420
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,760
Sun Jae's friend's parents are here!

If you don't trust me, I can put them on the phone.

Fine, you brat!

423

Anyway, don't be a burden down there.

424
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,560
Make sure you behave around the adults and enjoy yourself.

425
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,300
Okay.

426
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,750
Must be nice to be young.

427
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,490

429
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,800
The water is so cold. Your hands will get dry and crack.

430
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,110
Look how red they are.

431
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,830
It's fine.

432
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,460
Get out of my face and go back to Seoul!

433
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,570
How can we leave?

434
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:40,010
My Sunny is in the cold ocean waters.

- Geez! 
 - It's fine.

436
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,590
Why did I give them a ride? So mad!

437

Hey, does your goat go on walks by itself?

Sol!

500
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,800
Are you really going to quit music?

501
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,730
In Hyuk,

502
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:21,370
I... I'm scared actually.

503
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:25,530
I've always been an athlete and music out of the blue?

504
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,090
I'm choosing a path I haven't been down before.

505
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,690
It's scary.

506
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:35,610
But... I think I could do a good job with you.

507
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,690
I don't know when I'm going to die.

508
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,540
But if the brightest moment of my youth arrives,

509
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,150
I hope it's with you.

510
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,110
What?

511
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,950
Dude.

512
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,840
Listen to you, now that you're dating.

513
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,580
Stop crying. It's not manly.

514
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,210
Hey! Hey! Come on, dude!

515
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,950
- You know I'm strong. Right? 
 - Yes, you're strong. Yes.

516
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,570
Here. Pick.

517
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,340
I pick this one.

518
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,680
It makes me feel better to see you laugh here.

519
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:38,690
I was worried you'd be in shambles, seeing Kim Young Soo on the news.

520
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,710
In shambles? I'm fine.

521
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,680
Why do you keep worrying about me? It's unlike you.

522
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,410
Why? Am I the one who got away from you?

523
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,540
You should've been good to me while you had me.

524
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,640
The ship has sailed.

525
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,240
I know.

526
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,700
I didn't realize it until it had.

527
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,350
What I felt for you was real.

528
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,800
I wasn't using you.

529
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,180
I know all this is too late.

530
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,190
But if that hurt you, I hope you can let it go.

531
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,700
Okay. Thanks for telling me even now.

532
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,340
The most popular guy at school liked me for real?

533
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,800
My self esteem is getting higher.

534
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,550
I'm not as big of an asshole as you think, you know.

535
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,840
I know.

536
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:42,190
I know I said things, but I know you're a good guy.

537
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,620
Can't believe you're calling me a "good guy." Thanks.

538
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,180
Hey! Did you get the ice cream?

539
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,570
Yeah. Pick.

540
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,400
Hey, move.

541
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,440
Where's my phone?

542
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,230
You had it when you called your mom.

543
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,920
Yeah. I put it in my pocket.

544
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,670
Did I drop it somewhere?

545
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,730
You fell while we were chasing the goat earlier.

546
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,090
Maybe you dropped it then?

547
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,760
 Sol! Are you okay? 

548
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,650
 I'm okay. 

549
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,410
I think you're right.

550
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,330
I'll go with you.

551
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,580
You guys can head inside.

552
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,200
   
   

553
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,890
   

554
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,930
   

555
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,000
- What is this? 
 - Huh?

556
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,030
No, it's nothing.

557
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,840
I'll look for it.

558
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,320
Don't go anywhere. Stay here.

559
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,940
I found it!

560
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,980
Sol?

561
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,340
Sol?

562
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,420
Where did she go?

563
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,710
Sol!

564
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,520
Sol!

565
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,360
Im Sol!

566
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,800
Sol! Im Sol! Sol!

567
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,730
Im Sol!

568
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,690
You can't just leave like that! You don't even have a phone!

569
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,780
Sun Jae...

570
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,060
Why are you sitting here like this?

571
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,720
Did you fall?

572
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,390
What?

573
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,930
Oh, I came to see the view, and I tripped.

574
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,680
Let me see.

575
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,520
You're not hurt.

576
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,840
How's your ankle?

577
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,940
You okay? Does it hurt?

578
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,500
Let's hurry up and go.

579
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,390
It's creepy here. I'm scared.

580
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,130
Okay.

581
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,070
I told you not to go anywhere.

582
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:59,760
Why were you walking around by yourself?

583
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,550
I'm sorry.

584
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,480
Why are you so overprotective these days?

585
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,380
Sol,

586
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:13,070
do you... have anything to tell me?

587
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,430
No.

588
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,340
I don't. Why?

589
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,590
Just because.

590
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,990
I hope you can tell me anything that's painful and difficult, without hiding.

591
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,010
I hope you could tell me everything.

592
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:33,400
Don't try to get through it by yourself.

593
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,750
Okay. I will.

594
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,340
 Liar. 

595
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,250
 You won't say anything, so you can protect me. 

596
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,830
 But, Sol, no matter how much you try to hide it from me, 

597
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,900
 I'll go to you that day. 

598
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,850
 This is... my choice  

599
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,880
 that can't be changed. 

600
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,220
Let's go.

601
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,790
Okay.

602
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,290
Gosh, I'm hungry.

603
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:27,360
I've lost my voice from yelling too much.

604
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:32,050
Help me!

605
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,710
Help...

606
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,060
Geez, that just made me hungrier.

607
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,190
I'm starving. When are you coming home, son?

608
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,550
Yes. That's right.

609
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:59,580
I'm going to break that door with this rock-solid body.

610
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,950
I should have thought of this earlier.

611
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:14,600
That old door, it's about time to switch it out anyway.

612
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,670
What's going on?

613
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,810
Where is everyone?

614
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,440
 We're going octopus fishing together. Come to the harbor right away. 

615
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,370
 We're leaving in 30 minutes. 

616
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,090
What's up? What did he say?

617
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,990
They want to go octopus fishing.

618
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,620
Really?

619
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,630
Should we change, then?

620
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,620
Do you want to go?

621
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,660
- Huh? 
 - I don't want to go.

622
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,110
It's been over 30 minutes. Why aren't they coming?

623
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,400
   

624
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,680
Of course.

625
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,020
I knew it.

626
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,900
Dad, let's go.

627
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,610
- Come, come! 
 - Okay.

628
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,170
Get on, hurry. Untie it.

629
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,210
- Come! 
 - Wait! Are you leaving them behind?

630
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:41,670
I don't want to go, either.

631
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:44,390
- Whoa, dude, you're coming to catch octopus with me. 
 - Hey, hey.

632
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:47,820
Get back. Get back on.

633
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,640
Dad! Let's go!

634
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,830
Have a good time, buddy!

635
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,070
No!

636
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:00,110
No!

637
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:15,990
You're going to catch a cold. Why didn't you dry your hair?

638
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,170
I don't know where the hair dryer is.

639
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,310
It's not even my house.

640
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,920
Here.

641
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,310
Eat these.

642
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:43,210
Why are you looking at me? Eat the strawberries.

643
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,060
Just because.

644
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,860
You know, you don't even need to use the conditioner in your hair.

645
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,230
They don't even have any conditioner.

646
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,600
Because you're a p-rince. 
  ("Conditioner/Cream Rinse" sounds like "rinse/rince" in Korean") 

647
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,100
I thought you were quiet.

648
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,020
Oh, are you a deer?

649
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:04,320
- No, why? 
 - Why are you so dear to me?

650
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:09,050
This is embarrassing. Stop.

651
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:10,480
You're not laughing?

652
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,640
Gosh, what perfume are you wearing?

653
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,740
- "Perf" for "u" and "me"? 
 - Correct.

654
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,040
- Is this funny to you? 
 - I'm trying to make you laugh.

655
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,110
I'm telling you, this used to be your thing.

656
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,660
Are you going to eat that by yourself?

657
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:39,670
♫  Just you and I, you and I  ♫

658
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:43,960
♫  You and I, just you and I  ♫

659
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,240
♫  You and I, oh, you and I  ♫

660
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,950
♫  You and I, just you and I  ♫

661
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,820
Soon Dol!

662
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,260
That's right!

663
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,970
Get inside!

664
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,800
I should go to bed now.

665
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,810
Where are you going to sleep?

666
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,340
They told me to sleep in the guest room.

667
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,760
Good night.

668
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,370
Then, where do I sleep?

669
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,010
You?

670
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:41,390
Oh. Maybe the tent over here?

671
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,000
- I'm a guest, too. 
 - What?

672
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,120
Hey!

673
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:53,110
S-S-So what? You want to sleep there, too?

674
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,490
I'm kidding! Don't be so shocked.

675
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,290
Go and get some sleep.

676
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,730
But... if you're scared, call for me.

677
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,100
Why would I get scared?

678
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,190
Sol, you haven't stayed at a country house like this, huh?

679
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,820
It gets really scary at night.

680
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,680
When it's quiet, you can hear everything.

681
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,940
Even a ghost might show up!

682
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,330
Is that so?

683
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,080
I'm not scared of ghosts, though.

684
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,350
Good night!

685
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:34,080
   

686
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:46,130
♫  I feel this strange feeling  ♫

687
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:51,630
♫  My heart is beating, I'm dizzy, I'm just in it  ♫

688
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:57,120
♫  Will it be embarrassing to say, "I miss you"?  ♫

689
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:02,200
♫  Here I go thinking by myself again  ♫

690
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,260
♫  No matter how I try to look away  ♫

691
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,650
♫  I'm feeling ashamed  ♫

692
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,410
What? What's wrong?

693
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,210
There's a ghost over there!

694
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,590
What? A ghost?

695
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:16,210
Yeah! A virgin ghost wearing white!

696
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,770
You didn't hear a ghost just now?

697
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,560
♫  Can I tell you how I feel  ♫

698
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,640
♫  Didn't you feel it too  ♫

699
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,520
It was so scary, wow.

700
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,460
What if she haunts my dreams?

701
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,540
Oh, really?

702
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,230
I'll sleep over there, then.

703
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,700
What?

704
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,020
You want to sleep where the ghost appeared?

705
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:38,780
No.

706
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,230
Are you worried I'm going to try something?

707
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,950
You heard my dad the other day. Right?

708
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:48,280
I'm like oxygen.

709
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,780
I don't have an inch of a naughty thought—

710
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,750
Not even this much.

711
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,570
You really came in because you were scared of ghosts?

712
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,130
Yes!

713
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:02,400
Besides, it's so cold out there!

714
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,930
The draft!

715
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,350
The tent goes like this!

716
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:09,440
The sand keeps blowing in like this!

717
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,990
I can't sleep because the tent keeps—

718
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:14,840
Hey! Just say you want to be with me.

719
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,750
You're not even a good liar.

720
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,590
If I say I want to be near you, will you let me sleep here?

721
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,290
No.

722
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:27,420
Look. It's a divider.

723
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,050
I will not cross this line. Good?

724
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,330
So comfortable.

725
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:35,560
What happens if you do?

726
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,360
Didn't you ever draw a line down your desk in grade school?

727
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,770
You mean like, "Anything over this line is mine"?

728
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,000
Exactly.

729
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,490
So, be careful not to cross it.

730
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:47,490
Aren't you tired? Go to sleep.

731
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,690
Why are you crossing the line?

732
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:01,700
I guess I did.

733
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,400
What did I say about crossing the line?

734
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,660
So, is this arm yours now?

735
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:11,100
It's mine.

736
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,460
Fine! Take it.

737
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:17,210
But how? It's not like you can cut it.

738
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,780
This won't do!

739
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,110
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly love with you  ♫

740
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:29,720
Let's just say you're all mine.

741
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,590
♫  You're the spring that I've been waiting for so long  ♫

742
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:37,210
This is nice. Let's sleep like this.

743
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:42,870
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫

744
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,870
What's that sound?

745
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:49,790
It's the sound of a ghost. A ghost.

746
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,640
Wow, so scary.

747
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,580
Sol.

748
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,950
Yeah, Sun Jae?

749
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,640
How long do you have left?

750
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,400
♫  Am I dreaming again  ♫

751
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,510
I'm not sure.

752
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:20,120
I hope you don't have to go back.

753
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,980
♫  Come what may  ♫

754
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,030
I want you to be stuck in time here and never go back.

755
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:30,330
♫  I will come find you  ♫

756
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:37,800
I wish... tomorrow would never come.

757

♫  You're the spring that I've been waiting for so long  ♫

758
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,280
Should we try to break the watch?

759
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,550
Should we?

760
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,350
Let's do it.

761
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,330
♫  Even if it's erased again  ♫

762
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:56,520
Sun Jae.

763
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,780
Yeah, Sol?

764
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:04,460
If I... go back tomorrow,

765
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,590
no...

766
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:09,550
today, all of a sudden...

767
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,730
don't be too sad. Okay?

768
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,120
Okay.

769
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,610
Don't cry. Okay?

770
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,600
I won't.

771
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:55,380
I like you.

772
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:02,390
I thought... I would regret it if I didn't say it and left again.

773
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:04,890
♫  So I had to let it go  ♫

774
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,130
I like you, Sun Jae.

You are my last hope.

785
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,760
What is this?

786
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:30,800
 Hello? Is that Sun Jae's dad? 

787
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,790
Yes!

788
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,220
It's me!

789
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:40,420
Oh, my. What's going on?

790
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:43,130
Please save me.

791
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:46,550
I'm stuck in the bathroom.

792
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:49,130
You're stuck in the bathroom?

793
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,760
Gosh, what do I do?

794
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,060
I'll come open the door right now!

795
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,100
You can't come in.

796
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,180
The door is locked.

797
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,610
Call 911.

798
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:07,320
- 911? 
 - 911!

799
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,220
Are you okay?

800
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,480
Mr. Ryu!

801
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,620
Mr. Ryu! Mr. Ryu!

802
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,720
Mr. Ryu!

803
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:24,480
Hurry up! Please call 911!

804
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,340
 - That door isn't going to open.  
 - Can I just break this?

805
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,270
It won't break! That's why!

806
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:34,630
My rock-solid body from the Marine Corps couldn't break it.

807
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,650
I think I broke my shoulder.

808
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,330
Okay, okay. Back up.

809
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:42,620
 I think my shoulder is dislocated... 

810
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,570
I'm coming in!

811
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,910
Are you okay? Mr. Ryu!

812
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:07,550
Thank you for saving my life.

813
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:17,780
We're having octopus sashimi for dinner tonight.

814
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:22,810
Goodbye... Sunny.

815
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,550
Hey, Kim Tae Sung! Let's go.

816
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,120
You should stay another night.

817
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,060
We have to go back today.

818
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,090
We'll come back to visit.

819
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,810
Want to listen to music?

820
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,840
Sol.

821
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,990
Sol?

822
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,610
Did you just fall asleep?

823
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,930
Where am I?

824
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,070
What's wrong?

825
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:29,740
Why am I here with you?

826
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:36,970
Sol, what's going on?

827
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,650
 Did something happen to you? 

828
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:46,820
 Who are you? 

829
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:51,420
Did you... already...

830
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:56,050
go back?

831
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,890
Let go of me.

832
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,310
- Sol. 
 - Don't follow me!

833
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:04,380
I'm confused.

834
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,140
I'll go home on my own. Sorry.

835
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,520
 If I... 

836
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,520
 go back tomorrow, no... 

837
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,740
 today, all of a sudden... 

838
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:46,260
 don't be too sad. Okay? 

839
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,000
 Okay. 

840
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,050
 Don't cry. Okay? 

841
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,000
 I won't. 

842
01:02:57,310 --> 01:03:05,080
♫  The traces of you that I can't forget  ♫

843
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:12,340
♫  If I could stop, even just for a moment  ♫

844
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:18,350
♫  I would embrace you right there and then ♫

845
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:26,560
♫  All day, I miss you  ♫

846
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:34,640
♫  I want to go back to our time together  ♫

847
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:42,170
♫  No matter what happens, I will remember you  ♫

848
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:44,940
 Im Sol! 

849
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:46,360
 Sol! 

850
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,630
 The future changed. 

851
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:03,020
 Sol! 

852
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:08,610
 Sun Jae, what do we do? 

853
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,400
 I'll change my own fate. 

854
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,780
 So, Sun Jae. 

855
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:18,310
 Please don't come this time. 

856
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:27,020
   

857
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:43,660
   

858
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:06,970
   

859
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:18,950


860
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:23,490
   

861
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:26,680
 We can meet again in the future and come together. 

862
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,330
 I hope this isn't the last time, either. 

863
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:32,590
 She said she was with me? 

864
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:35,500
 Sun Jae, where is Sol right now? 

865
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,050
 You pretended that you went back? 

866
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:40,860
 Detective, please help me. 

867
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:43,640
 You really think Kim Young Soo will come here today? 

868
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,460
 Did the future change? 

869
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,800
 Sun Jae! 

870
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,350
 Sol! 

871
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:56,590
 Sun Jae, maybe we should have never met from the start. 

872
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:02,410
♫  'Cause I'm falling slowly in love with you  ♫
