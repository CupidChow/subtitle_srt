1
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,210
   

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,240
   

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,270
   

4
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,110
   

5
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,750
   

6
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,760
 Are you filming it? 

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,880
 What is that thing? 

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,260
 Look at that! 

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,790
Wow, this is so cool!

10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,000
How could this be?

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,870
   
 Did everyone catch the sky just now? 

12
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,220
 There's been a total eclipse, the biggest one in 61 years. 

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,480
 Watching the moon, only 1/400th the size of the sun, 

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,780
 - slowly swallow the gigantic sun...  
 - Are you ready? It's cold. Get in.

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,920
 - I felt strange somehow.  
 - Are you smelling the money?

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,570
 I feel like something extraordinary is going to happen. 

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,320
 I'm excited for something miraculous to happen to me. 

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,930
- Let's go! 
  - I hope... 

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,530
 something miraculous happens to you listeners, too. 

20
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,970
 We'll start part one with a song. 

21
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,910
♫  Tell me your smallest dream  ♫

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,840
Hey, we're late. Hurry up.

23
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,190
Hello!

24
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,910
 Hello, we are Eclipse! 

25
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,090
♫  And then look at me. I'm your genie  ♫

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,300
Hello.

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,960
Hello, we are Eclipse!

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,900
♫  Get in your dream car and ride. Sit next to me  ♫

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,150
I won't have time then...

30
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,640
♫  Throw everything  ♫

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,690
♫  Even if my heart is full and explodes  ♫

32
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,400
♫  Even if it flies to another star  ♫

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,660
Crazy!

34
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,290
Can I do it then?

35
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,710
Miss Yuri, I'm a huge fan.

36
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,290
Can I tell you a wish?

37
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,000
Sir, you can't do this here.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's okay. He says he's a fan.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,700
What is your wish?

40
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,610
♫  I'm your lucky goddess, tell me your wish  ♫

41
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,160
♫  I'm a genie for you, boy  ♫

42
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,900
♫  Tell me your wish  ♫

43
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,840
Yes! Yes!

44
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,800
Hurry up! Hurry up!

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,950
Don't make any mistakes. Okay? All right, do well!

46
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,910
One, two, three...

47
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,340
 Hello! We are Eclipse! Thank you for having us! 

48
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,940
♫  Tell me your wish  ♫

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,190
 Thank you for your introduction, wonderful members of Eclipse. 

50
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,110
 We have some things that newcomers have to do... 

51
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,400
I should paint your nails, prettily

52
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,280
in your favorite color, yellow.

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,110
Yellow...

54
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,830
 Your songs, Eclipse... 

55
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,640
Sol.

56
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,010
Look out the window.

57
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,960
The weather is so clear and nice out today. It's amazing!

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,510
Should we go for a walk?

59
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,140
They say only laying still in bed isn't good for you.

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,540
You should practice with the wheelchair, too.

61
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,900
Let's move a little.

62
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,880
- Okay? 
  - Hello! 

63
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,570
 I'm busy. I don't have time to say hello. Who is this? 

64
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,240
 My name is Baek In Hyuk, leader of the new pop group Eclipse. 

65
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,230
 What? You're a bitch?  
  (Misheard his name "In Hyuk" as "Ee Nyun") 

66
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,330
- She said "bitch." 
  - Oh, no. 

67
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,410
Oh, no! Sol!

68
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,500
That must hurt. Are you okay?

69
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,820
 - With the members of Eclipse today...  
 - Sol.

70
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,170
 we're testing how well known they are. 

71
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,990
 Oh, really? 

72
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,960
 Ma'am, I'll give you a special hint. 

73
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,000
 A guest who visits out of nowhere on a hot summer day. 

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,140
I'm sorry. I clipped it way too short.

75
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,950
Let me go and get some cream for it.

76
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:44,380


77
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,480
I can't do this...

78
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,170
 - The correct answer is a rain shower! 
 - Oh, a rain shower... 

79
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,640
 Thank you for answering our call. 

80
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,580
 You didn't succeed, but... 

81
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,200
 what kind of show is "Ham Seung Yeon's Ten-Ten Friends"? 

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,670
 It's a program that is as kind as In Hyuk's overflowing confidence.  

83
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,520
 We'll make sure to send you a gift for answering the phone, Grandmother.  

84
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:16,590
 We'll send you a red ginseng set for lasting health. 

85
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,190
- Congratulations. 
  - Congratulations! 

86
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,860
Now, right onto the second challenge.

87
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,410
After In Hyuk...

88
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,620
How about you, Sun Jae? Up for the challenge?

89
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,080
Oh, sure.

90
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,400
Your phone is ringing.

91
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,180
They're not picking up the phone.

92
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,850
Will Sun Jae fail without even getting to try?

93
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,610
That is so loud. I can't take it.

94
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,110
Answer your phone.

95
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,350
Hello?

96
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,600
 Can you hear my voice?  

97
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,170
- What is this? 
  - Hello! My name is... 

98
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,830
 Ryu Sun Jae. 

99
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,140
So?

100
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,050
 Do you know who I am? 

101
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,240
No, I don't.

102
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,300
Have you heard of Eclipse?

103
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,820
 - We debuted two months ago.  
 - I said I don't know.

104
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,720
 Fail! Gosh, so sad. 

105
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay. Hello, thank you for answering our call.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,080
 This is Ham Seung Yeon of Ten-Ten Friends. 

107
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,480
I'm hanging up.

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,710
 One second! We have a gift for you. 

109
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,320
- No thanks. 
  - Isn't the weather so nice these days? 

110
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,130
 We'll send you a pair of running shoes for when you take walks. 

111
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,470
I don't need that.

112
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,860
Oh, then, what kind of gift would you like?

113
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,470
How about a brand new model of an indoor bike?

114
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,170
I said I don't need it.

115
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,740
I don't need stuff like that!

116
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,190
A gift?

117
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,210
Can you make me walk again?

118
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,860
That's what I want.

119
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,330
 If you can't do that, why call me for nothing? 

120
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,160
 Is it fun to make jokes like this? 

121
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,040
How lucky are you guys? Your lives must be so much fun.

122
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,990
Somewhere out there...

123
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,450
there are people who don't want to live because it's so nice out.

124
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,530
So, never call me like this again.

125
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,810
Unless you want me to set your building on fire!

126
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,590
Oh, I'm so sorry...

127
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,700
- It was not our intention... 
 - Hey.

128
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,400
Are you still listening?

129
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,710
 You're listening, right? 

130
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,700
Mom! Mom! Turn this off—

131
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,230
 Thank you... for being alive. 

132
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,770
It's a relief that you're alive.

133
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,930
The ones by your side...

134
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,200
  will say thank you for that.  

135
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:27,660
 So... live today. 

136
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,600
 Because it's nice outside. 

137
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,380
I hear it's going to rain tomorrow.

138
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,560
Then... while waiting for the rain to stop...

139
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,010
try to live again.

140
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,350
 Then, someday... 

141
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,040
 a day might come when living doesn't feel so bad. 

142
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,540
- My goodness... 
  - To the person who picked up the call 

143
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,480
 and our listeners, we'd like to express our gratitude and apologies. 

144
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,760
What's wrong?

145
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,560
Oh, no...

146
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,940
 Now, we'll listen to "Rain Shower" by Eclipse. 

147
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,430
 See you again soon at part two of Ham Seung Yeon's Ten-Ten Friends. 

148
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,420
♫  Once again today you seep into my heart  ♫

149
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,120
Cry it out. It's all right.

150

♫  You are a gift from the heavens  ♫

151

It's all right.

153
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:34,150
♫  Just like a sudden shower you came to me  ♫

154
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,610
♫  I'm calling for you again today  ♫

155
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,610
♫  My precious one  ♫

156

♫  Fly toward the sun with all your strength  ♫

♫  Raise up those broken dreams  ♫

164
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,210
♫  I won't miss this chance, those high walls, break it  ♫

165
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,730
♫  Follow the sound of your heart  ♫

166
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,240
♫  Bye-bye to the tears of the past.  ♫

167
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,270
   

168
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,130
♫  The moment I've been waiting for, right now  ♫

169
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,030
Gosh, I sent in my resume forever ago.

170
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,910
If they were going to call, they would have already.

171
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,770
Let's stop dreaming. Just forget it.

172
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,350
Oh my god!

173
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,800
Grandma, what's on your face?

174
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,790
Unni, you are so pretty.

175
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,470
I'm pretty?

176
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,770
H-How did you take that out?

177
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,560
Show me your hand, Grandma.

178
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,290
Hmph!

179
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,400
Where did she learn to talk like that?

180
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,810
- Grandma! 
 - Hmph!

181
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,130
I said, give it to me!

182
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,410
Grandma! Grandma!

183
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,450
Hello!

184
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,790
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

185
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,500
- Mom! Mom!&lt; br&gt; - What now?

186
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
This lady is scary.

187
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,300
You called me "unni" just a minute ago.

188
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,130
That belongs to Sun Jae.

189
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,130
If it gets scratched, I'll die!

190
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,740
This is so fun!

191
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,790
Grandma!

192
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,970
- I'm home. 
 - You're home!

193
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,600
Did you spend the night at the office again?

194
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,200
That Manager Kim. I should just quit or something.

195
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,440
- Have you eaten? 
 - I need to take a shower and leave again.

196
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,830
- Again? 
 - Grandma!

197
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,830
Brother! Brother, get it from her.

198
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,940
She'll give it back after she's done playing with it.

199
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,760
He's right.

200
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,910
No!

201
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,200
Mom! Mom!

202
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,340
Okay! kay! Stay still.

203
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,740
Mom! Mom!

204
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,310
If you give that to me, I'll let you watch Secret Jouju.

205
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,840
- Jouju? 
 - Yeah!

206
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,240
 Ding! 

207
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,570
Mal Ja, are you in a good mood today?

208
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,980
- Yes! 
 - Gosh, girl.

209
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,560
What is this thing anyway? Bothering Grandma first thing in the morning.

210
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,140
- Let's watch Jouju! 
 - "This thing?"

211
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,370
I got it at an auction for 3 million won.

212
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,940
Three million?

213
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,120
Three million?

214
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,030
I meant 300. Three hundred (thousand won).

215
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,480
Gosh, I can't talk today.

216
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,750
My brain and my mouth are going head to head these days.

217
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,800
What a passionately devoted wife.

218
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,730
The pure, everlasting love of a fan.

219
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,520
Isn't the concert today?

220
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,550
Yes. The first one in five years.

221
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,030
Hey, Ryu Sun Jae! What happened?

222
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,270
I heard you met Director Park and told him you wouldn't do the movie?

223
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,510
Are you out of your mind?

224
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,050
Sun Jae, I told you...

225
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,750
After filming this one, I'll let you take a break.

226
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,460
I told you I wanted to retire.

227
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,730
Did I ask for a vacation?

228
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,760
Go outside.

229
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,560
Look at all those swarming fans here to see you onstage after so many years.

230
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,520
You'll regret this later, punk!

231
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,410
Regret it?

232
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,610
I won't.

233
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,530
 When a person is at the end of their days, 

234
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,150
 the body remains, but the spirit ascends. 

235
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,600
How can you ask me to edit this so last minute?

236
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,730
I have a really important thing today.

237
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,780
   
 Did you forget that I'm your number one client? 

238
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,290
 I'll hire someone else, then. 

239
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,450
Gosh, don't say that.

240
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,980
"Sam Doo Chun Dal." Isn't that from a TV series?

241
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,920
 You must have loved "Hotel Del Luna." 

242
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,810
Oh, my. Are you Jang Man Wol herself?

243
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,520
That drama portrays reality well.

244
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,110
This world isn't the only one that's progressing.

245
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,510
The underworld is building bridges over rivers, too.

246
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,620
Got it. I wouldn't know since I've never been to the underworld.

247
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,280
Okay, it's done.

248
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,820
   

249
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,350
I'm uploading it right now.

250
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm late!

251
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,420
      
      

252
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,770
I almost forgot the most important thing.

253
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,410
    

254
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,660
Hey, you! Will you keep hypnotizing me like that?

255
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,840
I love you so much.

256
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,690
See you soon.

257
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,540
Bye.

258
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,840
♫  I have zero worries  ♫

259
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,060
♫  Run it again right now  ♫

260
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:30,490
♫  Run it again, whoa  ♫

261
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,370
Are you that happy?

262
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,010
Of course! It's my first time seeing him in person. I'm thrilled to death.

263
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,480
Thanks a lot. I know you're busy.

264
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,900
No need to thank me!

265
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,400
I got a bigger car so I can drive you around for things like this.

266
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,040
Look inside the shopping bag. It's a gift from me.

267
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,840
What is it?

268
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,140
    
 Hey!

269
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,590
It turns out that my friend's brother was in the 13th class of Jagam Boys' High School.

270
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,130
I asked to borrow it.

271
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,510
Oh, my gosh! This is crazy!

272
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,780
Was Sun Jae in homeroom 5 in his last year?

273
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,890
Homeroom 5, homeroom 5, homeroom 5...

274
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,830
He was already so good-looking even then.

275
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,180
I just want to carry him on my back and take off.

276
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,610
Why didn't you, already?

277
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,250
You could have done it if you wanted.

278
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,670
I know. He was in the building right in front of us. Why didn't we notice him?

279
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,060
Why didn't we notice this sparkling boy?

280
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,510
If I had been a fangirl then, I would be a god-tier fangirl.

281
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,430
That's because you were fangirling someone else back then.

282
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,350
Who?

283
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,140
Oh, right! I did.

284
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,670
What homeroom was he in?

285
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,300
He's not in it.

286
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,580
I think it was after your accident.

287
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,000
He got into a group fight with kids from the next school over. It was crazy.

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,800
He was almost expelled but it was covered up by him dropping out.

289
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,820
I didn't know.

290
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,840
- Hey, Hyun Joo. 
 - Yeah?

291
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,290
Can I cut out Sun Jae's photo?

292
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,930
Sure, it's not mine. Do whatever you want.

293
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,530
Explain it well to your friend's brother.

294
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,600
♫  I feel this strange feeling, I'm especially nervous  ♫

295
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,270
♫  My heart is beating, makes me dizzy, it's just me  ♫

296
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,810
♫  Even I, who wants to do it   ♫

297
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,320
 Thank you. 

298
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,750
♫  It would make me feel shy  ♫

299
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,850
♫  I just keep thinking about you  ♫

302
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,130
♫  I want to tell you how I feel  ♫

303
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,470

304
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,650
Unni!

305
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,960
Hey!

306
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,880
- You made it! 
 - How have you been?

307
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,360
Good. You're early!

308
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,590

♫  Love is here, love is here  ♫

314
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,760
What should we eat?

315
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,260
- Tteokbokki? 
 - Sounds good!

316
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,060
Who's fault is it that they haven't played in five years?

317
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,950
Someone might think it's Ryu Sun Jae's solo concert or something.

318
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,220
Is In Hyuk his backup dancer or what?

319
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,390
If he wanted to act, he should've left the group.

320
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,150
One foot in Eclipse, one foot out. What is that?

321
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,000
It's people like that who fuel the disbanding rumors.

322
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,200
Right?

323
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,740
Sun Jae is so sweet to still consider them fans.

324
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,940
Even if they leave mean comments and spread rumors, he just takes it.

325
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,650
One second.

326
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,070
   

327
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,880
- Hello? 
  - Hello! 

328
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,230
My name is Choi Jeong Hoon from Boncinema.

329
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,690
You applied to be an intern, right?

330
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,310
 I'm calling you after looking through your portfolio. 

331
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,330
Oh! Yes! I applied!

332
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,990
 Is there any chance you can come in for an interview right now? 

333
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,140
Right now?

334
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,900
 We're in a little bit of a pinch... 

335
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,400
 - If you can't—  
 - I'll be there. I can be there.

336
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,450
Thank you!

337
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,560
Unni, where are you going?

338
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,040
We only have two hours before the doors open.

339
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,090
I have an interview for an internship.

340
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,280
I'll be right back. Stay in line. Okay?

341
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,750
- Don't be late. Okay? 
 - Okay!

342
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,600
 I'll be back. 

343
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,140
   
   

344
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,860
Can I help you?

345
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,670
I just got a call for an internship interview.

346
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,780
Oh, yes!

347
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,610
Oh, yes.

348
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,850
   

349
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,750
 We really do want to work with you, 

350
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,260
 but as you can see, this two-story building doesn't have an elevator. 

351
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,680
 I am so sorry. 

352
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,370
Gosh, that's too bad!

353
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,310
If it wasn't for the stairs, I would have gotten it!

354
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,960
Let's go see Sun Jae.

355
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,650
 Unni, why aren't you coming? They're about to open the doors. 

356
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,580
Oh, hello!

357
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,500
Excuse me! Hello!

358
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,760
I'm so sorry, but could you let me in?

359
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,040
You didn't get inside?

360
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,660
I was trying to rush.

361
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,700
We can't let you in after the official entry time.

362
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,540
I know that it's not allowed, but...

363
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,900
It's the holiday season. I couldn't get a cab.

364
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,810
I got on a bus, and I jumped through so many hoops to get here...

365
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,380
But I'm late.

366
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,000
I could tell you're very good at your job.

367
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,610
Is there anything you could do?

368
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,550
Gosh, I really can't.

369
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,930
I'm so cold.

370
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,140
So cold...

371
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,060
If you show me your ticket, I'll let you in.

372
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,760
Really? Thank you so much!

373
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,820
One second.

374
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,410
Why isn't it here?

375
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,730
I'm screwed.

376
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,500
   

377
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,110
 Eclipse! We love you! Forever! 

378
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,130
 Eclipse! Eclipse! 

379
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,770
♫  Fly toward the sun with all your strength  ♫

380
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,380
♫  Raise up those broken dreams  ♫

381
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,380
♫  I won't miss this chance  ♫

382
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,460
♫  Those high walls, break it, follow the beat of your heart  ♫

383
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,100
♫  Bye-bye to the tears of the past  ♫

384
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,950
♫  The moment I've been waiting for, right now  ♫

385
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,810
♫  I have zero worries  ♫

386
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:37,520
♫  Right now, run it again, run it again  ♫

387
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,150
♫  Oh, baby, don't you worry  ♫

388
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,100
♫  I'll go round and round to meet you  ♫

389
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,110
♫  You saved me like I got your love  ♫

390
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:55,820
♫  I know I'm going to meet you eventually  ♫

391
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,470
♫  Tonight, you shine so bright  ♫

392
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,140
♫  Sometimes when we feel like hiding  ♫

393
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,520
♫  Like those night skies that embrace us  ♫

394
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,710
♫  Spend all your time with me  ♫

395
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:27,270
♫  Just you and I, just you and I  ♫

396
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:32,120
♫  You and I, just you and I  ♫

397
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,410
This next song was our debut number.

398
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,910
It's been a while since we sang it live.

399
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,790
Is Sun Jae talking?

400
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,940
What is he saying?

401
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,510
♫  I wished it would never end  ♫

402
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,500
This wasn't on the setlist.

403
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,650
♫  The day you first came to me  ♫

404
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:23,240
♫  I hoped it wouldn't just be a quick drizzle  ♫

405
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,510
♫  That was what I wished for, so deeply  ♫

406
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,830
♫  Do you know how I feel?  ♫

407
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,270
♫  I've been thinking only of you every day  ♫

408
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:42,400
♫  You bleed into my thoughts once again today  ♫

409
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:50,500
♫  You are a gift from the heavens  ♫

410
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:58,450
♫  In this lonely world I'll protect you  ♫

411
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:07,390
♫  Just like a sudden shower you came to me  ♫

412
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,060
♫  I'm calling for you again today  ♫

413
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:22,070
♫  Someone precious to me  ♫

414
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,960
   

415
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,830
 Please be sure to line up in an orderly manner. 

416
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,850
 This is for those looking for transportation. 

417
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,980
 Please look for bus stops in the area... 

418
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,540
The music is so moving even from outside.

419
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,560
If I had been in there, I might have passed out.

420
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,920
It's the first snow of the year.

421
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,670
Sun Jae must love this.

422
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,660
Let's go!

423
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,590
Could this day get any worse?

424
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Hyung, calm down.

425
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,870
- Hyung! Don't do it! 
 - Shit!

426
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,660
- Hey! 
 - Hyung!

427
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,900
Who do you think I am?

428
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,700
- Use your words! 
 - Let go!

429
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,200
Hyung!

430
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,150
Hyung, please!

431
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,910
How am I hearing that you're retiring from someone else?

432
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,670
Retire? Are you crazy?

433
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,760
Hyung! Hyung! Hyung...

434
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,550
Let's talk later.

435
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,170
I want to be alone right now.

436
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,390
Fine. Do whatever you want.

437
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,560
Why are you guys being like this?

438
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,690
In Hyuk!

439
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,620
Why is the bus stop so far?

440
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,830
Why is this bridge so long?

441
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,980
What?

442
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,650
You can't stop right here!

443
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,530
Good! Let's just keep going a little longer. Okay?

444
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,260
Please?

445
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,850
Huh?

446
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,530
Are you serious?

447
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,290
 We really do want to work with you 

448
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,820
 but as you can see, this two-story building doesn't have an elevator. 

449
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,560
 If you show me your ticket, I'll let you in. 

450
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,090
I'm so cold...

451
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,720
What are you doing?

452
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,510
Is your wheelchair broken?

453
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,460
Oh, yes.

454
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,790
 Hey, mouth! Say something! 

455
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,380
 It's Sun Jae. Why can't you talk? 

456
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,610
You look cold.

457
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,540
T-T-Thank you.

458
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,980
Why are you crying?

459
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,430
I didn't make you cry, did I?

460
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,860
It's just...

461
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,550
I'm so happy.

462
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,670
Actually...

463
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,400
I'm a... f-f-fan.

464
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,410
It looks like it.

465
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,090
   

466
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,370
Funny.

467
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,610
It's been my username for over ten years for the fan club.

468
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,600
I've been a fan since your debut, actually.

469
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,460
I've never strayed.

470
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,160
Thank you.

471
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,950
I should be the one thanking you.

472
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,390
Huh?

473
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,870
 You made me want to live again. 

474
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,580
For everything. I'm grateful for everything.

475
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,410
For existing in this world.

476
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,610
All your fans feel that way.

477
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,760
How are you getting home?

478
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,220
- Well... 
 - Do you want a ride?

479
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,700
- What? 
 - You're a fan of mine.

480
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,160
I can't just leave you here.

481
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,910
I guess my friend is here to get me.

482
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,310
Thank you so much for today.

483
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,230
Take this with you.

484
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,250
W-Wait, h-hold on!

485
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,010
I'm sorry I don't have anything to give you.

486
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:06,490
But you like this, right?

487
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,620
Can I give it to you?

488
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,530
Mom.

489
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,400
Remember the person who saved me in the accident?

490
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,610
Do you remember their name?

491
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:35,110
No. That was forever ago.

492
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,380
Why all of a sudden?

493
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,390
Just because.

494
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,150
Maybe because I met the person who kept me alive? I'm thinking of the one who saved my life.

495
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,430
I feel bad that I didn't get to say, "thank you."

496
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,630
I should have gotten an autograph or something.

497
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:25,600
I feel like I'm dreaming.

498
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,900
What was that?

499
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,600
Did I just hallucinate?

500
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,310
Sun Jae's wrists must be about this thick...

501
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,340
This thick...

502
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,130
What's with this look!

503
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,130
Sun Jae looks so much better in person.

504
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,110
The camera cannot capture his beauty.

505
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,710
Oh, this is crazy. Crazy! Crazy!

506
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,270
I'm not guilty.

507
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,030
Your collarbone is guilty.

508
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,620
Wow. Nice.

509
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,580
Look at this.

510
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,400
   

511
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,200
   

512
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,210
Hey! I just saw Ryu Sun Jae in the lobby.

513
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,270
Really? I'm so jealous.

514
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,510
What's he like? Tall? Wide shoulders? Hot?

515
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,160
His face looks computer-generated.

516
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,390
Hey! Don't keep him to yourself! Let's share—

517
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,610
   

518
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,510
 - Have you seen the article? 
 - What article? 

519
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,810
 This isn't the first time. 

520
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,170
 What if it's real? 

521
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,410
 I don't believe it. The reporters must have gotten it wrong again. 

522
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,830
 A suicide attempt? That doesn't make any sense. 

523
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,570
What are they talking about?

524
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:17,840
He was just in front of my eyes.

525
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,830
The haters must be at it again with the rumors.

526
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,790
   

527
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,310
   

528
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,820
   

529
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,980
   

530
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,700
 Is it Ryu Sun Jae? What can we do? 

531
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,140
 He's not breathing. 

532
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,350
 No, no... 

533
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,370
It can't be true. Is that really Sun Jae? No, right?

534
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,290
It can't be...

535
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,390
 Is he going to be okay? 

536
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,970
   

537
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,460
 He's being transported to Hanguk University Hospital. 

538
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,840
Hanguk University Hospital?

539
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,320
Out of the way! The patient is in critical condition!

540
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,610
Oh, no!

541
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,180
Shock!

542
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,090
- Charge to 150! 
 - Charged to 150!

543
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,740
Charge complete!

544
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,600
Clear!

545
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,620
Charge to 200!

546
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,340
Shock!

547
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:57,370
 Patient Ryu Sun Jae, time of death, January 1st, 2023, 12:00 a.m. 

548
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,070
   

549
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,740
   

550
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,100
S-Sun Jae...

551
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,660
No. It can't be.

552
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,380
No.

553
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,730
   

554
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,570
   

555
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,520
   

556
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,340
   

557
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,860
 You look cold. 

558
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,380
No, no. It can't be.

559
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,020
You were just alive.

560
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,660
   

561
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:49,040
 Thank you... for being alive. 

562
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,240
Sun Jae...

563
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,690
 So live today 

564
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,310
 because it's so nice outside. 

565
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,740
It snowed.

566
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,740
You like the snow.

567
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,410
Why couldn't you stay alive today? Why! Why did you do that?

568
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,230
Sol!

569
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,710
Drifting away in dreamland, huh?

570
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,920
What are you dreaming that made you sob like that?

571
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,400
Bulldog?

572
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,460
Bulldog?

573
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,230
What?

574
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,350
This is a classroom?

575
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:01,140
Of course, it's a classroom. This is not your bedroom.

576
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,480
You're still in dreamland, huh?

577
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,670
Oh. Am I dreaming?

578
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,130
Dreaming?

579
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,510
Look here.

580
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,720
Stand up. Right now!

581
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,710
One, two, three!

582
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,970
Stand in the back of the room until you're awake.

583
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,580
Where were we? Page 64.

584
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,440
Page 64...

585
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,380
What are you doing?

586
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,590
Is it really a dream?

587
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,380
Then maybe...

588
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,880
 Jagam High School! 

589
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,740
Im Sol!

590
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,230
 Hey! Where are you going? 

591
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,360
 Im Sol! 

592
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,640
Where's Ryu Sun Jae?

593
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,820
What?

594
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:01,320
Where is Sun Jae?

595
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:13,100
 We will soon begin a practice game for Park Tae Hwan's 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. 

596
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:20,310
 Athletes, please enter the arena. 

597
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:40,340
   

598
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:06,110
One, two, three, four...

599
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,640
 Today's weather is so nice, isn't it? 

600
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,290
 A brilliant summer is about to begin. 

601
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,240
 The singer Bob Marley once said... 

602
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,660
 "The sun is shining, and the weather is sweet." 

603
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,010
 "Making you want to move your dancing feet now." 

604
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,890
 Your heart beats, and you think of someone dear to you. 

605
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,680
 It's a bright day like that. 

606
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,960
 The present will turn into the past in just a second. 

607
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,690
 The most special moment in our lives 

608
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:42,630
 might just be today, the moment you spend with your loved ones. 

609
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:48,580
 Run to your love before it's too late. Right now. 

610
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:53,550
♫  I'm running to you  ♫

611
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:02,310
♫  Standing at the end of the world that's fast asleep  ♫

612
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:09,250
♫  You look just like a shining star, I'm telling you  ♫

613
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:16,330
♫  Hey, you're my only one star, yeah  ♫

614
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:19,900
♫  You are beautiful memory  ♫

615
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,290
♫  Someone's clumsy first love  ♫

616
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:29,570
♫  Remember that you shine brilliantly  ♫

617
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:34,180
♫  Sometimes when we feel like hiding  ♫

618
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:39,290
♫  Like those night skies that embrace us  ♫

619
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:43,620
♫  I will always be with you  ♫

620
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,800
♫  You're like a shooting star  ♫

621
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,090
♫  You're like a shooting star  ♫

622
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,370
♫  Didn't seem to share the same feelings  ♫

623
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:42,790
♫  So finally I had to let go  ♫

624
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:45,030
Sun Jae!

625
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:48,680
♫  I recollect that day, our night  ♫

626
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:57,000
♫  When I walk the stairs of memories and call your name  ♫

627
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,850
♫  It seems lucid again  ♫

628
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,270
Who is that? Stop her!

629
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:10,180
♫  ♫  Was I waiting inside scattered sense of time  ♫ 

630
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:18,610
♫  One moment, your scent came to me  ♫

631
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:24,690
♫  So you can't disappear, I won't go far away  ♫

632
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:30,590
♫  Don't let go of my hand  ♫

633
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:33,390
Who are you?

634
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:37,930
♫  So you can't disappear, I won't go far away  ♫

635
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,630
It must have been so hard for you to go through this alone.

636
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:44,500
You couldn't tell anyone that you were struggling.

637
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,380
I didn't know how much pain you were in.

638
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,860
I'm sorry that I didn't know.

639
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,150
I love you, Sun Jae.

640
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:04,030
- Didn't you see the "No entry" sign? 
 - Get her out of here!

641
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,050
What? Why? This is my dream. Let me hold onto him!

642
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,780
Sun Jae! I love you, Sun Jae!

643
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,570
 Sun Jae! 

644
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:14,890
 Let me go for a second! 

645
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:17,280
 Sun Jae! 

646
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,020
Let me go for a second! Just a second!

647
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,500
Just a second!

648
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,200
I just need to go in for one minute.

649
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,030
No. Hey, kid.

650
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:28,880
This is a top-secret game, so don't tell anyone about it.

651
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,060
Just once, please!

652
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,390
If you understand go away!

653
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,790
Hey, kid. A-Are you okay?

654
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,600
No, it hurts.

655
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,790
Wait, it hurts?

656
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,560
Why?

657
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:50,230
Why am I not waking up from this dream?

658
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,670
I was looking for Sun Jae's watch.

659
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,610
I found it.

660
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:04,730
I did find it... But then...

661
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,710
No way.

662
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,790
 When a person is at the end of their days, 

663
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:19,860
 the body remains, but the spirit ascends. 

664
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:24,150
 That spirit crosses the bridge over the River of Three Crossings 

665
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,970
 and travels to the Underworld. 

666
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,870
By chance, am I dead?

667
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,390
Hey.

668
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,200
Hey! What are you doing?

669
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:00,600
Hey!

670
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,160
Sorry.

671
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,790
We're dead, right?

672
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,310
What?

673
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,130
Are you a ghost?

674
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:16,020
A ghost?

675
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,650
It's you, Sun Jae.

676
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,790
- Hey, why are you crying? 
 - It's true.

677
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:29,630
I see Sun Jae.

678
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,550
That means I'm dead.

679
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,180
What?

680
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,880
Here. I have the same one.

681
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,100
It's yours, take it.

682
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,760
- It's mine? 
 - Yes.

683
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,160
This is for the best.

684
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,290
I'll go with you.

685
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:49,680
So you don't have to go alone.

686
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,860
But what about my poor mom?

687
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:59,070
Mom! Grandma!

688
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:03,750
No, I haven't crossed this bridge yet. There must be a way.

689
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,330
Let's go back together.

690
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,390
You cannot cross this bridge!

691
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:09,800
I need to if I want to get home.

692
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,910
No.

693
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,680
No, Sun Jae. You can't cross.

694
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,780
Yes, I have to.

695
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,560
No, Sun Jae!

696
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,340
Let's live together.

697
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,790
Let's both live together.

698
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,570
Live together?

699
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,360
Taxi!

700
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,720
- Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! 
 - Sun Jae!

701
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,200
Go straight, please!

702
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,160
Sun Jae!

703
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:40,260
A taxi?

704
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,330
In the Underworld?

705
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,780
   

706
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,250
- Hello? 
  - Where are you? 

707
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,470
 I heard you skipped class! 

708
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:00,900
That is my mom's voice.

709
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,450
 Don't make excuses and come home now. 

710
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:07,930
 If you don't get home within an hour, I'm sending you on the express train to Hell. 

711
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:09,880
Hell?

712
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,030
   

713
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,090
   

714
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,260
 Goodness, Ryu Sun Jae, my little bonito shark! 

715
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,910
Bonito shark? That sounds weird.

716
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:30,650
 Hey. Jo Oh Ryeon was called the "Seal of Asia." 

717
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,910
 Park Tae Hwan is the "Marine Boy." 

718
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:35,100
 You need something, too! 

719
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,260
 Did the game go well today? 

720
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,370
It wasn't even an official game.

721
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,900
But my scores were good.

722
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,300
 That's my son! I'm so proud! 

723
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,120
 I knew you could do it! 

724
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,500
 Is your shoulder okay? 

725
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,810
Of course, it is.

726
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,040
Dad, I'm going to go eat now.

727
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,660
Okay. Talk to you later.

728
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,930
 It must have been so hard for you, going through this alone. 

729
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,920
 You couldn't tell anyone that you were struggling. 

730
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,700
 I didn't know how much pain you were in. 

731
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,830
 I'm sorry that I didn't know. 

732
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,230
 I love you, Sun Jae. 

733
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,320
She's not all there...

734
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,800
Huh?

735
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,320
What? Mine was here.

736
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,560
So why did she give this to me?

737
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:46,050
   

738
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,020
   

739
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:51,160
   

740
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,200
This makes no sense.

741
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,410
It looks exactly like it used to. This whole area was redeveloped.

742
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,830
♫ Just like that. Keep it in the same spot ♫

743
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,590
Mom?

744
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,690
Hey, you! Come over here!

745
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:22,180
You left your backpack at school. Where did you run off to?

746
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,920
Mom? Mom, why are you so young?

747
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,850
Don't try to sweet-talk your way out of this!

748
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,870
Why did you skip class? Where did you go?

749
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:32,350
It's your last year of high school! Why are you being like this?

750
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:35,240
- Hold on, Mom! hold on! 
 - Gosh, seriously!

751
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,710
   

752
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:41,570
2008?

753
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,830
My granddaughter is lucky when it comes to food.

754
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,860
Come in! Have some misugaru. 
  (Grain powder drink) 

755
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,810
Grandma!

756
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:54,770
Oh, my! My goodness. Don't jump!

757
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:57,390
Gosh, you'll hurt my stomach.

758
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:00,480
Grandma, look at me. Who am I?

759
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,920
What do you mean by who? Our baby, Sol.

760
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,880
That's right. I'm Sol.

761
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,830
My goodness.

762
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:16,180
Say it again! My name, please? Say it again.

763
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,340
Sol.

764
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,630
Why are you crying?

765
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:26,150
Who made my Sol cry?

766
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:30,150
- Grandma. 
 - Oh, my.

767
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:41,600
♫  I won't look back at myself when I was shaky  ♫

768
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:53,300
♫  I was swaying and flowed down to somewhere while I cried  ♫

769
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:59,300
♫  My sighs are collecting  ♫

770
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:06,510
♫  and I can't see the happy days  ♫

771
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:12,300
♫  I'll get them back, I won't let them get away  ♫

772
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:18,120
♫  I'll hold onto them, never let them go  ♫

773
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:21,920
♫  Even when the night is gone  ♫

774
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:26,220
   

775
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,450
June...

776
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,320
It's before the accident.

777
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:52,860
Mom...

778
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,790
Grandma...

779
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:56,720
Hey...

780
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,760
Why are you crying?

781
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,430
It's weird...

782
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:09,780
I can't feel my legs.

783
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:12,030
What's wrong with me?

784
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:15,510
I can't remember...

785
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:08,920
 Will I wake up here again tomorrow? 

786
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:26,110
 What if this is just a midsummer night's dream? 

787
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:31,310
 What if when I wake up, everything is gone, like a mirage? 

788
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,730
I can't move my legs.

789
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:03,620
Of course. It was just a dream...

790
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,080
Hey!

791
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,780
What was that?

792
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,050
Geum!

793
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:25,090
Im Geum!

794
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,390
Brother!

795
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:30,200
I'm sorry!

796
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,790
What's this?

797
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,250
 I'm going to school! 

798
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:47,030
 Please make sure to take a small umbrella with you when you go out today. 

799
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:51,220
 Due to atmospheric instability, rain is expected in many places. 

800
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,110
 Especially in the case of Seoul and Gyeonggi, 

801
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:55,990
 the hot air is creating intense rain shower clouds 

802
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:58,810
 and might provide some relief from the heat. 

803
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:04,150
 This rain shower will be brief in the morning. 

804
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:10,700
 No, I don't want to. 

805
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,200
 - How about pizza? 
 - Pizza? 

806
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,650
I should give this back.

807
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:46,210
Sun Jae.

808
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:53,550
   

809
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,390
Sun!

810
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,180
- Did the practice game go well yesterday? 
 - Get away from me.

811
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:04,480
- Did you do well? 
 - Of course, I did.

812
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,870
♫  Wherever I go, there it is  ♫

813
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:17,320
♫  A black cloud of my own  ♫

814
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:28,330
♫  I close the window and close my eyes  ♫

815
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:36,440
♫  But a cold drop of water soon wakes me up  ♫

816
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:44,750
♫  Suddenly, there's a puddle around my ankles  ♫

817
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:54,240
♫  The tears I held back well up in my eyes  ♫

818
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,010
♫  You are the umbrella above my head  ♫

819
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:01,660
♫  Cold rain coming down on my shoulders tonight  ♫

820
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:06,050
♫  I'm too used to having you around  ♫

821
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:09,710
♫  I can't be without you  ♫

822
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:12,990
♫  Alone in the rain  ♫

823
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:24,000


824
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:36,310
♫  You are not by my side  ♫

825
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:41,320
♫  You used to be outside my window with an umbrella  ♫

826
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,600
Why are you crying?

827
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,280
♫  You used to wait for me, I cry  ♫

828
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,120
♫  You are the umbrella above my head  ♫

829
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,650
 Why are you crying? I didn't make you cry, did I? 

830
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:52,890
♫  Cold rain coming down on my shoulders tonight  ♫

831
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:57,010
♫  I'm too used to having you around  ♫

832
01:02:57,010 --> 01:03:00,230
♫  I can't be without you  ♫

833
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:02,320
♫  I need you back in my life  ♫

834
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,250
♫  You are the umbrella above my head  ♫

835
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:10,190
♫  Cold rain coming down on my shoulders tonight  ♫

836
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:13,990
♫  Without you, my world is broken in half  ♫

837
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:18,440
♫  You can't be without me  ♫

838
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,310
   

839
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:28,010
 I really need to be friends with someone. How can I do that? 

840
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:29,120
 Stop it. 

841
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,960
 -Give it up! 
 - No! 

842
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,450
 - Have you seen me before? 
 - Even if I had, I would say no. 

843
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:35,890
 Hey! Hi! 

844
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:37,310
 She likes Kim Tae Sung. 

845
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:39,280
 - Who's Kim Tae Sung? 
 - You don't know who Kim Tae Sung is? 

846
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,340
 - You're Ryu Sun Jae, right? 
 - Who are you? 

847
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,600
 Sun Jae, you can't do this competition. 

848
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,300
 Who are you? 

849
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,740
 Why are you doing this to me? 

850
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,320
 Because I want to protect you. 

851
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,580
 I'm doing whatever I can because I'm trying to keep you alive.
