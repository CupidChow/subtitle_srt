18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,440
Really good.

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,800
You should try some too.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,000
- Let me try.
- Really tasty.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,840
You try it.

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,620
- How is it?
- I think

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,780
I might've mixed up the sugar and salt.

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,280
No worries.

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,300
I've done that too.

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,640
- We're alike.
- This.

27
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,240
- This is good.
- So we're family.

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,080
Let me see this.

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,140
This is good, right?

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,660
You didn't mix up the sugar and salt for this.

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,100
It just has no taste.

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,200
No.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,240
Corn naturally has flavor.

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,180
Try some.

35
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,420
Taste this.

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,040
Duo,

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,460
why do you like playing beach volleyball?

38
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
I think I love the feeling

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,540
of stepping on the sand.

40
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,700
Every time I attack and defend,

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,020
I feel my blood boiling.

42
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,080
So,

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,960
you rebuilt the beach volleyball team,

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
not anyone else.

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,220
Today, I truly understand

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,900
success

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,340
belongs to pure love,

48
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,420
with no room for impurities.

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,040
Don't say that.

50
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,940
I understand you.

51
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,500
We all do.

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Thank you.

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,660
I've caused trouble for you all

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,380
and for our university.

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,060
Let's let those things pass.

56
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,460
We all need to look forward, right?

57
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,140
So, what

58
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,300
are your plans now?

59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,720
I think

60
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,900
Xixi and I need to find

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,240
something

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,600
we can love purely

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,860
and dedicate ourselves to.

64
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,800
Then

65
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,200
fill our remaining time

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,740
with it completely.

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,320
And it won't be

68
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,540
beach volleyball, right?

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,400
Duo,

70
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,300
Xixi and I

71
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,260
are formally leaving the team.

72
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,540
Even though we're leaving,

73
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,320
we've learned a lot

74
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,160
from the matches.

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,700
So,

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,380
no matter where we go,

77
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,900
we'll cheer for you.

78
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,380
Definitely, let's all do our best.

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,440
We can do this.

80
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,220
It feels so nice.

81
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,020
Guys, I'm back.

82
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,260
What's wrong? You all

83
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,660
seem a bit off.

84
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,140
You've heard, right?

85
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,360
Heard what?

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,540
Xiaojing and Xixi just talked to me.

87
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,820
They're leaving the team.

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,520
What?

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,500
What?

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,540
You didn't know?

91
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,860
She told me.

92
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,180
How could this be?

93
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,060
Actually, from training, it was obvious.

94
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,320
They didn't love beach volleyball so much.

95
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,160
It's understandable.

96
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,020
They're leaving,

97
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,880
but do you know

98
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,300
how much this affects us?

99
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
What happened?

100
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,980
Here. See for yourself.

101

(Scandal: Game Bribery)

102
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,660
Because of this,

103
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,360
our Seven-School League

104
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,740
might be canceled forever.

105
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,820
And they think it's our fault.

106
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,640
No way.

107
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
The league has always

108
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,020
been a tradition at Xingang.

109
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,780
Can it just be canceled?

110
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,080
Don't worry.

111
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,620
Don't just believe online rumors.

112
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,280
There's no

113
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,700
official statement yet.

114
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,220
Impossible.

Many sports insiders revealed

118
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,520
that Xingang Sports Bureau is considering

119
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,320
canceling the Seven-School League

120
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,860
- Look!
- from next year.

121
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,020
The procedures for the league.

122
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,760
What's your plan?

123
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,460
You want to organize it?

124
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,360
Yes.

125
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,140
Out with the old, in with the new.

126
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,280
Even if the old league is canceled,

127
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,620
we can start a new one.

128
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,620
We're gonna do it?

129
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,640
I got this from my senior.

130
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,020
It's the league's procedure.

131
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,520
Every detail

132
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,420
is written clearly.

133
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,820
Everyone, take a look.

134
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,240
Though this game is self-organized,

135
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,200
we must

136
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,340
make it professional.

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,100
Look at Article 5.

138
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,220
Teams are selected internally by the schools.

139
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,500
So, for a new game,

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,720
do we need another selection process?

141
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,120
That's too troublesome.

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,760
Many will be discouraged.

143
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,600
Right.

144
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,780
We'll cancel the internal selection.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,560
Every athlete

146
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,380
trains hard.

147
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,680
Why do we have to have

148
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,520
a selection?

149
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,760
This process

150
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,020
drains the athletes' energy.

151
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,960
So, for this game,

152
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,100
I propose a change.

153
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,240
Every athlete who loves beach volleyball

154
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,500
can participate.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,980
That's a good idea.

156
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,480
This way,

157
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,180
everyone has a chance to win.

158
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,760
But don't get excited yet.

159
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,700
Look at Article 8.

160
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,700
The match must be organized by seven schools.

161
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,320
Committee members must be leaders

162
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,380
from the seven schools.

163
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,460
And Article 9.

164
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,940
Funding must be raised
by the organizing committee.

165
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,740
This isn't a small sum.

166
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,800
Additionally,

167
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,480
we need venues,

168
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,880
lots of staff,

169
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,760
and many other things.

170
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,900
These are all problems.

171
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,880
Don't worry.

172
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,020
There will be a way.

173
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,500
Li Guoduo,

174
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,260
this isn't just your problem.

175
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,580
Let's find a way together.

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,460
Hold a new Seven-School League?

177
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,260
It's a good idea, right?

178
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,240
Yes.

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,180
But there are many difficulties.

180
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,100
I've thought of a way.

181
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440

00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,720
This was posted last night, right?

198
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,560
Yes.

199
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,360
Still nothing.

200
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,140
Don't worry. Let's wait.

New Seven-School League recruitment.

204

All volleyball enthusiasts are welcome

205

to join us.

206
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,280
- Shao Nian.
- What's this?

207
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,720
What are you forwarding this?

208
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,540
I thought it was about an art exhibition.

209
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,080
- No.
- Yeah.

210
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,340
- A post.
- What's it to us?

211
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,040
You have many friends.

212
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,960
Help forward it.

213
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,120
I'll give you red envelopes.

214
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,300
- How's that?
- Seriously?

215
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,680
- Really.
- Seriously?

216
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,140
Who has more friends than you?

217
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,440
Didn't you know?

218
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,560
Shao Nian's friends

219
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
have forwarded it.

220
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,520
Stop joking.

221
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,560
Hurry and forward it.

222
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,830
- Post it.
- That girl, right?

223
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,520
Which girl?

224
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,220
She's his girlfriend.

225
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,600
- Girlfriend?
- Really?

226
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,680
No wonder.

227
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,280
Stop joking. Hurry and post it.

228
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,940
Help, help, help.

229
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,680
- Forwarded.
- For his love.

230
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,900
- I forwarded.
- Forwarded.

231
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,360
Where do we forward it?

232
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,600
Shao Nian.

233
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,520
I forwarded it for your love.

234
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,280
- Treat us to a meal.
- Sure, I will.

235
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,850
- Okay.
- A meal.

236
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,670

- Sure.

238
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,360
Great, great, great.

239
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,200
I'll ask her.

240
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,180
(Liang)

241
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,980
- Hello?
- Hello, Weilan.

242
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,280
What did you post in the group?

243
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,380
It's blowing up.

244
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,060
Blowing up?

245
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,900
It's just a promo post.

246
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,200
I knew you didn't check the group.

247
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,400
The group is going crazy.

248
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,600
Your post is a bomb.

249
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,880
It brought out

250
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,040
all the lurkers.

251
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,880
They didn't expect

252
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,200
Chen Weilan

253
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,300
to personally promote.

254
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,100
I'm on the beach volleyball team now.

255
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,800
A friend in the team thought of it.

256
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,580
I'm just helping out.

257
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,660
This friend must be important

258
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,040
to get our cool goddess Chen Weilan

259
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,560
to promote personally.

260
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,880
She's my partner now.

261
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,720
We're very close.

262
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,040
When can I meet her?

263
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,760
Come to Xingang.

264
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,700
I'll introduce you.

265
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,160
Okay.

266
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,360
I'll forward it too.

267
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,560
It'll be popular. Don't worry.

268
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,880
- Thanks.
- It'll gain traction.

269
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,720
Good for you.

270
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,700
- Bye.
- Bye.

271
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,480
Oh, no. I need to rest.

272
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,340
I need a break.

273
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,340

274
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,100

What's it about?

278
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Many think

279
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
the Seven-School League

280
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
will be canceled due to the scandal.

281
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,580
They might think

282
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,120
it's unfair

283
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,200
to athletes

284
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,320
if there's no match,

285
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,460
so they started a new one.

286
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,460
Looks like they're after the championship.

287
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,180
You think

288
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,240
they haven't won a championship,

289
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,400
so they want a new competition

290
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,260
to win one?

291
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,380
Do they think it's easy to win?

292
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,440
Few can win

293
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,420
a championship.

294
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,620

299
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,840
I came to take you home.

300
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,680
Get in the car.

301
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,260
How did you know I'm here?

302
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,300
Did you go to the hospital?

303
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,160
The hospital gave me a day off.

304
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,100
I came for my things.

305
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,440
I just want to know

306
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,540
if you did

307
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,660
what you promised.

308
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,120
I didn't go to find Li Guoduo.

309
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,100
I won't see her again.

310
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,520
Sweetie.

311
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,180
This child

312
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,060
is getting more and more disobedient.

314
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,340
Hello, Ms. Sun.

315
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,180
What are you doing here?

316
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,320
I came to see Duoduo.

317
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,460
I'm about to leave now.

318
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,400
It's late.

319
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,300
Let me drive you home.

320
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,400
That's too much trouble.

321
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,240
Thank you.

322
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,620
It's no trouble. Let's go.

323
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,240
Auntie,

324
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,520
I heard Shao Nian

325
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,160
is interning at the hospital.

326
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,620
You're Shao Nian's friend.

327
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,040
Didn't you know?

328
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,620
He's closer to Li Guoduo,

329
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,800
so I hear

330
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,680
many things about him

331
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,880
from Li Guoduo.

332
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,100
I always tell Li Guoduo

333
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,480
that Shao Nian will become

334
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,680
a great doctor.

335
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,620
She doesn't believe it.

336
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,860
Why doesn't she believe it?

337
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,400
She thinks being a doctor

338
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,280
is tiring and not lucrative.

339
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,880
Her family's situation isn't good,

340
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,160
so she always thinks

341
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,340
about making more money.

342
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,000
But now,

343
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,700
there are those informal matches

344
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,540
where she can earn some money.

345
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,980
Does Li Guoduo play

346
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,380
for money?

347
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,860
Actually,

348
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,660
I feel sorry for her.

349
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,100
My family's situation isn't good either,

350
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,540
so I can't help much.

351
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,080
Let me tell you.

352
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,280
Up until now,

353
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,200
there are 200 teams

354
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,420
willing to sign up.

355
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,300
That means everyone recognizes your effort.

356
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,600
Of course.

357
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Let me tell you.

358
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,820
I know athletes best.

359
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,500
She's Li Guoduo.

360
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,460
She plays informal matches for money.

361
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,700
Really?

362
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,840
And she wants to organize a new league?

363
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,380
I think it's for gambling.

364
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,060
Doesn't our school discipline her?

365
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,640
Who knows?

366
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,380
- Let's go.
- What are you saying?

367
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,500
Hurry. Let's go.

368
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,300
Stop looking.

369
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,480
Duoduo.

370
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,380
What's going on?

371
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,780
Let's talk in the activity room.

372
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,200
Li Guoduo is from Xingang University.

373
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,120
The league was suspended

374
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,280
because one of their players broke the rules.

375
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,420
She wants to sponsor a new game
to make money secretly.

376
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,320
Here's another thing.

377
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,220
Li Guoduo plays informal matches.

378
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,840
Could she be linked

379
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,380
to some gambling organization?

380
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,280
And

381
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
her family isn't well-off

382
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,800
and runs a barbecue stall,

383
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,380
so she has a motive to make money.

384
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,920
Duoduo,

385
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,160
they also dug up your relationship
with Tu Lingling,

386
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,340
saying you're jealous she won the championship.

387
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,980
This is slander.

388
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,960
What should we do?

389
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,380
(Li Guoduo is jealous of Tu Lingling)

390
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,800
Stop.

391
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,680
Where are you going?

392
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,360
I'm going to work at the hospital.

393
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,260
I don't think so.

394
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,620
You're rushing to school to help Li Guoduo.

395
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,220
I've seen the school forum.

396
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,000
Li Guoduo is so desperate

397
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,300
for money.

398
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,560
Can you say

399
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,640
she's not interested in your background?

400
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,300
Mom, Duoduo isn't like that.

401
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,980
This is all nonsense online.

402
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,280
Then why is she organizing the new league?

403
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,460
Because she loves the sport.

404
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,300
Someone who truly loves beach volleyball

405
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,700
couldn't even make it to the finals.

406
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,210
Tu Lingling played with her.

407
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,450
Why did Tu Lingling win the championship?

408
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,930
I think she has bad intentions.

409
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,360
Mom,

410
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,310
you're reasonable.

411
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,720
Why do you suspect her like this?

412
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,930
Duoduo isn't like that.

413
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,380
Whatever she's like,

414
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,720
I don't care.

415
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,500
I hope you keep your word.

416
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:20,980
Go back to your room.

417
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,640
Stick to your promise.

418
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,480
Mom.

419
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,020
I got you leave from the hospital.

420
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,740
Stay at home.

421
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,150
Do you hear me?

422
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,740
(Li Guoduo plays informal matches.)

423
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,060
(New League Recruitment)

424
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,140
(Li Guoduo is simply jealous of Tu Lingling)

425
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,460
Don't you find this strange?

426
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,080
This post suddenly became popular.

427
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,740
Now, so many people are attacking Duoduo.

428
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,360
Do you mean

429
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,260
someone deliberately made this post go viral

430
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,960
to praise Duoduo

431
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,780
and then let her fall?

432
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,780
Actually, no.

433
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,060
I did it.

434
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,240
I just asked some friends

435
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,500
to help forward it.

436
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,680
I just wanted more people to know

437
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,620
about the new league.

438
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,340
I didn't expect this reaction.

439
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,640
No wonder it went viral so quickly.

440
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,300
You asked your friends for help.

441
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,240
It was just a small effort.

442
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,620
We all helped.

443
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,600
It wasn't a small effort.

444
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,440
Without your help,

445
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,760
the new Seven-School League

446
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,980
wouldn't be so popular.

447
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,440
So,

448
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,000
someone saw the post going viral

449
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,840
and got jealous.

450
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,200
That person must want to stop

451
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,620
the new Seven-School League.

452
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,540
The committee has decided

453
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,420
to cancel the league.

454
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,380
In the future,

455
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,100
there will be no more leagues.

456
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,960
Xingang has withdrawn

457
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,060
from the national league.

458
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,100
Now there are people outside the committee.

459
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,650
Why cancel it?

460
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,560
- We trained.
- Hey.

461
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,880
- The league.
- Li caused this?

462
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,480
- Yeah, why?
- It must be related.

463
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,320
It must be related.

464
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,400
- She did it.
- She's here.

465
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,240
Li Guoduo.

466
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,080
You're here.

467
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,660
Look what you've done.

468
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
Give us an explanation.

469
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,840
Don't do this. What are you doing?

470
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,400
- Don't.
- The league is canceled.

471
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,360
Let's find a solution.

472
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,340
Don't just yell here.

473
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,380
- Give us an explanation.
- Yeah.

474
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,840
Give us an explanation.

475
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,930
Why cancel the league?

476
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,920
Calm down, calm down.

477
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,040
I will explain, okay?

478
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,000
Then explain.

479
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,680
- Everyone is waiting.
- Speak.

480
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,200
Can't you be a bit more civilized?

481
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,140
Can't you speak nicely?

482
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,040
Then what should we do?

483
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,060
It's not her fault the league got canceled.

484
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,240
Whose fault is it?

485
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,960
- Is it ours?
- We did nothing wrong.

486
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,800
Yeah.

487
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,540
- Exactly.
- So selfish.

488
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,800
Give me some time.

489
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,860
I'll explain it to you.

490
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,480
What's going on here?

491
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,320
I don't know.

492
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,240
My team members told me

493
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,040
that Li Guoduo is organizing a new league.

494
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,940
Do you know about this?

495
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,400
I don't know.

496
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,760
As a coach,

497
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,080
how can you not know anything?

498
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,080
Let's drop it for now.

499
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,480
Why isn't there any school staff?

500
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,440
- Who are you?
- Yeah.

501
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,740
- What's wrong?
- Whose fault?

502
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,780
Because of you, we all can't compete.

503
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,420
- Everyone!
- This is too much.

504
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,400
Quiet down.

505
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,420
If you have any questions, ask Mr. Li.

506
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,460
Everyone, quiet down.

507
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,020
I am a member of the league's

508
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,680
organizing committee.

509
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,520
I'm Mr. Li.

510
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,460
Everyone, please calm down.

511
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,840
One at a time.

512
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,440
Mr. Li, why cancel the Seven-School League?

513
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,180
- Yeah.
- Why cancel it?

514
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,560
Please be quiet.

515
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,940
As you all know,

516
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,720
in the recent

517
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,500
Seven-School League,

518
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,700
there were some issues.

519
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,820
The organizing committee decided

520
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,160
to cancel Xingang University's

521
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,140
runner-up result

522
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,820
in this match.

523
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,420
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

524
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,020
The fourth place will be the third place.

525
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,340
And we will no longer

526
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,380
hold the Seven-School League in the future.

527
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,060
This is the fairest decision

528
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,340
for all participants

529
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,220
and preserves the dignity

530
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,640
of the Seven-School League.

531
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,040
So, this means our school is withdrawing

532
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,500
from the national league?

533
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,740
- Yes.
- Really, Mr. Li?

534
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,180
- Mr. Li, how will we compete?
- Well.

535
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,480
The organizing committee

536
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,840
believes that players selected

537
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,420
under unfair conditions

538
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,200
cannot represent Xingang University

539
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,620
in the national league.

540
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,000
It's the unanimous decision

541
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,140
of the organizing committee.

542
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,800
Mr. Li,

543
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,160
is it because some students

544
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,300
are organizing a new league

545
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
that you canceled

546
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,820
the original one?

547
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,180
Yeah, exactly.

548
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,320
Wait a minute.

549
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,200
I don't know

550
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,260
about this new league.

551
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,600
The committee

552
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,720
canceled

553
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,560
the league

554
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,240
purely

555
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,100
for fairness.

556
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,620
Nothing else.

557
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,540
Moreover, the committee

558
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,660
has no plans to hold a new season.

559
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,480
This new Seven-School League

560
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,460
you mentioned

561
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,960
has nothing to do

562
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,860
with the committee.

563
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,680
The committee

564
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,020
encourages students

565
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,380
to participate

566
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,680
in scientifically organized,

567
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,020
fair, and just competitions.

568
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,140
You can perform at your best

569
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,980
and it also protects the athletes.

570
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,540
This is all I have to explain

571
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,860
about the league today.

572
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,940
If you have more

573
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,660
detailed questions,

574
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,140
you can check the website.

575
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,860
Thank you for your support.

576
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,860
Mr. Li, wait.

577
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,800
Miss, do you

578
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,140
have any more questions?

579
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,860
I'm the one who organized
the new league online.

580
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,780
It's normal for them to be interested.

581
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,760
Do you know

582
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,420
why I organized the new league?

583
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,560
- Why did you?
- Why?

584
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,060
I know many of you think

585
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,080
it's because I'm jealous of others

586
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,360
winning the championship

587
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,200
in the old league.

588
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,440
Isn't that right?

589
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,260
It's not like that.

590
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,280
I'm happy for every one of you

591
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,620
who won the championship.

592
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,020
I often wonder

593
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,820
if I would win a championship

594
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,660
if I joined the match.

595
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,680
I believe everyone here

596
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,520
is like me

597
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,320
and has imagined themselves

598
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,180
holding the championship trophy.

599
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,220
Some might think

600
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,580
I organized it

601
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,180
because I needed money.

602
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,440
Yes.

603
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,340
My family isn't wealthy.

604
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,020
But the thing I'm most proud of is

605
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,160
since the moment I picked up a volleyball,

606
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,000
I've never wanted

607
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
to give up my dream

608
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,820
of beach volleyball.

609
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,220
In the preliminary rounds before the league,

610
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,460
I lost to my teammate,

611
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,900
so I couldn't join the final league.

612
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,120
I believe many of you have had

613
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,960
similar experiences.

614
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,620
You start with great enthusiasm,

615
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,820
but end up exhausting your energy

616
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,020
competing against your teammates.

617
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,860
Many students are about to graduate

618
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,320
without having the chance

619
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,480
to truly fight hard

620
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,660
on the court.

621
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,880
I know

622
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,540
it's not that we can't compete.

623
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,760
We just lack a real opportunity, right?

624
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,340
Right. Yes.

625
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,360
Mr. Li.

626
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,740
Thinking about this

627
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,420
always makes me sad.

628
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,360
When I learned the league

629
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,460
would no longer be held,

630
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,340
I became even more anxious.

631
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,960
So, I wanted

632
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,500
to organize a new league.

633
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,380
This time, there will be

634
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,940
no preliminary rounds.

635
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,200
Any student who wants to participate

636
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,340
can form a team and sign up.

637
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,680
Really? Anyone can sign up?

638
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,520
That's great!

639
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,800
Mr. Li,

640
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,800
for students who truly love

641
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,100
beach volleyball, winning isn't

642
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,740
the most important thing.

643
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,760
What matters more is

644
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,980
having a chance

645
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,100
to sweat and exert our strength

646
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,240
on the court.

647
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

648
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,000
We need a chance.

649
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,700
- Well said.
- Well said.

650
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,120
That's right.

651
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,960
Well said.

652
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,580
Mr. Li, Mr. Li.

653
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,540
Can the school

654
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,340
reconsider and negotiate

655
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,100
on this matter?

656
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,160
Coach Lu,

657
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,200
are you organizing

658
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,300
the new Seven-School League

659
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,900
that the students mentioned?

660
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,080
Yes, I'm somewhat involved,

661
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,920
but it's mainly

662
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,120
due to the students'

663
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,980
enthusiasm and initiative.

664
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,540
You saw how passionate

665
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,340
Li Guoduo is.

666
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,140
Please reconsider it.

667
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,460
The organizing committee

668
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,980
has decided to cancel the league.

669
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,220
This cannot be changed.

670
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,000
However,

671
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,180
matches organized by each school

672
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,560
are still possible.

673
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,020
But to reach the scale of the previous league

674
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,680
requires significant funding

675
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,620
and investment.

676
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,020
Have you considered all this?

677
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,520
Well.

678
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,800
Ask them to go back.

679
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,220
It doesn't look good.

680
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,600
We can talk later.

681
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,440
Okay.

682
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,940
- Go ahead.
- Alright, thanks.

683
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,740
I don't know what's going on.

684
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,200
We've been waiting so long.

685
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,760
Why haven't they gone out?

686
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,660
Yeah.

687
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,920
We need to find a solution.

688
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,760
Lu.

689
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,520
Coach, how's it going?

690
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,360
What's going on, Lu?

691
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,340
- Tell us.
- Stop keeping us in suspense.

692
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,720
- Let's talk later.
- Come on.

693
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,100
- Don't.
- Tell us now.

694
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,420
- Wen Xin.
- Just tell us.

695
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,580
Have you seen Shao Nian?

696
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,480
He was just

697
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,340
with you in the front.

698
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,060
I'm leaving now.

699
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,660
(Schematic Plan)
Step one.

700
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,580
Form a committee.

701
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,040
This is the first step

702
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,820
and the most crucial step.

703
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,200
I've learned

704
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,040
that without this committee,

705
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,700
the subsequent work cannot proceed.

706
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,200
There are seven schools in total.

707
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,700
We need two people from each school.

708
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,380
What are you thinking?

709
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,480
The role of the committee

710
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,940
is to ensure the smooth progress of all tasks.

711
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,240
Each committee member

712
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,680
has a strict set of review standards.

713
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,820
Not anyone can do this.

714
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,240
True.

715
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,180
Let's look at the second point.

716
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,040
If we can do the second one,

717
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,260
the others will be easy.

718
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,320
The issue of funding in the second point

719
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,340
is not difficult.

720
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,940
I've participated in some matches.

721
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,280
These games were sponsored by companies.

722
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,300
We can seek sponsorship.

723
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,400
That's a good idea.

724
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,920
How about this?

725
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,520
We list companies

726
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,260
that have sponsored volleyball events

727
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,060
and approach them one by one.

728
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,780
That's one approach.

729
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,340
However, I've also considered

730
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,720
that our current

731
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,160
promotional efforts are insufficient.

732
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,320
Forwarding on Moments isn't enough.

733
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,600
We need to find some

734
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,240
influential figures in the community

735
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,600
to record promotional videos

736
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,440
and promote the game.

737
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,340
Where can we find these people?

738
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,940
Lu is here.

739
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,160
I?

740
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,440
I can't do it.

741
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,440
Why can't you?

742
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,020
Of course. You have great connections.

743
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,840
Though this game
is not organized by the school,

744
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,540
its popularity is already high.

745
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,860
If we professionalize and formalize it,

746
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,600
it might even replace

747
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,620
the old league.

748
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,960
Coach, if this succeeds,

749
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,020
you'll become a pioneer.

750
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,420
There are many coaches who can lead teams

751
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,600
but very few

752
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,620
who can organize leagues.

753
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,320
If this works out,

754
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,340
Coach Lu, you'll be the first.

755
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,680
Then coaches like Zhang,

756
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,460
Wang, and Tian

757
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,140
will have to look up to you.

758
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,220
I think she's absolutely right.

759
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,800
I'll go find Lu Daxing

760
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,020
to record a video.

761
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,200
And remember to seek sponsorship.

762
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,040
No problem.

763
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,180
Bro, can you do this?

764
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,800
Why can't I?

765
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,120
I'll first ask Coach Tian, Coach Ma,

766
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
and other coaches.

767
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,240
Finally, I'll ask Lu Daxing.

768
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,180
If he refuses, he's refusing all these coaches.

769
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,060
Hello, everyone.

770
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,560
I'm Lu Daxing, the head coach

772
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,380
I'm here to announce

773
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,700
that registration for the new

774
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,260

775
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,820
by Xingang University is open.

776
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,500
Interested students,

777
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,960
act quickly!

778
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,100

780
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,000
Welcome to sign up

781
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,180
for the new league.

782
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,680
If you love beach volleyball,

783
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,060
you can register for the league.

784
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,880
We're waiting for you

785
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,720
at the new league.

786
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,420
This video is great.

787
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,440
With this

788
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,560
and the list of companies we've compiled,

789
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,900
we can seek sponsorship tomorrow.

790
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,900
We're seeking sponsorship?

791
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,220
Isn't that Lu's job?

792
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,560
After all, I initiated

793
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,480
the new league.

794
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,980
I can't let him do everything.

795
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,840
Don't worry.

796
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,300
I'll help you all the way.

797
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,280
Speaking of which,

798
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,060
I also need to thank you.

799
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,640
Look.

800
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,360
From the moment I came up with the idea

801
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,340
until now,

802
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,940
it's been so smooth

803
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,780
thanks to you.

804
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,780
You should thank another person.

(New Seven-School League Recruitment)

806
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,100
Shao Nian?

807
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,020
I actually only helped half the way.

808
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,580
He also forwarded it.

809
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,640
Otherwise, how could

810
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,020
the post go viral so quickly?

811
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,860
He helped me.

812
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,220
Why hasn't he answered my calls?

813
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,700
Why is he avoiding me?

814
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,840
Sorry.

815
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,680
Our company can't

816
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,700
invest in this project.

817
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,960
Please leave.

818
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,380
Let's try other places.

819
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,340
Cheer up.

820
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,840
Why hit me?

821
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,240
Chen Weilan, you...

822
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,680
Don't run.

823
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,360
Mr. Zhang,

824
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,940
please take a look at our proposal.

825
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,180
It's my personal time now.

826
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,240
No work discussions.

827
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,820
Please don't disturb my mood.

828
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,220
Mr. Zhang, here's the thing.

829
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,340
The previous league was canceled.

830
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,260
Now we want to organize a new one.

831
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,240
You know how popular

832
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,500
beach volleyball is in Xingang,

833
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,560
so we hope you can sponsor us.

834
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,640
If you sponsor us,

835
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,920
you'll be our top sponsor.

836
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,600
- There will be a huge billboard.
- Right.

837
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,500
You'll also get a lot of exposure.

838
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,040
So we hope you can support us.

839
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,880
Please support us.

840
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,180
This young lady has a point.

841
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,320
But this is just

842
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,330
a makeshift operation.

843
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,720
Though we haven't been recognized,

844
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,180
this can definitely work

845
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,720
because the players are very

846
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,630
supportive of us.

847
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,470
Yes.

848
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,400
Here's the thing.

849
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,180
Get the committee's recognition.

850
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,430
Then come back to me.

851
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,320
Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang.

852
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,060
Everything is ready except for your support.

853
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,700
If you could sponsor us,

854
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,770
we'd have the equipment and venue.

855
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,110
And I know you're

856
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,770
an alumnus of Xingang University, right?

857
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,770
If you support our alma mater,

858
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,120
our junior students will

859
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,620
- be grateful to you.
- Definitely.

860
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,880
Young lady,

861
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,330
I'm just a businessman,

862
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,900
doing small business.

863
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,730
You're asking for money

864
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,100
for such a big event

865
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,540
without approval.

866
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,700
How will you spend the money?

867
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,860
How can I commit

868
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:50,950
to this event?

869
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,460
- Mr. Zhang.
- Mr. Zhang.

870
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,950
Mr. Zhang.

871
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,900
The talk was for nothing.

872
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,500
Was he just toying with us?

873
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,360
How are you doing?

874
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,380
He could refuse us.

875
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,820
But why criticize us?

876
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,580
This is more difficult than we thought.

877
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,020
Everyone is struggling.

878
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,120
Let's go.

879
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,960
Wuxin Construction Ltd.

880
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,820
We've been there.

881
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Xiying Steel Ltd.

882
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,140
We've been there too.

883
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,540
Xingyao Rong Food Ltd.

884
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,020
We've been there.

885
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,780
They say Coach Lu is good at this.

886
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,200
But why is he like us?

887
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,100
Nothing too.

888
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,500
Didn't he get us a batch of uniforms?

889
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,940
Do we need uniforms?

890
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,200
Let's see.

891
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,100
There's one more company.

892
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,000
Xinxin Chain Pharmacy Management.

893
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,840
We've not been there.

894
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,560
This company

895
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,780
is the most willing to sponsor

896
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,100
sports events in Xingang City.

897
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,560
At least three times

898
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,800
a year, right?

899
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,680
That sounds good.

900
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,800
The success rate is high.

901
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,300
Why did we miss it before?

902
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,460
Because...

903
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,760
Hello, Mom.

904
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,840
Duoduo, come back.

905
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
We've secured

906
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,680
today's sponsorship.

907
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,570
- Really?
- Yes.

908
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,520
Okay, I'll head back.

909
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,360
Alright, alright.

910
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,560
My mom secured a sponsorship

911
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,540
and wants us to go back.

912
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,600
- Really?
- Really?

913
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,680
- Really?
- Good news.

914
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,520
Let's go.

915
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,900
Mom, Dad.

916
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Come here. Hurry.

917
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,340
My sponsorship arrived.

918
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,520
Auntie, I'll help.

919
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,920
- Okay, okay.
- Come, come.

920
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,160
Mom, is this the sponsorship?

921
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Yes. Let me tell you. The water

922
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,700
is enough for the whole season.

923
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,060
And I told the supplier

924
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,360
to put

925
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,200
our DaFu BBQ's logo on it.

926
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,580
I'm quite a businesswoman, right?

927
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,380
Thank you, Auntie.

928
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,040
- We'll help.
- Sure.

929
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,200
Alright. Thank you.

930
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,640
- It's nothing, Auntie.
- Just this?

931
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,300
Stop standing around and get to work.

932
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,340
Thank you.

We only have this last one left.

937

We don't know if it will succeed.

I'll go. I started this.

Wait for my news.

but our company has no plans

946
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,260
to sponsor competitions.

00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,300
from the NYT

951
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,420
and the seven schools in Xingang.

952
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,860
This is a very formal competition.

953
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,720
If you support it,

954
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,320
It will also be good for the hospital's

955
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,220
reputation.

956
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,400
You're right.

957
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,840
But our company currently

958
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,700
has no plans to sponsor competitions.

959
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,600
Auntie,

960
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,740
this competition's gained wide attention.

961
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,240
So far,

962
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,600
fifty teams have registered.

963
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,280
If you could support us,

964
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,420
it would also greatly enhance

965
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,640
the hospital's publicity

966
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,980
and boost the company's image.

967
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,720
The hospital's reputation

968
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,160
depends on excellent medical skills,

969
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,540
not on advertising sponsorship.

970
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,500
I understand your point.

971
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,720
But Auntie,

972
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,720
this new league

973
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,700
is very different from past formats.

974
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,320
This time, we hope

975
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,360
that all volleyball enthusiasts will

976
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,620
have a chance to participate.

977
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,680
You run a hospital

978
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,220
and bring hope to patients.

979
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,380
Can you also bring

980
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,700
some hope to athletes this time?

981
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,100
All you're saying

982
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,840
is to make me

983
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,740
give the hospital a good name

984
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,940
from my position.

985
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,440
Do you think

986
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,520
I haven't seen the online reviews

987
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,460
of your competition?

988
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,320
Do you think sponsoring this

989
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,140
will bring a good reputation to the hospital?

990
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Auntie, all those online reviews

991
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,080
are deliberately smearing us.

992
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,520
We haven't done anything like that.

993
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,560
This is a dream

994
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,960
for me

995
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,280
and many athletes.

996
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,880
It's a sacred and serious matter.

997
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,720
Enough.

998
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,760
Let me tell you.

999
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,980
As a mother,

1000
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,060
I have to think about my son.

1001
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,600
I absolutely cannot allow you

1002
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,720
to use the new league's name

1003
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,260
to influence Shao Nian.

1004
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,900
Influence Shao Nian?

1005
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,620
My son has a talent for medicine.

1006
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,700
He will become a good doctor.

1007
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,520
He will never waste time and energy

1008
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,420
on such trivial matters.

1009
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Do you think drawing is a trivial matter?

1010
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,580
Hanging out in your club is a waste of time.

1011
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,240
Mom.

1012
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,520
Mom, don't be upset. Duoduo.

1013
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,360
Auntie, you may

1014
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,920
choose not to sponsor our league,

1015
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,300
but you can't slander us.

1016
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,000
Thanks for your time.

1017
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,640
Duoduo.

1018
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,800
Mom.

1019
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,180
(I forgot the proposal.)

1020
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,980
Is this the girl you like?

1021
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,880
Duoduo is not usually like this.

1022
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,580
She was just too anxious about the league.

1023
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,000
Mom,

1024
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,180
are you going to not sponsor the new league?

1025
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,880
Do you want me to sponsor this league?

1026
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,060
Of course, I want you to.

1027
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,600
Mom,

1028
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,920
I've been with them since they started

1029
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,760
planning the league.

1030
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,920
I know how much

1031
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,840
they have put into it.

1032
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,480
We're just one step away, Mom.

1033
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,040
Sweetie, why do you insist

1034
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,200
on liking this girl?

1035
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,760
Mom, just help them out this time.

1036
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,800
I'll agree to anything.

1037
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,640
Okay?

1038
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,960
Mom.

1039
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,000
Alright.

1040
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,120
I agree.

1041
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,320
But

1042
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,440
I have a condition.

1043
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,720
Tell me.

1044
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,820
Choose between the league and Li Guoduo.

1045
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,860
Leave Li Guoduo.

1046
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,580
Cut off all ties with her.

1047
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,040
Sweetie.

1048
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,480
Think it over carefully.

1049
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,600
It's just a volleyball game.

1050
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,740
It happens every year.

1051
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,800
I agree.

1052
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,400
Can you really

1053
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,820
cut ties with Li Guoduo?

1054
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,980
Sorry, Ms. Sun.

1055
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,480
Duoduo.

1056
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,560
Duoduo.

1057
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,920
Duoduo, let me explain.

1058
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,820
Explain what?

1059
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,480
What I said to my mom

1060
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,820
was just to get her to sponsor it.

1061
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,740
But that's not what I heard.

1062
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,720
I had to say that,

1063
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,740
so my mom would agree.

1064
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,560
Shao Nian,

1065
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,280
if this is how we have

1066
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,580
to win sponsorship,

1067
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,780
I'd rather not have it.
