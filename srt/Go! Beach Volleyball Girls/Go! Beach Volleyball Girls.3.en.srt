18
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,060
Bro.

19
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,200
Did you go to see Wang Dong again?

20
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,620
Yes.

21
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,380
I can see that you are not happy.

22
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,080
So I went to see him and asked for some mercy.

23
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,940
Bro.

24
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,320
Why are you meddling again?

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,400
How am I meddling again?

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,900
Aren't you unhappy?

27
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,500
I just want to make you happy.

28
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,640
Besides, he is actually quite kind.

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,720
What's going on?

30
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,320
Is he asking me

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,560
to go to the club and play a match?

32
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,980
No.

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,300
He said, when you are free,

34
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,320
you can play a few games and that's all.

35
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,800
He didn't ask you to keep playing.

36
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,860
I'm not going.

37
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,500
No, Gao.

38
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,720
There's one thing that I just can't figure out.

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,160
He is the coach.

40
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,540
I think it's fine to arrange matches normally.

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,920
Why are you so resistant?

42
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,760
Brother, let me tell you,

43
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,300
Do you think he is

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,800
arranging matches normally?

45
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,140
He is a coach.

46
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,220
He is a teacher.

47
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,060
If he really cares about our school,

48
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,560
and cares about our volleyball team,

49
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,880
will he use this to threaten us?

(Xingang University)

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,700
Shao Nian.

52
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,320
Why did you ask me to come today?

53
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,120
To have a meal together.

54
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,140
Last time we agreed on this.

55
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,380
We are still good friends, right?

56
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,840
Can't good friends have a meal together?

57
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,400
I didn't say no.

58
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,420
But it's Tu Lingling

59
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,560
Is there anything
you want to explain to me today?

60
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,760
What do I need to explain to you?

61
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,520
We have known each other for so many years.

62
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,160
Since I met you,

63
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,880
you and Duoduo have been
playing beach volleyball together every day.

64
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,540
The two of you are like sisters,

65
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,600
together every day.

66
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,020
And I think you and Duoduo

67
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,160
get along particularly well.

68
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,600
But I really want to know it.

69
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,260
Why did you choose to betray her

70
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,780
at this most important moment in life

71
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,640
right before the Gaokao exam?

72
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,420
Shao Nian.

73
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,440
When we are together,

74
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,840
can we not mention her?

75
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,780
Duoduo is our good friend.

76
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,680
Why can't we mention her?

77
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,090
First of all,

78
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,880
according to Li Guoduo's physical condition,

79
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,840
she is not suitable
for playing beach volleyball.

80
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,450
Every achievement she made

81
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,700
is the result of my efforts alone.

82
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,400
I am the one supporting her alone.

83
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,400
When the three of us are together,

84
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,100
she goes wherever she wants to go.

85
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,220
She thinks this thing is good.

86
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,460
And we should just agree with her.

87
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,680
Why? Why is that?

88
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,520
I never thought
you would hold such a big grudge.

89
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,920
But have you ever thought about it?

90
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,160
Shouldn't good friends give to each other?

91
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,740
Yes, it's about giving to each other.

92
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,620
But what did she give?

93
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,600
What did I get?

94
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,720
This is the reason you betrayed her.

95
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,240
Aren't these reasons enough?

96
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,500
Bro.

97
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,920
Stop drawing and go.

98
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,560
Let's go play volleyball.

99
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,300
Don't torture me.

100
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,420
Yesterday Duoduo already tried it with me.

101
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,940
I don't have this talent.

102
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,180
I don't want to play either.

103
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,800
Everyone is not good at it at the beginning.

104
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,500
Practice makes perfect.

105
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
- Let's go.
- I beg you, Gao.

106
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,480
Will you give up on me?

107
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,540
No, if you really want to

108
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,920
prove that you are better than Chen Weilan,

109
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,320
you go fight her one-on-one.

110
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't provoke me anymore. I'm really scared.

111
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,800
Do I still need to prove
that I'm better than her?

112
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,580
At least she

113
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,200
defeated Lang Yueting.

114
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,340
She was just lucky.

115
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,900
She won the game.

116
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,020
So who is the most valuable player?

117
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,220
Lang Yueting.

118
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,080
But Chen Weilan is not
in the National Youth Team, right?

119
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,120
I was just about to ask you about that.

120
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,280
Do you want to join the National Youth Team?

121
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,920
Why are you asking this?

122
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,920
Those people around me,

123
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,140
whether they play beach volleyball,

124
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,600
or play volleyball,

125
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,400
are all aiming for the National Youth Team.

126
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,860
With your skills,

127
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,520
I think it's totally possible for you
to make it into the National Youth Team.

128
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,460
I don't want to.

129
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,960
What's so great about the National Youth Team?

130
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,640
Isn't your idol Lang Yueting also there?

131
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,320
She is she, and I am me.

132
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,540
Didn't you go to Beijing to find her that day?

133
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,380
It's not because of her.

134
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,240
What's wrong, Xia?

135
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,880
You have been feeling down recently.

136
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,800
Have a conflict with Yan Xiaojing again?

137
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,480
Listen to my advice.

138
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,500
Being single is always fun.

139
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,840
Love brings disasters.

140
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,940
Because of the fight we had in Beijing,

141
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,660
Yan Xiaojing has been
in conflict with me for days.

142
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,760
No matter how I apologize to her,
she ignores me.

143
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,320
It's not like you did anything wrong.

144
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,920
There's no need to apologize.

145
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,400
No wonder you're single.

146
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,120
Sometimes admitting a mistake
is not really admitting a mistake.

147
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,460
It's a tactic.

148
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,400
Do you understand?

149
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,540
So sometimes when you say 'I'm wrong,'

150
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,040
it can bring a lot of peace.

151
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,260
But before you admit your mistake,

152
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,180
you need to know

153
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,040
your mistake.

154
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,260
How could I make any mistake?

155
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,280
You'd better stay single.

156
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,620
Xia Liqiang.

157
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,660
Gao Ge.

158
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,880
- Coach.
- Come here.

159
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,940
A few days ago,

160
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,040
what were you two up to?

161
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,400
A few days ago,

162
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,400
we went to relax ourselves.

163
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,700
Yes.

164
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,360
Relax?

165
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,260
You were so relaxed

166
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,600
that you got yourselves famous.

167
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,840
What?

168
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,720
Come and see for yourself.

169
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,400
The two of you are very good.

170
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,000
You were quite agile in the fight.

171
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,880
I'm telling you.

172
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,220
Just wait to be disciplined by the school.

173
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,480
- Coach.
- Coach.

174
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:22,660
Coach.

175
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,980
Coach, let me explain to you.

176
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,480
- Coach.
- Chen Weilan.

177
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,100
Thank you.

178
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,940
You're welcome.

179
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,240
It's comfortable.

180
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,620
I'm happy.

181
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,000
I will be able to go to college soon.

182
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,820
Isn't it just the start of the school year?

183
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,860
Do you have to be so happy about it?

184
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,240
Of course, I am happy. It's college.

185
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,100
Going to college means freedom.

186
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,540
There's not as much academic pressure either.

187
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,120
No one is there to control me.

188
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,500
Let me tell you.

189
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,220
You still have to study hard in college.

190
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,620
Didn't you say that after going to college,

191
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,000
there is less academic pressure,

192
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,880
and I will have time to do other things?

193
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,200
What do you want to do?

194
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,840
Of course, to achieve my dreams.

195
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,850
To become the champion
of the National College Student League.

196
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,090
You sound so confident.

197
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,580
You want to win the championship in one shot.

198
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,320
Isn't it crazy?

199
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,280
It's not too bad.

200
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,360
Beach volleyball is my faith.

201
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,980
I believe that one day,

202
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,200
I will definitely win the championship.

203
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
And

204
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,160
is there any athlete who doesn't want
to win the championship?

205
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,480
Even if it means a lot of effort,

206
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,460
I will not have any complaints.

207
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,160
I must do my best to be the best.

208
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,920
Otherwise, my college life will be wasted.

209
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,000
I believe in you.

210
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,680
You will definitely win the championship.

211
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,280
I can definitely do it.

212
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,620
(Department of Physical Education Office)

213
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,340
Qiang, what's up?

214
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,800
Bro, big trouble.

215
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,860
What happened?

216
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,100
Why are you in such a hurry?

217
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,580
Gao and I watched a game together.

218
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,300
We ended up getting banned
from gaming ourselves.

219
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,240
Banned?

220
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,780
Why?

221
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,240
When we were in Beijing,

222
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,980
during dinner,

223
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,360
we ended up getting into a fight with someone.

224
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,980
There was a girl across from us.

225
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,720
She even took a video of us
and posted it online.

226
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,280
Now the whole school knows about it.

227
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,080
We are going to be punished.

228
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,780
Where are you guys now?

229
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,220
What kind of punishment will the school give?

230
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,420
I'm at the door of the office

231
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,580
of the Department
of Physical Education Office now.

232
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,620
Gao

233
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,200
is having a conversation with the coach inside.

234
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,540
I heard that

235
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,420
Gao

236
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,760
would be suspended for six months.

237
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,500
Actually, this is not a big deal at all.

238
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,540
it's just admitting a mistake.

239
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,960
Just apologize and everything will be fine.

240
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,880
I have already apologized to the coach.

241
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,480
I have also written an apology letter.

242
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,720
Everything is fine on my end.

243
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,840
But Gao is just stubborn.

244
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,800
He just won't admit his mistakes.

245
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,820
The coach gives him a way out.

246
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,100
But he doesn't accept.

247
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,420
Try to persuade him nicely.

248
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,660
Tell him not to confront the school.

249
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,500
Apology?

250
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,820
Impossible.

251
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,820
Let me tell you.

252
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,020
This school has banned you for half a year.

253
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,140
It's too short.

254
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,860
They should ban you for three to five years.

255
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,600
Just let you calm down and you will understand.

256
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,020
No, Coach.

257
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,300
Do you even believe that video?

258
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,220
That's obvious.

259
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,900
They cut out the part
where I yelled at someone.

260
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,480
The fact is not like that.

261
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,560
Is it useful just because I believe in you?

262
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,120
Is it useful?

263
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,980
Now the school has seen this video of you.

264
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
They want to punish you.

265
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,820
Do you know?

266
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,320
Do you know how serious the consequences are?

267
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,620
There is the seven-school league
in the second half of the year.

268
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,640
You don't need to participate.

269
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,560
Fine with me.

270
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,440
I don't care.

271
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,580
What?

272
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,320
You don't care?

273
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,820
The Seven-school League

274
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,260
is directly linked to

275
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,440
the National College Student League.

276
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,360
Based on your level of skill,

277
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,320
it is possible to achieve good results.

278
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,940
If you work harder,

279
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,440
you may be selected
for the National Youth Team.

280
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,410
Don't you care about these things?

281
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,660
Then it's the fault of both sides.

282
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,140
Why should I apologize alone?

283
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,280
This is simply unfair.

284
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,920
Why do you care about fairness now?

285
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,000
In our beach volleyball team,

286
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,740
those who can play well

287
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,440
are you and Xia Liqiang.

288
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,180
You are suspended now.

289
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,320
He will graduate next year.

290
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,560
How do you want me to handle this?

291
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:26,820
Coach.

292
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,920
Just lift my punishment.

293
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,720
Do I have the right?

294
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,760
Do I own the school?

295
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,680
Look at your attitude now.

296
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,260
You didn't even apologize.

297
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,440
How can I explain this to the school?

298
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,060
In any case,

299
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,360
I can't apologize for this.

300
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,220
Because I did nothing wrong.

301
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,100
That woman is also at fault.

302
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,080
Pretty impressive.

303
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,340
The two of us apologized to her.

304
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,020
But she didn't delete the video,

305
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,180
and even posted it online.

306
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,720
Based on Gao's temper,

307
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,740
how could he possibly give in again?

308
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,580
Fine.

309
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,120
Keep being stubborn.

310
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,700
Are they arguing again? Goodness.

311
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,140
I'll send you the video later.

312
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,120
And you can also try to persuade him.

313
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,980
Speaking of the sand volleyball team,

314
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,080
I shouldn't be involved either.

315
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,460
Next semester,

316
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,800
the coach of the women's
volleyball team will retire.

317
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,520
I'm going to volunteer over there.

318
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,000
You're on your own.

319
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,540
So you've been talking for so long.

320
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,080
It is because you're leaving.

321
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,900
Little brat.

322
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,160
It's all because I've spoiled you.

323
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,740
Understood.

324
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,620
Thank you then

325
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,120
for spoiling me for such a long time.

326
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,880
I really can't advise him anymore.

327
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,900
He came out. Bye-bye.

328
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,520
Okay, please send me the video.

329
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,760
Gao. Gao.

330
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,360
How did you talk to him?

331
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,880
I scolded him for a few words.

332
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,760
Gao Ge, what are your plans?

333
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,840
Apologize to her?

334
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,510
I want Chen Weilan to tell the truth.

335
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,440
What? Is she here?

336
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,620
I saw her just the other day.

337
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,800
It's a small world.

338
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,380
In such a big place,

339
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,400
you can't find her either.

340
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,080
This is a problem.

341
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,760
Actually,

342
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,440
this is just a matter of apologizing.

343
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,780
Look, my suspension has been lifted.

344
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,700
If you don't apologize,

345
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,940
you will still be banned.

346
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,340
If you are banned, I won't have a partner.

347
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,140
If I don't have a partner,
I can't play the game.

348
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,440
If I can't play the game, then what?

349
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,380
Wait a moment.

350
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,260
You're just being verbose.

351
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,920
Just say what you want to say.

352
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,460
What I mean is,

353
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,020
we are men.

354
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,280
Just apologize.

355
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,080
Impossible?

356
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,180
Gao.

357
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,520
Listen to me, Gao, listen to me, Gao.

358
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,800
It's the video.

359
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,060
Our school

360
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,680
want to suspend them for six months.

361
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,640
Just based on this video, they
are suspended for six months.

362
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,480
Is it a bit too serious?

363
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,580
I know Gao Ge's personality well.

364
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,420
If it weren't for him,

365
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,960
I wouldn't even be able
to participate in the competition.

366
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,620
And I think

367
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,880
there must be a reason for it.

368
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,640
Sure.

369
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,940
Gao may seem cold and aloof,

370
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,920
but he is actually a very nice person.

371
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,620
Just because of this video,

372
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,960
he is punished.

373
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,680
It's really too strict.

374
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,900
It will be half a year from now

375
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,020
before I can see my idol

376
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,520
showing his style on the field.

377
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,060
How is his injury?

378
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,980
It's nothing major.

379
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,920
Just rest for a few days.

380
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,640
Okay.

381
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,580
Coach Wang.

382
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,640
How come you're here?

383
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,520
Last time that thing didn't work out, right?

384
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,500
What's up today?

385
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,140
I came to see you today because of the issue

386
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,960
of Gao being banned from competition.

387
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,240
You can go back. I'm busy here.

388
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,500
Coach Wang.

389
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,820
You see, Gao's skills are so good.

390
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,900
If he really gets banned,

391
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,200
he will have wasted the past six months.

392
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,100
First of all,

393
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,740
He has been suspended.

394
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,120
It's not me who banned him.

395
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,800
It's the school's decision to ban him.

396
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,380
Besides,

397
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,380
the school had given him a chance before

398
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,300
to apologize.

399
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,520
But he refused.

400
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,760
So what else can we do?

401
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,100
Right?

402
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,020
This matter is already settled.

403
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,960
You should go back.

404
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,340
Well.

405
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,080
Is it too late to apologize
to the head of the school?

406
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,140
Now he wants to apologize again.

407
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,500
Why didn't he do it earlier?

408
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,600
Apologizing verbally is useless now.

409
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,140
Can a written apology work?

410
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,100
If it works,

411
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,780
I'll have Gao write you
a letter of reprimand now.

412
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,660
Then can you help me

413
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,140
talk to the school leaders?

414
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,060
Thank you, Coach Wang.

415
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,260
I'm going to see Gao.

416
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,100
- I'll go first.
- No.

417
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,220
(Ban on Gao Ge due to causing trouble
and being suspended for six months)

418
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,500
(Letter of Apology)

419
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,630
Gao, why are you here?

420
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,920
What's up?

421
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,390
Why look at me like this?

422
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,620
Don't you usually not come to the library?

423
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,870
Why did you come today?

424
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,940
I've been banned. That's why I'm here.

425
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,200
Just killing time.

426
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,440
I just want to feel the atmosphere here.

427
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,100
What are you reading?

428
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,600
I'm reading our professional courses book.

429
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,600
Let me take a look.

430
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,780
This is the textbook
for our professional course.

431
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,240
Let me see.

432
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,940
(Letter of Apology)

433
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,400
Why are you writing this?

434
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,540
It's because

435
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,060
you have been suspended for half a year.

436
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,520
I'll write an apology letter
to the school for you.

437
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,220
No. Gao.

438
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,140
Listen to me, I know it.

439
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,920
I help you write an apology letter
to the school.

440
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,460
It's really not right.

441
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,020
But I think you should give it a try.

442
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,940
It's better if it can be resolved.

443
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,460
If it can't be resolved, there's no harm done.

444
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,760
No harm done?

445
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,460
I was humiliated
by the school and coach like this.

446
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,580
Is there no harm done?

447
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,500
Then my self-esteem is not valuable, right?

448
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
I didn't say your self-esteem is not valuable.

449
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,980
But Gao, you are an athlete.

450
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,380
I think instead of self-esteem,

451
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,580
you should deal with your suspension first.

452
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,760
It's more important.

453
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,660
Shao Nian, let me tell you.

454
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,700
Even if

455
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,840
I can't play beach volleyball anymore,

456
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,040
I won't apologize to them either.

457
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,740
Bro,

458
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,320
I know you are for my sake.

459
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,480
But this matter is important to me.

460
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,010
This is a matter of principle.

461
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,820
(Disciplinary announcement
on campus bulletin board)

462
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,500
Isn't this Gao Ge?

463
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,140
Suspended for six months?

464
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,000
How could this happen?

465
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,920
(Suspension)
This is too serious.

466
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,340
Exactly.

467
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,340
It will cause a lot of inconvenience.

468
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,960
(Ban on Gao Ge)
What's going on with this?

469
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,060
Welcome.

470
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,240
Everyone.

471
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,920
Starting from today

472
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,600
(Welcome new students)
You are a member of the Xingang University.

473
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,020
You have the responsibility and obligation

474
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,500
(Xingang University)
to love this campus

475
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,440
just like your family,

476
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,580
to love your department

477
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,680
just like yourselves.

478
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,760
Strictly abide by campus rules.

479
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,660
Soon,

480
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,120
you'll develop yourselves here.

481
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,500
This will be the cradle of your growth,

482
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,200
and the ferry to success.

483
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,460
After enrollment,

484
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,180
please go to the registration site
of your respective major first.

485
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,900
Fill out the registration form.

486
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,700
The head of each department

487
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,940
will arrange your accommodation

488
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,760
and distribute daily necessities.

489
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,020
(Xingang University)

490
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,620
(Xingang University)

491
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,060
Starting from today,

492
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,720
you are a sophomore student.

493
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,500
You can't be as reckless

494
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,340
as you were in your freshman year anymore.

495
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,400
Professor, I wasn't reckless.

496
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,640
But my academic performance
is also pretty good, right?

497
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,620
Just right

498
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,600
third in the whole department.

499
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,440
If you study seriously,

500
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,160
you can be the top one.

501
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,180
No, professor.

502
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,180
I'm thinking

503
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,820
leaving the top two spots for others,

504
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,400
so they can get the scholarship.

505
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,240
You...

506
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,080
You have good integrity.

507
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,240
You don't care about these material things.

508
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,620
Don't say that, professor.

509
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,220
I'm starting to feel a little embarrassed.

510
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,560
Okay, okay, stop bragging.

511
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,520
Fill out this form.

512
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,980
Just studying medical theory is not enough.

513
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,560
(Scores of students from the Medical School)
Clinical practice is equally important.

514
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,320
I have secured an opportunity for you.

515
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,960
Every weekend this semester,

516
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,760
you will be following the doctor
to apprenticeship.

517
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,340
Professor.

518
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,260
I think this is such a rare opportunity.

519
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,620
Just leave it to those in need.

520
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,820
It's really wasted on me.

521
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,660
This...

522
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,920
I know what you're going to say, Professor.

523
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,840
Didn't you just say

524
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,700
I have good integrity?

525
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,000
Then I have to continue.

526
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,060
You go ahead
and I'll go welcome the new students.

527
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,900
I'm leaving, goodbye.

528
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,860
Shao Nian.

529
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,000
You come back to me.

530
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,880
Such a smart child.

531
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,710
Why isn't he striving for progress?

532
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,960
Students.

533
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,260
Facing the new campus,

534
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,520
new life, and a new starting point,

535
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,460
I believe that you will

536
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,840
cherish the beautiful youth

537
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,520
(Admission Letter)
be determined and hardworking

538
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,660
and sow the seeds of harvest

539
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,700
for the brilliance of tomorrow.

540
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,720
You will submit a satisfactory answer sheet.

541
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,760
I am a college student now.

542
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,400
keep fighting, Li Guoduo.

543
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,680
Go and compose a beautiful movement of life.

544
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,580
Finally, I wish everyone
a successful academic career,

545
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,480
and a beautiful life.

546
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,070
I'm going back to the dorm first.

547
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,000
OK.

548
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,700
The cafeteria is over there, right?

549
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,820
Senior sister, where is the cafeteria?

550
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,800
Duoduo, I'm here.

551
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,020
Where have you been?

552
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,500
I thought you were not going to pick me up.

553
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,680
How could I not come?

554
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,620
What's your major?

555
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,060
- Sports Rehabilitation.
- Sports Rehabilitation.

556
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,760
- I'll take you to register. Let's go.
- OK. Let's go.

557
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,940
Okay, just drop me off here.

558
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,260
You've already helped me a lot.

559
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,300
You can't go up to the dormitory.

560
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,420
I can handle this.

561
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,540
It's okay. I'll help you
carry the suitcase to the top of the stairs.

562
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,900
You go up and tidy up, then come down.

563
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,760
I'll take you out for a meal.

564
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,220
What delicious food will we eat?

565
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,880
There are many delicious restaurants
near the school.

566
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,320
- Let's go.
- Sure, let's go.

567
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,880
Chen Weilan.

568
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,280
It's you.

569
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,540
No, wait a moment.

570
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,500
The two of us

571
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,820
are in the same dormitory.

572
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,780
Do I know you?

573
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,740
I know you.

574
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,840
- Did you forget?
- No no no.

575
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,780
I am Li Guoduo at the Golden Fortune Hotel.

576
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,340
Remember?

577
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,600
The competition.

578
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,660
It's my honor, my honor,

579
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,140
to be in the same dormitory as you.

580
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,860
Sorry, I arrived earlier.

581
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,980
So I chose this side first.

582
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,940
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I'm sorry.

583
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,720
- It's okay. You can choose first.
- I'll pack up my things first.

584
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,940
Shao Nian.

585
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,040
Come help me take a look together.

586
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,020
What's up?

587
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,000
This is the roster of the volleyball team.

588
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,800
Is it for this year's volleyball team?

589
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,640
What are you two doing?

590
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,820
Aren't we supposed to have recruitment
for the beach volleyball team?

591
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,480
I've got the roster for the volleyball team.

592
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,040
Let's recruit a few more people to join.

593
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,640
Don't mess around, Xia.

594
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,000
It would be good
if they don't poach people from us.

595
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,700
(Li Guoduo, Chen Weilan)
Sports Rehabilitation Class 201

596
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,880
Chen...

597
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,940
Chen Weilan.

598
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,580
Let me see.

599
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,820
Was she the one

600
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,960
(Chen Weilan)
who recorded the video of us?

601
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:13,900
It's her.

602
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,160
You guys fought that day.

603
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,000
So it was with this Chen Weilan.

604
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,180
Yes.

605
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,280
We are looking for her.

606
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,260
Chen Weilan and Duoduo are in the same class.

607
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,420
Isn't this also the same dormitory?

608
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,620
How about we go find her?

609
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,900
Ask her to send the original video to us.

610
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,600
Once it's sent out,
won't it clarify everything for us?

611
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,980
Right?

612
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,920
I'm going now.

613
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,060
Gao.

614
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,270
Don't act impulsively.

615
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,620
(Champion)
National Middle School

616
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,300
Volleyball Tournament championship winner.

617
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,720
Is this the championship trophy?

618
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,120
This trophy looks so nice.

619
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,200
Are you just going to leave it
on the bed like that?

620
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,900
Let me help you display it.

621
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,820
It would look great on the table.

622
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,940
Don't touch it.

623
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
Don't touch it.

624
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,790
- But I just put it there.
- No need to.

625
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,640
- That place.
- I'll do it myself.

626
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,180
- It's fine where it is.
- Leave it to me. Really.

627
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,880
- Don't touch my things. I'll do it myself.
- Let me help you arrange it.

628
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,340
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

629
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,160
I didn't mean to do it. I...

630
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,260
No, don't touch it.

631
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,820
Don't. You'll get hurt.

632
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,880
Stop it.

633
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,940
Hello.

634
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,060
Are you a new student?

635
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,440
OK. Go in.

636
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,940
Don't touch it.

637
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,620
Hello.

638
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,360
Chen Weilan, come down here.

639
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,600
Who are you?

640
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,960
Chen Weilan.

641
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,240
It's really you.

642
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,120
It's not easy to find you.

643
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,220
What do you want with me?

644
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,080
Don't waste my time.

645
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,720
Come with me now to clarify the facts.

646
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,020
Let go.

647
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,160
Clarify what?

648
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,460
Last time,

649
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,600
didn't you say you wouldn't post that video?

650
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,580
Why did you still post it online?

651
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,420
What do you mean?

652
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,900
No.

653
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,460
I did forget to delete the video,

654
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,720
but I didn't post it online.

655
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,760
You didn't post it, right?

656
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,220
What is this?

657
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,660
It's not me.

658
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,900
Who else could it be except you?

659
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,280
Stop talking nonsense
and come with me to clarify the facts.

660
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,700
Let go of me.

661
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,340
Why should I go if I didn't do it?

662
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,220
Chen Weilan.

663
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,140
Stay away from me.

664
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,240
Chen Weilan, come back.

665
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,820
What are you doing?

666
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,340
This is a girls' dormitory.
Don't you know about it?

667
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,220
Sorry, aunt.

668
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,180
Fine, Chen Weilan.

669
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,160
You wait for me.

670
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,260
Just go.

671
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,140
What grade are you in?

672
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,440
What's the name of your academic advisor?

673
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,420
(Gymnasium)

674
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,960
Let me introduce everyone to you.

675
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,940
This player is Chen Weilan

676
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,960
from Beijing No. 8 Middle School.

677
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,960
She is an ace spiker. Let's welcome her.

678
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,660
Weilan.

679
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,100
This is our Captain, Song Xuewei.

680
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,200
Just like you,

681
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,440
she is also an ace spiker.

682
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,820
Welcome.

683
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,980
We have heard

684
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,220
there would be a genius volleyball girl

685
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,060
coming to our team.

686
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,160
Please advise me more in the future.

687
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,540
Weilan, join the line.

688
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,020
What's with the arrogance?

689
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,660
- Is everyone here?
- She is a genius.

690
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,500
Coach.

691
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,960
What's your name?

692
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,820
My name is Wen Xin.

693
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,660
Wen Xin.

694
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,240
Don't you know the time of the meeting?

695
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,700
Coach.

696
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,090
When I was riding a bike today,

697
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,280
I accidentally fell down.

698
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,540
Sorry for being late.

699
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,100
Alright. Join the line. Wen Xin.

700
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,940
Don't be late again.

701
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,320
Since some students arrived late,

702
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,060
I'll repeat it again.

703
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,660
This master,

704
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,580
I will be the coach

705
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,420
of the volleyball team.

706
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,300
My name is Wang Dong.

707
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,740
I took a look at

708
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,580
Training plan set by the previous coach.

709
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,980
This semester,

710
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,580
we will continue to train

711
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,420
according to this plan.

712
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,980
- Okay.
- Report.

713
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,020
Wen Xin, go on.

714
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,860
I think our previous training

715
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,380
was a bit too relaxing.

716
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,420
Many basic movements

717
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,780
are not acquired by some members.

718
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,780
So I believe

719
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,420
we should strengthen training in the future.

720
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,700
Good, Wen Xin.

721
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,180
Your suggestion is excellent.

722
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,500
You are quite positive.

723
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,580
Did everyone hear that?

724
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,020
- Yes.
- And,

725
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,940
I think

726
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,940
in the future,
we can regularly conduct some tests

727
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,980
to know the training situation
of the team members.

728
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,540
OK.

729
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,620
Let me think about it.

730
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,260
Okay.

731
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,420
That's it.

732
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,780
Prepare for training now.

733
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,580
Warm up individually.

734
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,500
Let's get started.

735
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,980
Thank you, coach.

736
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,900
Are you OK?

737
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,780
I'm fine.

738
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,780
I am the newcomer, Chen Weilan.

739
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,140
I'm Wen Xin.

740
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,420
Duoduo.

741
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,580
This trophy

742
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,620
is all broken like this.

743
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,060
Do you think you can put it
back together this afternoon?

744
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I think it's tough enough.

745
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,900
You are underestimating me too much.

746
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,940
I am so careful.

747
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,420
This is a matter of minutes for me.

748
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,940
Careful?

749
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,380
Who broke this?

750
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,340
Get up.

751
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,620
Don't use your hands. Use these tweezers.

752
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,460
Don't get your hands hurt.

753
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,620
I really want to know

754
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,460
whose trophy is this.

755
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,300
You pay so much attention to it.

756
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,340
There are words written on it.

757
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,460
Can't you take a closer look?

758
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,620
On the trophy.

759
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,980
National Middle School Volleyball Tournament

760
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,340
championship winner.

761
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,260
This is your trophy!

762
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,780
How is it possible?

763
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,700
I'm not that amazing.

764
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,900
This is Chen Weilan's.

765
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,420
You dared to

766
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,620
break her trophy.

767
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,660
I just saw this trophy

768
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,660
not placed properly.

769
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,580
I wanted to put it

770
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,900
at a really nice place.

771
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,500
But unfortunately it got broken accidentally.

772
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,660
I didn't mean to do it.

773
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,220
I just thought that this trophy

774
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,540
must be very important to her.

775
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,700
And this is also a great honor for her.

776
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,620
I want to return it to her intact.

777
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,420
Considering Chen Weilan's temper,

778
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,580
and you two are in the same domitary,

779
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,900
will she bully you?

780
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,820
You are not allowed to say that about her.

781
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,700
This is not the most important thing.

782
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,060
Could you help me get the trophy quickly?

783
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,980
Please help me quickly.

784
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,500
Okay, you stand by and I'll do it.

785
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,580
This is the biggest one.

786
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,060
- This.
- This one.

787
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:27,170
This.

788
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,260
- Yes, that's right.
- This one.

789
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,500
Then it should be...

790
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,700
Then this one, the one on both sides.

791
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,980
Captain.

792
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,420
I heard that Gao Ge

793
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,500
was banned because of her.

794
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,380
Don't talk nonsense.

795
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,740
Chen Weilan is from Beijing.

796
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,460
How could she have anything to do with Gao Ge?

797
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,780
It's true.

798
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,700
Someone saw Gao Ge this morning

799
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,100
go to the girls' dormitory to find her.

800
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,020
Here.

801
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,140
Check it out.

802
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,340
Although compared to the previous one,

803
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,100
it's a little different.

804
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,420
it's really perfect.

805
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,460
No, it's mainly because

806
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,260
the ones that broke before
couldn't be put back together.

807
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,740
So I used glue to patch it up.

808
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,420
Impressive, Shao Nian.

809
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,740
Thank you.

810
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,060
I'll go return this to her right away.

811
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,420
I hope I can get her forgiveness.

812
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,180
(Champion)

813
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,020
(Xingang University)

814
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,580
Weilan.

815
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,660
Is Weilan there?

816
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,580
Are you fetching water?

817
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,820
Yeah, and you?

818
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,220
Chen Weilan.

819
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,340
I told you.

820
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,620
Just let it be broken.

821
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,540
Why bother trying to piece it back together?

822
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,420
I don't care about this.

823
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,820
How can you not care about this?

824
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,980
This is the National Middle School Volleyball

825
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,060
Tournament championship winner.

826
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,900
So what?

827
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,780
It means you are the best in the country.

828
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,660
You are the most, most, most

829
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,940
most powerful one.

830
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,140
So what?

831
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,380
Do you know why I came to Xingang?

832
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,580
Of course I know.

833
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,140
Others say,

834
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,580
you came to Xingang
because you had nowhere else to go.

835
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,740
Because with your level,

836
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,860
you can go to the sports university.

837
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,740
But I don't think so.

838
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,140
I believe you must be like me.

839
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,420
You know the past glory of Xingang.

840
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,580
After coming here,

841
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,140
you want to rely on your own strength,

842
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,060
and change Xingang

843
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,540
to bring it back to its former glory.

844
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,500
Thank you.

845
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,860
I'm not as noble as you think.

846
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,660
You are.

847
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,100
You are nobler than this.

848
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,660
Auntie. I haven't seen you for a long time.

849
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,660
Still busy so late.

850
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,900
It's too hard.

851
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,100
Take care of yourself.

852
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,340
Go to bed early.

853
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,220
I'm going to fetch water.

854
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,180
- Goodbye, Auntie.
- Goodbye.

855
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,180
- Dormitory Auntie
- Xuewei.

856
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,060
After a summer vacation,

857
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,420
how come you look younger again?

858
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,260
You are really sweet.

859
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,380
The freshmen are here.

860
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,500
You have to worry about them again.

861
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,340
Exactly.

862
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,980
The last incident was so scary.

863
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,540
I suddenly remembered this.

864
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,420
I just saw

865
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,220
an unauthorized device,

866
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,620
but I'm not sure.

867
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,700
Really? Where is it?

868
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,740
Can you take me to have a look?

869
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,860
- Let's go.
- Okay.

870
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,460
Here you are.

871
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,700
Sorry for it.

872
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,460
Thank you.

873
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,060
Slow down.

874
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,060
Sorry about that.

875
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,100
Don't move.

876
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,220
I finally completed it in the afternoon.

877
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,060
Don't move.

878
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,020
Help me turn on the light.

879
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,460
Has the power been cut off?

880
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,700
Well, help me put it here.

881
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,100
- OK.
- Slowly.

882
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,100
Put it here.

883
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,510
Okay,

884
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,620
Li Guoduo, Chen Weilan.

885
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,500
Which one is your locker, Chen Weilan?

886
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,900
This one.

887
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,420
What is this?

888
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,820
It's my device.

889
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,820
What is it for?

890
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,460
It's for treatment.

891
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,900
The school has regulations.

892
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,220
Any unauthorized electrical appliances
are strictly prohibited.

893
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,380
Tomorrow, wait for the school to report you.

894
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,980
- No, auntie.
- Auntie.

895
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,580
- Auntie.
- Auntie.

896
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,100
- I need to use it.
- Auntie.

897
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,980
What's going on?

898
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,500
We ran out of power.

899
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,780
(Campus bulletin board)

900
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,820
So many societies.

901
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,780
Which one do you want to join?

902
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,620
I want to join this one.

903
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,740
Why?

904
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,980
Because it can take a lot of photos.

905
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,340
Like this.

906
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,220
There are also many other options over there.

907
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,300
Swimming is so cool.

908
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,540
Is that so?

909
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,820
There is also ballet.

910
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,420
Which one did you sign up for?

911
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,780
Coach Wang, thank you.

912
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,220
Weilan.

913
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,140
Follow Coach Wang in the future.

914
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,340
Our school's volleyball team

915
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,660
is counting on you.

916
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,660
Rest assured, Secretary Zhou.

917
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,100
Thank you, Secretary Zhou.

918
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,020
Coach, excuse me.

919
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,060
You can go back, Weilan.

920
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,260
- Coach Wang.
- Xuewei.

921
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,380
Was that Chen Weilan just now?

922
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,220
What's wrong?

923
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,020
The dormitory administrator said

924
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,180
she violated the rules
by using electrical appliances

925
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,580
and reported it to Secretary Zhou.

926
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,980
That's quite serious.

927
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,180
Our school wasn't like this before.

928
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,180
It was because of such things

929
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,380
that there was almost a fire.

930
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,620
How is it being handled now?

931
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,500
It's fine. It has been clarified.

932
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,260
That's good.

933
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,220
Do you have something to do?

934
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,660
It's nothing.

935
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,140
Are we going to train today?

936
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,700
Yes.

937
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,500
Didn't Wen Xin suggest

938
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,700
we should train more?

939
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,940
Okay, I'll call Chen Weilan to join us.

940
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,740
No need to.

941
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,620
She just arrived. Let her rest for a day.

942
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,700
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

943
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,500
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

944
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,100
(What's going on here?)

945
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,700
(Is it just because she's from Beijing)

946
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,540
(that she has the privilege?)

947
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,100
I got your stuff back

948
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,060
from the dormitory auntie for you.

949
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:50,980
You're welcome.

950
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,140
How did you get it back?

951
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,780
With my eloquence

952
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,940
and personal charm.

953
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
In fact, I told aunt that

954
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,220
it is not a prohibited appliance.

955
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,980
This is a therapeutic device for athletes.

956
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,380
Just consider it as an educational tool.

957
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,860
Auntie sees me as so adorable.

958
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,900
So she gives it to me.

959
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,820
By the way, Auntie said
its power is quite strong.

960
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,380
So you need to be careful when using it.

961
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,660
Otherwise, it could be dangerous.

962
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,980
Thank you.

963
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,460
In the future,
you should mind your own business.

964
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,540
I helped you.

965
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,780
Why blame me?

966
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,980
(Beach volleyball room)

967
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,940
The recruiting is coming soon.

968
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,820
Aren't you coming with me?

969
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,180
I'm not going.

970
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,460
I'll go find Coach Wang.

971
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,540
Finally you figured it out, right?

972
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,380
Go apologize?

973
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Apologize? Impossible.

974
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,700
I am going to tell Coach Wang

975
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,780
that Chen Weilan knows the truth of the matter.

976
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,300
She must clarify it to me.

977
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,740
Why is he so stubborn?

978
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,900
Coach.

979
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,300
I have joined the volleyball team now.

980
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,060
I can't manage
the beach volleyball team anymore.

981
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,900
I came here just for the volleyball team.

982
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,820
The person who fought with me before

983
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,420
is Chen Weilan from the volleyball team.

984
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,860
If I am punished, what about her?

985
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,260
Doesn't she need to be punished at all?

986
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,420
Do you have any evidence?

987
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,420
She is the evidence herself.

988
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,380
You can ask her.

989
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,140
You came just in time, Wei Lan.

990
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,980
Come here.

991
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,620
I have a question.

992
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,180
The video of Gao Ge fighting.

993
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,020
Have you seen it?

994
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,820
Coah, I'm here

995
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,060
for this matter.

996
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,500
Because of that video,

997
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,700
he has been bothering me.

998
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,020
It's already affecting my life

999
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,260
and also my learning.

1000
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,300
Chen Weilan.

1001
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,180
Are you fabricating facts?

1002
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,300
Are you reporting instead of posting videos?

1003
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,060
How did I report you?

1004
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,660
You reported to our dormitory auntie

1005
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,740
about my matter.

1006
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,980
I? What?

1007
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,460
- What dormitory auntie?
- Stop.

1008
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,820
Don't argue, you two.

1009
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,900
Gao Ge.

1010
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,140
I know you won't say it out loud,

1011
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,260
but you have thoughts
about the ban in your heart.

1012
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,420
You still care a lot.

1013
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,620
Right?

1014
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,540
After all, in the next semester,

1015
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,420
it's the Seven-school League.

1016
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,660
But listen to my advice.

1017
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,820
No matter who started the fight,

1018
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,180
or who provoked first

1019
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,500
the thing you cannot deny

1020
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,860
is that you did get into a fight.

1021
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,300
Right?

1022
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,980
the punishment from the school is justified.

1023
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,460
It's just a matter
of the severity of the punishment.

1024
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,060
Even if you try to

1025
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,140
clarify everything,

1026
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,620
you will still be suspended
for a period of time.

1027
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,220
You are a man.

1028
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,700
You must take responsibility
for what you have done.

1029
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,380
Apologizing is taking responsibility
for yourself.

1030
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,300
- Coach.
- Coach.

1031
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,940
How long will he be suspended for?

1032
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,780
Half a year.

1033
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,900
Coach. It's like this.

1034
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,580
I think, this matter,

1035
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,020
is actually between him and me.

1036
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,100
It can be resolved privately.

1037
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,180
If placed at the school level,

1038
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,260
the punishment is a bit heavy.

1039
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,660
Because he has already apologized to me.

1040
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,020
Chen Weilan, Chen Weilan.

1041
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,740
What do you mean by what you just said?

1042
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,700
It doesn't mean anything.

1043
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,700
I was thinking if you were banned
for a day or two,

1044
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,540
it would be fine.

1045
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,700
I can help you with half a year ban.

1046
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,460
There is no evidence at school now.

1047
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,340
If there is evidence, Coach Wang can help you.

1048
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,660
He?

1049
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,700
I don't have much hope for him either.

1050
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,900
I have a question.

1051
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,660
That video

1052
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,180
is not posted by you, is it?

1053
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,020
Bro, how many times do you want me to say it?

1054
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,260
It's not me.

1055
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,100
You can't understand human language.

1056
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,940
At that store at the time,

1057
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,380
there was only her at the shooting angle.

1058
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,820
But she said the video

1059
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,820
was not posted by her.

1060
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,780
I am really confused
about the truth of this matter.

1061
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,900
I don't believe her.

1062
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,260
Bro.

1063
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,060
It's not a matter
of whether you believe her or not now.

1064
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,780
Let's just go to school together.

1065
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,820
Let's apologize,

1066
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,100
and then it's over.

1067
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,060
We don't need to apologize.

1068
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,500
Even if we need to apologize,

1069
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,700
we have to catch the one

1070
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,660
who is behind the scenes.

1071
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,100
(Beach volleyball room)
Didn't you say we would go recruiting?

1072
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,540
It looks lively over there.

1073
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,460
Why did you bring me to such a remote place?

1074
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,220
Aren't you interested in beach volleyball?

1075
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,540
Look.

1076
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,740
Let's go.

1077
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,700
Gao.

1078
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,580
Gao Ge.

1079
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,980
Long time no see. What are you doing here?

1080
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,260
Is the registration
for the beach volleyball team here?

1081
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,220
He is in charge.

1082
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,860
Gao.
