You guys enjoy it. I'm still busy.

No.

62
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,080
Coach Li,

63
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,970
you've truly convinced me with your skills.

64
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,680
Now, I officially welcome you

65
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,760
to join our beach volleyball team.

66
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,280
No, Duoduo,

67
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,720
you shouldn't drink anymore.

68
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,980
Remember the last time you got drunk?

69
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,140
I still shiver

70
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,180
when I see Uncle Li.

71
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm too scared.

72
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,500
Shao Nian's right.

73
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,080
Stick to juice.

74
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,040
Alright.

75
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,800
I'll toast with juice

76
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,260

- Let's toast to you.
- Together now.

81
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,380
Together.

82
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,420
Coach, thank you.

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,420

- Thank you, Coach.
- Thank you, Coach.

85
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,000
She's my daughter.

86
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,160
The pit was dug by me.

87
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,920
Luckily, I didn't bury myself.

88
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,200
Right, right.

89
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,180
Now that we've got the prize money,

90
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,360
what are your plans?

91
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,360
Spend the prize money and live it up a bit.

92
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,960
What about you, Mascot?

93
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,320
Me?

94
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,060
I'll probably save my prize money

95
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,080
for future needs.

96
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,720
Future needs?

97
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,020
Saving up for a wife, huh?

98
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,100
What are you talking about?

99
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,700
I'm just being prepared for the future.

100
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,140
What do you know? Come on, drink up.

101
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,440
- Come on.
- What about you, Weilan?

102
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,880
Well.

103
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,980
Growing up,

104
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,360
I've always won trophies,

105
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,870
but this is the first time winning prize money.

106
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,460
I'll give the prize money to my grandpa

107
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,300
to make him happy.

108
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,160
Grandpa?

109
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,720
You're so filial.

110
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,520
I want to go on a trip.

111
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,080
Duoduo, what about you?

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,960
Me?

113
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,580
Well, I have big plans for it.

114
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,600
What big plans?

115
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,560
That's a secret.

116
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,160
Come on.

117
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,020
Let's toast again to victory!

118
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,220
- Alright, alright.
- Alright, come on.

119
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,620
- Another toast.
- Thanks, Coach.

120
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,920
Cheers!

121
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,040
It's getting late.

122
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,040
You guys go on with your secrets.

123
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,580
I'm taking my peanuts

124
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,980
and drinks elsewhere.

125
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,480
Coach,

126
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,820
- drink with us!
- Come on.

127
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,700
Yes, eat with us.

128
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,710
- You guys go ahead.
- Drink with us.

129
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,760
- Uncle, drink with us here!
- You guys have fun.

130
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,300
Here, have some shredded potatoes and edamame.

131
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,600
- Fill it up.
- What are you doing?

132
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,800
Can't you see?

133
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,320
What?

134
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,900
Keep him company.

135
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,600
Go.

136
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,120
Come on. Let's drink.

137
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,880
Keep it up!

138
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,940
- Keep it up!
- Keep it up!

141
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,260
Mom, I'm coming down.

142
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,320
We're coming down, Auntie.

143
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,500
How's the food? Is it enough?

144
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,900
- The kebabs smell great.
- Eat more.

145
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,200
- You ate too little.
- How about the drinks?

146
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,900
Respect.

147
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,580
- Fine.
- Mom.

148
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,300
Let's keep going.

149
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,340
Your husband can really drink.

150
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,460
Shao Nian can't keep up at all.

151
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,900
He's going on and on.

152
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,220
Alright, stop teasing me.

153
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,860
Go to Aunt Zhou's place
and get me two dragon fruits.

154
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,540
- I'm running low.
- I'll go get them.

155
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,260
- Okay.
- Thank you.

156
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,700
Mom, you're the best.

157
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,180
Always so thoughtful.

158
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,580
Now you think of me.

159
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,980
I saw you toasting your coach

160
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,180
non-stop earlier.

161
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,500
Why?

162
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,100
Are you jealous?

163
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,420
I'm not jealous at all.

164
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,140
I'm your logistics chief.

165
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,380
I deserve half of the credit.

166
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,060
Of course, all the credit goes to you.

167
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,940
Come on.

168
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,140
You're my beautiful, charming,

169
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,380
and kind-hearted mom.

170
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,100
Love you.

171
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,380
Alright. Don't disturb me.

172
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,860
I'm getting goosebumps here. Go over there.

173
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,340
Let me do it. Go be with your husband.

174
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,740
If he gets drunk, no one can handle him.

175
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,140
- Let me handle it.
- Alright.

176
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,180
I'll go take care of him.

177
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,460
Thinking about the match

178
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,780
makes my hands shake.

179
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,460
Drinking well, huh, Gao?

180
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,380
Of course.

181
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,540
Where's Auntie?

182
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,100
She went upstairs to be with my dad.

183
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,740
Thank you.

184
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,140
Be careful not to cut yourself.

185
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,420
Take it. It's for you.

186
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,420
What's this?

187
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,220
You lent me 10,000 yuan tuition fee, remember?

188
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,660
Hurry, take it.

189
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,940
I didn't even play in the game.

190
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,820
The prize money is enough.

191
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,060
We're even now.

192
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,260
- You should keep it.
- You have to take it.

193
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,060
This is different.

194
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,980
It's not the same.

195
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,500
You have to take it. Don't look back.

196
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,450
Take it before the others see.

197
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,300
Come on, take it.

198
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,020
Then I'll take it.

199
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,260
Let me know if you need money again.

200
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,620
Okay, got it.

201
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,660
Be careful not to cut yourself.

202
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,940
Go back and join them.

203
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,540
What are you talking about?

204
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,340
Give me my cup.

205
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,660
The fruit will be ready soon.

206
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,460
Where's Shao Nian?

207
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,100
In the kitchen, washing dishes.

208
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,140
Let me handle this. You should head back.

209
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,420
Don't stay too late.

210
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,820
I'll help you clean up.

211
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,380
Your spikes were weak during the game.

212
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,260
Is your old wrist injury

213
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,300
acting up again?

214
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,180
No.

215
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,900
Then why were your spikes so weak?

216
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,260
I just didn't play at my normal level.

217
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,980
That's definitely not your usual level.

218
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,460
Is your wrist really okay?

219
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,220
It's fine.

220
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,860
Don't worry about me.

221
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,700
Leave these. I'll help you clean up later.

222
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,620
(Xingang University)

223
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,180
Go.

224
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,580
What's wrong?

225
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,180
Are you okay?

226
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,500
I'm tired.

227
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,900
I'll rest for a bit.

228
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,820
I'll go check.

229
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,540
Come in.

230
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,620
Chen Weilan,

231
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,620
there's still an issue with your spiking.

232
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,060
Are you worried about your wrist injury?

233
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,220
Actually,

234
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,420
beach volleyball isn't as likely

235
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,720
to cause injuries as indoor volleyball.

236
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,300
If you're really worried,

237
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,940
you could wear a wrist guard.
Wouldn't that help?

238
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,300
Why should I wear a wrist guard? No need.

239
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,780
I just care about you.

240
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,460
Thank you.

241
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,820
Weilan,

242
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,420
isn't this your wrist guard?

243
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,660
Why aren't you wearing it?

244
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,900
(Yang Liyun)

245
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,220
It's been a while
since we played volleyball together.

246
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,100
Yes.

247
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,020
It's rare.

248
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,860
Let's hang out tonight.

249
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,740
- Yang Liyun.
- Let's hang out.

250
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,220
I need to talk to you.

251
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,740
You all go ahead.

252
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,540
Bye-bye.

253
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,140
What's the matter?

254
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,420
Take a look at this video.

255
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,180
Is this you?

256
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,380
You were wearing a wrist guard.

257
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,660
Yes.

258
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,060
It looks similar

259
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,500
to mine,

260
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,780
but

261
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,340
what does that prove?

262
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,020
That day, I was rushing out with Liang,

263
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,380
and I accidentally saw you
wearing that wrist guard

264
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,500
and recording.

265
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,860
You can't deny it.

266
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,980
You were right behind me,

267
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,100
so the angle of the video online

268
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,780
matches mine.

269
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,940
Did you know Gao Ge was suspended

270
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,500
for six months because of this video?

271
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,780
So, please come back

272
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,900
to our school with me

273
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,540
and explain everything to the school leaders.

274
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,340
Alright?

275
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,300
Chen Weilan,

276
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,580
when did you become a busybody?

277
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,900
So nosy.

278
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,380
I'm not being nosy.

279
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,140
Gao Ge thinks

280
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,740
I posted the video.

281
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,260
He's misunderstanding me.

282
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,620
I'm taking the fall for you.

283
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,140
Don't you think you owe me an explanation?

284
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,420
I'm not going.

285
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,620
He was fighting. It's a fact.

286
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,780
What's there to explain?

287
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,980
Then why did you do it?

288
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,020
Because I like him.

289
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,860
But he only

290
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,700
has Lang Yueting in his heart.

291
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,380
He wouldn't even say a word to me.

292
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,340
And now,

293
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,860
he's known as a rogue who fights.

294
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,980
Lang Yueting will never look at him now.

295
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,540
Even if he didn't fight,

296
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,820
I wouldn't like him.

297
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,500
Yueting, it wasn't intentional.

298
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,860
Listen to me.

299
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,220
Really, I just...

300
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,780
You did nothing wrong. No need to apologize.

301
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,500
Who's suspended or taking the blame

302
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,540
doesn't concern me.

303
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,340
These are all trivial matters.

304
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,460
- Let's go.
- Lang Yueting.

305
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,220
Do you really not care

306
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,900
that I've been suspended?

307
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,700
Right?

308
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,300
Right.

309
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,980
What do you have to do with me?

310
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,540
Why would your suspension matter to me?

311
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,500
Besides,

312
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,100
you're suspended because you fought.

313
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,940
You did it. You can't blame anyone else.

314
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,180
Lang Yueting,

315
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,580
you're an athlete.

316
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,260
You know that a suspension

317
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,740
is a blemish on an athlete's record.

318
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,140
How can you say that?

319
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,260
Now I understand.

320
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,780
You won that MVP award...

321
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,060
Impressive.

322
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,780
Are you just upset

323
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,420
about the last Youth National Team selection?

324
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,740
Can't accept that?

325
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,020
We can have another match.

326
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,020
- Sure.
- Enough.

327
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,660
Chen Weilan.

328
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,740
Thank you.

329
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,500
Come on.

330
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,900
You'll come with me to my school.

331
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,900
Gao Ge, why did you run away?

332
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,060
Ignore them.

333
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,300
Gao Ge, why did you run away?

334
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,620
I've found the recorder.

335
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,980
Explain it to the school,

336
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,540
so you won't be suspended.

337
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,620
So, as I said,

338
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,220
thank you.

339
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,900
That's your attitude?

340
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,020
What do you want?

341
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,580
What do I want?

342
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,780
Dude, this is your problem.

343
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,700
I cleaned up your mess.

344
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,620
Don't bother me again.

345
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,420
And what about my wrist guard?

346
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,420
Consider us even.

347
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,740
You've wronged me for so long,

348
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,020
and you just want to call it even?

349
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,020
Fine.

350
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,180
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,420
You get all soft when you see Lang Yueting.

352
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,380
And you?

353
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,180
Did I get soft just now for your sake?

354
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,940
Are you alright?

355
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
Are you okay, Weilan?

356
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,900
My hand hurts a bit. I'll rest for a while.

357
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,700
Your old injury acts up around certain people.

358
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,100
You were fine

359
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,260
when playing against Xia,

360
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,260
but you seemed hesitant

361
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,420
when Gao blocked.

362
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,300
Maybe Shao Nian should take another look at it.

363
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,220
Let me take a look.

364
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,220
It's not an old injury.

365
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,340
It's a mental issue.

366
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,340
You're the one with a mental issue.

367
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,620
Enough for me. You guys continue.

368
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,020
A mental issue?

369
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,940
Wrist recovery period.

370
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,700
(Rehabilitation Training)
Conditions for recurrence after recovery.

371
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,940
Is there...

372
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,980
Wow, Duoduo.

373
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,260
It's been a semester,

374
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,540
and you're finally doing your homework?

375
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,380
You're just in time.

376
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,220
Let me ask you.

377
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,980
After a wrist dislocation
has healed for a year,

378
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,220
under what circumstances

379
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,700
could it dislocate again?

380
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,620
And she exhibits different symptoms

381
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,980
around different people.

382
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,300
Sometimes she's fine,

383
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,220
and sometimes it suddenly acts up.

384
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,340
You're asking all this

385
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,420
just to find out what happened

386
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,260
to Chen Weilan's wrist

387
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,660
during the game with you and Gao, right?

388
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,380
Yes, yes.

389
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,860
Let me put it this way.

390
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,060
From a medical standpoint,

391
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,860
habitual dislocation is tough to cure,

392
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,500
and we can't rule out

393
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,700
psychological causes.

394
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,140
If there is

395
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,140
no physical cause

396
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,500
like a heavy impact

397
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,100
or repetitive strain,

398
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,540
it is very likely

399
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,860
post-traumatic stress disorder

400
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,860
or some other psychological factor.

401
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,700
Honestly,

402
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,740
I don't think there's anything wrong

403
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,820
with Chen Weilan's wrist.

404
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,580
Look at this.

405
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,300
Look.

406
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,060
During your training,

407
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,420
I secretly

408
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,140
recorded this game.

409
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,780
Look at it.

410
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,340
The ball is coming.

411
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,100
Look at her wrist.

412
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,660
It's strong, right?

413
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,460
And that spike was beautiful, wasn't it?

414
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,060
But look.

415
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,220
This is yesterday's game.

416
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,900
Look at you and Gao.

417
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,900
Look at Chen Weilan's wrist.

418
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
When Gao blocks,

419
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,100
it suddenly

420
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,340
becomes weak, right?

421
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,140
- Right?
- Yes. It's true.

422
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,020
That's a symptom

423
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,580
of a psychosomatic injury.

424
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,820
So,

425
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,500
I think her wrist

426
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,620
is fully healed.

427
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,380
It's mostly psychological.

428
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,460
Let's not dwell on that now.

429
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,300
Let me show you

430
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,660
the new gift I got you.

431
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,740
How is it?

432
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,380
Did you draw me?

433
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,340
Of course, it's you.

434
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,300
Who else would it be?

435
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,940
It's nice, right?

436
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,460
Nice?

437
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,460
You didn't even capture

438
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,740
a tenth of my beauty.

439
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,900
I even enhanced

440
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,260
your features a bit,

441
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,380
and I drew your hair.

442
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,980
Am I bald?

443
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,060
- No, no, not bald.
- Stop joking.

444
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,420
Forget the hair for now.

445
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,780
Duoduo,

446
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,980
look.

447
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,300
When spiking,

448
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,620
your elbow

449
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,740
should be slightly above your shoulder.

450
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,980
The elbow, shoulder, and waist

451
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,340
should form a line

452
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,220
at about a 135-degree angle.

453
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,060
See?

454
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,700
Your elbow is too low, right?

455
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,940
This affects your power.

456
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,620
It's a lack of training

457
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,060
and coaching.

458
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,860
Uncle Li, you're impressive.

459
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,940
You can tell so much

460
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,060
from just a picture.

461
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,380
Then I should...

462
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,420
You like this picture so much

463
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,540
that you hang it over your bed?

464
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,740
I just want to practice

465
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,020
my spiking form before bed.

466
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,580
Alright, your dedication is admirable.

467
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,820
Of course.

468
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,260
Beach volleyball is my dream.

469
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,860
Dream, huh?

470
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,940
No wonder you want to practice before bed.

471
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,220
You want to dream about it.

472
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,140
Are you mocking me?

473
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,340
Not at all.

474
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,540
I really respect

475
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,980
people like you

476
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,900
who pursue their dreams.

477
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,740
That's right.

478
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,740
People who chase their dreams

479
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,860
shine brightly.

480
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,860
Look at me.

481
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,860
Am I shining now?

482
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,700
Sorry.

483
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,580
I have a bit of astigmatism.

484
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,740
I can't see your glow.

485
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,180
Hey, bring me a hammer

486
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,140
and two nails.

487
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,020
Okay.

488
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,100
- Is this the one?
- It'll do.

489
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,820
How about

490
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,620
putting it here?

491
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
A little to the right.

492
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,780
- Like this?
- A bit more to the right.

493
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,140
- There, that should be good.
- Good.

494
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,020
- Good, good.
- Alright.

495
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,820
Hand it to me.

496
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,860
Wasn't it just here?

497
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,700
This spot.

498
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,740
The frame is here this way.

499
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,380
You got it?

500
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,380
Yes.

501
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,980
Forget it. Give it to me.

502
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,780
You can't even hammer a nail in.

503
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,380
Who says I can't?

504
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,140
Let me do it.

505
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,140
Your drawing

506
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,380
is pretty good.

507
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,620
You're quite talented.

508
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,500
Don't praise me all of a sudden.

509
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,500
I'm not used to it.

510
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,620
You're not used to compliments?

511
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,660
What's wrong? Is your hand okay?

512
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,540
It's fine.

513
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,780
You surprised me with the compliment,

514
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,780
and I hit my hand.

515
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,660
You're just clumsy. Let me do it.

516
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,500
No, I'll do it.

517
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:40,740
One of us hitting the hand is enough.

518
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
- It's done.
- Great.

519
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,060
Here.

520
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,460
Good.

521
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,100
- Looks nice.
- Looks nice.

522
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,380
Why are you copying me?

523
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,180
- Serve up!
- One, two, three, go!

524
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,420
Great, Jingxuan.

525
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,140
Watch your angle on those spikes.

526
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:02,860
Okay.

527
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,260
One, two, three, go!

528
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,260
Great shot!

529
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,780
Weilan's spikes are really strong.

530
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,980
- One, two, three, go!
- Nice one.

531
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,860
Thank you, Coach.

532
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,340
Duoduo.

533
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,820
What's wrong with you?

534
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,140
Didn't I tell you about this?

535
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,060
Your elbow needs to be

536
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,940
above your shoulder when spiking.

537
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,740
- Have you forgotten about it?
- I had it up just now.

538
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,660
Didn't you see?

539
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,340
Alright.

540
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,860
Let me show you again.

541
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,100
Watch carefully.

542
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,540
Bend your knees, squat down, feet apart.

543
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,860
Quickly push off the ground.

544
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,420
Lean forward.

545
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,700
When jumping,

546
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,940
put your elbow above your shoulder,

547
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,100
your hand naturally beside your eye.

548
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,700
Alright.

549
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,460
Ready.

550
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,220
Jump!

551
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,300
- Coach!
- Uncle!

552
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,420
- Uncle Li!
- Coach, are you okay?

553
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,540
Don't move. What's wrong with your leg?

554
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,940
Wen Xin, get the doctor!

555
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,420
Where does it hurt, Dad?

556
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,060
- Are you alright?
- Dad!

557
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,620
- Take it easy.
- Dad, are you okay?

558
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,580
Dad!

559
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,820
Are you okay?

560
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,100
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

561
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,000
Does it hurt now?

562
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,020
We're from Xingang University's

563
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,900
beach volleyball club.

564
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,140
Someone's injured.

565
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,700
Can you send an ambulance?

566
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,660
What should we do?

567
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,300
(Outpatient)

568
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,140
You're really overestimating yourself,

569
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,300
thinking you're still

570
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,660
a twenty-something.

571
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
You should be careful

572
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,500
doing demonstrations for Duoduo,

573
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,100
or you wouldn't have ended up in the hospital.

574
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,900
This has nothing to do with the demonstration.

575
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,380
Glad you know it.

576
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,700
You drank with Zheng
from next door, didn't you?

577
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,340
It's fine.

578
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,380
But you shouldn't have eaten seafood.

579
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,460
Now, your gout flared up, right?

580
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,540
I was just celebrating a win.

581
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,860
You were happy, sure.

582
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,660
But I won't feed you now.

583
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,820
Drink a beer,

584
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,660
and suffer gout for days. Don't you know that?

585
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,260
Now it's just me

586
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,460
and Shao Nian at the store.

587
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,460
I still have to take care of you,

588
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,180
which I don't mind,

589
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,820
but it's bad for business.

590
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,460
And that means losing money.

591
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,780
We're already short on cash,

592
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,060
and now you're in the hospital,

593
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,540
costing us more.

594
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,380
Money, money.

595
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,420
All you think about is money.

596
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,540
Can money buy happiness?

597
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,780
Can it replace family love?

598
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,620
Can it bring harmony with neighbors?

599
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,420
So, as the old saying goes,

600
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,940
just live each day well

601
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,100
and live in the moment, okay?

602
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,540
How can we live in the moment without money?

603
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,540
How can we be happy without money?

604
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,180
How can we find happiness without money?

605
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,240
- I just don't understand.
- You...

606
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,900
We're talking about two different things here.

607
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,300
- Duoduo, what are you doing here?
- You don't understand what I'm saying at all.

608
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,100
Why aren't you coming in?

609
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,420
Auntie, I brought some fruit for you.

610
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,020
You can wash these and share them with Uncle.

611
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,100
I'll take Duoduo out for a walk.

612
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,460
- Okay, go ahead.
- I'll go now.

613
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,740
When did Duoduo arrive?

614
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
I'm not sure.

615
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,500
What's wrong?

616
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,980
You seem upset.

617
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,580
It's just a bit frustrating.

618
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,140
Your parents

619
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,420
have a good relationship.

620
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,940
They just bicker sometimes.

621
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,900
It's normal.

622
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,020
Look.

623
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,780
I asked my dad to join the team

624
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,860
to coach us.

625
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,580
But he ended up in the hospital

626
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,820
so soon.

627
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,460
Now the team

628
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,740
can't train properly,

629
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,700
and everything's on hold.

630
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,140
My mom is struggling

631
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,300
to manage the BBQ restaurant alone.

632
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,460
She can't handle it on her own.

633
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,500
And Chen Weilan...

634
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,100
She has so many issues,

635
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,260
but we don't even know what they are.

636
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,660
All in all, there are so many problems.

637
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,940
I was hoping my dad could help her,

638
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,060
but now

639
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,060
everything's a mess.

640
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,300
Don't worry too much.

641
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,780
I'm helping out

642
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,940
at the BBQ restaurant.

643
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,660
I spoke to the doctor earlier,

644
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,140
and they said Uncle Li's condition

645
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,460
is just a mild gout attack.

646
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,780
As long as he rests well in the hospital

647
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,620
and controls his diet,

648
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,820
he should be fine.

649
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,300
As for the beach volleyball coach,

650
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,340
we can figure something out.

651
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,620
I'm sure we'll find a solution.

652
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,540
Dad.

653
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,500
Duoduo.

654
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,900
- You should've slept longer.
- You're here.

655
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,380
I'm fine.

656
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,380
Go home

657
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,580
and help your mom with the work.

658
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,860
Even while sick,

659
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,540
you're still thinking about your store.

660
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,540
Without the store,

661
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,780
how will you pay for college?

662
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,540
You'd only play beach volleyball
in your dreams.

663
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,220
Take care of your health first.

664
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,500
Drink less alcohol in the future.

665
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,900
Alright.

666
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,980
I know.

667
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,460
Just focus

668
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,460
on practicing your volleyball.

669
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,420
You've improved

670
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,740
your quick spikes,

671
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,780
but you still need to work

672
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,020
on your form for spiking.

673
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,460
And

674
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,620
I think

675
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,660
Chen Weilan

676
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,460
is a rare talent.

677
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,560
Don't drive her away.

678
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,380
Alright, alright.

679
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,460
Even when you're sick,

680
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,140
you still can't say something nice.

681
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,020
If you really want to train us well,

682
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,820
get better soon.

683
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,260
Take care of yourself.

684
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:13,940
Okay?

685
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,220
Okay.

686
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,020
I'll get better soon.

687
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,860
Once I'm out of here,

688
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,540
I'll train you all properly.

689
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,940
You're getting eager.

690
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,820
Just rest up

691
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,180
and recover first.

692
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,300
Duoduo, stop practicing.

693
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,820
Come and have some late-night noodles.

694
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,540
Here.

695
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,580
Why is it instant noodles again?

696
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,020
I don't know how to cook anything else.

697
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,020

I've completed my mission.

00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,700
Hello.

734
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,740
Sit down.

735
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,420
You're looking for me?

736
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,140
I wanted to ask you.

737
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,860

Why do you ask?

742
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,380
Yesterday,

743
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,620
I watched a video of a match

744
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,380
between Chen Weilan and Lang Yueting.

745
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,940

Chen Weilan's performance

747
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,340
was the same

748
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,620
when facing you

749
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,780
and Lang Yueting.

750
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,860
She hesitated

751
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,980
and couldn't spike smoothly.

752
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,340
This phenomenon

753
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,220
has been happening frequently lately.

754
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,140
So, I wanted to ask you.

755
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,540
What exactly

756
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,580
is going on?

757
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,580
Weilan,

758
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,220
isn't this your wrist guard?

759
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,620
Why aren't you wearing it?

760
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,900
A few days ago,

761
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,140
Duoduo found

762
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,460
a wristband that Chen Weilan left behind.

763
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,020
It looks exactly like the one
I gave to Lang Yueting.

764
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,460
Afterward, I explained it to her.

765
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,460
Now I understand.

766
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,820
Chen Weilan's psychological issue

767
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,580
must be related to Lang Yueting.

768
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,660
She knows that Gao

769
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,100
had a crush on Lang Yueting,

770
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,300
so when she plays against you,

771
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,900
she subconsciously replaces your face

772
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,140
with Lang Yueting's,

773
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,980
making her nervous and hesitant.

774
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,620
I'm sure that's the problem.

775
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,860
But we can't

776
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,340
let this continue.

777
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,260
What can we do about it?

778
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,460
What can we do?

779
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,740
I think we need to help Chen Weilan see it.

780
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,900
She needs to know where her problem lies

781
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,260
before we can assist her.

782
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,340
How can we help her

783
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,740
face her own issues?

784
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,300
(Honor Certificate: Champion)

785
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,460
How are you?

786
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,580
Are you alright?

787
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,940
Did you notice it?

788
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,380
Today,

789
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,900
Jingxuan's movements

790
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,180
were very similar to Lang Yueting's.

791
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,420
We actually did that on purpose.

792
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,900
Jingxuan, look at this movement.

793
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,340
Do you see it?

794
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,230
I think

795
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,940
since you just joined us

796
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,980
and haven't developed

797
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,660
a distinct style yet,

798
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,460
asking you to mimic Lang Yueting

799
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,620
might be our best choice.

800
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,540
How am I supposed to mimic her?

801
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,020
Watch more videos.

802
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,860
For any technical moves you don't know,

803
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,940
I'll guide you.

804
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,740
Thank you.

805
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,700
But Gao Ge, you're amazing.

806
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,780
You even know

807
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,820
indoor volleyball moves?

808
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,620
He's not just familiar

809
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,220
with indoor volleyball.

810
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,820
He knows Lang Yueting well.

811
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,900
Mascot,

812
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,020
you talk too much.

813
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,100
Don't listen to his nonsense.

814
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,820
Watch closely.

815
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,100
When you're facing an opponent

816
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,820
with a similar build to Lang Yueting,

817
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,380
you can't execute a perfect spike.

818
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,380
It's not because the opponent is skilled.

819
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,300
It's because their stance

820
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,700
throws you off balance.

821
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,740
Duoduo is right.

822
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,780
Just like when you faced Gao,

823
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,620
you couldn't complete

824
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,900
your spike properly.

825
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,700
It's because Lang Yueting
brings you too much pressure.

826
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,500
This mental barrier has never been resolved.

827
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,020
To put it bluntly,

828
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,980
it's a mental issue.

829
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,940
And Lang Yueting's skill level

830
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,260
is similar to yours.

831
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,500
So why does this happen to you?

832
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,340
Are you done?

833
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,860
Do you all have to do this today?

834
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,860
What exactly are you trying to do?

835
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,860
Are you done?

836
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,100
Weilan?

837
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,500
Chen Weilan?

838
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,660
Weilan?

839
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,820
Weilan?

840
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,540
Where did she go?

841
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,140
Where did she go?

842
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,860
Answer your phone, Chen Weilan.

843
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,780
(Wen Xin; Has Chen Weilan contacted you?)

844
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,340
(Beach Volleyball Activity Room)

845
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,500
Did she reply to your message?

846
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Where did she go?

847
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,300
No idea.

848
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,140
We still don't know where she is.

849
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,980
Where could she be?

850
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,460
Where could she be?

851
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,020
No idea.

852
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,540
Duoduo, you're here.

853
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,220
Any news about Chen Weilan?

854
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,780
No.

855
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,540
Did she return to the dorm last night?

856
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,860
No.

857
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,820
I didn't sleep all night.

858
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,220
Almost called the police.

859
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,100
It's not that serious.

860
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,180
Where could she be?

861
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,700
Maybe we were a bit too harsh.

862
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,300
Her self-esteem is strong.

863
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,740
She probably couldn't handle it.

864
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,420
But she has to face her current issues.

865
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,900
We need to help her, right?

866
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,740
But we didn't help her at all.

867
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,780
The problem

868
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,460
lies with Chen Weilan herself.

869
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,500
She's so used to winning

870
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,420
that she can't accept the blow of failure,

871
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,820
especially losing

872
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,900
to Lang Yueting.

873
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,140
Dad.

874
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,420
We came to see you.

875
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,980
Uncle Li, we're here.

876
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,140
Hello.

877
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:51,740
We brought you some fruit.

878
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,420
How have you been resting lately?

879
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,920
Can you give me an apple?

880
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,500
It looks like I'll be here for a while.

881
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,900
You're finally here.

882
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,260
I'm so bored.

883
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,100
If you're too bored,

884
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,660
we'll come by more often to chat with you.

885
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,500
- I'll get some water.
- Okay.

886
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,460
Let me peel an apple for you

887
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,540
as a treat.

888
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,340
I played five games

889
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,540
with Gao Ge today,

890
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,220
and he blocked all five of my shots.

891
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,820
By the way,

892
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,340
about Chen Weilan.

893
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,580
He talked to me

894
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,820
about her issues today.

895
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,700
But his explanation isn't clear to me.

896
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,100
He mentioned something

897
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,300
about not being able to handle losing

898
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,980
after always winning.

899
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,940
What's wrong with Chen Weilan?

900
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,300
Duoduo,

901
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,540
Gao Ge has already made it clear.

902
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,060
Has he?

903
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,260
Chen Weilan's issue is psychological.

904
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,780
She can't handle losing.

905
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,180
She'll never get past this mental barrier.

906
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,260
Duoduo,

907
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,460
you also have a similar problem.

908
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,300
You know?

909
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,180
You know when you spike,

910
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,420
you lack power,

911
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,420
right?

912
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,100
But when you're not sure you'll make the shot,

913
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,820
you still keep spiking.

914
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,900
This kind of mindset

915
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
is also a psychological issue.

916
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,500
I'm telling you.

917
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,300
If you can't get past this,

918
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,340
you'll never improve.

919
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,220
Think about it.

920
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,460
I'm worried for you.

921
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,380
Are you okay, Duoduo?

922
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,780
- I'm fine.
- Let's get you patched up.

923
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,100
Uncle Li, have some water.

924
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,580
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

925
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,140
This kid.

926
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,380
Always so careless.

927
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,340
Hold on for a bit.

928
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,540
Does it still hurt?

929
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,540
Thank you.

930
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,620
This little injury is nothing.

931
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,180
The emotional pain my dad causes

932
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,340
is the real pain.

933
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,300
I know what you're thinking,

934
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,940
but Uncle Li didn't mean it that way.

935
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,460
You're just here

936
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,100
as a messenger from my dad,

937
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,660
trying to smooth things over.

938
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,940
I'm like the beef patty in a hamburger,

939
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,060
stuck in the middle.

940
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,020
Think about it. What Uncle Li said today

941
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,460
was to teach you

942
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,780
that you have to learn to lose

943
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,780
before you can win.

944
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Think about it.

945
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,620
For example, Chen Weilan

946
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,820
has been known as a prodigy
since she was young,

947
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,900
especially good at spiking,

948
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,660
always hitting the mark, never losing.

949
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,740
But once she loses,

950
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,420
it creates a huge psychological burden

951
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,540
and shadow.

952
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,420
I think the Lang Yueting issue

953
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,980
is just a trigger.

954
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,860
In competitive sports,

955
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,220
it's impossible to only win and never lose.

956
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,060
Even in things you're really good at,

957
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,460
you'll meet your match eventually.

958
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,220
Right?

959
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,780
That makes sense.

960
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,220
Xiaojing,

961
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,500
do you know what address Chen Weilan put down

962
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,180
when she joined the beach volleyball team?

963
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,300
She's really good at studying.

964
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,140
(Sport Psychology)
Scary.
