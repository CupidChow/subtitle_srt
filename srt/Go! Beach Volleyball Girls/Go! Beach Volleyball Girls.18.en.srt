=Episode 18=

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,700
I reviewed the past competitions.

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,940
I think

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,960
Keji University's Liu Shutong

21
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,000
and Lin Fang

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,400
and Gongye University's Liu Huizi

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,320
and Li Haiping

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,340
are a bit weaker.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,640
The other four teams

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,680
are relatively strong.

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,780
Forget it. Don't overthink it.

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,600
We've taken the first step,

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,940
so we must keep moving forward.

30
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,540
Xiaojing.

31
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,700
Don't worry. We're with you.

32
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,100
Don't worry.

33
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,420
Let me analyze

34
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,500
these teams for you.

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,020
Except Ocean University,

36
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,980
I haven't watched

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,860
their videos.

38
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,740
I've watched

39
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,940
the others.

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,780
Keji University's

41
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,420
players are tall

42
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,380
and good at strong spikes,

43
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,740
but they're slow to react.

44
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,820
Use fast attacks against them.

45
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,140
Gongye University is weaker.

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,220
We can dominate them with serves

47
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,060
and aggressive attacks.

48
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,260
Right.

49
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,580
Yiyao University's

50
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,260
defense is very solid.

51
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,820
Everyone, pay attention.

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,900
Their defense is solid.

53
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,620
This means we need

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,940
to have varied and flexible attacks.

55
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,980
Got it?

56
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,980
Now,

57
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,900
our problem lies

58
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,180
in weak basics.

59
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,980
We need to take advantage

60
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,620
of serving

61
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,900
and the first attack.

62
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,940
Got it?

63
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,860
Yes.

64
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,860
Wow, Uncle.

65
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,700
You two are truly old partners.

66
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,260
You say the exact same things.

67
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,290
- Let me see.
- Really?

68
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,380
Really.

69
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,940
It's exactly the same.

70
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,220
Really the same.

71
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,700
You've been slacking off.

72
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,860
No, I haven't.

73
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,060
I went to find Coach Lu.

74
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,980
I've decided to buy

75
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,260
two more beers tonight.

76
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,060
What beers? Say that again?

77
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,260
Safflower oil.

78
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,780
Duoduo. Shao Nian.

79
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,500
Duoduo, I need to talk to you.

80
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,460
You go. I'll be over there.

81
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,300
Okay.

82
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,580
What's up?

83
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,900
Do you remember

84
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,300
the match we had on Yuzhou Island?

85
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,900
What are you getting at?

86
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,860
Today, the Seven-School League's

87
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,940
roster came out.

88
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,700
I saw your name isn't on it.

89
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,060
I've always thought

90
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,660
if there was a match,

91
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,340
I could have a game with you.

92
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,900
You want to compete with me?

93
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,980
You've got it wrong.

94
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,940
That's not what I meant.

95
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,900
It's just that before,

96
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,300
we were always partners.

97
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,300
I was curious

98
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,900
how it would feel

99
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,340
if we were opponents.

100
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,780
Oh, I almost forgot the main point.

101
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,820
Today,

102
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,260
Coach Tian Qing asked me to come.

103
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,860
She wants to organize another match.

104
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,980
This time,

105
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,900
we'll try our best

106
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,260
to have a proper game.

107
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,820
Sure.

108
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,180
As long as it's a fair competition,

109
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,260
I'm all for it.

110
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,020
Don't be like the match on the island.

111
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,940
Don't worry.

112
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,700
Tomorrow morning at nine,

113
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,500
we'll meet at your court.

114
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,980
Okay.

115
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,940
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

116
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,620
Coach,

117
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,380
there's a match at nine tomorrow.

118
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,980
You have to come.

119
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,420
Coach Lu.

120
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,740
Coach, you've had

121
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,740
alcoholic liver disease.

122
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,900
Why are you still drinking?

123
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,180
Are you out of your mind?

124
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,860
I have alcoholic liver disease?

125
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,540
Right, I do have that.

126
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,060
I'm using poison to fight poison.

127
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,900
To cure alcoholic liver disease?

128
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,060
Duoduo, I think

129
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,900
Coach Lu doesn't look too well.

130
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,220
Let him rest.

131
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,460
Let's head back.

132
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,620
What do you think?

133
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,340
I agree.

134
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,900
Yeah, I'm not well.

135
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,060
Yeah.

136
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,980
I agreed to a match

137
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,860
against Ocean University tomorrow.

138
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,140
You won't be able to go, right?

139
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,260
Ocean University?

140
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,380
Will Coach Tian be there?

141
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,020
Of course.

142
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,620
But it's okay.

143
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,460
Even if you don't go,

144
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,340
we'll perform well.

145
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,500
We won't embarrass you.

146
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,380
No, no.

147
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,340
I must go.

148
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,260
- Even if...
- Even if

149
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,220
you can't be there,

150
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,020
you'll think of them.

151
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,820
Don't worry. I'll take care of them.

152
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,660
You just rest well.

153
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,140
What's the use of thinking?

154
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,660
I must go.

155
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,980
I have to go.

156
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,220
- Really?
- Really.

157
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,100
Alright.

158
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,620
Coach Lu, you really...

159
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,420
Aren't you going to reconsider?

160
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,620
No need.

161
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,900
Shao Nian, what's wrong?

162
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,860
He said it's fine. Why are you worrying?

163
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,820
What are you doing?

164
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,900
Picking out clothes.

165
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,500
Not too formal

166
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,860
for the beach match.

167
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,820
I need to pick a few

168
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,500
that show off my style.

169
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,140
Which do you think is better?

170
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,380
Just wear whatever.

171
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,820
Go for it.

172
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,140
Show your spirit

173
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,420
on the court.

174
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,500
Shao Nian, hurry up.

175
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Go for it.

176
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,860
Shao Nian,

177
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,980
what's wrong? You look so down.

178
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,420
Nothing.

179
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,980
Cheer up.

180
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,820
Let's go.

181
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,580
Coach Tian,

182
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,660
we meet again.

183
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,060
Coach Tian.

184
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,020
Coach Tian.

185
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,100
Duoduo, Weilan,

186
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,540
Lingling has gone to change.

187
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,540
- Go get ready.
- Okay.

188
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,730
- Okay.
- By the way,

189
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,180
let me introduce an NYT coach.

190
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,100
Coach Lu.

191
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,300
Not me?

192
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,420
Xiaole?

193
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,540
Why are you still here?

194
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,740
- Bro?
- Bro?

195
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,060
Duoduo.

196
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,220
Duoduo.

197
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,220
Let me explain.

198
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,100
No need, Shao Nian.

199
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,220
It's already clear.

200
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,460
You knew he wasn't Lu Daxing, right?

201
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,300
No wonder you've been acting oddly,

202
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,940
trying to stop him from coming.

203
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,620
You and Tu Lingling conspired to deceive me

204
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,860
and the entire team.

205
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,500
I found out a bit earlier than you did.

206
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,340
Before he arrived,

207
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,420
I didn't know he wasn't Lu Daxing too.

208
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,540
I didn't mean it.

209
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,500
It has nothing to do

210
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,740
with Tu Lingling.

211
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,180
Still defending her, aren't you?

212
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,660
You all conspired

213
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,580
to deceive me.

214
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,260
So, she tested me

215
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,580
on the island several times.

216
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,220
You were fooling me.

217
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,820
I'm not defending her.

218
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,940
How could I conspire

219
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,500
with her to deceive you?

220
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,740
You should know I've always been on your side.

221
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,380
I used to be sure of that,

222
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,740
but not anymore.

223
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,540
Duoduo.

224
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,140
Shao Nian.

225
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,740
What you did was really wrong.

226
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,660
Li Guoduo!

227
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,700
I was so embarrassed

228
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,620
- when I fell just now.
- Yes.

229
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,340
I was embarrassed myself.

230
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,460
Coach Tian.

231
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,940
Wait.

232
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,420
- Bye.
- Bye.

233
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Let me explain.

234
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,660
No need.

235
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,060
Lu Xiaole,

236
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,940
I used to think

237
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,220
you were just a joker

238
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,060
and a bit frivolous,

239
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,780
but I didn't expect you

240
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,260
to have such a problematic attitude.

241
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,340
Your students were nice to you.

242
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,300
Shouldn't you explain

243
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,220
and apologize to them?

244
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,580
I'll definitely apologize to them

245
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,580
and explain everything.

246
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,540
What matters is

247
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,860
you don't get me wrong.

248
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,100
I don't get you wrong.

249
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,140
I won't waste my time

250
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,500
on someone like you,

251
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,180
who deceives the students,

252
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,420
with no sense of responsibility.

253
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,580
- Duoduo.
- This is so frustrating.

254
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,980
What's wrong?

255
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,020
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

256
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,060
Did you lose the match?

257
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,180
We didn't even play.

258
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,100
We met the real Lu Daxing.

259
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,340
Lu Daxing came?

260
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,460
No, they met.

261
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,780
They met?

262
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,100
You two knew about this too?

263
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,500
No, no, no.

264
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,460
Wait, wait, wait.

265
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,700
The real Lu Daxing? What?

266
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,500
Then who is this?

267
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,380
To put it simply,

268
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,980
this "Lu Daxing"

269
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,980
is actually Lu Xiaole,

270
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,500
Lu Daxing's younger brother.

271
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,420
He's not a coach

272
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,340
from the NYT.

273
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,500
He's pretending to be

274
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
his brother here.

275
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,420
No wonder he only focused on physical training.

276
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,660
But what he said

277
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,900
sounded pretty convincing.

278
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
I also thought he was right,

279
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,540
especially in his evaluation of me.

280
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,980
This is all your doing.

281
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,860
See?

282
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,940
You've deceived everyone.

283
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,340
No, that's not fair.

284
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,780
We just gave a little hint.

285
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,300
The rest

286
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,620
was all Lu Xiaole.

287
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,500
Yes.

288
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,660
Xia Liqiang,

289
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,340
how could you do this?

290
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,980
Don't you know how important

291
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,220
the league is to me?

292
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,580
How could you deceive me?

293
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,300
I know.

294
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,140
But

295
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,220
we only found out later

296
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,780
that Lu Xiaole was an impostor.

297
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,420
We were deceived too.

298
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,900
But our thinking was

299
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,860
at the beginning,

300
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,460
we didn't have a coach,

301
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,340
and having an NYT coach

302
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,660
was very inspiring.

303
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,100
I admit

304
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,660
we shouldn't have deceived you.

305
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,220
But now we've found

306
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,500
our own training method.

307
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,540
This is what we need.

308
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,580
Right?

309
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,940
Xiaojing, trust me.

310
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,900
This won't ruin

311
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,780
the league.

312
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
Why should I trust you?

313
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,460
How can you guarantee that?

314
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,700
If we had the real NYT coach,

315
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,300
we would've improved more.

316
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,260
Xiaojing, don't be mad.

317
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,820
No matter who's coaching,

318
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,860
we still need to execute the tactics.

319
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,220
What's wrong with you two?

320
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,700
Can't you realize how serious this is?

321
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,180
Our preparation time is so short.

322
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,020
We've wasted so much time on this impostor.

323
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,380
We could've improved more.

324
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,220
I absolutely won't allow

325
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,460
an impostor to be our coach.

326
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,020
I won't forgive him,

327
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,420
or you all.

328
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,780
Duoduo, this...

329
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,620
Duoduo.

330
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,660
Don't be mad.

331
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,500
Get out.

332
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,180
Alright.

333
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,580
We've kept this

334
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,060
from you for so long.

335
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,420
We're truly sorry.

336
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,580
But it's come

337
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,820
to this point.

338
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,540
I'll do my best

339
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,220
to make up for it in terms of tactics.

340
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,340
How can you make up for it?

341
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,100
How about the time

342
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,940
everyone lost?

343
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,860
You're right,

344
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,100
but you know.

345
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,940
Shao Nian's always been my buddy.

346
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,700
He did it for everyone.

347
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,100
So,

348
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,500
I kept it a secret.

349
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,420
You did it

350
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,860
for brotherly loyalty.

351
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,980
Who's going to make up for our training time?

352
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,900
How about this?

353
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,980
As long as it calms you down,

354
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
you can hit me.

355
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,740
Just to let off steam.

356
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,700
Okay.

357
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,100
That's it?

358
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,220
Glad you aren't upset.

359
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,020
Duoduo.

360
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,660
Duoduo, listen to me.

361
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,380
Listen to what? More lies?

362
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,500
I didn't mean to deceive you.

363
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,580
He deceived me too. It was later...

364
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,140
Why didn't you tell us?

365
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
I thought you did find

366
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,980
an NYT coach.

367
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,420
Was it just to save face?

368
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,060
Tian Qing said Lu Xiaole was putting on airs.

369
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,220
I think you are too.

370
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,380
Don't appear in front of me.

371
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,460
Come here.

372
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,740
Let me introduce him.

373
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,580
This is the NYT coach,

374
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,940
Lu Daxing.

375
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,500
Lu Daxing.

376
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,740
Everyone, welcome!

377
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,060
Welcome, welcome.

378
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,140
Welcome, Coach.

379
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,900
- Welcome, Coach.
- Welcome.

380
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,380
We'll follow your arrangement.

381
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,860
I applied for some funding from the school.

382
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,260
Starting tomorrow,

383
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,260
we'll go to Yuzhou Island

384
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,860
for a week of special training.

385
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,580
Really?

386
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,500
It's true.

387
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,620
You're amazing, Coach.

388
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,220
- Long live the coach!
- You're amazing.

389
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,610
You're Lu Xiaole?

390
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,140
I know you.

391
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,460
Daxing told me

392
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,540
about a cousin

393
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,060
who likes windsurfing.

394
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,580
Yes.

395
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,740
Bro.

396
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,420
I'm here today

397
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,260
to apologize to you.

398
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,300
I didn't visit you

399
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,460
because I was afraid

400
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,860
you'd expose me.

401
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,500
Now, this team is yours again.

402
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,540
I'll leave in a few days.

403
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,420
You've done a great job with them.

404
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,780
I should thank you.

405
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,300
Please don't mock me.

406
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,300
Is Daxing still in Xingang?

407
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,580
Yes.

408
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,860
He's at the hotel.

409
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,300
Said he had something to do

410
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,500
and would come later.

411
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,220
Lu Xiaole, what do you want from Uncle Li?

412
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,420
Shao Nian,

413
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,580
don't get him wrong.

414
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,820
He's here to apologize.

415
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,620
Apologize?

416
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,580
Since you're all here today,

417
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,660
let's eat here.

418
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,620
I'll grill some kebabs.

419
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,140
You can have a few drinks

420
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
and have a good chat.

421
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,940
This

422
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,820
is all my fault.

423
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,860
I shouldn't have stayed.

424
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,180
It's all my fault.

425
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,940
I shouldn't have kept you here.

426
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,860
It's all my fault.

427
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,860
I shouldn't have come.

428
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,700
It's all my fault.

429
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,660
I shouldn't have kept it from everyone.

430
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,220
How can it be your fault?

431
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,580
It's all my fault.

432
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,700
I shouldn't have made that investment.

433
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,180
It's all my fault.

434
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,500
I shouldn't have invited any coach,

435
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,380
let alone you, the fake one.

436
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,340
And now Duoduo isn't talking to me.

437
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,180
What should I do?

438
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,700
Cheers.

439
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,580
I'm in worse shape

440
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,380
than you.

441
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,300
This whole mess

442
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,940
is my fault.

443
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,380
Tian Qing knew all along

444
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,900
that I was a fake.

445
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,820
She was fooling me.

446
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,340
I just started to like volleyball,

447
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,620
and a bucket of cold water

448
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,020
put out the fire.

449
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,700
Both my career and love life

450
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,060
are in shambles.

451
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,180
Come on.

452
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,180
♪Love stories are too perfect♪

453
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,220
♪So my life is like this♪

454
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,460
I'm telling you.

455
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,180
We're all men.

456
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,060
We need to take responsibility.

457
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,220
We need to do something.

458
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,260
What should we do?

459
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,500
Don't ask me.

460
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,340
I'll take you somewhere.

461
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,180
The kebabs are ready.

462
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,380
Where are they?

463
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,180
Dafu.

464
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,020
Look.

465
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,780
New equipment.

466
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,460
New fitness equipment.

467
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,900
What's going on?

468
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,660
I want to renovate

469
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,380
this place

470
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,580
and replace everything.

471
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,420
Renovate?

472
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,460
Just the two of us?

473
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,300
Yeah.

474
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,820
I did some calculations.

475
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,340
With just the two of us,

476
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,860
we can get it done

477
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,300
in

478
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,180
about two days.

479
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,340
You know.

480
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,820
This whole thing

481
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,420
is all my fault.

482
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,660
I want to make up for it.

483
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,380
Of course, you have to help me.

484
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,340
Tell me.

485
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,220
Actually,

486
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,460
it's not that hard.

487
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,020
When we're

488
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,100
renovating this place,

489
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,500
don't let Li Guoduo

490
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,580
and Chen Weilan come over.

491
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,800
When we're done,

492
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,940
they'll come in

493
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,100
and see a whole new place.

494
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,940
That'd be great.

495
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,580
Sure.

496
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,420
(Dafu BBQ)

497
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,860
Your leg...

498
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,580
It's not because of you.

499
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,700
It healed a while ago.

500
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,340
Then what's wrong?

501
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,300
Gout.

502
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,860
I heard you have a daughter who's also

503
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,460
into beach volleyball.

504
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,860
I met her today. She looks a lot like you.

505
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,940
She's following in your footsteps.

506
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,500
She's just playing around.

507
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,300
What about you?

508
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,140
Still not married?

509
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,460
Not yet.

510
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,900
Unlike you.

511
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,380
Your daughter's a grown-up now.

512
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,780
You're the envy of many,

513
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,180
an NYT coach.

514
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,100
I'm just a greasy

515
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,060
small-time shopkeeper.

516
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,500
You know my level.

517
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,340
If it weren't for that time

518
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,980
I insisted you join the training match,

519
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,060
your leg might not have been injured.

520
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,780
Why bring that up?

521
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,860
It's been so many years.

522
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,340
This time, when I got sick,

523
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,940
I realized a truth.

524
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,180
What truth?

525
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,500
Back then when I was injured,

526
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,850
it was mainly because

527
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,220
my leg muscles

528
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,900
were not strong enough.

529
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,060
That's why I got injured.

530
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,260
Just like my gout this time.

531
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,100
It's due to usual drinking beer

532
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,090
and eating seafood.

533
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,780
Gout was bound to happen.

534
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,980
The turning point of fate

535
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,540
was already destined

536
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,220
before that moment arrived.

537
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,980
And we actively

538
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,300
made it destined.

539
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,660
Dafu,

540
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,820
no matter what,

541
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,100
I've felt very guilty

542
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,100
all these years.

543
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,860
I didn't contact you

544
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,700
because

545
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,820
I felt too guilty

546
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,980
and didn't know

547
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,940
how to face you.

548
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,700
Drink this.

549
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,020
Leave it all in the past.

550
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,140
Later, send me the link

551
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,180
to the match.

552
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,500
Duoduo?

553
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,980
What are you doing?

554
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,940
What's on your mind?

555
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,420
Shao Nian?

556
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,340
How is that possible?

557
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,700
It's better not to see him.

558
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,900
Out of sight, out of mind.

559
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,340
Then why are you

560
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,180
so distracted?

561
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,180
Send me the match link.

562
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,420
Let's study it carefully.

563
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,380
Okay.

564
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,620
Get your act together.

565
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,340
Focus in the coming days.

- Lu Xiaole.
- What?

610
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,020
Let's take a photo.

611
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,780
Show me the one from earlier.

612
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,460
I'll show it to you later.

613
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,460
Let's take one more.

615
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,660
This place looks pretty good.

616
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,020
Bro.

617
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,220
Not bad, huh?

618
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,940
Good for you, Shao Nian.

619
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,780
Right?

620
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,820
Not bad. Really.

621
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,020
- Not bad.
- Not bad.

622
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,220
Who came up with this idea?

623
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,240
He's there.

624
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,540
I did.

625
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,740
You're all here.

626
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,140
Why is there such a big change?

627
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,900
What is this? Who did it?

628
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,420
You all came.

629
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,220
Before,

630
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,700
because of me,

631
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,020
everyone's training was delayed.

632
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,420
I'm really sorry.

633
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
So I thought

634
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,460
to tidy up our activity room,

635
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,180
as an apology.

636
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,060
I'm sorry.

637
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,540
Duoduo.

638
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,460
I was the one

639
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,740
who didn't let Shao Nian tell you.

640
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,140
Don't blame him.

641
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,700
Do you think you can just get away

642
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,300
by renovating the room?

643
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,660
I didn't think

644
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,740
you would forgive me so easily.

645
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,860
Of course not.

646
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,380
You deceived us

647
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,700
for so long.

648
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,420
If you hadn't been exposed,

649
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,660
would you still be deceiving us?

650
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,660
I know you came here to escape debt.

651
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,780
If you weren't escaping debt,

652
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
wouldn't you just pack up

653
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,020
and return to Beijing,

654
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,220
forgetting us and Xingang?

655
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,620
Absolutely not.

656
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,820
I...

657
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,140
During the time I spent with you,

658
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,460
I really enjoyed it.

659
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,740
I also learned a lot

660
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,900
from each of you.

661
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,100
Now I truly love beach volleyball,

662
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,820
and I hope

663
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,980
you can give me a chance

664
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,020
to stay

665
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,940
and advance together with you

666
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,260
to win the game.

667
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,220
We should also apologize

668
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,380
because we knew the truth

669
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,660
but hid it from you.

670
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,540
We're sorry.

671
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,540
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

672
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,180
Duo,

673
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,980
Coach Lu is sincerely

674
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,180
apologizing to you.

675
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,380
And he's shown his sincerity.

676
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,660
One hundred push-ups.

677
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,020
One hundred push-ups.

678
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,060
You've been tough on us.

679
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,540
Can you do one hundred push-ups?

680
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,860
If you do it,

681
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,900
we'll forgive you.

682
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,380
Yeah.

683
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,140
- That's right.
- Okay.

684
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,020
- Go ahead.
- Do it.

685
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,780
You said it.

686
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,620
If I do it, I can stay.

687
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,380
Finish them first.

688
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,460

689
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,210
Alright.

690
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,220
- Record it.
- Come on. Record it.

691
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,860
- Record it.
- Record it.

692
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,700
Has it started?

693
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,460
Two, three, four.

694
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,740
- Hurry.
- That's only ten.

695
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,540
Do it. Hurry up.

696
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,900
- Hurry.
- Do it properly.

697
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,180
If not, it doesn't count.

698

Eight.

- Eight point one.
- Hurry.

702
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,460
Is it tiring?

703
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,540
No.

704
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,660
Do it properly.

705

Don't film me. My face is big.

it's time to enjoy some perks.

Didn't expect so many people.

752
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,780
Yeah.

753
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,620
Take a look.

754

Where did you go?

760
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,300
I have an important task. Look.

761
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,460
Where are Xia Liqiang and Gao Ge?
I haven't seen them.

762
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,420
Haven't seen them.

763
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,460
They're preparing backstage.

764
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,900
What about Lu Xiaole?

765
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,340
Lu Xiaole?

766
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,580
Saw him at the store

767
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,500
this morning.

768
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,020
Is he in the coach's seat?

769
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,660
Welcome everyone

770
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,780
- to the 22nd
- Get your wrists warmed up.

771
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
Beach Volleyball

772
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,020
Youth Tournament.

773
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,700
During the match,

774
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,740
pay attention to their formation changes

775
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,180
and adjust accordingly.

776
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,660
Watch out for back-row attacks.

777
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,860
Their players are

778
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,020
Yan Xiaojing and Mo Xixi.

779
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:17,020
- Xixi, go for it!
- Xiaojing, go for it!

780
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,900
Their rivals are

781
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,580
Liu Shutong and Lin Fang

782
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,940
from Keji University.

783
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,540
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

784
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:27,860
Go for it!

785
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:02,060
Xingang team, go for it!

786
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,020
Awesome!

787
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,280
Go for it!

788
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,660
This serving is indeed targeted.

789
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,100
Looks like Lu Xiaole was right.

790
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,300
Awesome!

791
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,900
Go for it!

792
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,390
Go for it!

793
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,260
Go for it!

794
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,480
Another point!

795
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,110
Nice!

796
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,820
Their No.1 Player can't block or pass.

797
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,900
Xixi is very good at serving,

798
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,060
and she's mainly targeting

799
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,500
their No.1 Player.

800
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,660
So, after our serving,

801
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,820
they can't have their first attack.

802
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,780
- As I know,
- Good.

803
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,860
though the serving scoring rate

804
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,940
is only 30%

805
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,300
in beach volleyball matches,

806
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,220
it's still a very critical factor.

807
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,940
Keep talking.

808
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,540
From what I know,

809
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,700
to effectively disrupt

810
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,420
the opponent's first attack,

811
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,260
the serving needs to be very precise.

812
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,860
Increase the serve's intensity,

813
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,580
so they won't have their first attack.

814
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,260
Our defense will be less pressured.

815
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,900
The opponent's mindset will be affected.

816
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,860
- Nice.
- We'll gain the initiative.

817
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,500
Not bad. You've become a master now.

818
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,700
Shao Nian has always been our strategist.

819
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,420
He's working for love.

820
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,940
Good.

821
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,980
Awesome.

822
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,220
Yan Xiaojing serves again.

823
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,180
To the No.1 Player.

824
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,180
Liu Shutong.

825
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,300
Her pass is still weak.

826
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,260
No.2 sets up in the air.

827
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,340
No.1 spikes again.

828
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,340
Score!

829
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:43,620
Xingang team, go for it!

830
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,010
Xingang team, go for it!

831
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,820
Yan Xiaojing receives.

832
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,100
Mo Xixi makes a heavy spike.

833
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,140
Another point!

834
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,260
In this match,

835
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,620
Xiaojing's serves have a huge advantage.

836
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,900
It looks like this strategy

837
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,460
was set up well.

838
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,420
Weren't you just complaining

839
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,820
about Lu Xiaole before?

840
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,740
I wasn't complaining. I just...

841
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,620
You complained that he wasn't in the NYT.

842
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,580
But you have to admit

843
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,450
most of the credit

844
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,940
for this strategy goes to Uncle Li.

845
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,260
Lu Xiaole just added

846
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,860
some of his own ideas.

847
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,460
My dad is that amazing?

848
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,660
If Uncle Li hears this,

849
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,820
he'll be so sad.

850
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,700
Coach.

851
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,540
- Hello.
- Hello, Auntie.

852
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,500
Coach.

853
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,420
- Auntie.
- Auntie.

854
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,700
- Come on.
- Send this out.

855
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,220
- Hold it up.
- Lift it.

856
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,380
Lift it. Come on.

857
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,820
- What's this?
- Open it.

858
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,540
What are these for?

859
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,020
These are from our sponsors.

860
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,180
With these, we'll have money.

861
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,540
Don't stand there. Come on.

862
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,860
Hold it up. Let me take a picture.

863
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,980
- I'll send it.
- Do it.

864
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,740
Mom, is this your idea again?

865
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,700
It's not mine.

866
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,820
It's Coach Lu's.

867
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,420
I don't have this kind of business mind.

868
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,140
I'm just coordinating.

869
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,900
These neighbors are eager...

870
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,380
Just right. Lift it.

871
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,220
Let me take a photo.

872
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,460
Shao Nian, take it.

873
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,180
This, this, this.

874
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,380
Take it.

875
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,820
What are you doing? Lift it.

876
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,460
- Lift it.
- Yes. Like this.

877
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,700
Get up.

878
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,660
Shao Nian.

879
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,530
Good.

880
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,740
- Smile.
- Smile.

881
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,940
Look at the camera.

882
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,940
Smile. Good.

883
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,740
Come on, quickly.

884
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,540
Duo, smile.

885
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,620
Smile.

886
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,740
Quickly.

887
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,060
Smile. Come on, Duo.

888
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,100
Duo, stand up quickly.

889
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,420
Smile.

890
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,300
Shao Nian, hurry up.

891
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,060
- Smile. Great.
- Stop it.

892
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,260
Great. Come on.

893
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,500
What are you doing?

894
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,900
Don't put up these banners.

895
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,220
Take them down.

896
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,140
Coach Tian,

897
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,260
long time no see.

898
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,220
You're here.

899
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,420
Who told them to do this?

900
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,300
I had them do this.

901
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,900
These are our sponsors.

902
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,140
Just doing some advertising.

903
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,940
The league is an exchange among students.

904
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,540
No commercial activities.

905
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,620
Take them down.

906
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,660
Coach, we'll take them down now.

907
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,500
I did this. I'll take them down.

908
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,620
Don't take them down.

909
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,700
Coach Tian, get back to your work.

910
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,580
You're not in charge here.

911
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,460
I'm the secretary general.

912
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,580
I am in charge.

913
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,860
No, the secretary general

914
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,340
shouldn't affect making money.

915
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,540
If you don't take them down,

916
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,140
I'll call security now.

917
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,540
Taken down.

918
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,180
No, no, no.

919
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,420
Don't be angry. We're taking it down now.

920
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,540
Don't be angry.

921
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,220
Not taking it down.

922
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,140
If you continue,

923
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,660
you won't be able to play.

924
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,860
No, we'll take it down.

925
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,780
Sorry.

926
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,860
Sorry, Coach Tian.

927
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,740
Sorry.

928
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,820
Get back to work.

929
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,940
Hurry. She's angry.

930
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,180
How embarrassing.

931
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,020
Well.

932
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,780
- What to do?
- What should we do?

933
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,580
You figure it out.

934
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,540
Got it. Let's go.

935
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,740
So fast.

936
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,260
You're so smart.

937
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,060
The match is about to start.

938
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,620
Let's film the match.

939
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,500
The match is starting.

940
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,100
Don't be angry.

941
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,940
Your mom means well. It's fine.

942
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,880
Don't look.
