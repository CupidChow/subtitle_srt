20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,280
- Coach.
- Coach.

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,700
You two are outstanding.

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,840
Xingang University

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,500
truly has a lot of talents.

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,120
We're doing our best.

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,600
Here, this is for you.

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,880
Take it.

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,780
- What is this?
- What's this?

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,440
Coach Wang,

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,280
why are you giving us

30
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,340
money for the match?

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,520
We can't accept it.

32
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,380
We can't take it.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,520
How can you not take it? Take it.

34
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,990
This is your prize money.

35
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,080
Prize money?

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,580
There's prize money for matches?

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,320
Of course. When you win,

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,160
you get a prize.

39
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,980
Think about it.
International matches offer prizes.

40
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,300
Ours isn't as much,

41
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,260
but it's the same rule.

42
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,360
Right?

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,920
We need to be international.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,320
There's such a thing?

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,020
Well, thank you, Coach.

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,080
There's another match tomorrow,

47
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,120
so hurry back and rest.

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Coach.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,900
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks.

51
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,800
So lucky.

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,060
Look how happy you are.

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,920
Money lover.

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,080
Money grubber.

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,700
You're counting the money like crazy.

56
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,660
It's 2,000 to return to Shao Nian.

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
It's a pity this money

58
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,860
hasn't even warmed in my hands yet.

59
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,600
How about this?

60
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,960
At night,

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
you sleep with it

62
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,820
and keep it warm.

63
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,220
Then, let it make more money for you.

64
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,620
Forget it. I'll just return it.

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,720
He fell out with his mom to be independent.

66
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,020
He needs the money now.

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,620
Professional matches are great.

68
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,760
Like the previous

69
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,220
Jin Yun Hotel challenge.

70
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,000
We can play,

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,340
improve skills,

72
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,160
and make money.

73
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,420
Such a good deal.

74
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,920
Why didn't I know sooner?

75
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,100
Like I missed out so much.

76
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,100
But something still feels off.

77
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,600
Those two girls we played against today

78
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,940
have good physical fitness,

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,700
but why are they so slow to react?

80
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,760
I think

81
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,820
professional players are divided into levels.

82
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,320
And Coach Wang doesn't know

83
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,300
our strengths.

84
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,360
Maybe they're just

85
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,180
testing us with weaker players?

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,980
Don't think too much.

87
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,200
Let's see if you also have 2,000.

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,040
Let me count it.

89
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,840
Not likely to be more.

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,680
Who knows?

91
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,760
What if there's more?

92
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,680
Who knows?

93
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
If there is, it's yours.

94
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,520
Really?

95
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,620
- You said so.
- Money lover.

96
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,660
But, about us playing professionally...

97
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,520
I know what you're going to say.

98
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,780
We can't tell others.

99
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,960
We're improving our skills secretly

100
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,980
and will shock everyone later.

101
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,840
- Count it.
- Give me five.

102
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,680
Quickly.

103
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,660
Really, not a single extra bill.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,860
Here, here, here.

105
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,320
I said, if there's extra, it's yours.

106
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,340
- It's mine?
- Yes.

107
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
Really?

108
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,860
I'm taking it.

109
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,700
Money lover.

110
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,780
I'm really taking it.

111
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,020
(Xinbo Club)
So you all understand?

112
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
It will depend on you.

113
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,140
- Okay.
- Okay.

114
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
- Guoduo.
- Coach.

115
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,100
Are we competing against them soon?

116
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
Yes.

117
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,520
Just these two.

118
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,420
But today, the two players are quite strong.

119
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,460
They are our top players.

120
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,760
So, we'll...

121
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,160
Don't worry. We're not weak either.

122
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,460
- Rest assured.
- Yes.

123
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
I know you're not weak,

124
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,460
but don't overstrain yourselves.

125
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,000
Play as much

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,840
as you can.

127
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,280
Just don't make it

128
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,300
look too bad.

129
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,200
In the second set,

130
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,460
just manage it.

131
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,880
Right?

132
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,280
The opponents are too strong.

133
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,700
We have no way to handle it.

134
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,800
Coach,

135
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,300
are you afraid we might be pressured?

136
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,800
Don't worry.

137
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,720
Weilan and I

138
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,040
just want to use this match

139
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,000
to train ourselves.

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,280
So, no matter the opponents,

141
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,200
bring them on.

142
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,380
We'll fight till the end.

143
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,360
We'll definitely give our all

144
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,720
on the court.

145
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,660
- Rest assured.
- Yes.

146
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,620
I believe in you.

147
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
So, prepare well.

148
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,720
Okay.

149
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,280
Let's go warm up.

150
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,120
Let's go.

151
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,520
What's wrong?

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
You go ahead.

153
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,180
My stomach hurts. I need some water.

154
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,720
Then drink some water.

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,860
- I'll go first.
- You go.

156
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,120
Go.

157
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,020
(Baichuan One vs Xinbo One)

158
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,440
Nice.

159
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,120
This time, you're losing.

160
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,140
Just wait and see.

161
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,240
It's okay.

162
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,420
These two?

163
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,720
Yes, just these two.

164
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,060
Understand?

165
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
Got it.

166
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,920
Okay, go.

167
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,600
Weilan.

168
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,600
Don't rush.

169
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,440
Let's think of a way.

170
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,420
How about one pass attack?

171
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,400
Whether it's a spike

172
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,380
or one pass attack now,

173
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,250
they can easily receive it.

174
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,380
Can't believe it.

175
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,040
Their offense isn't great,

176
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,880
but

177
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,010
their defense is strong.

178
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,220
Especially that block.

179
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,240
I still can't figure out

180
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,460
how to break through.

181
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,900
You need to make the game look good.

182
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,940
It was luck at first.

183
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,260
Now we need to show our skills.

184
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,920
Good.

185
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,320
Go for it.

186
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,680
Go for it.

187
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,940
What's wrong, Weilan?

188
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,300
I need an injury timeout.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,980
Doctor, quick.

190
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,980
- Coach.
- Quick.

191
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,920
- Weilan.
- Coach.

192
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,900
Weilan, what happened?

193
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,240
Come and check.

194
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,480
Doctor, hurry.

195
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,040
- Let me see.
- Check it.

196
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,180
It's quite severe.

197
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,880
Don't play anymore.

198
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,160
End the match, Guoduo.

199
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,360
- The hospital.
- OK.

200
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,340
- No.
- Let's go.

201
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,060
- The game is over.
- No.

202
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,200
Coach, I can manage.

203
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,160
I can hold on.

204
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,400
No, Weilan, we can't continue.

205
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,340
We must go.

206
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,840
- Go.
- I'll hold on.

207
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,960
- We forfeit.
- No way.

208
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,840
We must go.

209
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,680
Must go.

210
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,720
Hurry.

211
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,580
(Outpatient)

212
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
Your hand

213
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,160
is just bandaged.

214
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,360
Isn't surgery needed?

215
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,280
It's just a dislocation. A reduction is enough.

216
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,120
Not that complicated.

217
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,360
How did it suddenly dislocate?

218
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,200
Chen Weilan.

219
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,420
- What's going on?
- I...

220
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,880
Chen Weilan,

221
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,200
you're something.

222
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,540
Sneaking off to play?

223
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,820
Is your wrist okay now?

224
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,620
What did the doctor say?

225
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,380
Did you forget?

226
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,420
Gao Ge, don't be mad.

227
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,140
It's my fault.

228
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
I insisted on dragging Weilan

229
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,680
to the match

230
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,640
to improve our skills.

231
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,640
It's my fault.

232
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,480
Li Guoduo,

233
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,900
you're her partner

234
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,140
and team captain.

235
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,980
She's injured, but you took her to the match.

236
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,160
Do you know

237
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,000
this could end

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,900
her sports career?

239
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,300
Enough.

240
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,740
I wanted to play.

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,280
Should I just keep resting?

242
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,380
I need to find my rhythm.

243
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,480
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,480
This matter

245
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,720
is my responsibility.

246
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,160
Gao, you've said enough.

247
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,260
This isn't all Duo's fault.

248
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,540
Easy for you to say.

249
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,260
Did Guoduo get hurt?

250
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,360
Now isn't the time to blame anyone.

251
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,660
We need to treat her injury.

252
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,560
Enough.

253
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,680
It's my injury.

254
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,040
I know it well myself.

255
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,360
I'll recover on my own. Okay?

256
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,660
I'm not playing anymore.

257
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,280
Weilan.

258
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,540
(Comprehensive Treatment Area)

259
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,660
Sorry, Gao Ge.

260
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,740
I'll take care of this.

261
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,920
It won't happen again.

262
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,900
Please don't be angry.

263
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's go.

264
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,800
Everyone's here.

265
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,120
Stop playing. Let's go eat.

266
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,960
I'm not hungry.

267
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Bro, stop writing.

268
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's go eat.

269
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,840
I'm not hungry.

270
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,040
What's wrong?

271
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,380
You don't seem right.

272
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,860
- What?
- What?

273
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,440
I'm...

274
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,640
Fine.

275
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,520
You both continue.

276
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,900
Coach Tian,

277
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,640
it's a pity you didn't see Shao Nian's

278
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,100
art exhibition here.

279
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,300
It really is a shame.

280
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,180
But seeing how you support
your students' dreams,

281
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,940
I really admire you.

282
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,560
Are you

283
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,380
praising me or criticizing me?

284
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,320
Aren't you already recruiting new students?

285
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,500
- Is she your student?
- Why?

286
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,500
- Who?
- Xiaojing.

287
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,680
They're not as excellent as you. Right?

288
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,400
Anyway, just finish this last match, okay?

289
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,580
I said...

290
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,240
- Lu Xiaole.
- Who are you?

291
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,080
What are you doing?

292
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,320
Who are you?

293
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,460
- Nothing.
- Lu Xiaole.

294
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,240
What's the matter?

295
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,900
Why do you look so familiar?

296
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,220
Weren't you a coach at Xingang University?

297
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,760
Hello.

298
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,800
I used to be.

299
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,640
Well.

300
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,600
You all talk.

301
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,220
I'll leave first. Bye-bye, Xiaojing.

302
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,680
Bye-bye.

303
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,760
Coach Lu, Coach Tian,

304
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,160
I have to go too.

305
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,060
You go.

306
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,260
Is that a coach?

307
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,720
I think your student

308
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,580
seems a bit off.

309
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,880
Go check on her.

310
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,480
Okay, I will.

311
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,880
Then, next month.

312
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,720
Next month.

313
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,400
Xiaojing, what was that just now?

314
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,200
Coach Lu, I have some matters in my dorm.

315
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,260
I'll leave first. Bye-bye.

316
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,060
What's going on?

317
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,020
If I were you,

318
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,480
I'd think about finding a way

319
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,500
to pay back the money.

320
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,740
Today,

321
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,140
we came here

322
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,940
just to remind you.

323
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,160
Don't forget

324
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,820
to return the money in three days.

325
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,740
What?

326
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,460
Why are you here?

327
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,440
Here's the deal.

328
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,060
I haven't

329
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,180
received the money.

330
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,680
Once they do,

331
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,220
I'll repay you.

332
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,460
We're just reminding you.

333
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,100
If you don't repay,

334
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,860
you'll be doomed.

335
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,800
Let me tell you.

336
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,080
Three days.

337
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,340
Only three days.

338
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,760
Return the money,

339
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,400
or we won't be nice.

340
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,240
Got it?

341
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,780
When have you ever been nice?

342
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,000
Bye.

343
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,140
Remember.

344
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,960
Let me.

345
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,860
Your hand's just healed. Don't injure it again.

346
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,280
I'll use my left hand.

347
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,240
You saw it.

348
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,480
No matter which hand you use,

349
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,740
you need to be careful.

350
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,420
Thanks for your concern.

351
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,600
If you could be more careful,

352
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,920
I wouldn't have to be

353
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,020
so nagging.

354
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,020
That day...

355
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,540
Give me some rice.

356
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,840
- Thanks.
- Is it enough?

357
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,020
Your hand.

358
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,020
I think you should

359
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
take out your frustration on me.

360
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,820
Don't vent on Duoduo

361
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,820
and Shao Nian like yesterday.

362
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,560
I'd rather vent on myself

363
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
than on you.

364
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,420
Some greens, please.

365
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,920
Thanks.

366
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,020
I think

367
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,100
you should apologize to Shao.

368
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,920
I won't go.

369
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,000
Do you know how many treatment plans

370
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,860
Shao Nian sent me?

371
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,740
You should at least apologize.

372
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,920
Fine, fine.

373
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,200
I'll do it.

374
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,040
Thanks.

375
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,320
Anyway, I can't be angry

376
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,900
with you and Shao Nian.

377
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,460
Want some of this?

378
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,080
Sure.

379
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,580
- Thanks, Auntie.
- Thanks, Auntie.

380
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,870
Crazy person.

381
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,820
What's a crazy person or a mental illness?

382
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,600
Common symptoms include

383
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,340
personality changes, emotional disturbance,
bizarre behavior,

384
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,060
and uncontrollable emotions.

385
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,420
You know I'm uncontrollable.

386
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,840
What do you mean?

387
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,820
Looking for an excuse?

388
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,760
What?

389
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,320
Should I bow to you now?

390
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,560
If you can't speak properly,

391
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,500
just shut up.

392
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,700
You've known me for so many years.

393
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,180
That's who I am.

394
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,400
Is that the reason?

395
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,360
You should've stayed at the hospital

396
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,200
to treat your brain.

397
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,980
I'm doing fine coming back.

398
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,420
Aren't you a doctor?

399
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,080
Check me out.

400
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,360
I'm not a brain specialist.

401
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,200
I don't treat brains.

402
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,380
Dr. Shao.

403
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,480
Dr. Shao, prescribe some medicine.

404
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,020
Can you stop bothering me?

405
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,160
You...

406
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,480
My brain isn't good.

407
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,340
Stop hitting me.

408
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,620
I give in.

409
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,720
Yesterday was too rushed.

410
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,560
I'm really sorry.

411
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,080
Thank you.

412
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,380
What happened yesterday?

413
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,360
Yesterday,

414
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,320
I chased after her.

415
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,160
She didn't tell me.

416
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,920
That's all for now.

417
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,760
Okay.

418
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,600
Hello?

419
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,380
I know. I know.

420
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,910
Didn't we agree on tomorrow?

421
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,120
Is there something important tomorrow?

422
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,520
It's fine.

423
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,560
Eat.

424
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,340
(Unfamiliar number)

425
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,280
Your phone.

426
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,300
Is that okay?

427
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,700
It's okay.

428
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,080
Don't mind the call.

429
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,340
I...

430
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,580
In a few days, it's my birthday.

431
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,060
I'm about to turn thirty.

432
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,700
Do you have any

433
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,020
special gift for me?

434
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,260
What gift do you want?

435
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,600
A girlfriend.

436
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,880
Eat.

437
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,280
Eat.

438
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,700
Don't peek at me.

439
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,060
Hurry up and eat.

440
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,560
Eat the hot dishes.

441
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,360
Well,

442
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
I've almost secured my graduate spot.

443
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,520
Really?

444
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,180
That's great news.

445
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,400
That's why you invited me

446
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,580
to such a nice restaurant.

447
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,300
Let's celebrate.

448
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,020
There's another good news.

449
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,160
What's that?

450
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,580
My parents have an old friend

451
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,080
who runs a company

452
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,700
in Beijing in imported equipment.

453
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,020
My dad said it was doing well.

454
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,380
He came to my home during the summer vacation.

455
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,260
Knowing I wanted to work in a big city,

456
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,720
he immediately said

457
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,180
I could intern there

458
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,940
and work there

459
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,780
after graduation.

460
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,820
You still want to go to Beijing?

461
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,860
Anyway, I've told you

462
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,380
I won't work in Beijing,

463
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,620
Shanghai, or Guangzhou.

464
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,640
Xiaojing,

465
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,180
we'll be very tired over there.

466
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,400
The houses are pricey,

467
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,020
and we won't be able to do what we like.

468
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
Why don't we find a job

469
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,180
we like here instead?

470
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,100
I'm not willing to give up.

471
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,080
I want to venture into big cities

472
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,340
like Beijing and Shanghai.

473
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,500
Life should have some dreams, right?

474
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,500
But we're all studying aquaculture.

475
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,920
What kind of job can we find

476
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,610
in Beijing or Shanghai with that major?

477
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,340
What kind of job did they offer you?

478
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,060
We haven't discussed that.

479
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,840
Xiaojing,

480
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,500
you're neither studying machinery

481
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,580
nor foreign trade.

482
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,420
What do you think you can do at their firm?

483
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,920
Yes.

484
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,740
They might give you an easier job

485
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,020
because of your parents' connections,

486
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,660
but do you think you can stand that?

487
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,820
I can switch to studying foreign trade.

488
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,520
If not,

489
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,180
I can take it as a minor.

490
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,840
I'm still young.

491
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,460
Why can't I give it a try?

492
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,480
Coach Tian.

493
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,420
- Guoduo.
- Wanted to see me?

494
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,360
I feel like Coach Lu

495
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,380
has something going on,

496
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,060
but he's not willing to tell me.

497
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,020
Coach Lu?

498
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,900
What could be going on?

499
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,120
We saw Wang Dong

500
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,760
and Yan Xiaojing seem to have
a disagreement the other day.

501
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,060
Could it be related to that?

502
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,140
I'm not really sure about this.

503
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,960
I only know Coach Wang Dong

504
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,820
works at the club.

505
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,720
Does Coach Lu

506
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,580
have any plans?

507
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,320
Maybe.

508
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,980
Thanks, Guoduo.

509
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,800
- No problem.
- I'm leaving.

510
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,640
Okay.

511
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,220
(Mr. Lu Xiaole, your account has been
credited with 1,000,000 RMB today.)

512
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,940
It's credited.

513
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,180
I need to transfer the money right away.

514
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,420
You bought so many face masks.

515
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,060
Is the sun rising from the west?

516
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,640
Got rich?

517
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,740
Why are you so generous?

518
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,980
I'm quite the senior, you know.

519
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,100
Can't I give some benefits to the juniors?

520
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,800
You can,

521
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,840
but it was hard to get even one
from you before.

522
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,020
Suddenly you're so generous.

523
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,580
Did something stimulate you?

524
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,860
I just wanted to let everyone know

525
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,020
my graduate school spot is almost confirmed.

526
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,320
- Congrats.
- That's great!

527
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,860
Congratulations, congratulations!

528
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,480
What's the school doing?

529
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,860
Why haven't they announced it?

530
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,600
They'll do it next week.

531
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,800
I ran into Secretary Zhou,

532
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,700
so he told me first.

533
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,080
That's great.

534
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,980
Congratulations, Xiaojing.

535
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,180
It's all thanks to Coach Lu.

536
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,700
I don't know how to thank him.

537
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,120
I heard from Coach Tian that his

538
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,520
birthday is coming up.

539
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,920
Let's celebrate it for him.

540
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,880
Sounds good.

541
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,860
- Sure.
- Sure.

542
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,660
Let's think about how.

543
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,160
How about we organize a party

544
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,120
here for him as a gift?

545
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,600
Let's give him a surprise.

546
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,620
- What surprise?
- Great.

547
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,240
A party?

548
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,900
- Sounds good.
- Should we get him

549
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,780
a gift too?

550
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,300
What gift?

551
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,080
Try it out.

552
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,120
- Call Lu.
- Come.

553
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,680
Get him out. Lu, Lu.

554
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,960
Coach Lu, Coach.

555
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,660
He's here.

556
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,960
Who designed this?

557
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,880
I love it.

558
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,220
- How nice.
- Come on.

559
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,920
Thanks to Coach Tian.

560
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,760
She reminded us,

561
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,740
so we know it's your birthday.

562
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,160
Coach Lu, I got

563
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,620
my graduate slot thanks to you.

564
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,480
Thank you.

565
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,120
Treat me to a meal when you have money.

566
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Treat you to street food.

567
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,860
You always think about money.

568
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,720
I don't have money.

569
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
I know you don't.

570
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,320
Don't you have a scholarship?

571
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,160
Why...?

572
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,600
Stop thinking about eating.

573
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,120
- Come on.
- Let's take photos.

574
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,680
Come on. Let's take photos.

575
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,520
Come on. Look here.

576
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,660
Wait, wait.

577
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,540
Where's Shao Nian?

578
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,880
He went to buy a cake.

579
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,440
Let's take photos without him.

580
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,540
Come on, come on.

581
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,450
Come on.

582
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,900
One, two, three.

583
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,820
Okay. Let's eat.

584
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,800
Tonight, let's get Coach Lu drunk.

585
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,920
- Who?
- Don't talk nonsense. With your little frame,

586
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,960
you can't get me drunk.

587
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,800
Come.

588
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,840
Eat up. Drink some juice.

589
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,980
Do you want it cold?

590
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,480
Coach Lu.

591
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,680
Let me open this for you.

592
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,540
I have a few words I want to say to you alone.

593
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,440
Sure.

594
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,700
You all continue. I'll be back soon.

595
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,080
Excuse me.

596
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,940
- Why?
- What are you going to do?

597
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,860
Happy birthday.

598
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,000
Coach Tian.

599
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,640
We're already so familiar.

600
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,120
No need

601
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,500
for such formalities.

602
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,600
Have you considered

603
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,620
being my girlfriend?

604
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,300
You're thirty now.

605
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,060
Let me get serious.

606
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,560
Remember when we saw

607
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,820
Yan Xiaojing and Wang Dong at school?

608
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,780
Wang Dong was a coach at Xingang University

609
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,580
and now works at the club.

610
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,980
Just now, when you joked with Xiaojing,

611
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,120
you said

612
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,960
she should treat you to a meal

613
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,060
after her graduate exam.

614
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,020
She said she didn't have money.

615
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,420
Do you think her emotions seemed a bit off?

616
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,320
I don't think so.

617
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,120
Could it be related to the graduate exam?

618
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,740
But that's already over.

619
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,980
I don't think it's about the exam.

620
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,380
It's somewhat related to Wang Dong.

621
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,300
I think

622
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,940
you girls

623
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,860
just overthink things.

624
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,320
There's nothing to it.

625
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,340
Let's go.

626
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,520
It's more fun inside.

627
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,680
I have a gift for you.

628
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,800
Let's go.

629
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,700
Lu Xiaole,

630
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,860
I don't think I can be with a man

631
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,760
who has no life plan

632
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
and is irresponsible

633
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,900
towards their students.

634
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,420
What do you mean?

635
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,620
We aren't suited.

636
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,500
Happy birthday to you.

637
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:20,980
(Beach Volleyball Activity Room)

638
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,880
- Gao.
- Thanks.

639
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,840
Fetch that beer.

640
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,600
- Coming.
- Here, here.

Let's get Lu drunk.

642
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,500
We must get Lu drunk.

643
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,360
Let me see this.

644
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,000

645
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,420
- Hi, Coach Lu.
- Coach Lu.

648
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,040
Yes. Waiting for you to start to drink.

649
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,160
- Drink.
- We're waiting.

about the options for habitual dislocation.

672
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,040
Two options.

673
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,280
One is surgery.

674
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,440
The other is

675
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,340
conservative treatment.

00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,960

00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,340
I previously had surgery

00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,140
and was out for two months,

679
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,700
but it still recurred.

680
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,940

681
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,660

about Weilan's injury.

Okay, see you later.

722
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,180
By the way, Coach Wang Dong came to find me.

723
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,900
He asked about your injury.

724
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,320
Wang Dong?

725
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,860
He's left the school.

726
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,360
You know about this?

727
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,760
At that time, Weilan

728
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,160
had left the volleyball team, so I

729
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,060
didn't mention him.

730
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,800
Wang Dong? Isn't he your coach?

731
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,680
Yes, I've told you many times.

732
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,520
Yes.

733
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,800
You two,

734
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,240
stay away

735
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,080
from him.

736
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,640
Why?

737
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,720
He misguided you?

738
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,580
With another coach, I would

739
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,200
have joined the NYT.

740
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,220
He held you back.

741
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,060
Here's your coffee. Enjoy.

742
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,180
Coach Wang, what do you need?

743
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,960
Guoduo,

744
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,460
how's your partner doing?

745
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,120
She might need some time to recover,

746
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,560
so we might not be able

747
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,340
to participate in matches for a while.

748
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,240
Then

749
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,720
have you thought

750
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,700
about playing yourself?

751
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,380
Me?

752
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,520
Yes.

753
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,180
There are many

754
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,420
good players in the club.

755
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,140
You can choose one as your partner.

756
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,340
Guoduo, I'm telling you.

757
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,360
This will help improve

758
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,200
your tactical level,

759
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,380
enhance your strengths,

760
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,560
and compensate

761
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,940
for some weaknesses,

762
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,960
including on-the-spot

763
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,140
adaptability.

764
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,780
You'll be better.

765
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,760
Coach,

766
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,460
are you suggesting...?

767
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,300
Have you considered Xiaojing?

768
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,400
Xiaojing?

769
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,600
She's also from our club?

770
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,880
I saw her last time.

771
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,720
Yes.

772
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,160
She's in her senior year.

773
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,080
She has been busy with her studies.

774
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,160
I thought she was just

775
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,560
passionate about beach volleyball.

776
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,780
Does she want to be a pro?

777
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,340
She only wants to play a few matches.

778
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,630
She's probably preparing

779
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,730
for the League.

780
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,240
Guoduo,

781
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,840
sometimes

782
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,980
you need to think long-term.

783
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,060
College matches

784
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,500
aren't very meaningful.

785
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,150
Not as thrilling as professional

786
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,990
matches.

787
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,030
Right?

788
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,220
And there's money.

789
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,720
Actually,

790
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,220
with your current strength,

791
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,730
you can play professional beach volleyball.

792
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,860
Me? Playing as a professional?

793
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,430
Of course.

794
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,420
Don't you want to?

795
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,110
I've always been

796
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,700
passionate about beach volleyball,

797
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,770
but I haven't thought

798
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,860
about becoming a professional.

799
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,290
Think about it.

800
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,980
I believe in you.

801
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,420
You believe I'd be a professional player?

802
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,240
Of course.

803
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,060
Don't you have any confidence in this?

804
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,740
Look at your first matches.

805
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,140
The first match was an easy win.

806
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,880
In the second match,

807
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,660
though the opponents were very strong,

808
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
you still managed

809
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,820
to show your skills.

810
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,500
That's quite impressive.

811
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,400
But Coach,

812
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,340
don't you think

813
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,240
Chen Weilan has always been

814
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,380
leading me?

815
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,200
Without Chen Weilan,

816
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,040
I wouldn't have

817
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,340
reached the high level alone.

818
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,480
Guoduo,

819
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,560
don't you want

820
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,680
to know

821
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,940
what your real level is?

822
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,000
Trust me.

823
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,420
Join the club.

824
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,140
Switch to a new partner.

825
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,140
You'll find

826
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,800
you can fully

827
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,860
stand on your own.

828
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,940
Think about it.

829
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,660
I'll wait for you.

830
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,880
Dafu,

831
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,220
busy so early?

832
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,600
Going out?

833
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,580
- Going to work?
- Yes.

834
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,640
Zhou.

835
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,400
Lost again?

836
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,500
I let him win.

837
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,320
Come back.

838
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,680
Duo,

839
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,340
are you clearing out stock?

840
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,980
What about making money?

841
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,740
She's thinking of selling one for two.

842
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,640
Guoduo,

843
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,400
don't you want

844
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,440
to know

845
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,620
what your real level is?

846
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,180
Join the club.

847
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,660
Switch to a new partner.

848
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,540
You'll find

849
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,840
you can fully

850
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,500
stand on your own.

851
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,500
Dad, Dad.

852
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,780
Do you think

853
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,180
I've changed

854
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,160
recently?

855
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,860
Lost some weight

856
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,960
and got a bit darker.

857
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,260
I didn't mean that.

858
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,120
Have I made any breakthroughs

859
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,140
in beach volleyball?

860
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,020
I haven't had time to watch your training,

861
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,180
but I saw the video Shao Nian sent.

862
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,600
To be honest,

863
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,180
you've indeed improved.

864
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,680
But...

865
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,980
Does that mean I can go pro?

866
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,220
I haven't finished yet.

867
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,940
But you're still

868
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,320
too dependent on Chen Weilan in your attacks.

869
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,160
Understand?

870
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,880
Beach volleyball relies

871
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,420
on both partners having

872
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,900
comparable skills.

873
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,640
Right now, there's no way

874
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,980
you can be on par with Weilan.

875
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,020
Am I really that far behind Weilan?

876
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,080
When I agreed to let you play,

877
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,080
it was just for fun

878
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,920
during these 4 years.

879
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,540
Going pro is

880
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,900
out of the question.

881
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,660
You'd better give up on that idea.

882
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,880
Why can't I go pro?

883
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,520
You just said I've improved.

884
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,480
If I keep progressing,

885
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,820
I can surpass Chen Weilan.

886
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,780
Dad, Dad.

887
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,740
What's the benefit of going pro?

888
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,240
It looks glamorous,

889
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,860
but do you know the hardships behind it?

890
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,180
A pro career just lasts a few years.

891
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,900
One injury

892
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,180
and it's all over.

893
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,720
Understand?

894
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,460
I'm telling you.

895
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,200
Don't think about it.

896
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,140
Why are you shouting?

897
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,700
Why can't you talk properly?

898
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,920
I can do it.

899
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,880
I'll prove to you

900
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,720
that I can do it.

901
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,380
I support you.

902
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,270
Hello?

903
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,320
Coach Wang.

904
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,460
Can we meet tomorrow?

905
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,920
Sure.

906
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,280
Let's meet

907
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,600
same time tomorrow, at the café

908
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,500
we met last time.

909
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,820
(Xingang University)

910
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,360
Gao,

911
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,080
you seem particularly unhappy

912
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,920
with Coach Wang Dong.

913
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,640
Wang Dong?

914
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,040
I remember I told you before.

915
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,880
Did you forget?

916
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,860
The two seniors

917
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,100
who couldn't compete.

918
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,000
Yes.

919
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,540
And Xia's previous partner.

920
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,740
Because he didn't listen to Wang Dong,

921
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,000
he was benched

922
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,660
and eventually left the team.

923
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,540
We can't judge a book by its cover.

924
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,980
Be careful around him.

925
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,520
But you don't have much to worry about.

926
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,100
You look fierce. Who would bully you?

927
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,640
Mascot,

928
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,220
are you asking for a beating?

929
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,040
Not really,

930
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,020
but my shoulder arthritis is acting up.

931
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,780
Shoulder arthritis, huh?

932
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,160
What are you doing?

933
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,320
Let me massage it for you.

934
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,160
Stop messing around.

935
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,580
- Bye, Coach.
- Bye.

936
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,060
(Ocean University)
Go to rest.

937
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,720
See you tomorrow.

938
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,560
Alright.

939
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,460
The same old issue.

940
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,500
You're playing your own game

941
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,060
without mutual trust.

942
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,800
It's been so long.

943
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,240
What's going on?

944
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,700
Still haven't gelled?

945
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,920
Coach Lu.

946
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,720
Go back.

947
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,660
Coach, we're leaving.

948
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,600
Bye-bye, Coach.

949
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,980
Think about what I said.

950
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,480
Coach Lu.

951
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,900
What do you need?

952
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,020
Just want to see you.

953
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,300
It was my birthday yesterday.

954
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,980
You didn't even have a piece of cake.

955
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,200
How about we make up for it?

956
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,420
I think I made myself very clear yesterday.

957
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,780
There were so many people yesterday.

958
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,820
You should save me some face.

959
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,180
If you think I did something wrong,

960
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,480
I'll change.

961
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,380
I think you're immature.

962
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,700
We're not suited.

963
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,420
I'm immature?

964
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,680
Wait, Coach Tian.

965
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,020
Let me finish.

966
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,260
Let me finish!

967
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,600
Coach.

968
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,700
Li Guoduo.

969
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,100
Why aren't you training?

970
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,900
I have an appointment.

971
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,380
Coach, why aren't you watching us train?

972
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,920
There aren't any competitions.

973
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,280
You'll be busy

974
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,480
with studies in the semester.

975
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,420
You should rest.

976
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,420
Yes, we should rest.

977
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,540
Coach, do you have an appointment?

978
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,220
I'm buying a cake.

979
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,120
Then I...

980
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,640
You have an appointment, right? Go.

981
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,480
Alright, alright.

982
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,060
I won't disturb you.

983
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,140
- Guoduo.
- Coach.

984
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,240
Take a seat.

985
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,080
Guoduo,

986
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,980
you called me here.

987
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,820
Have you made up your mind?

988
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,460
Yes, I want to give it a try.
