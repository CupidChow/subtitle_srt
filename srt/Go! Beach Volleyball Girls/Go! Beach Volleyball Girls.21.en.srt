18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,140
What about the ledger?

19
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,580
He told me to find some money.

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,900
But I don't have any money.

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,320
I don't know where he heard

22
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,980
we had a sponsorship for the game.

23
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,740
He told me to steal the ledger
from Duoduo's house.

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,900
It's all worthless stuff.

25
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,620
I already told you.

26
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
He took one look

27
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,240
and threw the ledger away.

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,160
Duoduo.

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,420
I'm sorry, Duoduo.

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,160
- Sorry.
- It's okay, Xixi.

31
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,240
It's all because of me.

32
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,200
It's all my fault.

33
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
It's okay, Xixi.

34
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,320
- Listen.
- It's my fault.

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,440
Listen to me.

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,660
The crucial thing now

38
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,720
is to get the evidence

39
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,180
that he used for loans in your name.

40
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,120
Today is a great opportunity.

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,780
We must solve these problems today.

42
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,340
What do you mean?

43
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,420
Weilan said he's looking for investors, right?

44
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,640
If they knew what kind of person he is,

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,740
would they invest in him?

46
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,440
It's been a while.

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,720
You owe three shots.

48
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,640
- Black.
- Listen.

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,860
- I will drink with you.
- Come on, drink.

50
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
Xixi asked me to drink,

51
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,790
so I have to drink.

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,740
Drink, drink.

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,240
Black,

54
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,520
I'll pour you a drink.

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,380
I'll pour you a drink.

56
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,140
What's going on?

57
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,400
Xixi poured me a drink,

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,340
and you're jealous?

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,080
- No, no.
- Come on, Black.

60
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,940
- No.
- Cheers.

61
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,180
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

62
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,090
- Come on.
- Cheers.

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,920
Come on. Keep playing.

64
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,100
- Black.
- Drink.

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
What's wrong with you?

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,240
Always contracts.

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
Enough with the it.

68
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,920
I told you not today.

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,660
Let's have fun, got it?

70
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,000
- A buzzkill.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,900
Weilong,

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,640
Black just wants to have fun,

73
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
not talk contracts.

74
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,240
Don't you get it?

75
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,880
Let's have some fun.

76
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,760
Why talk about contracts all night?

77
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,600
Yeah.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,280
Which successful man

79
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
acts like that?

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,020
Do you know what it's called?

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,300
It's called low EQ.

82
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,280
What are you saying?

83
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,240
So, you have low EQ.

84
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,280
I'm just helping you improve it.

85
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,120
Are you drunk?

86
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,030
I'm not drunk.

87
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,870
Du Weilong,

88
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,320
you've been borrowing money in my name.

89
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,960
Now you want me to drink and pay it back?

90
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,540
- Are you a man?
- What are you saying?

91
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,720
Black,

92
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,100
do you know what this contract is?

93
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,080
What are you saying?

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,680
- Du Weilong asked me...
- Don't.

95
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,600
Let her finish.

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,960
To drink with you

97
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,940
so you'd invest money.

98
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,880
Then, he'd take the money

99
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,000
and run.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,830
- You'll never find him.
- Don't move.

101
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,680
Sit down.

102
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,840
You dared to con me.

103
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,240
In this world, rules are the most important.

104
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,180
- Got it?
- Black.

105
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,360
No fighting here.

106
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,880
We'll settle

107
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,100
our score later.

108
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,880
Got it?

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,450
Weren't we fine just now?

110
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,750
- Watch yourself.
- Let's go.

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,140
Pay the bill.

112
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,670
You wretch.

113
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,640
Don't move.

114
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,560
Let go of me.

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
Mo Xixi, wait.

116
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,460
I won't let you go.

117
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,800
- Don't move.
- Cops are here.

118
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,920
Don't move.

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,000
Take them away.

120
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,360
Go.

121
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,400
Don't move.

122
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,760
Be quiet.

123
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,080
Stop staring.

124
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,220
It's over now.

125
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,320
Are you okay?

126
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm fine.

127
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,440
I'm fine.

128
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,080
It's over now.

129
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,940
The police are here.

130
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,480
Such a big scene.

131
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,630
I told you not to come.

132
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,480
Are you okay?

133
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,300
I'm fine.

134
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
Thanks to you two,

135
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,180
or he would've escaped again.

136
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,940
I've known Gao for so long,

137
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,660
but I've never seen him so anxious.

138
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,480
This plan was too risky.

139
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,960
He's not someone you can handle.

140
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,660
You should've thought of a better way.

141
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,900
Did you understand him?

142
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
He means

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,400
don't bear the burden alone.

144
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,460
He's here for you.

145
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
Xixi.

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,520
You too.

147
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,940
You've known us for so long.

148
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,140
Don't you trust us?

149
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,040
Sorry

150
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,460
for causing trouble.

151
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,320
It's okay.

152
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,360
Thanks to you,

153
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,540
otherwise,

154
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,180
I wouldn't know what to do.

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,860
My pleasure.

156
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,500
He's got something on me.

157
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,960
Sorry, sorry. I almost forgot.

158
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,880
I just took it.

159
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,320
I got it

160
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,180
during the chaos.

161
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,760
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

162
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,640
Let's go.

163
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,480
Go.

164
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,000
Secretary.

165
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,780
Captain Li.

166
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,380
Come on. Have a seat.

167
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,920
Secretary, I'm here

168
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,580
to explain about the ledger.

169
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,580
I heard from the police.

170
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,900
You acted bravely,

171
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,320
helped the police catch

172
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,020
the mastermind of the campus loan scheme,

173
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,980
and helped

174
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,660
many female students.

175
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,900
You're a role model among students.

176
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,080
Secretary, you're too kind.

177
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,440
I just did

178
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,420
what I could.

179
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,140
The finals of the league are coming up.

180
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,220
I've told the student council.

181
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,620
This issue of the school's

182
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,660
WeChat account will promote

183
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,760
your team.

184
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,580
Thanks, Secretary.

185
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,880
Once we get the ledger back,

186
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,760
I'll give it to you.

187
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,620
No worries.

188
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,000
The school

189
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,780
trusts you.

190
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,220
The past is past.

191
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
But in the future,

192
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,280
any similar sponsorships

193
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,060
must be reported

194
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,260
to the school.

195
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
I will thoroughly

196
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,320
check the ledger

197
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,830
- and give to you.
- Okay.

198
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,480
- I'll leave now.
- Okay.

199
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
Thank you, Secretary.

200
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,760
I'm back.

201
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,920
Duoduo, Duoduo.

202
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,420
How did it go with Secretary Zhou?

203
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,960
Don't worry.

204
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,240
If the police have no problem,

205
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,420
neither will Secretary Zhou.

206
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,760
That's great.

207
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,130
No trouble then.

208
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,910
Thank you so much.

209
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,400
You always help me.

210
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,890
Alright, stop saying that.

211
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,200
By the way,

212
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,240
I heard the finals tickets

213
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,880
are open to all citizens.

214
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,760
So you must play well.

215
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,680
Show the city and Ocean University

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,540

217
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,560
You mean

218
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,290
you must play well

219
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,680
and beat Tu Lingling, right?

220
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,780
Chen Weilan,

221
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,880
I want to play a match myself

222
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,060
to show her my strength.

223
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,500
Don't worry.

224
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,900
Watch me and Xixi.

225
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,340
We'll avenge you.

226
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,160
That's not important.

227
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,000
The key is

228
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,260
not to lose momentum.

229
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,760
Come on.

230
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,240
Go for it.

231
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,100

00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,020

- Okay.

249
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,560

and Long Ya,

405

00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,860
Right, Xixi.

412
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,200
- Don't cry.
- Okay.

413
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,040
But this match

414
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,620
was so important to Xiaojing.

415
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,920
There won't be another chance.

416
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,000
It's okay.

417
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,560
As long as we get into the top three

418
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,040
and enter the national league,

419
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,960
I still have a chance to get the graduate slot.

420
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,800
It's okay.

421
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,240
But we've worked so hard

422
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,600
to catch up in the score.

423
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,740
For what?

424
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,740
Who doesn't want to be the champion?

425
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,680
The championship is important,

426
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,700
but it's not the only goal.

427
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,000
When I was playing with you on the court,

428
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,460
I didn't think about things

429
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,280
like graduate slots or bonus points.

430
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,400
I just focused

431
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,240
on winning

432
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,280
the current point. Right?

433
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,120
As I said, it's okay.

434
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,900
I still have a chance.

435
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,160
Don't cry.

436
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,020
If you cry, I'll cry too.

437
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,640
Yeah, Xixi.

438
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,600
Don't cry.

439
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
It's okay. It's just a match.

440
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,200
There will be more in the future.

441
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Yeah, yeah.

442
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,380
Don't cry.

443
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,040
We've already done great.

444
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,220
There's no regret.

445
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,880
Xiaojing is right.

446
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,140
It doesn't mean everything.

447
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,400
As long as we keep our passion,

448
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,680
we can go further.

449
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,140
Next year, we'll win.

450
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,440
Go!

451
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,440

452
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,600

569
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,920
I'm not a gentleman at all.

570
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,760
I'm shameless.

571
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,320
The last time you saw me was

572
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,500
at my worst moment.

573
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,780
Right?

574
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,240
Now I'm defeated by you again.

575
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,160
Yet I came for you.

576
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,100
It shows I'm shameless.

577
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,000
So, you keep looking for me

578
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,060
because you're shameless.

579
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,800
No, no.

580
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,660
That's

581
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,280
a subjective reason.

582
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,880
The objective reason is you're great,

583
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,940
always attracting me.

584
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,300
What do you want from me?

585
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,980
I came to tell you

586
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,120
I'm not

587
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,500
an unreliable person.

588
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,100
Look at this.

589
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,600
This is my personal profile

590
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,880
made in an internet style.

591
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,720
It contains

592
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,800
data, charts, everything.

593
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,260
Including what happened last time.

594
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,880
We're all

595
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,240
in beach volleyball now.

596
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,680
You must understand data very well.

597
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
Take a look.

598
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,760
I just don't

599
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,600
want you

600
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,100
to misunderstand me.

601
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You scared me to death.

602
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,980
Are you childish or what?

603
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,240
Childish people play childish games

604
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,800
with childish people.

605
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,460
I'm not childish. You are.

606
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,140
Why suddenly come to the supermarket?

607
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,600
Yan and Mo won second place

608
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,500
in the competition.

609
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,520
I thought we should celebrate second place,

610
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,540
so I came for snacks.

611
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,380
And also because...

612
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,960
What else?

613
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,180
Tu Lingling won the league.

614
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,500
You might be feeling down,

615
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,960
so I brought you out

616
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,800
to change your mood.

617
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,240
Lingling's progress this time was significant,

618
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,420
and she's very strong.

619
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,400
Even if I teamed up with Weilan,

620
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,420
we wouldn't beat her.

621
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,500
So she deserved the championship.

622
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,100
Our Captain Duo has such

623
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,280
a good mindset now.

624
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,220
I've always had a good mindset.

625
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,160
Well then.

626
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,440
Let's hurry

627
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,900
to their award ceremony,

628
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,100
Can we make it?

629
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,020
Probably not.

630
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,020
We're already at the supermarket.

631
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,200
Let's go shopping.

632
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,620

What are you doing?

643
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,220
Who told you to put it back?

644
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,620
Chocolate is actually quite like

645
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,880

I can eat that, right?

647
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,740
Help me pack that over there.

648

Duoduo, you're shopping too?

649
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,640
Why are you here?

650
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,560
Last time, you asked me

651
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,520
to help clear things up.

652
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,730
- Did I help you?
- Get a bag.

653
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,860
I forgot to thank you.

654
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,480
If it weren't for you proving

655
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,440
it was Sci-Tech students

656
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,280
who bullied us first,

657
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,560
we wouldn't have been praised.

658
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,520
We avoided punishment

659
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,440
and got praised.

660
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,300
That's great.

661
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,440
By the way, Duoduo,

662
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,760
who's that cute guy? Your boyfriend?

663
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,060
Yes, I'm Duoduo's boyfriend.

664
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,540
Duoduo, you secretly got a boyfriend?

665
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,080
Remember to treat us to a meal.

666
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,060
Sure, we will.

667
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,000
I'll go pay.

668
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,680

Why are you running? Hey, your snacks.

675
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,880
What nonsense were you

676
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,780
saying in front of her?

677
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,280
What did I say?

678
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,480
What did you say?

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,340
You don't remember?

680
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,020
I said I'm your boyfriend.

681
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,380
How shameless.

682
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,320
What's wrong with that?

683
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,060
Look, I'm your good friend,

684
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,200

687
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,980
Is that what you meant?

688
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,060
What else could I mean?

689
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,980
You don't think I meant...

690
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,640
Li Guoduo,

691
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,100
are you secretly into me?

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,220
Dream on.

693
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,180

Look at the news link I sent you.

699
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,680
Latest sports news.

700
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,040
A new coach joins the NYT.

701
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,660
According to our latest news,

702
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,880
Coach Zhang Yecheng

703
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
from Beijing No.8 High

704
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,720
School has been selected as a coach for the NYT

705
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,980
due to his high-level coaching skills.

706
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,380
Duoduo, why aren't you at practice?

707
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,980
Weilan is here too.

708
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,520
Why are you spacing out?

709
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,360
I've done practice.

710
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,020
Practice model, Li Guoduo,

711
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,300
actually spacing out here.

712
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,820
I wasn't spacing out.

713
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,100
I was just thinking.

714
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,040
What's on your mind?

715
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,620
Say it. I'll help you think.

716
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,800
You know.

717
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,760
Well.

718
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,560
Why would a guy

719
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,120
say in front of others

720
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,500
that he is a girl's boyfriend?

721
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,060
He is her boyfriend.

722
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,860
No, they're just friends.

723
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,320
Duoduo,

724
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,060
are you in love?

725
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,760
I'm not in love.

726
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,080
Tell me if he's

727
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,280
- Shao...
- I'm not.

728
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,120
I'm not in love.

729
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,560
What love?

730
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,620
Tell me.

731
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,780
Who is it?

732
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,940
If not him, who is it?

733
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,280
Duoduo.

734
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,460
(Coach Zhang: Hearying us say ayo,
the champion's halo is behind us.)

735
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,500
This environment is really nice.

736
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,300
Isn't this Chen Weilan?

737
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,560
It is.

738
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,000
- Coach Zhang.
- Your strength isn't enough.

739
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,580
This is our school's court.

740
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,480
It's a bit simple,

741
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,800
but

742
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,700
the team's skills are quite good.

743
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,700
Secretary Zhou. Weilan.

744
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,880
Coach Zhang.

745
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,720
- Weilan.
- Hello.

746
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,080
Coach Zhang.

747
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,640
- You know each other?
- Of course.

748
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,480
Secretary Zhou,

749
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,540
Coach Zhang was my coach in high school.

750
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,140
Let me introduce you.

751
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,560
This is Coach Zhang

752
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,400
from the NYT.

753
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,340
This is our team captain,

754
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,400
Li Guoduo.

755
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,180
Our team's key player.

756
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,960
Hello, Coach Zhang.

757
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,800
Hello.

758
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,640
Weilan,

759
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,180
I heard from previous teammates

760
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,460
that you changed.

761
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,980
You look great now.

762
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,280
Secretary Zhou.

763
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,060
Sorry for interrupting.

764
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,560
I wanted to speak with Weilan.

765
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,780
Is that alright?

766
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:02,920
Sure.

767
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,480
Come on.

768
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,150
Secretary Zhou.

769
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,140
Beach volleyball now?

770
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,560
Secretary Zhou,

771
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,220
the atmosphere in your team

772
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,680
is really great.

773
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,960
I can feel

774
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,580
Weilan has made great progress recently.

775
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,380
Her mindset has matured a lot.

776
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,290
Thanks, Coach Zhang.

777
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,980
You're Li Guoduo, right?

778
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,120
Yes.

779
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,840
Weilan was just praising you, saying

780
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,260
your skills are very comprehensive

781
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,480
and outstanding.

782
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,920
We're going to have dinner together.

783
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,900
How about join us?

784
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,200
You all go ahead.

785
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,120
I have some things,

786
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,380
so I won't join you.

787
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,360
Secretary Zhou,

788
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,320
I'll leave first.

789
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,160
I won't disturb you.

790
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,720
Bye-bye.

791
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,360
Bye-bye.

792
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,820
Look at this kid.

793
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,080
Let me take this opportunity

794
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,600
to thank them on camera.

795
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,920
There are many people

796
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,420
I need to thank on this journey.

797
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,680
My parents, my coach,

798
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,720
my partner,

799
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,340
and my teammates.

800
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,320
My teammates have

801
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,020
given me a lot of help and support.

802
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,140
But I want to thank two people the most.

803
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,800
One is my former partner,

804
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,640
Li Guoduo.

805
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,200
If it weren't for Li Guoduo, I would never

806
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,620
have played beach volleyball.

807
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,460
She helped me a lot.

808
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,000
Without her,

809
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I wouldn't have achieved

810
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,940
this honor today,

811
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,100
or be standing

812
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,620
on the winner's podium.

813
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,260
She is a part of my youth,

814
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,700
and I will never forget her.

815
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,860
I can feel the sincere friendship
of your youth.

816
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,840
Everyone has a friend like this

817
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,400
in their youth.

818
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,000
They may not be by our side,

819
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,660
but they are forever in our memories.

821
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,450

828
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,000
(Lu Xiaole)
(I remember Li.)

829
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,160
(With her physical condition,)

830
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,100
(achieving this level)

831
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,700
(is quite impressive.)

832
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,280
(Beach Volleyball Case Analysis)

833
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,100
(But Lu Xiaole isn't a professional.)

834
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,600
(Li Guoduo's talent)

835
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,220
(is somewhat wasted with him.)

836
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,680
(Take Li and Chen as examples.)

837
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
(If they could undergo)

838
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,980
(my systematic training,)

839
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,980
(their future would be bright.)

840
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,980
(But Lu Xiaole sent me a resume)

841
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,340
(and I ended up recruiting from him.)

842
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,680
(Forget it.)

843
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,020
(They might not want to come.)

844
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,500
(I just need to explain things clearly.)

845
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,840
Lingling.

846
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,160
Come here.

847
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,160
I'm going ahead.

848
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,040
Coach.

849
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,460
You know Li Guoduo, right?

850
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,660
- Yes.
- I think she's a good talent.

851
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,680
I'd like you to help me invite her

852
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,540
to join us.

853
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,900
Of course, it depends on her own wishes.

854
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,600
Alright, I'll take care of this.

855
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,440
Don't worry.

856
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,180
- I'll be back.
- Go ahead.

857
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,840
Chen Weilan,

858
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,100
your shot today was really good.

859
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,600
For the setter,

860
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,800
use a little bumping

861
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
and then spike.

862
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,900
With your strength,
your opponents won't block it.

863
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,740
You're great now.

864
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,660
You've learned to rely on your mate

865
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,460
to do more with less effort.

866
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,880
Coach Zhang,

867
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,280
if you have any advice,

868
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,000
don't just tell Chen Weilan.

869
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,560
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

870
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,620
- It's not true.
- Coach.

871
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,120
Come on.

872
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,800
I'm very happy today

873
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,040
to gather here

874
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,080
with Weilan.

875
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,460
I hope each of us

876
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,980
can achieve our dreams.

877
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,980
Let's have a toast.

878
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,360
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

879
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,920
Coach Zhang, let's take a group photo.

880
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,720
- Yeah.
- Let's take a photo.

881
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,040
Sure, we can do that later.

882
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,940
Alright, no problem.

883
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,200
Weilan,

884
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,960
I'm very happy

885
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,860
to see you here today.

886
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,940
I hope you can join our team

887
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,220
and play with us.

888
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,540
I haven't had the chance to tell you,

889
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,400
but I've switched to beach volleyball now,

890
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,260
not indoor volleyball.

891
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,900
But your strengths

892
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,040
are in indoor volleyball.

893
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,100
Yes, I know.

894
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,800
But after playing

895
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,100
beach volleyball for months,

896
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,340
I've realized my shortcomings.

897
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,780
And I now have a new partner

898
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,940
that I work very well with.

899
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,040
So, I want

900
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,180
to continue playing beach volleyball.

901
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,860
Thank you for the invitation.

902
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,160
How about this?

903
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,220
Think it over carefully.

904
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,080
Consider your personal characteristics
and preferences.

905
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,920
Be rational.

906
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,000
We'll talk about it later.

907
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,840
Let's have dinner.

908
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,140
You seem to approve of Coach Lu.

909
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,900
Why? You don't?

910
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,780
He's just a National Youth Team coach.

911
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,700
You know

912
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,480
his level.

913
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,060
I don't care about his level.

914
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,420
I care about beach volleyball.

915
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,460
If you join the NYT this time,

916
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,380
do you care about beach volleyball?

917
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,800
Why couldn't you join

918
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,640
the NYT?

919
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,020
Lack of skill?

920
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,460
I wasn't selected

921
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,500
because I didn't want to go.

922
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,760
That can't be.

923
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Lang Yueting was selected.

924
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,420
Why wouldn't you want to go?

925
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,100
Because you weren't good enough?

926
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,860
Not everyone is like you,

927
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,420
failing to get into the NYT
due to a lack of skill.

928
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,980
But everyone knows

929
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,480
I didn't get into the NYT

930
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,300
and the Sports University.

931
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,520
You keep it to yourself.

932
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,140
No one can mention it.

933
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,500
Are you afraid of being laughed at?

934
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,540
During the last NYT selection,

935
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,500
I was determined to get in.

936
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,100
But somehow, I wasn't chosen.

937
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,660
Regardless, neither of us

938
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,020
made it to the NYT.

939
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,100
What gives you the right to lecture me?

940
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,060
I don't have the right to lecture you.

941
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,500
But

942
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,140
this must be important to you.

943
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,660
Otherwise, why can't you let it go

944
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,580
