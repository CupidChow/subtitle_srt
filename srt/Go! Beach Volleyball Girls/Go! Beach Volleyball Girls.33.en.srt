18
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,740
Hello, Coach Lu.

19
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
What?

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,700
You're almost here?

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,600
No problem.

22
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,140
Wait for me for a bit, okay?

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,480
Alright.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Coming.

25
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,740
Coach Tian.

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,780
Thank you.

27
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,940
Come in.

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,040
Okay.

29
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,140
Close the door for me.

30
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Okay.

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,220
Coach Tian,

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,500
how's your foot?

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,100
It's fine. Just twisted it.

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,420
The doctor said

35
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,060
two days of rest is enough.

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,580
Please have a seat.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,240
- Sure.
- Here.

38
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,360
Let me help you.

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,300
No, no, no.

40
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,220
I can manage.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,360
Sit.

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,640
Alright.

43
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,000
What's wrong?

44
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,580
Sorry.

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,760
I just tossed the ointment

46
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,780
on the couch after I used it.

47
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,700
It's okay. You scared me.

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,660
Let me pour you some water.

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,160
No, I'm not thirsty.

50
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,140
It's okay.

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,640
How about a beverage?

52
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,500
Sure, sure.

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,720
(This is my house.)

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,860
(Why am I so nervous?)

55
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,120
Come on.

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,780
There are no more beverages.

57
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,360
I forgot.

58
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,170
Actually, I can't have sugary stuff.

59
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,940
So, Coach Lu,

60
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,620
why did you come to see me today?

61
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,820
Nothing.

62
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,440
Well.

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,300
I just wanted to check

64
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,880
on your foot

65
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,180
and maybe treat you to a meal.

66
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,260
You've helped me so much.

67
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,380
We're friends, after all.

68
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,820
We should help each other.

69
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,740
As for the meal...

70
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,000
Well, I...

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,800
You need to eat well now

72
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,020
to get your strength back.

73
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,060
But I can't go out now.

74
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,240
Then

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,620
we can eat at home.

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
At home?

77
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,840
I can't cook.

78
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,680
No worries.

79
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,720
I can.

80
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,320
Remember? I write on my resume

81
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,060
that I graduated from culinary school.

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,400
I could've been a chef,

83
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,100
but I ended up as a coach instead.

84
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,700
And now I'm stuck in it.

85
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,940
This...

86
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,420
I need to wash this.

87
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,290
- Let me help you.
- No, no.

88
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,160
I can manage.

89
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,220
It's okay. Careful.

90
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,220
Are you okay?

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,660
I'm fine.

92
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,100
Can you help me get my crutch?

93
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,200
Here.

94
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,240
Well.

95
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,500
The laundry room

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,240
is over there.

97
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,140
Weilan, you're back.

98
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,120
Perfect timing.

99
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,480
Let's eat.

100
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,320
Hurry.

101
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,480
Perfect timing.

102
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,100
Wow, so many dishes.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,300
You love yellow croaker, right?

104
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,640
I went to so many places to find it.

105
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,700
It was hard to find.

106
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,200
I had to go to Chinatown today

107
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,380
to finally get it.

108
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,180
Try it to see if it's authentic.

109
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,460
It's not takeout, is it?

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,320
Are you kidding me?

111
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,420
I'm exhausted.

112
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,640
Is it good?

113
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,720
Not bad.

114
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,940
Good, eat more.

115
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,460
All your favorites.

116
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
Here.

117
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,500
Some leafy greens.

118
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,260
And eggs, too.

119
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,900
I can manage myself.

120
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,980
You need to replenish your energy.

121
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,980
Eat up. You must be starving.

122
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,760
Weilan,

123
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,120
do you hate

124
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,220
that I forced you to be here?

125
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,500
You did it for me, didn't you?

126
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,300
Let me ask you.

127
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,420
Have you thought about your future?

128
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,620
I'll play beach volleyball

129
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,960
and join the NYT.

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,620
I've been thinking

131
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,300
a lot lately,

132
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,900
seeing you persist

133
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,660
with your rehab

134
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,980
and training.

135
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,880
The moment your hand got better,

136
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,300
you went out to play again.

137
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,700
It makes me

138
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,260
feel bad.

139
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,740
But I'm proud.

140
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,120
Because my daughter

141
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,820
is someone who can chase her dreams

142
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,460
with determination.

143
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,580
I've also been thinking

144
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,620
if I were

145
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,620
in your shoes,

146
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,770
what would I do?

147
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,820
Probably the same as you.

148
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,500
The reason I work so hard

149
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,040
to make money

150
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,920
is to give you

151
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,980
a better life.

152
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,260
You lost your dad long ago.

153
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,020
You don't have a father figure.

154
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,920
I want to give you the best

155
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,900
the world has to offer.

156
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,080
But

157
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,580
I'm afraid

158
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,740
that one wrong step will lead us astray.

159
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,620
Because I've been through a lot, I don't

160
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,420
want you to make the same mistakes.

161
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,460
Seeing how much you love volleyball,

162
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,460
I should support you.

163
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,540
So,

164
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,920
today,

165
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,140
I'm apologizing to you.

166
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,860
I was wrong.

167
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,580
Let's make a deal.

168
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,620
What deal?

169
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,980
If you stick to your dream, I'll support you.

170
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,400
I hope you make it

171
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,420
to the NYT.

172
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,680
But

173
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,100
the path of an athlete is really tough.

174
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,460
I'm not afraid of hardship.

175
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,620
If you don't make it

176
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,480
to the NYT

177
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,600
during college,

178
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,380
it proves it's not for you.

179
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,900
You'll have tried,

180
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,140
and you'll have to face reality.

181
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,660
We'll cut our losses.

182
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,300
After graduation, you'll come abroad

183
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,120
and follow my plan.

184
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,740
So, you agree I can go back to China?

185

♪To embrace all with courage♪

186
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,700

♪No one can♪

188
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
Deal.

189
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,660
Deal.

190
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,900
No backing out.

191
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,100
I'm very fickle.

192
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,740
You never know.

193
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,540
Eat. Everything's getting cold.

194
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,120
I can manage.

195
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,020
You eat.

196
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,960
Alright.

197
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,580
The food's ready.

198
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,120
You go ahead.

199
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,400
I'll clean up the kitchen.

200
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,420
Don't wait for me.

201
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,280
All set.

202
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,400
Aren't you eating?

203
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,200
What's wrong?

204
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't like it?

205
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,620
Something on my face?

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
No.

207
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,060
I just didn't expect it.

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,980
Didn't expect me

209
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,300
to be so domestic?

210
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,500
Actually, I didn't expect it either.

211
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,660
Okay, enough joking.

212
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,760
Eat up

213
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,620
before it really gets cold.

214
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,080
I'll give it a try.

215
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,560
Don't just eat veggies.

216
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,460
Have some meat.

217
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,680
You should eat, too.

218
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,540
I'm not hungry.

219
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,680
Here are some new materials

220
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,740
I picked out for you.

221
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,300
They're all pretty good.

222
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,580
Pick one.

223
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,440
I was so frustrated
when I was picked by others.

224
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,060
Now that I get to pick,

225
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,180
I'm even more frustrated.

226
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,720
Why?

227
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,360
We'll help you choose.

228
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,700
Yeah, we'll help you choose.

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,580
This is what they call "happy troubles".

230
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,420
Is that all?

231
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,060
Yeah, that's it.

232
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Doesn't feel like any of them are quite right.

233
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,100
Everyone's here.

234
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,320
- Weilan!
- Weilan!

235
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,420
You're back!

236
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,920
Is your hand better?

237
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,840
Of course.

238
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,500
I wouldn't be back if it wasn't healed.

239
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,560
I'm telling you. I can beat you

240
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,820
one-handed now.

241
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,540
Why did you become
a braggart after going abroad?

242
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,660
Did you guys miss me?

243
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,380
We did.

244
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,120
I got in.

245
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,560
Coach Lu told me I made it.

246
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,700
I'm in the NYT.

247
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,420
You're back.

248
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,060
So, you're leaving?

249
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,420
When did you get back?

250
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,940
When are you leaving?

251
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,580
Are you that eager for me to go?

252
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm just worried

253
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,720
if you leave in a hurry,

254
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,800
we won't have time to throw you

255
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,900
a farewell party.

256
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,920
She means she doesn't

257
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,340
want you to leave.

258
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,060
Yeah, yeah.

259
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,640
You're leaving so suddenly.

260
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,820
Weilan just got back.

261
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,100
It is sudden.

262
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,480
But I'm worried

263
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
you won't make friends

264
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,740
as good as us over there.

265
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,620
You don't need to worry

266
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,260
about that.

267
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,100
True.

268
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,060
There are familiar faces there.

269
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,600
Right.

270
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,260
If you hadn't reminded me,

271
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,320
I would've forgotten.

272
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,620
Welcome.

273
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,720
It's good to be back in the dorm.

274
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,520
What are you doing?

275
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,360
You've been staring at me the whole way.

276
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,640
Do I have something on my face?

277
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,740
Stop it.

278
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,820
Actually,

279
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,700
after you left,

280
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,660
Gao Ge has been missing you.

281
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,540
He joined the NYT for you.

282
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,040
I haven't even made it yet.

283
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,460
He got in even before me.

284
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,460
He did recommend himself to the NYT.

285
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,080
But

286
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,480
don't you know

287
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,900
why he did this?

288
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,120
I don't know.

289
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,460
Chen Weilan.

290
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,800
You usually seem smart.

291
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,260
Why are you being foolish now?

292
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,020
Who dreams about joining the NYT?

293
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,620
Whose wish was it?

294
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,980
His wish, his dream.

295
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,760
Chen Weilan, can you

296
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,220
not make me so angry?

297
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,880
Joining the NYT is your lifelong

298
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,860
dream and wish.

299
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,940
After you went abroad,

300
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,440
he was very upset.

301
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,240
He kept thinking about you.

302
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,960
So, he joined the NYT

303
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,460
to fulfill your dream.

304
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,420
It seems he went alone.

305
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,780
Actually,

306
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,100
he is carrying both your dreams.

307
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,900
Gao Ge leaves tomorrow.

308
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,980
At today's farewell party,

309
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,540
seize the opportunity.

310
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,740
Give me the clothes.

311
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,300
Let me make your bed.

312
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,210
Give it to me.

313
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,660
What does she want?

314
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,980
Showed up and left just like that.

315
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,700
What's the school to her?

316
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,480
What does she want?

317
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,560
She has someone she's been thinking about here.

318
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,220
Otherwise, why come back from so far away?

319
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,320
I told her long ago that the environment

320
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,920
abroad wasn't suitable for her,

321
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,020
but she wouldn't listen.

322
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,120
How is it not better here?

323
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,800
Yes, it's better here.

324
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,340
Now she's back. Did you treat her well?

325
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,780
You kept arguing with her.

326
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,460
Wasn't she the same?

327
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,160
Look at her.

328
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,220
She'd love it if I left.

329
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,500
You're leaving tomorrow anyway.

330
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,720
Bro, let me be honest.

331
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,240
You're wasting time

332
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
being upset here

333
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,060
You should be spending time with her.

334
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,440
Don't wait until you

335
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,020
can't see her and regret it later.

336
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,820
(Dafu BBQ)

337
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,180
- Coming.
- Come on.

338
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,520
- Careful.
- Thanks, Auntie.

339
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,920
We have too many small items on this table.

340
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,480
Maybe later, get me a takeaway bag.

341
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,580
I'll take it with me.

342
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,440
Okay, I'll pack it for you later.

343
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,120
Mom, are you still doing business?

344
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,780
At this rate, we'll go bankrupt.

345
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,480
When did you become so stingy?

346
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,720
Come on, Gao Ge, eat more.

347
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,800
- Thanks, Auntie.
- I'll toast to you today.

348
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,840
Congratulations.

349
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,040
You need to eat more today.

350
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,640
Otherwise, when you're in the NYT,

351
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,880
you'll miss

352
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,740
our BBQ.

353
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,320
- Okay.
- Worried

354
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,420
about Gao Ge going hungry in the NYT?

355
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,160
The food there is much better

356
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,320
than ours.

357
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,180
As if you've been there before.

358
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,540
I'm a veteran of the NYT.

359
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,920
When we played back then,

360
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
let me tell you...

361
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,460
- The cafeteria...
- Alright.

362
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,300
Mandarin fish and braised pork.

363
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,260
Let's eat.

364
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,760
Well.

365
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,540
Since I came to Xingang University,

366
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,780
a lot has happened

367
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,900
in just a few months.

368
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,540
Our team used to have many members,

369
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,540
but now there are fewer and fewer.

370
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,400
And now, another one

371
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,960
is leaving.

372
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,260
But

373
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,900
people have aspirations.

374
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,340
Gao Ge is going to the NYT.

375
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,020
Isn't this the result of my coaching?

376
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,420
You did teach me a lot except volleyball.

377
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,860
Gao Ge, say something.

378
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,220
What is there to say?

379
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,980
Nothing to say.

380
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,340
Are you sure you have nothing to say?

381
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,400
I'll drink this.

382
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,360
Nothing to say?

383
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,380
Then drink by yourself.

384
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,280
Really nothing to say.

385
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,340
It's all in the drink.

386
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,640
I'll drink.

387
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,780
I'll drink. Come on.

388
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,720
Gao Ge,

389
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,340
I toast to you.

390
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,460
My boyfriend isn't here today.

391
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,580
I have some heartfelt words to share.

392
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,800
I'm recording this,

393
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,260
so be careful.

394
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,740
Sorry, Weilan.

395
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,420
Everyone knows

396
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,400
I joined the team

397
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,060
because I liked you.

398
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,160
I didn't expect

399
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,340
to make such good friends.

400
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,120
I didn't expect

401
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,600
to find my own love.

402
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,440
I didn't expect to truly fall in love

403
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,860
with beach volleyball.

404
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,960
Everything started because of you.

405
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,020
Thank you, Gao Ge.

406
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,120
I'm not calling your name.

407
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,220
It's "Ge" as in "brother".

408
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,680
From now on,

409
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,740
you're my brother.

410
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,860
You'll do even better.

411
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,080
Speaking of which,

412
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,220
I'll make a toast too.

413
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,380
The toast is to Gao Ge

414
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,220
but also to everyone.

415
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
I don't

416
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,200
have as many sentiments as Jingxuan,

417
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,640
but since joining the team,

418
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,040
your presence

419
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,200
has made me

420
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,860
stronger and more resilient.

421
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,960
So,

422
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,580
I love you all.

423
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,700
We love you too.

424
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,400
- Cheers.
- Together.

425
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,240
Come on.

426
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,260
Wen Xin spoke well.

427
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,700
Since that's the case,

428
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,900
I'll also toast to Gao Ge.

429
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,540
As the head coach of our team,

430
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,780
an amateur coach,

431
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,340
Gao Ge, I admire you.

432
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,160
You not only play well

433
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,040
but you're also handsome

434
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,880
with a bad temper.

435
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,480
But people still like him,

436
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,320
right?

437
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,340
I'm a bit jealous of you.

438
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,380
Are you praising me or criticizing me?

439
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,580
I'm neither praising nor criticizing you.

440
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
Gao Ge, since you're going to the NYT,

441
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,820
it's my brother's territory.

442
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,580
If

443
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
he targets you,

444
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,380
give him my name.

445
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,980
I'll give your post a like.

446
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,140
So, it won't help, right?

447
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,120
Just kidding.

448
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,020
Gao Ge,

449
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,820
following my cousin,

450
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,380
there's a bright future.

451
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,980
Thank you, Coach.

452
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,720
Keep it up.

453
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,780
Come on, Gao Ge.

454
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,500
As brothers,

455
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,740
we toast to you.

456
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,540
After you get there,

457
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,700
keep in touch with us.

458
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,640
I have nothing else to say,

459
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,660
except

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,960
if there are

461
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,800
female trainees

462
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,300
who have any pro questions,

463
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,840
let them find me.

464
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,080
I'll give them guidance.

465
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,640
Liqiang, are you drunk?

466
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,840
Do the NYT's female trainees

467
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,360
need your guidance?

468
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,880
It's different.

469
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,780
Stop it.

470
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,280
Gao,

471
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,140
as your little mascot,

472
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,760
I'm actually reluctant to see you go.

473
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,140
After all, we're the high,
rich, and cute combo.

474
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,080
With you leaving,

475
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,920
don't forget you're Gao.

476
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,800
When you get there,

477
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,300
stay high as you always are.

478
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,140
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

479
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,480
Gao Ge, don't put down your glass.

480
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,660
I toast to you.

481
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,200
Well.

482
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,380
I sincerely admire you.

483
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
No wonder you're our Xingang's idol.

484
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,940
I'm sincerely happy for you.

485
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,420
As the captain of the team,

486
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,180
on behalf of all the team members,

487
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,120
we're very reluctant to see you go.

488
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,300
We'll miss you.

489
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,480
Duoduo,

490
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,660
who do you represent?

491
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,540
Anyone.

492
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,300
Alright, put it down.

493
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,900
Come on, Gao Ge.

494
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,800
I toast to you.

495
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,380
Congratulations

496
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,780
on going to the NYT first.

497
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,060
Keep it up.

498
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,020
Don't forget us.

499
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,560
Don't worry.

500
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,680
I'll wait for you.

501
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,860
Okay.

502
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,880
Eat quickly.

503
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,720
- It's getting cold. Duoduo.
- Eat.

504
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,340
- Eat while it's hot.
- Eat while it's hot.

505
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,670
- Thanks, Auntie.
- Thanks, Auntie.

506
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,180
Come on, come on.

507
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,200
- Eat up.
- Drink.

508
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,070
Uncle, let's eat.

509
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,280
- Have a drink.
- Drink up.

510
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,180
- Smells so good.
- Come on.

511
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,180
- Tomorrow...
- Well...

512
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,340
- You first.
- You go.

513
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,420
- The NYT...
- The NYT...

514
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,800
I'm waiting for you.

515
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,620
I'm serious.

516
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,860
I'm waiting for you at the NYT.

517
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,740
You have to come.

518
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,780
If you don't come,

519
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,460
I'll...

520
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,280
What?

521
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,620
I'll

522
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,000
keep waiting for you.

523
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,060
You'll leave tomorrow morning.

524
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,740
Before you go,

525
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,620
let's do something together.

00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,580
Weilan, Weilan.

572
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,700
So late.

573
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,480
You slept here?

574
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,420
Overnight?

575
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,280
Where's Gao Ge?

576
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,380
By now, he's probably on the road.

577
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,220
Shao Nian and others went to see him off.

578
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,420
He left it for you, right?

579
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,060
He probably didn't

580
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,580
want you to see him off.

581
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,440
Alright.

582
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,740
(Rushi Bookstore)

583
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,300
- Sorry. I'm late.
- It's okay.

584
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,140
- Sit.
- Sorry.

585
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,540
Had a sudden meeting.

586
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,040
The school league ended a while ago.

587
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,080
Why are you still so busy?

588
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,940
Come on.

589
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,520
Have some hot soup to warm up your stomach.

590
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,480
Busy going around.

591
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,720
Athletes should eat more.

592
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,700
I know.

593
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,080
But we've been busy

594
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,700
with the National College Student League.

595
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,680
Three teams in the province

596
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,980
will join, including our school.

597
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,820
The national league?

598
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,260
Doesn't our school have a chance?

599
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,720
Your competition results were canceled.

600
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,340
Originally, the top three had a chance.

601
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,600
You were canceled.

602
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,160
The fourth place moved up.

603
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,480
So it's our school,

604
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,460
Agricultural Uni, and Uni of Petroleum.

605
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,860
So you're busy with this now?

606
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,120
Yes, time is tight.

607
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,420
Only one month left.

608
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,060
A month?

609
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,840
Why don't you eat?

610
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,700
Sure. I'll eat.

611
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,660
Waiter,

612
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,760
the menu.

613
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,480
Hello, sir.

614
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,780
What do you want?

615
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,780
There are enough dishes. No more.

616
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,600
We don't know

617
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,720
when we'll eat together

618
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,660
after this.

619
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,060
We need to eat more

620
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,340
until late at night.

621
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,500
No, until the next morning.

622
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,380
One serving of king crab, please.

623
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,440
Alright.

624
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,700
One serving of king crab?

625
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,940
- Coach.
- Coach.

626
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,440
What are you doing?

627
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,640
Why aren't you at the court?

628
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,120
Cool for you.

629
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,160
Staying inside,

630
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,500
not going out to guide us.

631
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,620
You just trained, right?

632
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,320
It's okay. I'm thinking about some issues.

633
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,940
Contemplating life?

634
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,940
I think he's thinking about Coach Tian.

635
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,120
You're right.

636
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,840
Today, Coach Tian told me

637
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,040
that they can join the national league.

638
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,060
I was thinking.

639
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,580
Why can't we?

640
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,100
The national league?

641
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,080
We should participate too.

642
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,660
I'll talk to the Secretary about this.

643
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,160
They won the Seven-School League.

644
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,580
We also won.

645
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,140
Secretary Zhou,

646
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,640
other schools are preparing

647
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,660
for the national league.

648
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,440
Can we also participate

649
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,480
in the national league?

650
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,460
Don't mention it.

651
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,420
It just makes me angry.

652
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
Yan Xiaojing bribed the referees.

653
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,000
Our school can't hold its head high
among universities

654
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,900
in Xingang.

655
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,460
Secretary Zhou,

656
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,940
Yan Xiaojing has been punished.

657
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,080
We really want to participate

658
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,480
in this competition.

659
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,860
Can you help us get a chance?

660
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,400
Li Guoduo,

661
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,330
I understand how you feel,

662
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,420
but the school really

663
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,700
can't do anything

664
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,250
about it.

665
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,860
In my opinion,

666
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,100
let it go this year.

667
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,620
Besides, the final exams are coming.

668
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,730
You should focus on the exams.

669
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,140
Try again next year.

670
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,080
Secretary Zhou,

671
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,520
every competition

672
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,100
is important

673
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,810
to us players.

674
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,330
You've seen the effect of the new league.

675
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,620
It was quite high-level and prestigious.

676
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,420
Could you

677
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,020
apply to higher-ups and see

678
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,080
if the champion of the new league

679
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,000
can participate in the national league?

680
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,440
- Well.
- Secretary Zhou,

681
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,000
Please help us.

682
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,620
Just this once.

683
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,220
Our team

684
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,640
won the new league.

685
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,200
We hope to perform well

686
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,480
in a national-level

687
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,800
beach volleyball competition.

688
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,380
- We will...
- Alright.

689
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,260
So eloquent.

690
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,920
Well.

691
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,320
I'll

692
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,680
give it a try.

693
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,180
Great. Thank you, Secretary Zhou.

694
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,360
Thank you.

695
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,760
Coach Tian,

696
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,380
we meet again so soon.

697
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,440
Where are we going today?

698
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,220
Shall we go to your place for a nice dinner?

699
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,620
Do you think I'm a pig?

700
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,140
Always cooking for me.

701
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,680
We could do something else.

702
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,440
How about watching a movie

703
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,560
to develop our relationship?

704
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,400
What do you think?

705
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,100
Be serious.

706
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,760
Besides meeting you today,

707
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,420
I need to ask you for a favor.

708
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,720
One favor isn't enough.

709
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,740
You can ask for more.

710
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,300
Not serious, huh?

711
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,900
- Then I'm leaving.
- Don't.

712
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,320
Tell me.

713
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
There's just over a month

714
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,020
until the national league.

715
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,520
This time, the participants

716
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,660
are the top athletes from across the country.

717
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,540
I don't have

718
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,900
much experience leading teams.

719
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,340
So I was thinking...

720
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,080
You want me to co-lead the team, right?

721
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,880
- Sure, let's go.
- No.

722
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,040
That's not what I meant.

723
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,180
Let me finish.

724
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,740
I want to ask you

725
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,200
to invite your cousin Lu Daxing

726
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,860
to come and guide us for a few days.

727
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,640
A week will be enough.

728
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,480
What do you think?

729
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,140
I don't think so.

730
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,000
So you're looking for me just for my cousin?

731
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,380
I'm a setter.

732
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
The setter is very important

733
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,560
in indoor volleyball.

734
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,160
It's like the brain of the team.

735
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,560
Talking about this is useless.

736
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,920
I want to see you every day,

737
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,540
but you just want me to find my cousin.

738
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,580
You're really disappointing me.

739
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,180
You're speaking in such a sarcastic tone.

740
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,020
I'm asking for a little help.

741
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,240
Will you help me?

742
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,400
It's fine if refuse.

743
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,240
Come on.

744
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,820
Is this how you ask for help?

745
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,600
Given our relationship,

746
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,920
should I get a gift or something

747
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,420
before you help me?

748
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,200
Well.

749
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,140
Help me.

750
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,940
I'll owe you a big favor.

751
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,340
That's fine.

752
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,580
Bro, listen.

753
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,780
When she arrives,

754
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,060
speak well of me.

755
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,260
Long legs?

756
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,420
What long legs?

757
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,860
This time, it's a goddess.

758
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,540
A goddess?

759
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,280
How's it going?

760
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,380
Unrequited love, huh?

761
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,700
What are you saying?

762
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,400
I've been to her home

763
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,100
and made breakfast several times.

764
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,540
Is this serious this time?

765
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,440
Anyway, I've done my job.

766
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,760
It's your turn.

767
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,780
Get in the position

768
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,180
and do your job.

769
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,320
Alright.

770
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,900
As long as you're serious,

771
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,900
I can handle

772
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,920
the rest.

773
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,340
(Fenghe Market)

774
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,340
Coach Tian, come.

775
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,140
This is my cousin.

776
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,420
Lu Daxing, Coach Lu.

777
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,440
Hello, Coach Lu.

778
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,340
This is Coach Tian from Ocean University.

779
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,440
I know.

780
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,100
Hello, Coach Tian.

781
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,640
Last time we met briefly,

782
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,420
I didn't expect you to remember me.

783
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,540
Your guidance was outstanding.

784
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,700
I was quite impressed.

785
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,620
You're too kind.

786
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,200
Under your guidance,

787
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,900
the NYT has improved significantly.

788
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,600
You're a great coach.

789
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,460
Not at all.

790
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,180
Let's sit and chat.

791
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,300
- Sit.
- Sit down.

792
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,300
Coach Tian,

793
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,180
you don't know.

794
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,740
When I practiced volleyball
with my brother as a child,

795
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,020
people used to say

796
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,020
I had more talent than my brother.

797
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,860
I heard Coach Tian is a good friend

798
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,900
of Lu.

799
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,180
We played a friendly match once.

800
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,480
Just once?

801
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,660
Yeah. Just once.

802
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,240
Right, Coach Lu,

803
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,860
I'd like you to review

804
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,600
this video of our team's match

805
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,540
in the Seven-School League.

806
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,020
I want your guidance.

807
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,460
- Sure.
- Move a bit.

808
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,140
Look here.

809
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,140
You see.

810
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,140
They like to play quick attacks.

811
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,440
In this situation, you should use

812
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,440
long-distance floating balls

813
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,280
or high tips.

814
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,240
This will disrupt the opponent's bumping

815
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,060
and break their offensive rhythm.

816
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,120
Well.

817
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,420
Let's talk after ordering food.

818
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,820
You order. We're fine with anything.

819
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,280
Anything is fine.

820
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,860
Coach Lu, look.

821
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,420
In this set, it's a pity they lost.

822
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,260
Yes, you see.

823
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,300
When dealing with this positional attack,

824
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,080
you should use not only man-to-man defense

825
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,600
but also area-based blocking defense,

826
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,560
combined with new-style overlapping blocks.

827
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,780
This set could have been won.

828
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,440
I'm going to the bathroom.

829
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,280
But this

830
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,880
needs

831
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,760
their teamwork to be continuously

832
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,900
reinforced in training,

833
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,640
and the physical requirements

834
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,900
should be higher.

835
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,920
Dafu.

836
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,020
What brings you here?

837
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,620
I missed your cooking.

838
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,860
I remember you love clams.

839
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,760
This is fresh stock. Try it.

840
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,620
Good, good.

841
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,060
How's business lately?

842
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,580
It's okay.

843
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,300
Not many people during the day,

844
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,620
but quite a few at night.

845
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,420
Sometimes there's even a line.

846
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,960
Duoduo said

847
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,320
we needed to hire someone else.

848
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,160
Come on.

849
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,740
Duoduo is worried about you.

850
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,520
Yes.

851
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,880
How is it?

852
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,720
The taste is great.

853
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,560
It's really fresh.

854
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,660
If you want to eat, just come over.

855
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,060
Okay.

856
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,240
Dafu,

857
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,120
I heard Duoduo

858
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,040
can't join

859
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,900
the national league.

860
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,620
These kids are too far behind.

861
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,140
They can't always aim too high.

862
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,000
They'll keep working.

863
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,180
Maybe next year.
