Stop here.

(Classroom 303)

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,420
Teacher, is there any other angle?

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,940
No, that's the only shot from this angle.

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,220
Gao Ge, Chen Weilan.

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,120
Do you know

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,200
this student?

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,120
No.

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,580
I can't tell.

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,300
But look at the way he moves.

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,380
He's trying to avoid surveillance.

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,800
I think it's probably him.

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,180
But that's just my guess.

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,080
Mr. Cheng.

33
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,140
Tell the security

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,040
to increase patrolling.

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,880
Yes, Secretary Zhou.

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,680
Secretary Zhou.

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,800
Why don't we ask Jingxuan?

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,740
Maybe she knows him.

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,520
Sure.

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,560
You two

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,700
should be careful too.

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,280
How was it?

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,220
Remember anything?

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,940
No.

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,640
It's okay.

46
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,680
It's normal.

47
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,260
You meet many people every day.

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Don't be afraid.

49
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,800
We've talked to the school about it.

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,100
We'll all help find this guy.

51
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,720
By the way,

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,060
lately, have you

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,540
encountered anything strange?

54
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,180
Anything strange?

55
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,780
When I went back
to the dorm room the other day,

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,580
I felt like I was being followed.

57
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,460
I'm not sure.

58
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,880
At the time, I felt a little scared.

59
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,460
So I ran back to the dorm.

60
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,320
When I was at the entrance,

61
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,260
I looked back.

62
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,580
But there was nothing.

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,100
Nothing?

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,260
Have you been arguing

65
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,740
with anyone lately?

66
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,920
Something like that?

67
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,980
I don't think so.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,840
Who is it?

69
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,780
Me, Jingxuan.

70
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,080
Come in.

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,600
Weilan.

72
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,760
Can I stay with you for a while?

73
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,660
Sit, sit, sit.

74
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,720
What's going on?

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,900
I'm a little scared.

76
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,460
There's a man downstairs.

77
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,700
He's been standing there for hours.

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,520
Who is he?

79
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,520
I don't know.

80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,940
But he definitely came for me.

81
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,060
Do you know him?

82
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,380
- Male or female?
- Male.

83
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,200
That one?

84
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,400
Do you know him?

85
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,720
No.

86
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,920
Oh, my.

87
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,860
I turned down a guy

88
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,860
who confessed to me in public.

89
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,980
The one who was waiting

90
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,140
near the dorm?

91
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,700
Could it be him?

92
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,220
Based on what everyone said,

93
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,530
Wang Wenjie

94
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,720
is honest.

95
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,060
And nothing's wrong

96
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,660
with his studies.

97
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,020
But he confessed

98
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,100
to Jingxuan days ago,

99
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,780
and Jingxuan turned him down.

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,300
We feel

101
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,260
he may have a motive to hurt Jingxuan.

102
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
Here's the deal.

103
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,360
I'll make a call first

104
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,420
to their counselor

105
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,600
to ask around.

106
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,200
Sure.

107
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,440
Hello?

108
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,820
I'm Secretary Zhou.

109
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,260
Tell me something

110
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,780
about Wang Wenjie.

111
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,040
Okay. Okay.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,020
I asked the counselor.

113
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,520
He said

114
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,220
Wang Wenjie's roommate

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,860
recently told him

116
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,560
that he's been going

117
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,340
to the off-campus game room.

118
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,220
The game room?

119
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
Why don't we split up?

120
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,120
- Let's go.
- OK.

121
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,480
Is he there?

122
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,740
He's not here.

123
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,920
He's right here.

124
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,860
All three of us think

125
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,460
a stalker can be a dangerous person.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,740
Even if there were more of you girls,

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,660
there's no way to ensure your safety.

128
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,040
So, after the discussion,

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,540
we decided to have a boy

130
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,980
and a girl in each group

131
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,540
to escort you every day

132
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,820
until we catch that creepy stalker.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
But is this

134
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,820
too troublesome for you?

135
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,800
Not at all.

136
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,740
You're our teammate.

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,020
It's our duty.

138
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,760
Well.

139
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,720
Xiaojing and I are seniors.

140
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,180
So there's not that much time.

141
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,160
Shao Nian and Gao

142
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,900
will cover this.

143
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,380
How do we group then?

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,640
I think

145
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,060
you're with Shao Nian.

146
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,240
And

147
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,580
Chen Weilan is with Gao.

148
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,900
I'll be with Xiaojing.

149
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
How was it?

150
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,060
I agree with this proposal.

151
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,340
But not

152
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,120
this grouping.

153
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,720
Well.

154
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,440
Shao Nian's not on the team.

155
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,460
I can find another guy.

156
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,030
Why is Shao Nian

157
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,940
not on the team?

158
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,630
He's our team's

159
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,160
special doctor.

160
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,990
Yeah, and if you're gonna talk like that,

161
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,880
Duoduo,

162
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,460
don't forget you're at Ocean University.

163
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,140
Aren't you still our captain?

164
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,100
Weilan, what do you think?

165
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,640
Okay.

166
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,040
Okay, then it's a deal.

167
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,880
Meeting adjourned.

168
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,640
Jingxuan.

169
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,720
Well, don't be too scared.

170
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,560
We're here.

171
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,920
Let's go.

172
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,960
Good for you two.

173
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,340
This isn't an escort.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,540
This is a date in disguise.

175
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,900
(Dafu BBQ)

176
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,520
Take care.

177
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,880
Duoduo.

178
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,820
Why are you here?

179
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,360
I heard about your school.

180
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,620
There's been a stalker lately.

181
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,560
He's following your teammate.

182
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,440
I was worried.

183
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,280
So I came to see you.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
I'm fine.

185
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,840
Did you come specially

186
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,680
for this?

187
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,020
It's okay.

188
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,540
Have you caught the guy yet?

189
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Not yet.

190
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,980
But the school's investigating.

191
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,120
My friends and I discussed

192
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,000
and decided to divide

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,660
into groups to protect Yang Jingxuan.

194
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,020
So who's in your group?

195
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,280
Shao Nian.

196
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,800
So, because of this,

197
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,720
I probably can't train

198
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,780
at Ocean University.

199
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,160
It's okay.

200
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,780
I'll just tell Coach Tian.

201
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,680
But

202
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,380
in case you get lazy,

203
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,920
I've decided that after you get out of school,

204
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,220
I'll supervise your training.

205
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,220
Well, that's too troublesome for you.

206
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,800
It's okay.

207
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,780
Then it's a deal.

208
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
I'll go home first.

209
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
- Okay.
- Be safe.

210
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,420
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

211
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,040
So much meat tonight.

212
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,860
Do you need some yogurt to take the edge off?

213
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,860
No, it's too cold.

214
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,940
What's wrong with you two?

215
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,120
It's okay.

216
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,660
How can it be okay?

217
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,820
Look at your mouth.

218
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,460
You're pouting up in the air.

219
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,740
What? Did he bully you?

220
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,640
He doesn't dare.

221
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,120
Right.

222
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,480
Duoduo.

223
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,180
You have to know

224
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,380
that the silent treatment is the most
emotionally damaging.

225
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,600
Shao Nian.

226
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,180
- Shao Nian.
- I...

227
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,560
Duoduo.

228
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,380
You asked her to come?

229
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,520
No.

230
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,120
She's here to supervise my training.

231
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,300
You agreed to it?

232
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,660
Shao Nian, have you had dinner?

233
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,760
Yes.

234
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,180
Duoduo, did you meet your
training standards today?

235
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,620
Don't worry. I did.

236
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,960
We're here. We'll go up first.

237
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,260
Shao Nin will escort you.

238
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,740
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

239
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,020
Well, let's go.

240
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,120
Duoduo.

241
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,100
Is that girl

242
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,140
a good friend of yours?

243
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,220
We were good friends before.

244
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,600
But now...

245
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,140
If Shao Nian is with her,

246
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,020
are you sure you won't mind?

247
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,820
But friendship is important, too.

248
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,720
In a relationship,

249
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,540
don't deceive yourself and others.

250
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,420
If you really like him,

251
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,940
you should be brave.

252
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,040
Go to bed. It's late.

253
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,880
Go to bed.

254
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,720
You go to bed early too.

255
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,560
Bye-bye.

It's not far from the school.

259
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,520
You can stay a little longer.

260
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,660
I've called you a cab.

261
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,760
Right at the door.

262
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,980
You be safe.

263
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,600
I just saw you guys

264
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,520
discussing something.

265
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,820
Did something happen?

266
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,600
You wouldn't know if I told you.

267
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,900
Go back early. Bye-bye.

269
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,800
What are you doing?

270
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,140
Nothing.

271
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,900
Then why are you sitting here?

272
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,600
Stop the nonsense.

273
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,140
Let me ask you something.

274
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,740
Chen Weilan again?

275
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,900
Are you done joking?

276
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,440
Well.

277
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,240
Is there a way to treat

278
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,740
dislocation of the wrist?

279
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,540
Isn't this still about Chen Weilan?

280
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,560
No, no.

281
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,160
Something's wrong with my wrist.

282
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,280
I'll take precautions.

283
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,640
Come on.

284
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,360
You care about her so much.

285
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,880
You have to act like you don't care.

286
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,980
Why bother?

287
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,000
No. What acting?

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,980
She has nothing to do with me.

289
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,280
Good luck.

290
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,380
- To the dorm.
- Bye-bye.

Bye-bye.

292
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,420
I'm going to get my books.

293
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,340
- Wanna go with me?
- Let's go.

294
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,380
Thank you.

If you aren't with me,

296
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,060
I won't be able to get my books here.

Can you two at least say something?

298
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Otherwise, I really think

299
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,340
I'm a prisoner being escorted.

300
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,700
What's there to say to him?

301
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,160
I can't stand it. It's so embarrassing.

302
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,000

Did you get threatened again?

- No. Come on.
- Should I call the police?

I asked everyone to be here

315

because I want to tell you something.

316
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,040
First of all,

317
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,820
thank you for escorting me

318
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,220

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,700

- That's it?

- It's okay.
- It's our duty.

322
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,930
let's leave it at that.

323
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,210
Starting today,

- No, Jingxuan.

- We have time.
- What's going on?

329
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,280
Yeah, we're really okay.

330
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,260

You two haven't done it yet.

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,380
Well, I think

341
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,880
lately,

342
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,780
nothing has happened.

343
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,800
Maybe that guy sees

344
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,280
I'm being escorted,

345
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,260
so he won't

appear again.

We're still worried

about you being alone.

you can tell us.

We can make adjustments, okay?

353
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

354
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,380
I think it's good to take it easy.

355
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,800
It's just as well that the man

356
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,920
would let down his guard.

357
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,800
Then we can lure him out of his hole.

358
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,640
Right?

359
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I think Shao Nian is right.

360
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,460
Lure him out.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,780
Have you quit Ocean University?

367
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
If you have,

368
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,860
I don't have an excuse to go there.

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,200
Right.

372
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,700
I don't need an excuse.

373
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,860
Okay, since you're all here today.

374
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,260
Let's just warm up.

Practice the new tactic.

- Okay. Luring out.
- Let's lure.

377
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,040
- Let's lure.
- Let's go.

378
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,220
Let's go. Let's lure.

379
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,140
- Go.
- Let's go.

380
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,640
- Get some luring.
- Go!

381
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,480
Let's train.

382
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,380
Why are you here?

383
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,280
Well.

384
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,640
Waiting for Jingxuan.

385
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,820
I'm waiting for her too.

386
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,280
She's not here yet?

387
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,820
Maybe she has things to do.

388
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,980
I'll send her a message.

389
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,720
Hello.

390
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,620
Are you Ms. Chen Weilan?

391
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,440
A gentleman chose a bouquet

392
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,480
for you at our store.

393
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,380
Please sign for it.

394
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,660
Thank you.

395
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,320
Please sign for it.

396
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,080
Good for you.

397
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,780
- Received roses at the library.
- Thanks.

398
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,720
This guy's silly.

399
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,840
Eleven flowers.

400
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,780
That's bad luck.

401
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,020
(Love you forever. Gao Ge)
He is silly.

402
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,960
No, I...

403
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,300
Would you stop being so childish?

404
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,820
Why don't you grow up?

405
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,340
Why am I being childish?

406
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,400
Then don't do this

407
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,700
disgusting thing.

408
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,980
Chen Weilan.

409
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,000
First of all, I don't know what I've done

410
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,260
to make you think I'm naive.

411
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,520
And secondly, I really don't get it.

412
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,960
Why are they arguing?

413
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,180
Such a prude.

414
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,040
Excuse me. I saw that shelf...

415
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,340
Jingxuan, are you okay?

416
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,440
Jingxuan.

417
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,450
- It's you.
- The shelf.

418
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,680
What are you talking about?

419
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,760
I finally got you.

420
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,240
No, that almost hit her.

421
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,080
So I gave her a hand.

422
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,800
Cut the crap and come with me.

423
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,640
- What crap? I've got a class.
- Come with me.

424
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,660
Come on, let's go.

425
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,860
What happened?

426
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,200
Why did he pass out?

427
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,240
What's going on?

428
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,080
What happened?

429
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,820
You've become my regulars.

430
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,660
Doctor, how's he doing?

431
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,780
After the examination, the patient

432
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,920
didn't faint due to external forces.

433
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,860
It's probably due to his hemophobia.

434
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,300
Hemophobia?

435
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,020
It's hemophobia.

436
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,300
Do you remember the threatening photos

437
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,420
have blood on them?

438
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,560
But this morning, when we were in class,

439
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,720
Wang Wenjie saw the blood

440
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,020
and fainted in the classroom.

441
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,520
So I think

442
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,940
he's not the stalker.

443
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,920
What's going on?

444
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,640
Professor, he's a little hemophobic.

445
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,480
Hemophobic?

446
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,040
Get him to the infirmary. Come on.

447
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,900
- Okay. Let's go.
- Hurry.

448
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,200
This way, this way.

449
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,160
Jingxuan.

450
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,760
Which one do you want?

451
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,180
Bread or rice?

452
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,160
- Bread.
- Bread?

453
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,000
Sure.

454
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,380
Okay, eat.

455
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,820
What's going on?

456
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,000
About the game before,

457
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,420
if you serve here,

458
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,600
make sure

459
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,520
our position

460
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,360
can't be...

461
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,260
Good news. Good news.

462
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,720
The school rewarded us

463
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,240
for coming second in the league.

464
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,460
We were given a fund.

465
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,180
Wow, that's great.

466
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,900
Great that...

467
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,460
That's all the money?

468
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,160
Let's split a hundred yuan each

469
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,320
to buy some ice cream.

470
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,740
What are you talking about, Liqiang?

471
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,800
Think about it.

472
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,920
What can we do with it?

473
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,880
We got the money

474
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,160
because of Xiaojing and Xixi.

475
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,380
Go ahead. What do you think?

476
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,600
During the league,

477
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,780
you all contributed.

478
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,840
Duo, you were our sparring partner.

479
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,940
You're the captain.

480
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,560
We'd rather listen to you.

481
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,860
Yeah, you decide.

482
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,640
If we a foodie like her

483
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,520
to decide,

484
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,720
she'll just take us out for a meal.

485
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,620
Chen Weilan!

486
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,380
I have a proposition for you.

487
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,320
Tomorrow's the weekend.

488
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,220
We could go to the aquarium together.

489
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,920
I hear it's super romantic.

490
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,260
It's perfect for a date.

491
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,800
You're indeed in love.

492
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,140
It's just different.

493
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,260
That's good.

494
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,020
What about you guys?

495
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,040
It's okay.

496
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,040
No problem.

497
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,440
I just finished the first draft of my thesis.

498
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,540
Yeah, I've got time.

499
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,560
I can't make it tomorrow.

500
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,740
You guys have fun.

501
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,560
Me too.

502
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,920
I'm just so tired.

503
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,500
I'll get my beauty sleep.

504
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,800
Captain.

505
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,600
Can you cash me in on my portion?

506
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,620
I'll buy an ice cream.

507
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,300
What about the boys?

508
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,880
If you all agree,

509
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,960
we're absolutely on board.

510
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,460
- No problem.
- Okay, let's go.

511
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,960
I'll book the tickets then.

512
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,800
I'll get the tickets.

513
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,500
Let's just check tomorrow.

514
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,580
I'm afraid to send it to the group.

515
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,140
Don't send it.

516
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,920
(Tu)
Let's get a bigger car.

517
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,780
Tomorrow, training at Ocean University.

518
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,840
Shao Nian.

519
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,640
Why don't we go first?

520
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,900
I don't think she's coming.

521
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,920
No, let's wait a little longer.

522
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,800
She used to love

523
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,840
aquariums.

524
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,680
She even went there

525
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,680
secretly with Tu.

526
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,660
Shao Nian.

527
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,620
I heard you talking about me.

528
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,020
What are you doing here?

529
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,600
Coach Tian heard Duoduo say

530
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,360
today you planned to go to the aquarium.

531
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,820
So she canceled the training.

532
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,540
I came with Duoduo.

533
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,840
Get in the car.

534
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,100

Look at this. Look.

Look, look, look.

- Look, look.
- Look at that one over there.

542
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,820
So lazy.

543
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,660
It went in. Did you see it?

544
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,760
Let's go over there.

- Bye. See you later.
- Bye.

549
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,380
Look at that.

550
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,180
Its belly turned over.

551

00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,760
♪Watch the tide rise tomorrow♪

569
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,010
So cute.

570
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,860
Look, look.

571
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,220
They jumped down from there.

572
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,040
From above.

573
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,160
We took a photo here before.

574
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,440
- Right?
- How time flies.

575
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,880
Right? It was here.

576
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,920
- I think so.
- Yes.

577
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,160
Let's take another one.

578
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,060
- Sure.
- OK.

579
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,160
Come on.

580
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,460
Let's take a picture here.

581
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,580
Can you take a photo for us?

582
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,360
Sure.

583
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,000
Wait a second.

584
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,180
Look, it's coming over.

585
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,640
Come.

586
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,990
- Let's include it.
- Here.

587
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,240
- Sure.
- Three.

588
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,000
- Wait, Duoduo.
- Two.

589
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,880
Last time, you were in the middle,

590
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,240
and we were beside you, right?

591
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,460
Yes, that's right.

592
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,560
Let's do it that way.

593
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,180
Three, two, one.

594
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,800
Smile.

595
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,180
Three, two, one.

596
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,200
- Smile.
- Wait.

597
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,220
This won't work.

598
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,480
Let me show you how.

599
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,360
- Do it well.
- Okay?

600
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,540
Make it look nice.

601
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,800
Trust me.

602
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,280
Look good, right?

603
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,100
Look here.

604
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,440
Look at me.

605
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,940
Three, two, one.

606
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,780
Great, perfect.

607
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,600
- Show me.
- Looks good.

608
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,160
- I'll use the photoshop.
- Looks good.

609
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,000
I'll send it to you.

610
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,880
Don't forget, okay?

611
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,320
I won't forget. Come here.

612
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,470
Look how cute that is.

613
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,830
It's coming.

614
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,040
Look.

615
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,220
What's the matter?

616
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,540
What's the matter?

617
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,440
Bro,

618
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,000
can't you really see?

619
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,220
Tu is doing it on purpose.

620
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,420
You need to have Liqiang teach you a lesson.

621
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,020
How could I not see it?

622
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,900
But Duoduo wants to believe her.

623
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,220
What can I do?

624
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,240
Here it comes.

625
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,700
So many tropical fish.

626
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,060
This is coral.

627
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,020
There are so many colors of coral.

628
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,820
- It's pretty.
- Duoduo,

629
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
didn't you say you'd create an opportunity

630
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,580
for me and Shao Nian to be alone?

631
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,020
I know.

632
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,480
I'll think about it.

633
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,520
I'll figure out how.

634
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,460
Just don't forget.

635
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,980
Isn't there a dolphin show soon?

636
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,160
Yes.

637
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,140
Go buy two tickets.

638
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,420
Take Duoduo with you and ditch her.

639
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,440
Can this work?

640
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,380
Why not?

641
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,520
It will work, bro.

642
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,460
Now, send Duoduo a WeChat message.

643
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,560
I bought tickets for the dolphin show

644
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,420
at 2:30 pm.

645
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,640
See you there.

646
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,760
Don't miss it.

647
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,080
Shao Nian.

648
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,900
Why is it you? Where's Duoduo?

649
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,540
I'm here to watch the show with you.

650
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,940
Ladies and gentlemen,
the show is about to begin.

651
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,580
Shao Nian, it's starting.

652
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,400
Okay.

653
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,360
It's coming out.

654
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,200
Look, look.

655
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,620
Shao Nian, where are you going?

656
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,540
So many tricks, huh?

657
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,160
Hurry and let Li Guoduo go back

658
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,340
to Xingang to play.

659
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,100
Stop manipulating her.

660
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,180
Genius is genius. You've seen through it.

661
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,040
You've admitted it?

662
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,520
Yes.

663
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,140
But so what?

664
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,920
Though Li Guoduo went to Ocean Uni

665
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,980
to learn new techniques for beach volleyball,

666
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,720
she'll still stay

667
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,760
if I ask her to.

668
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,400
Do you know she pushed Shao Nian away

669
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,120
because of you?

670
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,240
And because of you,

671
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,580
she's playing at Ocean Uni.

672
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,280
So what?

673
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,940
She's willing.

674
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,480
How can you speak

675
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,900
so self-righteously?

676
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,760
If she didn't care

677
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,320
about your friendship,

678
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,440
She wouldn't let herself be

679
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,100
so restrained and distressed.

680
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,980
I advise you to tone it down.

681
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,340
I won't make it easy for you.

682
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,780
What you say doesn't matter.

683
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,540
I know her better.

684
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,560
Bye-bye.

685
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:12,700
(Continue touring)

686
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,900
So cute, so cute.

687
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,800
Hello.

688
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,340
So cute.

689
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,260
So cute.

690
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,180
- Hurry up.
- Slow down, Jingxuan.

691
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,380
- So many penguins.
- So cute.

692
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,700
Here's another chubby one.

693
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,120
Look at that, clueless and silly.

694
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,960
Just like you.

695
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,040
Jingxuan, let me ask you something.

696
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,820
When is a person most like a penguin?

697
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
When?

698
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,080
When the phone rings with your pants

699
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,700
halfway down in the restroom.

700
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,660
The phone, the phone.

701
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,480
It's alike, right?

702
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,320
Duoduo.

703
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,320
Duoduo.

704
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,180
Where are they?

705
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,560
They might have gone ahead.

706
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,440
I thought it was cute,

707
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,940
so I stayed to watch more penguins.

708
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,400
They're so cute.

709
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,520
- Jingxuan, let me take a picture for you.
- Sure.

710
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,560
Then you guys stay here.

711
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,740
I'll go to other places.

712
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,580
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

713
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,660
Bye-bye. I'll take a picture for you.

714
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,160
Come on.

715
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,680
A bit more to that side.

716
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,860
Include the penguins.

717
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,500
(What am I thinking?)

718
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,660
(She's my good friend.)

719
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,620
(Isn't this exactly what I was going to do?)

720
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,660
(I understand now.)

721
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,920
(I must be)

722
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,340
(feeling alone because)

723
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,060
(they're all paired up.)

724
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,680
(Even my partner Chen Weilan)

725
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,180
(has Gao Ge by her side.)

726
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,540
(Where is my companion?)

727
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,320
I lost a companion.

728
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,700
Do you know where she is?

729
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,940
Oh, she's here.

730
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,860
Did your show end so quickly?

731
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,560
Yes, I was pulled into the performance.

732
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,770
Luckily, Weilan and

733
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,760
Gao Ge

734
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,000
saved me.

735
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,330
Now we can swim together

736
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,560
again.

737
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,020
You really are...

738
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,980
So childish.

739
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,900
So you were here.

740
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,290
Let me tell you. The dolphin show was amazing.

741
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,900
But you didn't see it.

742
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,960
I took photos. I'll send them to you.

743
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,800
Okay.

744
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,800
By the way, you didn't go to training today.

745
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,190
Our training has been postponed.

746
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,880
You're very important

747
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,060
to Coach Tian Qing now.

748
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,240
Really?

749
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,180
But I'm just an extra.

750
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,360
Why is that?

751
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,400
This is what makes Ocean Uni

752
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,730
different from Xingang.

753
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,900
This dolphin is so cute.

754
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,460
Let's each buy one.

755
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,780
Shao Nian, you should get one too.

756
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,140
I don't need one.

757
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,340
Then we each get one.

758
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,180
(What should I do?)

759
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,500
(Tomorrow's training camp.)

760
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,540
(Where should I go?)

761
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,700
(He's the person I like.)

762
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,460
(She's my friend.)

763
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,780
(What should I do?)

764
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,500
Come and see.

765
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,420
- Coach.
- Hello.

766
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,960
Yes.

767
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,120
Chen Weilan.

768
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,220
Li Guoduo was supposed to be back, right?

769
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,700
She just sent me a message

770
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,080
(Guoguo Duoduo)
"I caught a cold last night."

771
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,460
"I won't come today."

772
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,840
Is she sick?

773
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,060
Then I'll check on her.

774
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,300
Train well.

775
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,780
Coach, you're leaving?

776
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,750
- Bye-bye.
- Coach.

777
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,740
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

778
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,060
Duoduo is sick?

779
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,380
She was fine at the aquarium yesterday.

780
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,020
She must be faking it.

781
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,440
Why is the temperature

782
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,500
still normal after covering up for so long?

783
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,140
- Take care.
- Zhou, busy?

784
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,440
- Wang.
- Zhou, get another one.

785
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,320
Another one.

786
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,880
See? you always pick the best ones.

787
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,720
You always pay the least for the best.

788
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,640
50% off next time.

789
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,860
Okay, see you next time.

790
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,700
- Coach Lu.
- Coach Tian.

791
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,800
You're here for Guoduo too?

792
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,640
Yes.

793
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,060
Carrying such

794
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,080
a big basket of fruit is heavy, isn't it?

795
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,340
- Yes.
- Let me help you.

796
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,840
- Here.
- Thank you.

797
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,260
- Is it here?
- Yes.

798
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,500
Let's go in.

799
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,360
Dafu.

800
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,640
Lu.

801
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,200
- You're here.
- Yeah.

802
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,120
Come in. Sit down.

803
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,820
Hello, Coach Lu. Who's this?

804
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,340
This is Duoduo's father.

805
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,820
This is Coach Tian from Ocean Uni.

806
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,080
Hello, I'm Tian Qing.

807
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

808
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,100
Well.

809
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,300
Where's your wife?

810
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,500
Who knows where she went?

811
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,300
She went to sell health products.

812
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,380
You don't have to bring gifts.

813
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,960
It's nothing.

814
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Since Duoduo is sick,

815
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,300
she'll need some fruit.

816
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,640
Where is Duoduo?

817
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,340
She's been sleeping all day.

818
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,840
Shall I wake her up?

819
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,680
Don't wake her up.

820
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,040
Let her sleep if she needs to.

821
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,540
We just came to deliver the fruit.

822
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,260
We'll leave now. We have other matters.

823
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,680
- Sit for a while.
- No need. We're leaving.

824
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,740
Please take care of her.

825
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,040
Thank you.

826
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,240
Thank you.

827
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,400
Well.

828
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,340
I'll leave it here.

829
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,740
Take care.

830
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,240
Okay.

831
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,160
That's why

832
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,900
you helped me carry the basket.

833
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,460
A family shouldn't be so polite.

834
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,260
Who's family with you?

835
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,800
Duoduo,

836
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,680
do you know how we played

837
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,700
in Xingang 20 years ago?

838
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
There were

839
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,460
no professional training facilities.

840
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,620
We set up a net

841
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,680
by the sea

842
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,900
and practiced like that.

843
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,280
I know.

844
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
Xingang University's

845
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,140
conditions aren't great now either.

846
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,980
But it's a matter of attitude.

847
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,700
As a Xingang student,

848
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,440
how can you

849
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,320
not play here

850
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,640
because the conditions are poor?

851
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,480
Right?

852
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,300
Dad, you misunderstood me.

853
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,460
It's not because of that.

854
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,460
It's because...

855
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,380
Dad, you know.

856
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,760
Lingling used to be my best friend

857
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,100
and partner.

858
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,820
But now...

859
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,960
I don't know what problems

860
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,420
you two have.

861
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,340
But I still hope

862
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,140
you can be magnanimous.

863
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,020
If you can let go, that's best.

864
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,380
If you can't let go

865
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,940
and can't forgive,

866
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,180
that's okay too.

867
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,980
After all, it's your own feelings,

868
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,500
and no one can be you.

869
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,660
But I need

870
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,380
to tell you one thing.

871
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,460
Though you're rivals with Tu Lingling now,

872
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,100
it doesn't affect your relationship.

873
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,780
Rivals are not enemies.

874
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,180
Rivals can also become friends.

875
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,720
I really hope the three of us can

876
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,020
go back to the way we were.

877
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,840
Dad,

878
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,300
do you think Lingling and I

879
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,660
can be friends again?

880
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,000
Duoduo,

881
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,400
don't let these relationships

882
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,340
tie your hands and feet.

883
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,540
True friendships

884
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,160
will not be affected

885
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,340
by any conditions

886
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,700
or situations.

887
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,040
Understand?

888
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,200
Just like

889
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,600
Lu Xiaole

890
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,520
and Tian Qing.

891
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
I can see

892
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,220
their relationship is close,

893
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,980
but on the court,

894
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,260
they are also rivals.

895
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,520
Friends

896
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,220
can help us grow,

897
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,240
and so

898
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,020
can rivals.

899
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,160
So don't mind

900
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,620
which side of the net we're on,

901
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,060
