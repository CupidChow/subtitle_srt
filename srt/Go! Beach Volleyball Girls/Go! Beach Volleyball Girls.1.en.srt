18
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,660
Duoduo.

19
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,740
Our opponents today

20
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,580
are very impressive.

21
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,420
Especially Long Ya,

22
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,260
the most difficult one.

23
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,540
She is very powerful.

24
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,740
Her spikes are particularly fierce.

25
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,220
And she moves very agilely.

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,940
Be careful when you're blocking.

27
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,400
No problem, rest assured.

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,130
I'll just take the opportunity
to practice with them

29
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:09,970
to find the feeling.

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,660
It's perfect for us to get prepared for

31
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,500
Ocean University.

32
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,620
Great, great!

33
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,900
(Li Guoduo gestured for me
to attack Long Ya's partner side.)

34
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,940
(It's weaker.)

35
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,700
(Tu Lingling and I want to)

36
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,740
(win this game.)

37
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,460
(It's easy for us.)

38
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,300
Go for it!

39
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,100
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

40
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,740
Go for it!

41
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,660
Go for it!

42
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,940
Great!

43
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,100
Go for it!

44
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,260
Go for it!

45
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,260
Great job!

46
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,740
- Go for it!
- Come on, you can do it!

47
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,700
Great job!

48
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,060
Okay.

49
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,060
You are the best partner.

50
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,330
Definitely.

51
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,220
(Dafu BBQ)

52
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,400
You come early.

53
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,240
Dafu.

54
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,390
These are goods?

55
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,800
You went to buy goods?

56
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,460
Looks good.

57
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,320
They're fresh.

58
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,080
Dafu, you went to buy goods?

59
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,700
- Hello, Uncle.
- Hello, Lingling.

60
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,960
What is this thing?

61
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,540
Slow down.

62
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,520
You're back from the market?

63
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,900
Where did Duo go?

64
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,460
Let you sit here alone.

65
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,440
Come on, drink this.

66
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,340
Every time I come, you bring me good drinks.

67
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,860
Look, your little hair clip looks so nice.

68
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,800
Teach me later.

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,380
God, you are always walking fast

70
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,140
like Nezha riding on a wind-fire wheel.

71
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,740
Don't fall down. You have an exam tomorrow.

72
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,680
I won't.

73
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,600
Look at how restless you are.

74
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,800
Can you do well in the exam?

75
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,820
You should learn from Lingling.

76
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,950
You should learn from me.

77
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,060
- Dad.
- Not...

78
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,560
Am I your daughter?

79
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,380
Our girl must pass the exam, right?

80
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,700
Of course, I will pass the exam.

81
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,740
The uniform is all prepared.

82
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,340
My mom has corrected for you. You can try on.

83
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,900
If it doesn't fit you,
my mom will correct it again.

84
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,360
I trust Auntie's skills.

85
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,340
I've narrowed the waist

86
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,580
for you.

87
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,720
It looks so good!

88
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,500
Why didn't narrow my waist?

89
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,340
You don't need to change.

90
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,900
Give it a try.

91
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,740
Now I'm confirmed

92
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,900
I am not your daughter after all.

93
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,740
I'm leaving.

94
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,740
Take your drink.

95
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,700
Slow down.

96
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,060
No. Don't touch it.

97
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,260
This is for Lingling.

98
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,360
Get another one for yourself.

99
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,580
What's going on?

100
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,060
I am feeling very unhappy right now.

101
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,220
What's wrong with you?

102
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,580
You've been drinking a lot from fridge.

103
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,200
You've drunk so much.

104
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,560
How does it look? Is it nice?

105
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,460
- Looks good.
- So beautiful.

106
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,900
- It fits well and is very comfortable.
- Okay.

107
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,920
Good luck for tomorrow.

108
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,820
Your time.

109
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,760
Really perfect.

110
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,340
(Xingang University)

111
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
(Moments)

112
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,740
Okay.

113
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,580
You need to write down

114
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,700
your experimental results today.

115
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,270
Remember to hand them in tomorrow.

116
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,380
To be honest, Lingling,

117
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,880
we cooperated so well today.

118
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,540
Tomorrow we will perform like this.

119
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,600
We will definitely pass the exam.

120
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,920
Definitely.

121
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,640
And then we will dominate the competition.

122
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,680
Let's have dinner tonight.

123
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,740
Shao Nian hasn't arrived yet.

124
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,660
Send him a message.

125
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,080
Let me ask him.

126
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,460
How can we two girls wait for him like this?

127
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,840
I'll ask what's going on.

128
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,220
(Are you coming or not?)

129
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,300
(Right away.)

130
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,860
(Shao Nian, I'm waiting for you.)

131
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,020
I'll drink.

132
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,340
Auntie gave it to me.

133
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,580
I want to drink.

134
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,480
Go get it yourself. Give it back.

135
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,220
- Come on.
- I dislike you.

136
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,060
Here you are.

137
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,460
Stingy.

138
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,300
Hate you.

139
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,940
Shao Nian.

140
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,460
Wait a moment.

141
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,220
Professor Qin.

142
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,200
Well.

143
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,920
I know you're careless usually,

144
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,140
but now,

145
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,940
you don't do your homework properly, right?

146
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,680
You just copied directly from the Internet.

147
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,060
Are you shamed?

148
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,760
Sir, I drew this.

149
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,360
You drew this?

150
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,480
You think I don't use the Internet?

151
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,800
These pictures are obviously from the Internet.

152
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,940
You see?

153
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,120
Can you draw it?

154
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,880
I can draw one for you.

155
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,140
Go ahead.

156
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,740
Just draw this one.

157
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,920
I don't believe it.

158
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,240
Okay. Okay!

159
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,200
I knew you drew it yourself.

160
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,140
I was giving you a chance

161
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,120
to perform yourself well.

162
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,560
Students, what do you think

163
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,140
of Shao Nian's paintings?

164
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,600
- Good.
- We should learn from him.

165
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,020
Well done.

166
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,220
I'm very satisfied.

167
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,520
However, I have to remind you

168
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,320
your attendance rate is too low.

169
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,140
You should put your mind on studying.

170
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,980
Do you understand?

171
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,520
Don't worry, sir.

172
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,980
I will definitely

173
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,040
be one of the top three in class.

174
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,900
Goodbye, see you.

175
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,740
You...

176
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,160
He just left?

177
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,700
(Dafu BBQ)

178
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,100
Lingling, let's have some first.

179
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,380
Let's not wait for him. Let's eat first.

180
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,340
What time is it now?

181
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,680
Why hasn't he come yet?

182
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,060
Yeah, he just said

183
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,020
he's already on his way.

184
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,100
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

185
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,160
Duo, do you think my bangs look good?

186
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,920
Is there any mess?

187
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,440
I didn't notice until you mentioned it.

188
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,100
Why did you suddenly get bangs?

189
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,440
Won't it bother you when playing ball?

190
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,880
Just tell me if it looks good or not.

191
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,540
Let me see the bangs.

192
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,960
Don't mess it up for me.

193
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,840
I just did it.

194
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,400
Tu Lingling.

195
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,020
You're starting to

196
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,920
care about your appearance.

197
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,680
There must be something.

198
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,820
Tell me.

199
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,380
- Duo.
- Hurry.

200
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,740
What does Lingling want to eat?
You make it for her.

201
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,580
Okay, Mom.

202
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,220
Lower your voice,

203
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,620
or Uncle and Auntie may hear us.

204
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,920
Then you tell me quietly.

205
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,640
You also know him.

206
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,700
Who is it?

207
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,800
Shao Nian.

208
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,080
Him?

209
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,080
This guy is quite lucky in love.

210
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,320
I'm thinking

211
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,320
when I pass the entrance exam

212
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,180
for Ocean University,

213
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,600
I'll confess to him right away.

214
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,120
If you like him so much,

215
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,320
why don't you go to his college?

216
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,420
Beach volleyball at Xingang University

217
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,680
is unprofessional.

218
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,280
I want to be with my little fairy

219
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,320
and go to the most professional school.

220
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,660
You're loyal enough.

221
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,820
Sure.

222
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,720
Go ahead.

223
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,300
Is there anything I can do for you?

224
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,000
Like giving you a helping hand or something?

225
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,600
There is indeed one thing.

226
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,440
Tonight

227
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,520
don't bother giving me a ride.

228
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,900
I want to...

229
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,760
You want to be with him alone.

230
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,560
Tu Lingling.

231
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,020
But no matter what you do,

232
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,240
just don't affect our exam tomorrow, okay?

233
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,720
Rest assured.

234
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,900
How dare you.

235
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,980
You keep such a big thing from me.

236
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,360
- My bangs.
- Tu Lingling.

237
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,380
My bangs.

238
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,680
Duoduo, I'm here.

239
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,060
You finally came.

240
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,900
We've waited for long.

241
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,920
We're starving.

242
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,040
Why is it just you? Where's Lingling?

243
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,120
She's inside. She'll be out soon.

244
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,600
- Can I drink this?
- Sure.

245
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,640
It has been open.

246
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,280
Lingling drank it. It's fine.

247
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,620
Okay.

248
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,540
Duoduo.

249
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,900
I came today mainly to talk to you...

250
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,100
Shao Nian, you're here.

251
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,660
I just asked Duoduo a moment ago.

252
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,700
Where did you go?

253
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,080
I went to the bathroom.

254
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,100
What's wrong with your hair?

255
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,040
Like nothing happened.

256
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,720
Shut up.

257
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,580
Duoduo.

258
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,860
Do you remember you told me

259
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,940
you really want to watch

260
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,000
National Middle School

261
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,060
Volleyball Tournament?

262
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,180
It's about to start. Let's go watch it.

263
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,300
And there's the man you really like.

264
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,540
Chen Weilan is also there.

265
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,380
You don't understand beach volleyball at all.

266
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,990
Why are you so interested in
volleyball matches?

267
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,240
Okay.

268
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,420
We can just relax and have fun.

269
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,940
Let's go together with Lingling.

270
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,520
- Sure, let's do it.
- Okay, let's go together.

271
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,460
Zhang, can you

272
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,600
bring me three cups?

273
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,100
Sure.

274
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,960
- Thank you, Zhang.
- Thank you.

275
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,260
Hurry up and eat.

276
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,100
They're all cold now.

277
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,940
It's all because of you.

278
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,780
Hurry up and eat, Lingling.

279
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,040
We've waited for you for a long time.

280
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,970
Thank you.

281
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,810
- I'll pour it.
- Thank you.

282
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,300
Here.

283
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,140
- Thank you, Shao Nian.
- You're welcome.

284
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,640
Tomorrow is a big day.

285
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,580
After tomorrow, Lingling and I

286
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,180
will be a student at the Ocean University.

287
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,020
So here,

288
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,380
I wish Lingling and I good luck
on the exam tomorrow.

289
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,840
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

290
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,680
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

291
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,720
Shao Nian.

292
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,040
Thank you.

293
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,380
It's nothing.

294
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,560
By the way, good luck on the exam tomorrow.

295
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,100
I will.

296
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,700
Shao Nian.

297
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,520
If tomorrow

298
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,920
I get into Ocean University...

299
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,760
If you get into Ocean University tomorrow,

300
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,880
I will treat you to a good meal.

301
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,980
How about it?

302
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,640
- Deal.
- Deal.

303
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,920
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

304
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,400
The kid is smart.

305
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,120
Here she comes.

306
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,540
Ocean University, here I come!

307
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,820
Duo, drink it up.

308
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,580
Fighting, Duoduo!

309
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,540
When you get in,

310
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,740
put on my swimsuit

311
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,260
to advertise for me.

312
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,200
Yes. Advertising for Uncle Liu.

313
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,380
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

314
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,220
Wish you good luck!

315
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,400
Wait for my good news.

316
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,460
- Go for it!
- Goodbye.

317
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,260
- Duoduo is really promising.
- She'll definitely pass.

318
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,680
Look at what you're saying.

319
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,080
She is fine.

320
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,800
She needs test.

321
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
(Ocean University
Sports Special Enrollment Examination)

322
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,920
- Name?
- Miao Miao.

323
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,260
Which major?

324
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,110
Beach volleyball.

325
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,380
Okay.

326
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,130
- The two of you are partners, go ahead.
- Thank you.

327
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,580
- Take them to waiting area.
- Hurry.

328
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,300
Dear students,

329
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,520
prepare your admission tickets.

330
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
After finishing signing in,

331
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,860
I will call out your names.

332
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,880
Come to the entrance to find me.

333
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,020
Lingling.

334
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,420
Sorry, I mistook someone for you.

335
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,320
I'm sorry.

336
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,660
The exam number is 0585.

337
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,520
Here you are.

338
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,980
I was so embarrassed just now.

339
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,480
I mistook her for you.

340
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,300
I thought our outfit

341
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,620
is customized.

342
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,920
How come it's still matching with others?

343
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,740
How about changing it to the sky blue color
that I like next time?

344
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,580
What do you think?

345
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,520
My partner today is Long Ya.

346
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,780
Okay.

347
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,860
Are you afraid that I'll get nervous
and underperform in the exam?

348
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,240
Are you deliberately joking with me?

349
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,300
Okay. I've laughed enough.

350
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,960
Let's warm up and stop messing around.

351
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,060
Li Guoduo.

352
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,580
She is my partner now.

353
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,720
Not kidding.

354
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,820
Stop messing around.

355
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,420
The exam is coming soon.

356
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,500
They're calling our names. You hear?

357
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,460
Tu Lingling.

358
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,620
Long Ya.

359
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,760
I'm going to take the exam.

360
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,920
Tu Lingling.

361
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,620
What's going on?

362
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,840
Is what I heard just now true?

363
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,520
You are not taking the exam with me?

364
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,400
I have to get in Ocean University today.

365
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,820
So I have to switch into

366
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,660
a stronger partner.

367
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,060
Sorry.

368
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,260
Tu Lingling.

369
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,180
- No...
- You can't go in.

370
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,500
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

371
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,780
It's been two years, but you didn't mention.

372
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,900
- Why?
- Stop making noise.

373
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,790
- Why you...
- Stop making noise.

374
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,060
What do you want me to do, Tu Lingling?

375
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,200
- Tu Lingling!
- Student.

376
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,260
Tu Lingling!

377
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,140
This is the exam room.

378
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,120
Don't make a scene.

379
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,380
Qiang,

380
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,920
is this okay with me?

381
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,740
Are you really going to confess?

382
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,800
Aren't you wait for more time?

383
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,340
I can't wait.

384
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,680
I have liked Duoduo for so long.

385
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,480
She is about to go to college now.

386
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,010
I can't wait

387
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,870
to confess my love to her.

388
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,760
Haven't you heard a saying?

389
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,770
Freshman girls

390
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,100
are unripe cherries.

391
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,590
Look good but not tasty.

392
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,180
Sophomore girls

393
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,200
are apples. Good-looking and delicious.

394
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,340
Junior girls are pomegranates.

395
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,350
Not good-looking but delicious.

396
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,940
Senior girls

397
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,120
are...

398
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,380
tomatoes.

399
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,560
It's not a fruit.

400
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,360
What about who're about to be a freshman?

401
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,940
That's a rotten plum.

402
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,280
It looks bad and tastes bad.

403
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,200
You are objectifying women, Qiang.

404
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,920
I'm just joking.

405
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,300
Bro.

406
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,520
Listen to my advice.

407
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,020
With the three of you being so close,

408
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,040
as long as you confess,
you won't be friends anymore.

409
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,480
What's wrong with confessing
to someone you like?

410
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,380
Well.

411
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,480
Why don't you listen to me?

412
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,900
Sir, I beg you.

413
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,360
Can you let me take the exam just once?

414
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,940
I've really worked hard for this exam.

415
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,360
I have been preparing for a year.

416
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,040
Can you please make an exception for me?

417
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,900
This kind of emergency situation

418
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,780
can get compromise, right?

419
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,060
Can you let me take the exam?

420
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,720
I really love playing beach volleyball.

421
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,780
No, it's already written in the regulations

422
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,760
clearly.

423
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,020
If you have no partner,

424
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,200
you cannot take the exam.

425
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,600
- You're back?
- I'm back.

426
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,860
Okay. Okay!

427
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,220
This one?

428
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,040
- Come and have some fruits.
- Today is really a good day.

429
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,100
She's coming.

430
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,400
- Duoduo is back.
- Come on.

431
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,920
Congratulations!

432
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,200
You're impressive.

433
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,820
Come on.

434
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,080
Duoduo is really amazing.

435
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,500
Exactly.

436
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,700
Come on, take a break.

437
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,740
If you really become

438
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,940
a national athlete in the future,

439
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,660
when you go on TV to receive the award,

440
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,740
make sure to give me a heart.

441
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,780
Say something useful.

442
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,020
Practice your signature first.

443
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,440
Sign some names for me.

444
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,740
When you are famous,

445
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,900
they'll be worthy.

446
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,020
At my house,

447
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,340
there're some drawings you did
when you were young.

448
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,800
They will worth a lot of money.

449
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,420
Come and have some candy.

450
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,520
Say something useful.

451
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,140
Look at my girl.

452
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,300
Can she play beach volleyball?

453
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,480
Do we need to start practicing now?

454
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,700
- What are you doing?
- Look at her.

455
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,860
Your girl is so young.

456
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,040
Not even in elementary school yet.

457
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,740
Okay. Okay! Stop talking.

458
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,580
I'm telling you.

459
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,660
Duoduo is so good.

460
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,400
Duoduo will handle all.

461
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,780
What's the situation, Mom?

462
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,800
What are you doing here?

463
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,440
Look at this kid.

464
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,160
We are here to celebrate for you!

465
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,300
Come and peel a banana.

466
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,140
Peel a banana.

467
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,040
Come on.

468
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,580
Eat a banana first to take a break.

469
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,340
Later, tell these uncles and grandpas

470
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,380
about

471
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,300
Ocean University.

472
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,720
What exactly does it look like?

473
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,520
- Yes, yes!
- Yes, yes.

474
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,860
I

475
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,880
never went to college.

476
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,980
Remember to

477
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,180
bring me

478
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,100
to Ocean University

479
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,940
to take a video.

480
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,280
No problem.

481
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,540
What Ocean University?

482
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,500
Don't mention it.

483
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,660
Why can't we mention it?

484
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,300
I'm telling you, you're the coolest girl

485
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,380
on our street now.

486
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,500
The first one get into
a prestigious university.

487
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,580
Yes, that's right.

488
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,540
- You're great!
- Exactly.

489
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,540
I'm talking about my son.

490
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,740
It's your brother.

491
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,220
Although he got into college,

492
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,420
but it's just a third-tier university.

493
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,740
If I had known earlier, I would have let him

494
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,460
go play beach volleyball with Dafu.

495
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,640
Dafu, is that right?

496
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,580
How do you know

497
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,760
I get into Ocean University?

498
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,140
You mom said that.

499
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,000
That's right.

500
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,460
Mom.

501
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,940
How do you know

502
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,980
I get into Ocean University?

503
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,260
You are my girl.

504
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,660
How could I not know that you are the best.

505
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,620
Right, Dafu?

506
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,540
Come on. Please have a seat.

507
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,660
It's just about getting into

508
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,920
Ocean University.

509
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,580
Look at you.

510
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,300
Mom, I didn't pass the exam.

511
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,820
I told you earlier.

512
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,380
Speak louder
when talking to uncles and elders.

513
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,600
Be polite.

514
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,340
I...

515
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,780
I didn't take the exam at all.

516
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,100
She said she didn't do well in the exam.

517
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,020
It's okay if you didn't do well.

518
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,780
As long as you get into the school.

519
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,300
The main thing is to get in.

520
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,140
Mom.

521
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,160
I didn't get in!

522
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,080
Really? Is it true or not?

523
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,700
- Exactly.
- Really?

524
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,020
What's going on, Duoduo?

525
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,280
I'll ask her.

526
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,460
You guys go ahead and start eating first.

527
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,600
You guys go ahead and start eating.

528
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,400
Did you not see Coach Yan at Ocean University?

529
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,080
He said he guarantees you will pass.

530
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,620
What Coach Yan?

531
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,940
There is no Coach Yan at Ocean University.

532
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,920
Only Coach Tian.

533
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,340
Coach Tian?

534
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,180
Yes.

535
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,560
The kid is so smart.

536
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,700
Mom!

537
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,640
What's wrong with you, Mom?

538
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,940
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Slow down

539
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,480
- Slow down, slow down!
- What's wrong?

540
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,180
Duo.

541
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,620
Coach Yan told me,

542
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,620
if we gave him 100,000 yuan,

543
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,040
you would pass the exam.

544
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,520
Why didn't you pass?

545
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,220
Why didn't you pass?

546
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,060
What 100,000 yuan?

547
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,060
What is the guarantee fee?

548
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,060
You gave him 100,000 yuan?

549
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,780
How did you not pass?

550
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,620
Wang Xiuyun.

551
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,380
You can just take the money.

552
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,740
Can't you discuss with me first?

553
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,680
Please, stop talking.

554
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,280
What should I say about you, Mom?

555
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,420
Do you know that you've been deceived?

556
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,340
Go find him.

557
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,820
Don't stand there foolishly.

558
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,340
Find that Coach Yan.

559
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,300
- Get the back.
- Yes.

560
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,140
Don't say anything for now.

561
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,100
Listen to me.

562
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,580
Hurry up and call the police immediately.

563
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,420
Call the police!

564
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,040
Call the police.

565
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,100
Where's my phone?

566
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,000
Bring me the phone.

567
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,420
Bring me the phone.

568
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,660
Mom, don't worry.

569
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,620
Hurry up and call the police.

570
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,800
Hurry up.

571
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,060
(Celebrating! All BBQ today is 20% off.)

572
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,180
(Strict. Regulated. Fair. Civilized.)
You are just blaming me.

573
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,540
Look at this girl's petite figure.

574
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,060
- What if she doesn't get into college?
- It's close.

575
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,340
If I don't pay this 100,000 yuan,

576
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,420
what if our girl

577
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,740
can't go to college?

578
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,040
How would I know he's a scammer?

579
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,220
Is your brain malfunctioning?

580
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,340
Use your toes to think about it.

581
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,600
You shouldn't have fallen for this scam.

582
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,820
Can she do that?

583
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,940
You want her to get in the college.

584
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,900
But now she didn't get in

585
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,780
and you got scammed.

586
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,180
You think about it

587
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,220
from my perspective.

588
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,260
If you weren't a volleyball player back then,

589
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,540
could she cry for playing volleyballs

590
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,180
when she was born?

591
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,220
Even she cried and shouted.

592
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,940
You should let her go play with her skills.

593
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,020
What are you doing with money?

594
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,940
I must support her

595
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,140
whatever my daughter wants to do.

596
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,260
Better than you being indifferent.

597
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,560
- Support like this?
- What's wrong with me?

598
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,700
Stop making noise.

599
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,920
Are you going to report the case?

600
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,800
Yes, we are.

601
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,120
- By the way.
- Hurry.

602
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,040
Sir,

603
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,380
this is Coach Yan,

604
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,960
who claimed to be from Ocean University.

605
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,140
He told my mom

606
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,580
to give him a guarantee fee of 100,000 yuan

607
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,100
to guarantee my admission to Ocean University.

608
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,100
We have already filed

609
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,480
the materials you provided.

610
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,620
We will do our best to track the money.

611
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,180
But it will take some time.

612
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,900
How long do we have to wait?

613
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,000
It's hard to say.

614
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,060
As soon as there is news,

615
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,560
I will notify you immediately.

616
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,240
Okay, thank you.

617
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,720
Well.

618
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,480
About our daughter going to college,

619
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
I can't afford to lose money and the chance.

620
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,400
You need to come up with a solution.

621
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,700
Mom.

622
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,960
The police said that person is a fraudster.

623
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,460
Even if he is not a scammer,
your behavior is bribery.

624
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,780
Do you know it's wrong?

625
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,980
- Well...
- See?

626
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,220
Your daughter is very smart.

627
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,120
Your behavior is also illegal.

628
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,770
I...

629
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,500
I just want my kid to go to college.

630
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,060
How did I break the law?

631
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,160
Are you a legal illiterate?

632
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,660
Do you have to

633
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,740
be sentenced to ten years?

634
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,820
How is this not breaking the law?

635
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,700
It's bribery.

636
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,660
Arrest me if you can.

637
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,500
She is not good for this.

638
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,180
Do you have to make her get in?

639
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,460
I am doing this for our girl.

640
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,540
You guys keep arguing here. I'm leaving first.

641
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,580
- It is illegal.
- What are doing?

642
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,720
Can you stop making noise here?

643
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,520
Duo!

644
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,840
Thank you so much.

645
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,980
Okay.

646
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,240
Didn't catch it, right?

647
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,660
Tu.

648
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,360
We won all these trophies and medals together

649
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,760
in the previous competitions.

650
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,560
Do you remember this?

651
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,800
This was the first time we went to a game.

652
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,040
You were the MVP that time.

653
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,700
I was even happier than you.

654
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,680
I pulled you off the rocks by the sea.

655
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,980
Do you still remember?

656
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,820
Li Guoduo.

657
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,960
What do you want to say?

658
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,080
I want to know why you abandoned me.

659
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,740
During the exam that day,

660
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,000
I have made it very clear.

661
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,380
You are very clear about

662
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,680
your own shortcomings.

663
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,880
We can't be partners for life.

664
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,480
After entering college,

665
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,160
we still need to change partners.

666
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,700
Okay.

667
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,540
Li Guoduo, are you crazy?

668
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,400
What are you doing?

669
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,920
Do you remember this?

670
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,960
You got injured during the game.

671
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,980
Then the game was paused halfway.

672
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,200
Injury handled,
you were back to play.

673
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,160
Although we participated in the game,

674
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,000
you only ended up in third place.

675
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,040
That night you cried all night long.

676
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,000
I comforted you all night long.

677
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,280
You still remember, right?

678
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,400
Will you and Long Ya end up like us?

679
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,600
Of course not.

680
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,960
Because Long Ya is much stronger than you.

681
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,560
Li Guoduo, are you crazy?

682
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,520
Do you remember this?

683
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,420
It was the first time for us

684
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,560
to go out to join in a competition.

685
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,160
It was the first time for us
to take a train trip together.

686
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,160
At that time, I only booked a sleeper ticket.

687
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,580
We squeezed in a small bed together

688
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,680
for a long time.

689
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,160
This game,

690
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,960
we only ended up in second place.

691
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,440
But you told me it didn't matter.

692
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,980
Because in the future, we will

693
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,720
fight side by side and win more first places.

694
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,940
Li Guoduo.

695
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,260
Since you mentioned this,

696
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,320
let me tell you the whole story.

697
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,240
At that time, you didn't listen to me

698
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,840
to book tickets earlier, so that

699
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,220
only one sleeper ticket was left.

700
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,740
So we didn't get enough rest,

701
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,180
and only got a second place.

702
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,160
So you've been blaming me all along, right?

703
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,720
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

704
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,400
'Cause you've always been wishful thinking,

705
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,920
and conceited.

706
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,980
Have you considered my feelings?

707
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,320
I don't consider your feelings?

708
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,840
Don't forget.

709
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,300
We are not only partners,

710
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,260
but also classmates.

711
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,100
We are high school mates.

712
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,620
We're best friends.

713
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,980
We've been close

714
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,000
since we met in our second year.

715
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,880
I don't think about your feelings?

716
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,540
This outfit.

717
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,880
Do you still remember it?

718
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,900
You liked it very much at that time,

719
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,820
but you never bought it,

720
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,920
because it was too expensive.

721
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,180
We two saved up three months of pocket money

722
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,160
to buy it finally.

723
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,280
But it turned out to be too big.

724
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,800
I asked my mom to correct it.

725
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,280
Why?

726
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,260
Because I want

727
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,340
we can wear this outfit together

728
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,520
to get in Ocean University.

729
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,680
Li Guoduo.

730
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,680
You are too arrogant.

731
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,100
Do you think buying me an outfit

732
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,320
is considering me?

733
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,140
You never thought about

734
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,600
what I really care about.

735
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,500
You are just selfish

736
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,680
and self-serving!

737
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,600
Do you like smashing things?

738
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,240
As you wish!

739
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,040
Do you care about these?

740
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,260
Do you care about this outfit?

741
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,400
Give it back to you!

742
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,800
Stop messing around. It's annoying.

743
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,000
What's bothering you?

744
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,140
I went to Ocean University

745
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,420
to find you and Tu Lingling,

746
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,480
but found that you both had left.

747
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,660
What's wrong?

748
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,860
Are you angry with me?

749
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,280
I've bought you a drink.

750
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,940
What are you doing here?

751
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,160
Shouldn't you look for Tu Lingling?

752
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,160
Why should I go find Tu Lingling?

753
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,680
Did you guys quarrel?

754
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,960
Tu Lingling changed partners for the exam.

755
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,070
Don't pretend you don't know.

756
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,000
Are you saying

757
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,300
that just before the exam,

758
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,520
Tu Lingling changed her partner.

759
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,820
And your mom

760
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,960
got scammed.

761
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,720
Yes, that's right.

762
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,280
Why am I so unlucky recently?

763
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,100
I think you should put aside

764
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,000
Tu Lingling's issue.

765
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,840
Do you know what's your emergency?

766
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,640
What?

767
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,960
Track the money back?

768
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,400
It's what the police should do.

769
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,800
What's the most important for you now

770
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,040
is going to college.

771
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,120
985. 211.

772
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,920
Design school.

773
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,960
It has nothing to do with you.

774
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,160
Look at this.

775
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,880
Normal university.

776
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,200
(Huadao Normal University)
How about being a teacher?

777
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,540
Time is not enough.

778
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,380
The registration deadline is 6 p.m.

779
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,220
There's not enough time.

780
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,000
You're right.

781
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,440
There is still time for this one.

782
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,560
(New Town University of Technology)
This one?

783
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,660
What about this one?

784
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,740
It seems to require two people

785
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,020
participate in the exam as a group.

786
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,940
It's late now.

787
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,880
How can I find someone with me?

788
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,020
You're right.

789
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,300
This one.

790
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,400
Qingbei Medical University.

791
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,340
What about this one?

792
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,920
It's good to be in a medical school.

793
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,900
Medical school

794
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,100
seems to take priority to cultural courses.

795
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,460
I am a student with a sports specialty.

796
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,480
I have no advantages at all.

797
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,740
Student with specialty.

798
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,800
I just saw a brief introduction
of such students.

799
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,660
It's a music academy.

800
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,940
Why don't you go there?

801
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,560
You can sing and attract customers.
How about that?

802
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,320
Xingang University.

803
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,520
An old school with beach volleyballs.

804
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,960
And I'm here too.

805
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,180
(Xingang University)

806
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,460
But the beach volleyball program at this school

807
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,880
has been declining for many years, right?

808
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,500
When Ocean University

809
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,100
selects its member in a competitive format,

810
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,220
Xingang University

811
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,160
is still the most basic physical fitness.

812
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,800
- Figure out a way!
- What should we do then?

813
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,060
They are all here.

814
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,240
I'm talking to you.

815
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,640
No way.

816
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,900
Stop nagging.

817
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,740
What's wrong?

818
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,820
Oh my! Dad!

819
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,660
Duoduo, don't move.

820
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,260
Don't touch it.

821
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,960
Don't move, Duo.

822
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,980
You broke a good wine bottle.

823
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,360
I can sell it for a few cents.

824
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,240
What's the use of a few cents?

825
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,800
So much money has all gone.

826
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,660
Dad, please stop drinking.

827
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,700
At such an old age,

828
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,440
you're still throwing a childish tantrum.

829
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,480
Dad, drink less.

830
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,440
You drink so much.

831
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,800
I'm not good now.

832
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,500
My money is also gone.

833
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,480
I am getting old.

834
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,640
Uncle Li, don't say that.

835
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,920
You look young.

836
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,520
Shao Nian.

837
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,860
Twenty years ago,

838
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,880
when I played beach volleyball in Xingang,

839
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,520
it can be said

840
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,660
that there was no one in the country

841
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,000
who can defended against my spike.

842
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,860
Dad.

843
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,440
You played beach volleyball in Xingang before?

844
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,420
I really didn't expect it, Uncle Li.

845
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,900
You are actually my

846
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,740
schoolmate.

847
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,880
Duoduo, you are really not thoughtful enough.

848
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,180
You should tell me earlier
that your dad is my school mate.

849
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,500
Our relationship can be closer.

850
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,260
I didn't know. I just found out.

851
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,360
- What's going on?
- I don't believe it.

852
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,400
Don't blame Duo.
Your uncle doesn't want to mention it.

853
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,620
He has locked up all those things

854
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,720
from playing beach volleyball.

855
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,700
If I hadn't met him when I was young,

856
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,640
look at him now,

857
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,980
does he look like an athlete?

858
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,080
Okay, stop it.

859
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,680
Give me a bottle of beer.

860
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,340
Shao Nian, the Xingang's exam

861
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,360
hasn't ended yet, has it?

862
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,780
I also want to apply for Xingang.

863
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,340
I want to carry on my father's legacy

864
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,220
to pass it down,

865
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,960
and to revitalize beach volleyball to the end.

866
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,720
I was much stronger than you are now.

867
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,120
In the national league 20 years ago,

868
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,240
I, was the champion.

869
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,440
Sometimes I just wonder,

870
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,800
did I bring back the wrong person?

871
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,260
Why doesn't my talent

872
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,260
get passed on to you?

873
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,100
Alright, alright.

874
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,180
You go check out Xingang quickly.

875
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,500
Has the registration not ended yet?

876
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,350
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

877
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,360
I will go online to register now.

878
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,700
You just wait to see.

879
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,150
I will show you a champion too.

880
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,360
Let me show you if I'm your daughter.

881
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,820
Hurry up.

882
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,940
Shao Nian, aren't you from Xingang?

883
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,220
You go and take a good look at her quickly.

884
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,600
Okay, I'll go now.

885
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,980
Be careful.

886
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,880
Rest assured.

887
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,560
Okay, okay. Stop drinking.

888
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,170
How is it?

889
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,130
Has the game ended?

890
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,540
You just worry about others.

891
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,380
How did the exam go?

892
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,220
For me,

893
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,260
it's too easy.

894
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,940
The game is in the evening.
Let's have dinner first.

895
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,780
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

896
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,010
Hey.

897
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,300
What's wrong?

898
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,380
That night

899
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,480
what did Tu Lingling say to you?

900
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,920
She didn't say anything to me.

901
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,750
What's your relationship now?

902
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,320
What relationship can we have?

903
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,600
She has abandoned me.

904
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,360
You are also my good buddy.

905
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,880
Don't leave me behind again.

906
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,750
How could I ever leave you behind?

907
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,620
That's about right.

908
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,160
Let's go, buddy.

909
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,570
Look at you.

910
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,450
What are you talking about?

911
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,000
I said let's go for pizza.

912
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,940
Let's go eat pizza.

913
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,340
Let's go eat pizza.

914

Dear audience,

915
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,220
(Volleyball Tournament)
welcome to

916
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,300
the final competition of

918
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,100
Next, let's

919
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,340
give warm applause to the players

920
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,660
from Beijing No. 8 High School

921
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,000
and Tianjin No. 1 Middle School
entering the court.

922
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,340
The team in yellow

923
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,880
is Team of Tianjin No. 1 Middle School.

924
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,100
Their captain Lang Yueting

925
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,540
is well-rounded and flexible.

926
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,050
- Go for it!
- She is a core player

927
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:33,980
of Tianjin No. 1 Middle School.

928
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,980
Fighting.

929
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,220
Let's give another round of applause

930
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,760
to Team of Tianjin No. 1 Middle School.

931
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,020
Go for it!

932
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,700
Okay, now we can see

933
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,050
the players in white are

934
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,060
from Beijing No. 8 Middle School.

935
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,900
Come here!

936
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,300
Today is the final of

937
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,860
National Middle School Volleyball Tournament.

938
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,960
We must bring out our best state to defeat

939
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,300
Tianjin No. 1 Middle School

940
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,220
and win the championship.

941
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,000
- Do you have confidence?
- Yes!

942
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,440
Today is the final of the competition.

943
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,600
It is a crucial match.

944
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,320
Lang Yueting, as the core player,

945
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,260
must take the lead.

946
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,960
The coach of the national youth league
came here.

947
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,000
So if any of you

948
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,440
want to be a professional volleyball player
in the future,

949
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,140
today is the best opportunity.

950
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,980
Do you understand?

951
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,820
Yes!

952
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,660
Come on.

953
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,980
One, two, three.

954
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,000
Go for it!

955
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,500
Fighting!

956
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,780
- Dear friends.
- Stand by.

957
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,480
Let us look forward to the result

958
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,500
about Tianjin No. 1 Middle School

959
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,480
and Beijing No. 8 Middle School,

960
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,100
which team will win

961
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,140
the final victory.

962
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,240
Let's wait and see together.

963
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,060
(Beijing No. 8 Middle School vs.
Tianjin No. 1 Middle School)

964
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,020
(Chen Weilan, the genius girl)
Come on, Chen Weilan!

965
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,700
(Volleyball team)
Go for it, Chen Weilan!

966
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,740
Chen Weilan!

967
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,200
You are the best, keep it up!

968
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,540
(Chen Weilan, go for it!)

969
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,620
(Beijing No. 8 Middle School vs.
Tianjin No. 1 Middle School)

970
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,330
It's fine. Do it again.

971
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,920
Chen Weilan is good.

972
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,800
But she has been playing solo.

973
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,800
She has no communication with teammates.

974
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,410
That's right.

975
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,440
Catch it.

976
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,200
Can't you catch the ball?

977
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,460
You have to get up.

978
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,860
Please stop making mistakes in passing.

979
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,180
We have basically figured it out.

980
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,500
Make sure to keep an eye on Chen Weilan.

981
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,420
- Okay!
- Okay!

982
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,260
Grasp the reception.

983
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,540
Come on!

984
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,160
- Go for it!
- Come on!

985
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,700
(National Middle School Volleyball Tournament)

986
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,990
(Beijing No. 8 Middle School vs.
Tianjin No. 1 Middle School)

987
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,790
Go for it!

988
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,700
Tianjin No. 1 Middle School made a good start.

989
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,340
They won the first round of the match.

990
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,480
Now the referee signals for a change of court.

991
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,300
(Beijing No. 8 Middle School vs.
Tianjin No. 1 Middle School)

992
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,340
Both sides are keeping the score very close
in the first round.

993
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,540
Will Beijing No. 8 Middle School

994
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,900
change their strategy?

995
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,350
(Chen Weilan, go for it!)
Here's the second round.

996
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,860
Did you miss that ball?

997
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,420
How come you didn't catch that ball?

998
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,380
What were you doing just now?

999
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,780
Why did you have to hit her hand?

1000
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,080
Can't you pass it to me?

1001
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,020
Focus and be concentrated.

1002
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,760
- Hurry up, come on!
- Okay, okay!

1003
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,100
Beautiful block!

1004
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,760
Tianjin No. 1 Middle School's teamwork
is very tacit,

1005
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,300
Chen Weilan
from Beijing No. 8 Middle School

1006
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,610
doesn't have the space to perform herself.

1007
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,900
If Chen Weilan

1008
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,260
- cannot play a role,
- Indeed, she's not bad.

1009
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,380
it will be difficult for
Beijing No. 8 Middle School to win the game.

1010
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:01,980
Go for it!

1011
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,020
Go for it!

1012
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,210
- Go for it!
- Come here.

1013
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,160
(Chen Weilan, go for it!)
Fighting, fighting!

1014
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,720
(Lang Yueting, go for it!)
Come on!

1015
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,220
Go for it!

1016
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,820
Okay.

1017
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,990
The coach of Beijing No. 8 Middle School
signals for a substitution.

1018
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,660
Unexpectedly, the one coming off

1019
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,040
is player No. 7, Chen Weilan.

1020
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,280
- Me?
- Get down.

1021
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,340
Why?

1022
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,800
What are you looking at? Just come down.

1023
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,380
- Go for it!
- Come on, you can do it!

1024
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,500
Chen Weilan has been substituted.

1025
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,740
Her performance today is not so good.

1026
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,550
(Beijing No. 8 Middle School vs.
Tianjin No. 1 Middle School)

1027
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,060
She also made

1028
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,460
frequent mistakes when coordinating.

1029
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,340
After she left the field,

1030
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,980
will Beijing No. 8 Middle School
perform better?

1031
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,160
Let's wait and see.

1032
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,340
Go, go!

1033
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,200
Follow up!

1034
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:23,980
Coach.

1035
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,680
Coach, let me go in.

1036
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,240
I'm almost ready.

1037
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,740
Okay.

1038
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,320
Go, go!

1039
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,460
Not only did they catch up
after changing the main players,

1040
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,040
they also won this match.

1041
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,580
Chen Weilan's spikes are indeed very powerful.

1042
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,780
But the pass was not accurate.

1043
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,780
She just hit it out.

1044
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,660
So she can't play well.

1045
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,500
Yes.

1046
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,420
But you see.

1047
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,860
After Chen Weilan was substituted,

1048
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,620
though they
didn't have many highlights,

1049
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,260
their offense has improved,

1050
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,800
and scored several points in a row.

1051
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:13,940
Yes.

1052
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,820
After Beijing No. 8 Middle School

1053
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,540
won the second round,

1054
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,260
Chen Weilan goes to the field.

1055
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,360
The game entered the third round.

1056
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,740
- Defend well!
- Who will ultimately

1057
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,360
- Pay attention to their setting.
- be the champion of

1058
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,840
National Middle School Volleyball Tournament?

1059
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,700
(Beijing No. 8 Middle School vs.
Tianjin No. 1 Middle School)

1060
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,780
Go for it!

1061
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,520
Beijing No. 8 Middle School
ultimately won the game.

1062
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,600
The champion of
National Middle School Volleyball Tournament

1063
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,920
is Beijing No. 8 Middle School!
