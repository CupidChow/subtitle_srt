=Episode 8=

18
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,800
Uncle Li, what are you looking at?

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,300
(A Friendly Match between Sports University
and University of São Paulo Coming Soon)

20
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,440
Those two beat Duoduo and Chen Weilan.

21
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,120
I've seen some

22
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,860
of your beach volleyball team,

23
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,320
But none left an impression.

24
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,880
This event is a good chance to see them again.

25
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,280
Uncle Li,

26
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,980
are you allowing

27
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,070
Duoduo to play beach volleyball?

28
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,760
Don't talk nonsense.

29
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,880
I just want to see

30
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,240
what kind of team she's in

31
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,360
and what they're up to.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,200
Auntie, let me help you.

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,820
I'll take this inside to wash.

34
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,800
Yes, yes.

35
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,380
Look at her.

36
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,700
Everyone,

37
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,920
remember these details.

38
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,060
During practice,

39
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,040
keep working hard.

40
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,100
Captain,

41
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,220
we've been training so hard lately.

42
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,100
Isn't it time

43
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,780
for some team-building?

44
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,680
I agree.

45
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,480
How about we go

46
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,860
hiking?

47
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,680
Hiking is too tiring.

48
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,160
How about swimming by the beach?

49
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,660
Swimming is tiring too.

50
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,180
I think we should

51
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,160
find a place

52
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,420
to completely relax.

53
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,320
Where do you want to go?

54
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,080
I'm flexible. It's up to you guys.

55
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,260
I have a suggestion.

56
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,540
How about

57
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,980
a BBQ outdoors?

58
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,360
We can both play and eat.

59
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,260
- I agree.
- Sounds good.

60
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,020
- Duoduo agrees if there's food.
- Sure.

61
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,260
You can't play beach volleyball well

62
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,320
if you're not well-fed.

63
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,420
But we have to prepare lots of supplies.

64
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,800
Will we have time to do that?

65
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,880
Uncle Li.

66
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,140
- Uncle Li.
- Uncle Li is here.

67
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,460
- Uncle Li, have a seat.
- Sit down, Uncle Li.

68
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,990
- Don't be so polite.
- We're discussing it.

69
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,360
Actually, I discussed it with Uncle Li.

70
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,700
He'll cover

71
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,820
all the BBQ supplies.

72
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,880
We just need to enjoy.

73
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,420
You'll get the lowest price.

74
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,880
- Great, great.
- Good.

75
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,800
So, if the event is set,

76
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,040
where will it be?

77
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,020
Forest Park.

78
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,200
Forest Park doesn't allow fires.

79
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,500
Gao, any suggestions?

80
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,400
What do you think?

81
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,560
How about

82
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,420
we go somewhere farther?

83
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,560
Let's go to Qingtai City.

84
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,660
- Yes, yes!
- Yes!

85
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,000
We can go to Qingtai City.

86
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,100
But going so far

87
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,420
will increase the cost.

88
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,360
It's okay.

89
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,520
I'll go where you go.

90
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,040
Dad, you're being so agreeable this time.

91
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,010
But with so many people

92
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,890
and such a far place,

93
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,220
plus the supplies,

94
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,660
we'll need a chartered bus.

95
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,500
Yes.

96
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,920
No problem.

97
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,360
I'll cover everything.

98
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,760
Awesome, Uncle Li.

99
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,740
Xia,

100
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,960
who's this for?

101
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,540
It's for Jing.

102
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,500
Jing?

103
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,660
Why doesn't she have time to eat?

104
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,660
Well, with the club activity coming up,

105
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,200
she's squeezing time to write her paper.

106
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,320
Right, right.

107
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,600
Is something up?

108
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,200
Actually...

109
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,920
Nothing.

110
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,300
I'll give you five seconds.

111
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,720
- If you don't say, I'm leaving.
- Wait, wait.

112
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,980
There is something.

113
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,720
I want to ask

114
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,760
how Jing ended up with you.

115
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,220
Of course.

116
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,260
What? Do you like her?

117
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,400
Not what I meant.

118
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,320
When you were pursuing her,

119
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,720
did you use any special methods?

120
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,200
Not really.

121
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,060
I just

122
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,800
gave her some small gifts.

123
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,360
Mostly relied on my personal charm.

124
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,120
Gifts?

125
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,720
Where did you get the money?

126
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,120
You didn't save on instant noodles, did you?

127
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,180
You don't get it.

128
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,060
Let me tell you.

129
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,740
Gifting to girls

130
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,040
isn't about the price.

131
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,920
You need to hit the right spot.

132
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,260
What spot?

133
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,240
Let me put it this way.

134
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,660
The gift should be

135
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,240
something she can use.

136
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,020
And she should use it often.

137
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,980
If she uses it often,

138
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,040
she'll think of you.

139
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,820
Aren't you fishing here?

140
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,740
Thanks, bro.

141
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,580
Wait.

142
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,780
Is this because of Chen Weilan?

143
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,200
Don't talk nonsense. Go to deliver your food.

144
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,840
It'll get cold.

145
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,680
Let's order this.

146
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,780
Also, get some chicken feet.

147
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,060
I guess you'd like them.

148
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,780
Xia likes these chicken feet.

149
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,800
And order their signature noodles.

150
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,060
Not enough? Let's get more.

151
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,440
- Choose what you want.
- Wait, Gao.

152
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,920
Tell me before ordering.

153
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,220
What's the matter?

154
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,320
You're my buddy. We're eating.

155
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,540
There shouldn't be so many questions.

156
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,540
Don't I know you?

157
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,530
Just tell me.

158
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,560
Stop dragging it out.

159
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,040
What's going on?

160
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,560
Is something up with you lately?

161
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,000
No way. Nothing's up.

162
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,700
I saw this thing.

163
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,160
Gao, you looked under my pillow?

164
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,340
I didn't look.

165
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,600
Xia did.

166
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,300
He stayed up gaming

167
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,920
and fell asleep on your bed.

168
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,600
He found it under the pillow.

169
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,800
It was for Duoduo, right?

170
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,740
When will you give it to her?

171
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,100
That was before.

172
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,100
I planned to confess

173
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,080
after her competition

174
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,060
but then realized

175
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,600
she doesn't really like these things.

176
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,580
She's not interested at all.

177
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,600
Good thing I didn't give it.

178
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,940
Li Guoduo is all

179
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,400
about beach volleyball.

180
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,520
Doesn't like it?

181
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,460
Bro.

182
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,300
Well.

183
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,560
Do you know what gifts

184
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,120
beach volleyball

185
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,500
or volleyball girls

186
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,480
like?

187
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,240
Volleyball girls?

188
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,120
Who likes volleyball?

189
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,920
Stop asking questions.

190
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,860
Share some tips with me.

191
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,100
I don't have much

192
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,240
to share.

193
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,940
Duoduo is different

194
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,100
from ordinary girls.

195
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,440
She doesn't like those things.

196
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,020
I usually give her

197
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,700
some snacks.

198
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,540
Snacks?

199
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,700
Yes. And drinks.

200
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,100
Let me tell you, Gao.

201
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,580
That day at the BBQ place,

202
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,860
we had yogurt

203
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,880
with ice cream.

204
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,060
It was amazing.

205
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,640
So delicious.

206
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,580
You two

207
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,000
have similar tastes.

208
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,580
For a relationship

209
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,860
to be harmonious,

210
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,440
I think matching tastes is important.

211
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,680
When will you confess to her?

212
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,460
How about you

213
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,980
and Lang Yueting?

214
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,640
Waiter, order, please.

215
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,340
Hurry up.

216
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,420
- Hello.
- Finished?

217
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,300
We're done.

218
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,980
- Yes, that's all.
- Hello, sir.

219
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,100
- Please wait.
- Thanks.

220
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,940
Thanks.

221
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,660
(Beach Volleyball Activity Room)

222
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,400
Gao, what are you doing?

223
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,820
More ads.

224
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,040
Are there any useful ones?

225
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,800
Gao, haven't picked your gift yet?

226
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,660
You and Xia

227
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,540
haven't given me a useful suggestion.

228
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,640
I have to think on my own.

229
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,260
Gao,

230
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,060
we did give you suggestions,

231
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,660
but you vetoed them all.

232
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,660
How about flowers?

233
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,760
Girls definitely like them.

234
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,620
Too cliché.

235
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,440
Then how about a plush toy?

236
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,300
Too childish.

237
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,880
Maybe lipstick?

238
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,380
Lipstick

239
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,520
seems a bit ordinary.

240
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,580
Gao, what do you actually want to give?

241
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,100
None of these work.

242
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,360
Then just give yourself.

243
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,480
Would you

244
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,240
give these things to Duoduo?

245
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,860
I'm her gift.

246
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,200
Come on.

247
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,300
- What are you two doing?
- Weilan.

248
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,320
Gao, aren't you practicing?

249
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,920
Busy.

250
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,840
Gao, ask Chen Weilan.

251
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,460
She plays beach volleyball

252
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,780
and is a girl,

253
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,760
so she should know.

254
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,340
What's up?

255
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,900
Forget it.

256
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,760
I'll find out myself.

257
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,180
Gao wants to treat you to a meal.

258
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,380
He's too shy to say it. Ask her.

259
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,180
- I'll leave first, bye-bye.
- Wait, Shao Nian.

260
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,020
Come on.

261
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,320
What's going on?

262
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,800
I'll treat you to a meal later.

263
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,520
Why?

264
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,920
I need a favor.

265
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,080
Let me finish my practice first.

266
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,320
Spicy Mao Xue Wang.

267
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,280
Sliced beef in chili oil.

268
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,120
Water-cooked beef.

269
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,360
Hot and sour noodles.

270
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,120
Add extra spice and chili, thanks.

271
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,260
Okay.

272
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,480
Please wait.

273
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,680
Not bad.

274
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,240
Did you ask Shao Nian?

275
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,920
What you ordered suits my taste.

276
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,520
That's interesting.

277
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,420
It's your treat.

278
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,440
Of course, I had to order my favorites.

279
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,880
Why should I ask others what you like?

280
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,640
Yes, yes. My treat.

281
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,260
Is it enough? If not, we can order more.

282
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,100
It's enough.

283
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,840
I have a question for you.

284
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,640
What kind

285
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,340
of gifts

286
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,520
do beach volleyball girls like?

287
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,480
Or,

288
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,940
have you received

289
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,080
any particular gifts?

290
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,520
For me,

291
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,880
I like whatever I'm given.

292
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,300
As for other volleyball girls,

293
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,360
I don't know.

294
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,820
I'm not sending gifts to you.

295
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,060
I'm taking you here

296
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,680
for advice.

297
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,720
Here's the sliced beef in chili oil.

298
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,040
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

299
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,320
Enjoy your meal.

300
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,480
What to give?

301
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,080
Okay.

302
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,540
For a girl.

303
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,800
Especially one who plays beach volleyball.

304
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,880
Just give something practical.

305
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,240
Practical?

306
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,380
Hats.

307
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,320
Sunglasses.

308
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,320
- Sunglasses.
- Headbands.

309
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,240
- Headbands.
- Sunscreen.

310
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,700
Sunscreen.

311
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,640
Wristbands.

312
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,800
Wristbands.

313
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,920
That's it?

314
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,240
That's almost it.

315
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,240
Wristbands.

316
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,850
Who are you giving them to?

317
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,220
Yang Jingxuan

318
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,760
or Li Guoduo?

319
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,700
Why ask so much?

320
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,800
Consider this meal your consulting fee.

321
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,540
Just enjoy your food.

322
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,380
Thanks.

323
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,000
You're welcome.

324
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,640
Gao, are you human?

325
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,820
You're treating her to Sichuan cuisine,

326
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,540
and me to ramen.

327
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,820
She can order water-cooked beef,

328
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,660
while you complained

329
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,940
about my extra beef.

330
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,360
I said you could order whatever you wanted.

331
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,780
Was that said sincerely?

332
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,680
You're neglecting friends for a girl.

333
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,920
Wait a minute.

334
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,540
That meal with her

335
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,920
it's about benefits.

336
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,380
I got valuable info.

337
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,560
What info?

338
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,940
I know what to give Lang Yueting now.

339
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,900
Really?

340
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,740
Then tell me too.

341
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,750
I want to give Duoduo one as well.

342
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,300
Don't.

343
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,540
People are different.

344
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,560
Li Guoduo might not like it.

345
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,100
What does that mean?

346
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,300
Gao, I've figured you out.

347
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,140
You're the type

348
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,850
to use people and toss them aside.

349
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,060
Look, look.

350
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,170
Now, Li Guoduo is more important
than me, right?

351
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,060
- Look at you. So upset.
- Don't drag Duoduo

352
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,100
into this.

353
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Don't show me.

354
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,340
I don't want to see it.

355
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,180
I'll find out myself.

356
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,540
I don't need you to tell me.

357
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,580
Don't, don't.

358
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,740
Go away. I don't want to see it.

359
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,640
Let me show you.

360
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,280
This is it.

361
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,020
Sports wristbands?

362
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,900
Yes.

363
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,600
These are compact and practical.

364
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,840
True.

365
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,960
The stuff is there.

366
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,260
Let me help you.

367
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,100
Almost done.

368
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,220
I'll put it here.

369
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,100
Spread the sauce evenly.

370
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,940
Annoying.

371
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,820
Sorry, sorry.

372
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,840
Feel free to take what you need.

373
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,540
Xixi,

374
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,600
ask two male classmates to help.

375
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,400
Why is he here?

376
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,160
Please go and move the stuff.

377
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,540
Let's go.

378
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,720
- Gao, I'm not coming.
- Okay.

379
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,320
Why is he here?

380
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,100
Please move them all.

381
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,160
Thank you.

382
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,680
Why are you here?

383
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,740
Isn't there a BBQ today?

384
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,780
I went to the seafood market

385
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,260
to get some fresh seafood for you.

386
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,580
You came all this way.

387
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,640
Thank you for the effort.

388
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,120
Young man,

389
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,960
didn't this seafood cost a lot?

390
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,260
Uncle, it's nothing.

391
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,780
Yes, you shouldn't pay for it alone.

392
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,160
Let's split the cost.

393
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,660
No need to be polite.

394
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,180
This small amount is nothing.

395
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,220
- No need to split.
- Right.

396
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,880
With this little stuff, it's not expensive.

397
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,180
There's more in the car.

398
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,500
Could you help me bring it over?

399
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,160
Start grilling. We have plenty.

400
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,760
Start grilling.

401
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,340
Let's grill.

402
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,640
- Come on.
- Start grilling.

403
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,240
Be careful with your hands.

404
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,500
Let me tell you.

405
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,820
The seafood must be eaten while it's hot.

406
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,020
If you want more later, tell Xixi.

407
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,260
I'll get it for you anytime.

408
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,100
Thank you.

409
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,080
Grill a bit longer.

410
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,160
Xixi,

411
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,660
your boyfriend is great.

412
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,920
This is so delicious.

413
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,240
Don't talk nonsense.

414
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,580
Who's with him?

415
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,860
Who's not with him?

416
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,340
Aren't you eating enough?

417
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,540
You like this kind of guy?

418
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,580
This table is all yours.

419
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
Who said that?

420
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,200
I just like seafood BBQ.

421
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,120
What do you like?

422
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,280
Never thought about it,

423
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,060
but

424
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,200
he must have dreams

425
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,280
and is brave in pursuing them.

426
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,620
By the way,

427
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,980
there's a beach volleyball match

428
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,550
at 4 pm this afternoon
at the Sports University.

429
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,340
Who wants to go?

430
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,580
Who is playing against whom?

431
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,620
The University of São Paulo team

432
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,460
against the Sports University team.

433
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,380
- Let's go.
- Go.

434
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,940
Well-matched. Must go.

435
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,800
Everyone should go. No one can stay.

436
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,580
Sure.

437
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,200
Those two were really good.

438
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,020
(University of São Paulo VS Sports University,
Beach Volleyball Friendly Match)

439
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,680
Reporters say

440
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,660
Lang Yueting is perfect.

441
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,300
Her strength and blocking are perfect.

442
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,440
Everything is perfect.

443
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,700
I remember she was a key player
in middle school.

444
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,600
Don't know why she switched
to beach volleyball.

445
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
But last time, we lost to São Paulo's.

446
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,180
This time, seeing they beat São Paulo's

447
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,000
gives me a sense of revenge.

448
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,920
However, in the second set,

449
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,620
São Paulo's started focusing their attacks

450
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,820
on Lang Yueting's partner.

451
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,140
Yang Liyun, right?

452
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,260
They lost several points in a row.

453
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,520
I thought they were going to lose.

454
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,280
In beach volleyball, the partner is crucial.

455
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,300
If one is weaker,

456
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,760
the opponents will exploit that.

457
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,560
Yang Liyun was your teammate before.

458
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,800
You know her playing style best.

459
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,680
How do you think she performed this time?

460
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,760
She's improved a bit

461
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,960
compared to high school.

462
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,620
They've made progress,

463
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,100
and so will we.

464
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,340
Though we lost last time,

465
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,860
we'll definitely win back next time.

466
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,010
Lang Yueting and Yang Liyun

467
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,100
will be defeated by us.

468
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,060
It's your first competition,

469
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,480
so you'll definitely get better.

470
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,350
Don't rush it.

471
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,970
We should stay humble

472
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,060
in victory and determined in defeat.

473
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,540
This competition

474
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,660
indeed

475
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,720
has many things for you to learn.

476
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,680
Go back and train hard.

477
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,020
When the national competition comes,

478
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,240
that's when real results will show.

479
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,340
Yes, exactly.

480
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,220
Let's go.

481
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,900
I'll go get my phone.

482
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,760
I think I left it in the stands.

483
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,500
Do you need me to go with you?

484
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,860
No, no. You go back first.

485
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,260
- We'll go first. Bye-bye.
- Hurry up.

486
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,100
Go back. Go back.

487
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,530
Actually, it's fine.

488
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,300
We both just played at a normal level.

489
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,800
Okay, thanks.

490
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,160
Let's go.

491
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,480
Lang Yueting.

492
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,240
You are?

493
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,700
I'm Gao Ge.

494
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,740
Do you remember me?

495
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm waiting for you outside.

496
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,480
Okay.

497
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,800
I remember now.

498
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,000
What's up?

499
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,920
You played really well just now.

500
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,700
Thank you.

501
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,860
If there's nothing else,

502
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,740
I'll leave first.

503
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,740
I have some things to do.

504
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,720
Wait, wait.

505
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,380
I thought you might

506
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,220
need this for your training.

507
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,360
I want to give it to you.

508
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,560
Don't get me wrong.

509
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,100
I also play beach volleyball,

510
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,680
and I think this is quite useful.

511
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,540
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

512
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,500
I won't disturb you then.

513
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,340
I'm leaving.

514
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,860
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

515
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,420
Bored.

516
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,620
You just throw

517
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,740
other people's feelings in the trash like this?

518
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,420
I've received so many of these things.

519
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,760
My home can't fit them all.

520
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,020
I heard

521
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,600
you switched to beach volleyball.

522
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,000
Is it to avoid me on the court?

523
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,760
What a coincidence.

524
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,680
We've become rivals again.

525
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,340
You saw the match

526
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,640
with São Paulo's, right?

527
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,180
I heard

528
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,820
last time you played against them,

529
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,720
you lost.

530
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,920
So, you lost to me again.

531
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,600
Look forward to seeing you on the court.

532
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,260
- Did you see Lang Yueting's block?
- I saw it.

533
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,660
- That block was amazing.
- So impressive.

534
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,660
Her spike

535
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,540
made the opponents freeze.

536
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,460
I even recorded a video.

537
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,080
Really? Let me see.

538
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,300
Let me see.

539
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,340
I want to see it too.

540
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,180
Can you all see it?

541
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,600
This ball, this ball.

542
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,700
I remember this.

543
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,780
I was so excited at that time.

544
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,660
This ball was so amazing.

545
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,580
So amazing.

546
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,980
The opponents were stunned.

547
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,100
And that block.

548
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,260
Did you see that block?

549
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,740
- They didn't react at all.
- Give me the earphones.

550
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,940
The opponents were shocked.

551
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,580
- It's true.
- The opponents

552
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,540
must be thinking,

553
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,700
"Who am I? Where am I?"

554
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,740
"What am I doing?"

555
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,180
Really, that block was

556
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,300
- so amazing.
- When can we

557
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,900
play like that?

558
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,500
Come on.

559
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,540
To be honest,

560
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,020
seeing them lose so badly,

561
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,620
I actually feel a bit sorry for them.

562
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,020
There's really nothing to feel sorry about.

563
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,980
Lang Yueting played

564
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,080
so impressively.

565
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,540
- That's right.
- Indeed.

566
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,700
When we go back, I'll practice more,

567
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,340
so I can make the opponents crumble.

568
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,500
Go for it. You can do it.

569
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,700
You're the best, Wen Xin.

570
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,720
Kiss. Kiss.

571
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,660
- Li Guoduo.
- It's true.

572
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,480
In my opinion,

573
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,580
you'll never

574
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,320
be like Lang Yueting.

575
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,660
No, Duoduo.

576
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,280
Uncle must be joking with you.

577
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,400
I'm not joking.

578
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,260
Even if Li Guoduo
practices for another ten years,

579
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,400
she still won't be like Lang Yueting.

580
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,500
You might as well give up on this idea.

581
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,380
Uncle is too harsh.

582
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,700
- Duoduo.
- Actually, Duoduo is quite good.

583
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,840
Stop the car.

584
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,180
Stop the car.

585
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,820
- Uncle.
- Stop the car.

586
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,720
Duoduo is angry.

587
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,200
- Duoduo, Duoduo.
- Li Guoduo.

588
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,800
Don't worry, Uncle. I'll go find her.

589
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,540
Duoduo.

590
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,180
Duoduo.

591
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,360
Don't be angry.

592
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,220
He usually criticizes me at home,

593
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,500
but today he did it in front of so many people.

594
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,720
How could he do this to me?

595
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,400
I don't think Uncle meant it that way.

596
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,220
Then what did he mean?

597
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,380
Didn't you hear

598
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,320
what he said in the car?

599
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,860
I heard it.

600
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,740
- But Uncle...
- Stop it.

601
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't want to talk about him.

602
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,680
Where's my phone?

603
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,520
Did I leave it in the car?

604
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,680
Wait a moment.

605
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,200
Uncle Li,

606
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,820
Duoduo loves beach volleyball.

607
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,420
- I think what you said to her...
- Hello?

608
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,400
Rushing out without your phone.

609
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,200
So what?

610
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,540
The more you love playing,

611
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,700
the more you need to understand

612
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,960
your own situation.

613
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,940
One can't rely solely on enthusiasm.

614
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,420
Listen to what your father is saying.

615
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,120
You need to find your own place.

616
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,300
Listen.

617
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,740
(Shao Nian)
Uncle, what you said is correct,

618
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,740
but how does it relate

619
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,960
to what just happened?

620
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,820
Did you all notice

621
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,360
Lang Yueting's physique?

622
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,580
She's tall and powerful,

623
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,740
which is why she can

624
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,440
make those stunning game-winning shots.

625
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,640
Li Guoduo and Lang Yueting

626
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,660
are completely

627
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,240
different types of athletes.

628
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,290
Li Guoduo's strengths are

629
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,060
her agility

630
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,200
and quick reflexes,

631
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,180
which are perfect for short, fast balls

632
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,760
that opponents can't defend against.

633
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,280
That's how she scores on the court.

634
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,460
How about that?

635
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,980
Still saying your dad doesn't care about you?

636
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,800
Isn't he analyzing it just like you?

637
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,120
So what?

638
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,260
Even if his analysis is right,

639
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,620
he doesn't want

640
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,060
to be our coach.

641
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,840
I invited him, but he refused.

642
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,060
Just listen.

643
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,100
Good for you, Uncle.

644
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,940
Did you hear that?

645
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,020
Your suggestions are already

646
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,320
at a professional coach level.

647
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,660
Yes, Uncle.

648
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,620
- Amazing.
- Our beach volleyball team

649
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,200
is actually short of a coach right now.

650
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,440
What do you think?

651
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,140
Do you want to consider it?

652
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,380
- Good idea, Uncle.
- Uncle.

653
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,860
This is a good idea.

654
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,420
Just think about it. You could make

655
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,680
training plans for each of us,

656
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,260
especially for Li Guoduo.

657
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,700
With your guidance,

658
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,300
she would improve by leaps and bounds.

659
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,780
- Right?
- Yes.

660
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,640
- Uncle, please consider it.
- Uncle.

661
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,800
Forget it.

662
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,040
I won't be your coach.

663
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,480
(Li Guoduo)
I still have a barbecue place to run,

664
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,960
and Li Guoduo won't listen to me anyway.

665
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,240
Chen Weilan.

666
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,700
Tell my dad

667
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,380
he just knows how to criticize me,

668
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,920
not how to be a coach.

669
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,020
Uncle, Guoduo said

670
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,460
you only know how to criticize her

671
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,580
not how to be a coach.

672
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,680
You tell your dad yourself.

673
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,220
He doesn't dare to be one.

674
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,900
All talk, no action.

675
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,520
You think I'm all talk?

676
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,770
You can't even find

677
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,540
the right direction and positioning
in your practice,

678
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,600
and you're still criticizing me?

679
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,500
You can criticize me,
but I can't say anything back?

680
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:48,960
You're so authoritarian.

681
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,440
What? Why don't you
become the coach and show me?

682
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,420
(Shao Nian)

683
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,460
Shao Nian, where are you?

684
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,740
Let's talk in person.

685
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,580
Okay.

686
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,180
Uncle Li is really good to you.

687
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,860
When he's here, don't throw a tantrum at him.

688
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,700
Talk it out.

689
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,240
Guoduo.

690
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,420
Chen Weilan, we're partners.

691
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,940
Evaluate

692
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,120
my usual training.

693
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,540
Lang Yueting is average,

694
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,400
but

695
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,300
your dad is right.

696
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,520
You're indeed not as good as her.

697
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,240
Why aren't you helping me?

698
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,200
Because you're unreasonable.

699
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,220
Even your partner doesn't support you.

700
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,420
When people speak harshly,

701
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,440
it's also for your own good.

702
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,700
Honest advice is often hard to accept.

703
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,680
Haven't you heard that?

704
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,940
Are you honest?

705
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,160
You're hurtful.

706
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,260
Not only are you hurtful

707
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,760
but you also hurt my feelings.

708
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,440
You always keep criticizing me.

709
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,600
I'm your daughter,

710
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,680
not your punching bag.

711
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,320
Have you ever considered my feelings?

712
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,540
A bit of success

713
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,620
will make you smug.

714
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,480
Setbacks will make you fall apart.

715
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,040
You're not suited for competitive sports.

716
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,640
Competitive sports are very harsh.

717
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,260
It's about skills

718
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,640
and mentality.

719
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,940
You must learn to lose
before you can learn to win.

720
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,740
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

721
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,400
I know all this.

722
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,720
But I just want some affirmation,

723
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,600
even just a word.

724
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,260
I know I'm not a genius,

725
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,200
but I hope

726
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,020
I can make you proud

727
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,680
because I'm following in your footsteps.

728
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,380
You're my daughter.

729
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,600
I'm your dad.

730
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,360
How could I not be proud?

731
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,120
But I don't approve

732
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,920
of beach volleyball.

733
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,660
What's wrong with beach volleyball?

734
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,020
Why can't I play beach volleyball?

735
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,080
You're just not allowed.

736
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,380
Duoduo,

737
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,660
Uncle has been through it himself.

738
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,340
He's worried you'll work too hard

739
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,900
and not get what you want in the end.

740
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,200
Wouldn't that be upsetting?

741
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm not afraid of hardship at all.

742
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,940
I don't want to be

743
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,300
a professional beach volleyball player.

744
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,480
I just want to play, no matter what.

745
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,840
This is just the beginning.

746
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,120
The road ahead

747
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,020
will be harder and tougher.

748
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,920
If I criticize you a bit now,

749
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,560
you're already

750
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,500
backing down.

751
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,660
What will you do when you face

752
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,780
greater setbacks in the future?

753
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,220
I will never give up.

754
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,680
I don't believe you at all.

755
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,600
I don't care.

756
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,720
Anyway, we've agreed.

757
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,600
If I keep playing,

758
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,620
you can't stop me anymore.

759
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,460
Is that okay?

760
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,880
Okay, let's make it official.

761
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,780
I'll give you a year.

762
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,680
If you can make it to the college league,

763
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,860
you can play for the next four years.

764
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,700
I'll support you.

765
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,760
If you can't make it,

766
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,000
don't touch beach volleyball again.

767
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,140
Focus on your studies.

768
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,240
Okay, we have a deal.

769
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,920
In this year,

770
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,100
you must not say anything

771
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,500
like "I can't do it".

772
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,300
Why can't I say that?

773
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,160
Can't you handle this bit of criticism?

774
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,760
Uncle Li,

775
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,040
Duoduo can handle criticism.

776
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,700
I've been at your home these days,

777
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,440
and I understand the situation clearly.

778
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,000
Duoduo just

779
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,580
wants some more encouragement

780
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,080
from you.

781
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,400
And Guoduo.

782
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,860
Uncle Li's way of expressing himself
might be wrong,

783
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,860
but he's your dad.

784
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,440
How could he not care about you?

785
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,580
He is

786
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,360
your biological father,

787
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,380
so how could he not be proud of you?

788
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,400
Right, Uncle Li?

789
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,840
What's there to be proud of?

790
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,380
Look at you.

791
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,300
You just ran off again,

792
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,020
making everyone worry about you.

793
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,200
Let me ask you.

794
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
If your customers say your barbecue is bad,

795
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,480
would you run away?

796
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,740
If you can convince me,

797
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,480
I won't run.

798
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,440
I can't convince you.

799
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,420
But I can count. Would you listen to me?

800
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,360
Come on. One, two, three, four?

801
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,480
Are you dancing to a beat or what?

802
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,780
Hilarious.

803
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,740
They say

804
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,540
whether two people get along well or not

805
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,620
can be judged
by whether they can argue happily.

806
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,780
By this standard,

807
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,720
your relationship could score 90 points.

808
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,640
With a full score of 1,000?

809
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,480
Alright, alright.

810
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,700
You two are really amusing.

811
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,740
Seriously, I do hope Uncle Li

812
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,180
will become our coach.

813
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,820
I think with the two of them,

814
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,780
our beach volleyball team

815
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,980
will be really lively.

816
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,140
- Yes.
- Yes, Uncle.

817
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,420
Please be our coach.

818
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,120
- Yes.
- Yes, Uncle.

819
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,880
Uncle.

820
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,220
Weilan.

821
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,280
What do you think?

822
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,400
I fully support it.

823
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,140
Think it through.

824
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,460
If things don't go well,

825
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,800
don't come for me to return it.

826
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,980
Since you said that,

827
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,760
I have to agree.

828
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,200
I'll show you

829
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,600
whether I'm a fake product.

830
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,640
I'll let you experience

831
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,360
the harshness of beach volleyball.

832
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,100
- Great.
- No problem.

833
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,580
We finally have a coach!

834
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,040
We have a coach!

835
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,780
Here it is. The last dish.

836
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,640
Hurry up. Customers will be coming soon.

837
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,460
Today I'm in a good mood,

838
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,420
so I'm happy to sell a few fewer skewers.

839
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,840
You're just making yourself feel better.

840
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,600
Lost in thought?

841
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,880
Pour some wine for me.

842
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,620
Are you still thinking

843
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,120
about Lang Yueting's match?

844
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,000
Lang Yueting is great,

845
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,460
but no matter how good she is,

846
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,720
she's still in Sports University.

847
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,480
She can't become your teammate.

848
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,020
I have Chen Weilan.

849
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,500
Besides, one day,

850
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,520
I'll be as excellent as Lang Yueting.

851
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,220
I watched Chen Weilan's match videos.

852
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,240
Her overall abilities are indeed impressive.

853
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,980
Her spiking power at the net

854
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,480
is also very strong.

855
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,440
But I noticed a problem.

856
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,940
If she encounters someone like Lang Yueting,

857
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,700
who is tall and powerful,

858
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,360
she hesitates

859
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,280
when spiking.

860
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,900
Look.

861
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,200
In the match against São Paulo,

862
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,780
she lost at least ten points

863
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,640
because of her hesitation at the net.

864
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,720
Amazing.

865
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,480
You even noticed that.

866
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,560
Do you know why?

867
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,600
Why?

868
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,600
Because her wrist was injured.

869
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,220
A habitual dislocation.

870
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,180
It's hard to completely cure.

871
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,180
I don't think

872
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,100
it's just about the injury.

873
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,000
What else could it be?

874
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,180
She has psychological barriers.

875
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,020
She often worries

876
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,620
about her injury recurring,

877
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,820
so she can't let go.

878
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,980
Once she lets go,

879
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,660
Lang Yueting wouldn't defeat her.

880
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,960
That's the superficial reason.

881
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,740
(Dafu BBQ)

882
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,340
You're really strange.

883
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,140
With so many empty seats in the cafeteria,

884
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,720
why do you insist on sitting near me?

885
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,980
Are you running the cafeteria or something?

886
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:13,960
Why should you care?

887
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,800
You're affecting my appetite.

888
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,540
Affecting your appetite?

889
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,840
Just don't look at me.

890
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,860
Jingxuan, come here.

891
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,920
- Weilan.
- Come here.

892
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,440
Gao Ge.

893
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,000
When did you two become so close?

894
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,780
We're on the same team.

895
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,160
Of course, we get along well.

896
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,080
I never would have guessed.

897
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,680
You're quite willing to make friends.

898
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,360
There are many things you can't see.

899
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,980
You got steamed cold noodles?

900
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,240
When I went, there were none left.

901
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,700
When I went,

902
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,520
they had just made a new batch.

903
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:57,660
You like them?

904
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,860
No, I don't like them.

905
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,900
He really likes them.

906
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,380
I often see him eating them.

907
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,020
Oh, you like them?

908
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,580
Here, have some. Is that enough?

909
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,900
If not, I'll get more.

910
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,980
I haven't even touched them yet.

911
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,120
Hope you don't mind.

912
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,920
Look, he's happy now.

913
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,480
Eat up.

914
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,740
Gao Ge likes steamed cold noodles.

915
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,710
I'll remember that.

916
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,040
Eat up.

917
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,710
Weilan.

918
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,500
You're still here?

919
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,440
Finished eating?

920
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,220
Where are you going later?

921
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,230
Later?

922
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,000
I'll practice volleyball on my own.

923
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,670
By yourself?

924
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,540
Practice

925
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,520
should be done with a partner.

926
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,120
I'm used to being alone.

927
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,320
Will Gao Ge be going later?

928
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,400
Why would he practice with me?

929
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,060
Next time,

930
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,940
when Gao Ge

931
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,860
practices with you,

932
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,440
could you bring me along?

933
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,620
I'm a newbie in beach volleyball,

934
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,320
and I want to learn more from you guys.

935
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,020
Are you sure you want to practice with us,

936
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,120
or do you want to train alone with him?

937
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,040
Both.

938
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,220
I can't control that.

939
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,540
You have to ask Li Guoduo.

940
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,760
When we train next time,

941
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,380
ask her to let you two team up.

942
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,200
I've told her hundreds of times.

943
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,000
She still hasn't done that.

944
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,340
Please, Weilan, you're the best.

945
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,120
- I'll give you a tip.
- Please help me.

946
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,680
Next time when we train,

947
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,820
just put in more effort.

948
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,620
Gao Ge likes girls who are good at playing.

949
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,500
- So, you agree?
- I'm leaving.

950
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,360
Weilan, you're the best.

951
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,620
- Look at this.
- "Gao Ge", "Gao Ge".

952
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,020
Can I put this here? What do you think?

953
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,860
Yes, it's fine.

954
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,400
Here, here.

955
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,140
Take one of these. Write "Gao" on it.

956
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,020
I'll take a picture first.

957
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,400
Here. Three, two, one, cheese.

958
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,100
Okay, take one for me.

959
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,140
Come on.

960
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,700
Let me take a photo with "Gao Ge".

961
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,740
Come on, "Gao Ge", smile.

962
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,320
Come on, three, two, one.

963
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,400
Another one, another one.

964
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,900
Gao is here.

965
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,800
The real person has arrived.

966
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,620
What are you doing?

967
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,990
Buying so many steamed cold noodles.

968
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,920
See for yourself.

969
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,700
- Here.
- See for yourself.

970
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,540
"Gao Ge".

971
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,180
"Gao Ge".

972
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,940
"To my ideal type".

973
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:28,840
"Gao Ge".

974
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,560
"From your fan, Lulu."

975
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,220
What's all this about?

976
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,620
It's all her love.

977
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,900
The steamed cold noodles of love.

978
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,900
I've heard

979
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,660
about the "sad cold jelly" from Sichuan,

980
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,940
but we have the steamed cold noodles
of love in Xingang.

981
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,180
Gao, take it. Let me
take a few pictures for you.

982
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,460
Come on, smile.

983
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,880
Don't mess around.

984
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,220
Why is she giving me steamed cold noodles?

985
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,260
Who knows?

986
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,740
She likes you. You like steamed cold noodles.

987
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,920
So, she bought them for you.

988
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,940
You've been my roommate for a year.

989
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,680
How many times have you seen me eating it?

990
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,360
That's true.

991
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,480
- Why's that?
- I don't know.

992
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,400
Chen Weilan.

993
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,700
It must be her causing trouble.

994
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,840
I'm going to find her now.

995
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,740
Why is he always

996
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,240
in such a hurry to find her?

997
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,040
It really must be fate.

998
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,780
Let's just

999
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,560
split these noodles.

1000
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,960
Is that okay?

1001
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,340
What's wrong with that?

1002
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,420
The noodles

1003
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,540
can't be returned.

1004
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,960
Throwing them away would be a waste.

1005
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,340
How about this?

1006
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,300
I'll take some of the noodles

1007
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,380
since we can't finish them anyway,

1008
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,880
and bring them to the BBQ shop.

1009
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,440
Giving Gao Ge's gift to Li Guoduo?

1010
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,280
Chen Weilan.

1011
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,420
(Straightforward)

1012
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,040
Are you bored?

1013
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,560
Is it fun to mess with me?

1014
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,240
How am I messing with you?

1015
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,940
The activity room

1016
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,120
is full of steamed cold noodles.

1017
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,200
Aren't you behind it?

1018
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,700
Come on.

1019
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,400
How can I be behind it?

1020
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,900
Could you stop assuming

1021
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,140
everything is my fault?

1022
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,980
No way.

1023
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,000
Come with me to check it out.

1024
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,180
I'm not going. I'm reading. Don't bother me.

1025
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,300
Come with me.

1026
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,340
I'm not going.

1027
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,180
Come on.

1028
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,720
Come on. You see for yourself.

1029
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,400
Where are the steamed cold noodles?

1030
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,980
What girl would be silly enough

1031
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,560
to give you steamed cold noodles?

1032
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,540
The noodles were just here.

1033
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,600
With books and letters.

1034
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,920
Don't believe me?

1035
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,820
Ask Xia and Shao Nian.

1036
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,960
They know.

1037
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,940
Either the noodles

1038
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,700
grew wings and flew away,

1039
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,280
or those two split them up.

1040
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,140
It's just a few bucks.

1041
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,140
Do I really need to lie?

1042
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,740
Yeah, it's just a few bucks.

1043
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,700
Do you need to drag me here

1044
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,140
to show off?

1045
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,300
What am I showing off?

1046
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,760
The noodles were right here at that time.

1047
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,340
Gao Ge.

1048
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,280
How did you know I made
steamed cold noodles for you?

1049
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,900
It's my first time making it,

1050
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,940
so it might not taste as good

1051
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,580
as the ones from the shop.

1052
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,440
Give it a try.

1053
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,020
Now I believe it.

1054
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,480
The steamed cold noodles have arrived.

1055
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,260
Wait. Don't cause more trouble.

1056
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,240
Yang Jingxuan,

1057
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,420
when did I ever say

1058
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,660
I like steamed cold noodles?

1059
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,980
You don't like them?

1060
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,940
Even if I like them,

1061
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,560
I can buy them myself.

1062
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,820
If you have time for this,

1063
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,980
it would be better spent

1064
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,400
on training.

1065
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,720
Thank you very much.

1066
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,180
I'm really eating now.

1067
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,680
Eat, eat, eat. Here's a tissue.

1068
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,360
This doesn't feel right.

1069
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,520
By the way,

1070
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,820
I used to think guys

1071
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,980
don't eat spicy food.

1072
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,080
Do you need some chili?

1073
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,260
I don't really like spicy food either.

1074
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,200
Thanks.

1075
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,640
What about the vinegar?

1076
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,760
Is it flavorful enough?

1077
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,660
Yes, yes.

1078
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,980
If it's not enough, add some yourself.

1079
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,240
Okay, don't worry.

1080
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,280
The taste is pretty good.

1081
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,780
Of course.

1082
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,620
This is authentic Shaanxi steamed cold noodles

1083
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,020
from the most popular shop.

1084
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,200
Of course, it tastes good.

1085
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,080
Didn't you make it yourself?

1086
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,480
No.

1087
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,640
But you said you made it yourself.

1088
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,900
I'll tell you.

1089
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,480
Please don't tell Gao Ge.

1090
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,370
Go ahead.

1091
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,420
Actually,

1092
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,520
they were bought from the shop.

1093
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,260
I planned to make them myself.

1094
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,700
See? I bought

1095
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,220
all the ingredients

1096
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,400
to make them myself.

1097
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,180
But unfortunately,

1098
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,320
it wasn't successful.

1099
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,840
But it's still pretty good.

1100
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,000
This isn't really lying.

1101
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,480
It's a little trick

1102
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,520
from a girl.

1103
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,620
And it's not

1104
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,560
entirely from the shop.

1105
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,620
I asked the shop

1106
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,260
to pack the steamed cold noodles

1107
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,420
and the sauce separately,

1108
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,540
and after bringing them back,

1109
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,860
I mixed them myself.

1110
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,820
So,

1111
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,640
I did participate in the preparation.

1112
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,800
Such a lovely gesture.

1113
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,400
Actually,

1114
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,640
I was just joking in the cafeteria that day.

1115
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,420
How would I know what Gao Ge likes to eat?

1116
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,360
I just made it up.

1117
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,100
Didn't expect you to make them.

1118
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,160
Sorry.

1119
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,360
It's okay.

1120
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,220
Luckily, he doesn't like steamed cold noodles.

1121
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,860
Otherwise, I'd be in trouble.

1122
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,360
I really can't learn how to make them.

1123
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,360
Why do you like him so much?

1124
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,320
He's handsome.

1125
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,520
Is that it?

1126
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,680
Do you need a complicated reason?

1127
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,380
No, no, no.

1128
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,420
The noodles are good, very good.

1129
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,380
Tastes good.

1130
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,120
It's just that they're a bit broken.

1131
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,720
Maybe they jostled on the way here.

1132
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,680
Jostled when you went out to meet him?

1133
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,340
Gao Ge.

1134
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,400
You're here.

1135
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,900
I was just watching training videos,

1136
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,880
learning techniques.

1137
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,220
Great.

1138
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,540
Watching these videos is good

1139
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,460
for solidifying the basics
and improving skills.

1140
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,300
Good.

1141
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,160
Keep it up.

1142
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,620
Well.

1143
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,620
Gao Ge.

1144
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,880
With the recent weather changes,

1145
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,260
please take care of your health.

1146
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,100
Thanks.

1147
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,580
Gao Ge.

1148
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,580
I'm done with my studying here.

1149
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,920
I'll head to the library now.

1150
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,940
You go.

1151
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,020
But remember to keep up

1152
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,360
with your training.

1153
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,820
Well, Gao Ge.

1154
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,380
I made the goji tea

1155
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,800
on the table.
