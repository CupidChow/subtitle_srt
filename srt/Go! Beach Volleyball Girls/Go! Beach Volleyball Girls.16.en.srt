Coach Tian.

Well.

Coach Lu,

30
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,540
the match isn't over yet.

31
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,160
Nice shot!

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,000
- Well done!
- Coach Tian.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I know. I owe you a meal.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,100
Alright, see you later!

35
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,740
Great job!

36
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,680
Come on!

37
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,000
Amazing, amazing!

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,880
Coach.

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,960
Great job!

40
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,680
Awesome, awesome!

41
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,080
Coach, I'm sorry.

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,920
It's okay.

43
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,580
It was good.

44
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,980
Just

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,940
made me lose a meal.

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,380
Awesome!

47
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,020
Great performance!

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,640
Really good!

49
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
I was so excited

50
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,900
watching from the side.

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,280
Great job!

52
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,120
Good job!

53
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,520
Don't you think we won too easily?

54
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,940
Fantastic!

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,220
Cheers!

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,680
Thank you, everyone.

57
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,760
All our hard work

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,140
paid off.

59
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,380
Don't get too happy yet.

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,800
Didn't you notice

61
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,520
they were letting us win

62
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,740
on purpose?

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,520
I think

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,800
their coach probably

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,480
told them not

66
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,940
to show their full strength.

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,220
I agree.

68
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,000
Didn't you notice Tu Lingling

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,920
was completely different today?

70
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,640
She wasn't playing at full power.

71
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,670
And Long Ya.

72
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,700
Her strength is in blocking,

73
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,140
but today she let

74
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,220
a few balls through on purpose.

75
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,960
Tu Lingling.

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,840
She's usually strong at spiking.

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,620
Today, when I was blocking,

78
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,020
she reduced her strength.

79
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,510
So, we were silly

80
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,440
and played our full game,

81
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,700
and they saw everything.

82
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,280
I feel the same.

83
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,120
Yeah.

84
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,600
I wish we'd improve

85
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,240
and beaten them fair and square.

86
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,140
Don't worry.

87
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,920
You will.

88
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,980
You

89
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,960
have improved.

90
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,260
Keep going.

91
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,860
Still a long way to go.

92
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,300
Let's eat.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,020
Thank you, Coach Tian.

94
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,320
Throughout the match,

95
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
I felt

96
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,240
their overall level

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,620
was below ours.

98
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,760
And

99
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,680
the gap between them

100
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,200
is quite big.

101
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,600
Chen Weilan is excellent,

102
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,480
but Li Guoduo is average,

103
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,060
so they struggle to cooperate.

104
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,840
By the way, Coach Tian,

105
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,200
there was another pair.

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,680
I saw them play.

107
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,980
They were pretty good.

108
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,560
The short-haired pair?

109
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,820
Yes.

110
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,540
They didn't seem to have tactical skills.

111
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,320
Maybe it was because of the short time,

112
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,940
I didn't get to see much.

113
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,480
It might not be that.

114
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,760
You didn't see it

115
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,300
because they didn't have any tactics.

116
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,940
In the upcoming league,

117
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,780
I'm confident we can beat them.

118
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,040
I am too.

119
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,420
Let's toast to the coach!

120
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,740
- Cheers!
- Cheers, Coach!

121
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,100
Let me say a few words.

122
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,440
Our training on the island

123
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,860
officially ends today.

124
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
You've all gone

125
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,160
through intense training.

126
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,360
Your skills have greatly improved.

127
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,340
You are all top athletes.

128
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,600
I hope that when you return,

129
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,820
you will continue to work hard

130
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,600
and perform at your best

131
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,400
in the upcoming league.

132
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,240
Win glory

133
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,300
for yourselves

134
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,040
and for Xingang University.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,700
Let's give a round of applause.

136
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,360
Great!

137
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,400
Now,

138
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,600
please continue.

139
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,940
We'll leave after this.

140
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,900
Hello, Coach Lu!

141
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,240
Coach Lu.

142
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,400
We lost the friendly match,

143
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,460
so I owe you a meal.

144
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,120
No need to treat me.

145
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,760
You let us win on purpose.

146
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,160
I wouldn't be so thoughtless

147
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,180
as to let a beauty treat me.

148
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,400
You noticed that?

149
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,380
Of course.

150
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,340
But

151
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,760
I'm happy to go on a date

152
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,100
with a beauty.

153
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,680
Enough joking around.

154
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,780
See you later.

155
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,860
Here. To our friendship!

156
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,640
Cheers!

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,840
See you later.

158
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,740
He's quite interesting.

159
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,240
More than just interesting.

160
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,500
He's fascinating.

161
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,660
Let's all have a drink together.

162
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,040
Coach!

163
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,740
(Dafu BBQ)

164
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,700
Why is no one here?

165
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,200
Thief! How dare you break into my house?

166
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,280
Let me catch you today!

167
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,260
You scared me!

168
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,300
Where did you go?

169
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,780
I went to the storage.

170
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,200
No, I mean during the training camp.

171
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,160
You suddenly left.

172
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
Where did you go?

173
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,940
I went home.

174
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,980
Is everything okay?

175
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,860
Yeah, everything's fine.

176
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,860
I have some good news.

177
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,990
Uncle has been recovering well.

178
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,000
He'll be home soon.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,770
Really? That's great!

180
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,280
Thanks for staying

181
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,480
at the store,

182
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,180
so my mom could take care of my dad.

183
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,540
You're too polite.

184
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,960
After all,

185
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,900
I'm also an employee of Dafu BBQ.

186
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,960
Just focus on beach volleyball.

187
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,860
So, Uncle and Auntie will be happy.

188
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,080
I'll go visit my dad at the hospital,

189
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,240
check on his condition,

190
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,200
- and tell him
- OK.

191
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
about our training

192
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,160
to cheer him up.

193
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,200
- Go ahead.
- I'm going.

194
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,080
- I'll be here.
- OK.

195
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,920
Bye-bye.

196
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,160
Dad.

197
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,560
How are you feeling recently?

198
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,620
Are you better now?

199
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,840
Much better.

200
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,740
Don't worry.

201
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,280
I'm telling you.

202
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,060
You need to quit drinking.

203
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,620
Otherwise, you'll get sick again.

204
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,240
Alright.

205
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,340
Quit drinking?

206
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,560
Yeah.

207
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
Our alcohol will be only for the customers.

208
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,300
No one in the family can drink.

209
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,020
I think Duo is right.

210
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,980
We'll both keep an eye on you.

211
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,320
I told you to quit,

212
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,400
but you refused.

213
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,520
Now you're in the hospital.

214
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,540
Right, we'll keep an eye on you.

215
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,940
Don't worry.

216
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,060
You can't drink anymore.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,840
Let's discuss this

218
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,240
later.

219
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,960
Alright.

220
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,740
I'll promise to quit drinking,

221
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,320
but it has to be gradual.

222
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,660
I promise not to drink too much.

223
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,280
Is that okay?

224
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,700
You're just trying to negotiate.

225
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,060
Alright, enough about me.

226
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,640
Duoduo,

227
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,680
how are you?

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,420
How is Lu Daxing?

229
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,660
I think he's not as good as you.

230
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,420
We train for 10 hours a day.

231
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,400
Eight hours of physical training

232
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,260
The other two hours

233
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,300
are to convince us to do it.

234
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Physical training

235
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,100
takes up such a big portion.

236
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,580
It's a bit strange.

237
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,740
What kind of method is that?

238
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,520
In our time,

239
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,240
we used to balance physical training,

240
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,340
matches and tactics equally.

241
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,160
Has Lu Daxing forgotten

242
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,180
how he got through it?

243
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,740
It shouldn't be.

244
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,460
I don't know.

245
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,260
Although it's quite tough,

246
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,060
we're still quite happy.

247
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,520
By the way, Mom,

248
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,240
the team is having

249
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,460
a gathering at our house today.

250
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,600
Sure.

251
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,420
It's always been your gathering spot, right?

252
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,840
But it's okay.

253
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,640
This time, I'll handle everything.

254
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,800
Don't worry about it.

255
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,780
You?

256
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,660
Can you cook for your friends?

257
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,940
Come on.

258
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,480
Your dad's fine now.

259
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,300
I'll go back and help you prepare tonight.

260
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,500
Really?

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
That would be a great help.

262
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,060
My dear mother.

263
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,380
Alright, I'll head back with Duo now.

264
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
We'll be off.

265
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,720
Rest well.

266
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,560
Okay.

267
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,140
Go to bed early.

268
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,960
Come on.

269
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,880
Don't be shy.

270
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,760
- Feel free.
- OK.

271
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,140
Coming, coming.

272
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,560
- The kebabs are here!
- One for you.

273
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,620
Coming, coming.

274
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,960
- Here, here.
- Smells good!

275
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,100
There's more.

276
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,660
- Help me.
- Come on.

277
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,160
- Here.
- Come on, Xia.

278
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,440
- Careful.
- Smells good!

279
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,580
Looks so appetizing!

280
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,720
Eat this first.

281
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,040
- Help yourselves.
- I want that.

282
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
- It's coming
- Eat up.

283
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,980
Smells so good!

284
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,960
Everyone, dig in. There's plenty.

285
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,880
The edamame are there.

286
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,120
- Come on. Dig in.
- Come on.

287
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,960
- Dig in.
- Come on.

288
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,540
Looks so appetizing!

289
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,280
It's delicious!

290
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,680
I haven't had a barbecue in ages.

291
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,160
Our barbecue is the best.

292
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,560
Stop flattering yourself.

293
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,880
It's really delicious. Try it.

294
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,160
The meat at your place is good.

295
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
The meat is nice.

296
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,600
It's okay. Eat up.

297
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,360
You won't gain weight from one meal.

298
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
It's okay.

299
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,380
Then I'll eat.

300
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,240
So lively.

301
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,380
- Is there enough to eat?
- Yes, Auntie.

302
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,120
If you need more, just tell me.

303
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,640
I'll grill more for you.

304
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,520
- Thank you, Auntie.
- Thank you, Auntie.

305
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,400
Kids, I heard from Duo

306
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,300
that you all train really hard.

307
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,160
I can't help much,

308
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,900
but I prepared something for you.

309
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,040
What is it?

310
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,060
Supplements.

311
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,320
I checked online.

312
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,800
Athletes like you

313
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,040
have different nutritional needs

314
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,320
than ordinary people.

315
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,740
So, you need to take this every day.

316
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,320
- Calcium tablets.
- Thanks.

317
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
Don't touch it. This is for Weilan.

318
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,960
Boys and girls

319
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,040
take different ones.

320
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,920
This is for you.

321
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,820
Thank you, Auntie!

322
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,960
Eating just fish

323
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,200
and meat every day

324
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,240
isn't enough

325
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
to replenish your energy.

326
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,080
So, you need

327
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,600
to take one calcium tablet daily.

328
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,460
Got it, Auntie.

329
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

330
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,280
- Here.
- What's this?

331
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,240
This is knee lubricant.

332
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,320
Take it every day.

333
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,280
Knee lubricant?

334
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,380
What is that?

335
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
You all are jumping around

336
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,540
on the sand every day.

337
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,400
The biggest damage is to your knees.

338
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,480
So you need to start

339
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,320
taking this now.

340
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,880
Don't wait until you're my age

341
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,200
when your knees hurt. Here.

342
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
- Thank you, Auntie.
- Thank you, Auntie.

343
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,400
- Gao Ge, take this.
- And also,

344
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,520
take one of these every day.

345
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,020
Alright. Thank you, Auntie.

346
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,520
Mom, have you been scammed?

347
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,240
These supplements on TV are all scams.

348
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,220
Why did you buy so many?

349
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,860
These have won awards.

350
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,080
Kids, I've checked.

351
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,200
You can eat them.

352
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,960
These have won awards abroad.

353
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,800
If they work, come back to me. I can...

354
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,200
- Thanks.
- How much did you buy?

355
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,960
You bought so much. What a waste!

356
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,980
How much did you spend?

357
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,440
I'm telling you.

358
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,280
Buying for yourself is expensive.

359
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,360
But buying in bulk,

360
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,640
it's 5.4 yuan cheaper.

361
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,520
I got a membership,

362
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,560
so there's a 20% discount.

363
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,460
Alright, alright.

364
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,600
Coach.

365
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,480
Coach, I bought this for you.

366
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,920
You work so hard

367
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,120
training the kids.

368
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,600
This is just for you.

369
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,470
You've put a lot of effort into Duo.

370
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,320
Try it.

371
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,760
If it works, let me know.

372
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,020
I can get it cheaper.

373
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,160
Really?

374
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,260
If it's convenient,

375
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,880
recommend it

376
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,900
to your other students.

377
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,840
I can add you to the membership,

378
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,560
and it'll be even cheaper.

379
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,440
Mrs. Li,

380
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,260
do you have any whitening products?

381
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,820
Yes.

382
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,760
I'll get a catalog for you.

383
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,000
- Wait a moment.
- Sure.

384
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,220
I'll go with you.

385
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,140
Everyone, enjoy yourselves.

386
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,340
It's a good thing.

387
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,320
Coach Lu, look.

388
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,260
This is the product brochure.

389
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,400
I checked it out.

390
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,240
They're good.

391
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,100
Look at this.

392
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,800
They've won awards abroad.

393
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,860
They have them in China.

394
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,720
Mrs. Li, this is pretty comprehensive.

395
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,920
Right? I think these are pretty good.

396
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,620
Do you need more distributors?

397
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,180
Yes, yes.

398
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,040
You're quite

399
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,280
skilled at this.

400
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,260
I used to deal in cosmetics.

401
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,780
Really? You did that too?

402
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,620
Yes.

403
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,140
You know.

404
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,040
Being a coach is tough.

405
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,260
The salary isn't enough.

406
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,200
Right.

407
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,960
After I married Dafu,

408
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,860
I found out you two were partners.

409
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,560
We finally met.

410
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,600
Didn't expect us to be half-colleagues.

411
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
You must mentor me more.

412
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,040
I'm just starting out

413
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,220
and don't know much.

414
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,540
What do you think of the products?

415
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,740
I think they're very good.

416
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,560
Mrs. Li, I'll go over

417
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,900
and join them for a drink.

418
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,660
What about the distribution?

419
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,600
We have plenty of time

420
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,060
to discuss that.

421
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,480
Alright, Mrs. Li.

422
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,740
These are really good.

423
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,840
Alright.

424
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,110
(Student Dormitory)

425
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,660
Xiaojing, are you okay?

426
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,700
My stomach hurts.

427
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,840
Could it be something wrong

428
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,140
with Li Guoduo's barbecue?

429
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,880
I can't think about that now.

430
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,960
Call Xia Liqiang first.

431
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,900
Alright.

432
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,000
Hello?

433
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:38,850
Hello?

434
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,460
What's wrong?

435
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,560
Yan Xiaojing has diarrhea.

436
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,120
She's been to the bathroom many times.

437
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,980
Come and check on her.

438
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,900
(Outpatient, Xigang Heart Hospital)

439
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,840
For now,

440
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,060
don't eat anything.

441
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,020
Let her rest.

442
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,880
Xiaojing, rest for now.

443
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,980
I'll go ask the doctor.

444
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,020
Doctor,

445
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,310
may I ask

446
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,660
what's wrong with Yan Xiaojing?

447
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,900
Based on the test results,

448
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,310
she has acute diarrhea

449
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,920
caused by an improper diet.

450
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,170
Improper diet?

451
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,900
- Yes.
- Is it that serious?

452
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,880
It's not that serious,

453
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,340
but she needs proper rest.

454
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,480
I'll prescribe some medicine for her.

455
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,340
Take the medicine. She'll be fine in days.

456
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,200
But for now,

457
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,020
don't let her eat anything inappropriate.

458
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Alright. Thank you.

459
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,760
(Observation Room) Xia Liqiang.

460
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,720
I need to go.

461
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,080
I'll go check on her. Thank you.

462
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,220
Okay, take good care of her.

463
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,280
(Mo)
Xiaojing got diarrhea

464
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,440
after eating your barbecue

465
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,540
and is now in the hospital.

466
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,600
Where are you going?

467
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,920
Xiaojing is hospitalized.

468
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,020
I need to go check on her.

469
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,160
I'll go with you.

470
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,620
Let's go together.

471
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,660
My legs are numb.

472
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,900
The doctor mentioned an improper diet?

473
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,380
Yes, it's nothing serious.

474
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,180
Some rest and medicine will do the trick.

475
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,180
What should we do?

476
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,080
The competition is just a few days away.

477
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,840
I need to reach the finals of the league

478
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,220
to qualify for a graduate slot.

479
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,560
How can I compete

480
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,600
like this?

481
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,840
I can't!

482
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,760
Relax.

483
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,580
Careful. Or you'll go to the bathroom again.

484
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,940
There are still a few days left, right?

485
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,580
A few days?

486
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,420
The doctor said I need to rest.

487
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,500
After I rest,

488
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,540
can I still compete?

489
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,620
Will I have time to train?

490
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,460
I only ate once

491
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,660
t Li Guoduo's house today.

492
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,740
Something's wrong with their food.

493
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,020
Do you think

494
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,700
Li Guoduo did it on purpose?

495
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,660
She's jealous of my skills.

496
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,100
She's retaliating

497
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,660
because I beat her in the last game.

498
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,620
I get it. She just doesn't want me to compete.

499
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,860
You're exaggerating.

500
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,860
You're all teammates.

501
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,260
Don't think so badly of people.

502
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,780
Don't make things so complicated.

503
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,180
How can you say that?

504
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,500
Look at me now. What am I supposed to think?

505
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,020
I don't care.

506
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,940
You need to kick Li Guoduo off the team.

507
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,420
Li Guoduo is the captain now.

508
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,340
And even if I were the captain,

509
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,020
our team isn't a dictatorship.

510
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,900
We can't kick her out

511
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,140
for no reason.

512
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,540
I'm your girlfriend!

513
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,380
I've been

514
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,740
on an IV. Look at my condition.

515
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,700
You're siding with her,

516
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
not me?

517
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,500
Xiaojing, how are you feeling?

518
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,780
Liqiang, Xiaojing.

519
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,700
You're here.

520
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,340
What did the doctor say?

521
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,180
It's nothing serious.

522
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,580
Just an improper diet.

523
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,100
Shao Nian said

524
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,700
this is good for the stomach,

525
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,780
so I brought some from home.

526
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,180
Make some for Xiaojing later.

527
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,700
I dare not eat anything

528
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,900
from your house.

529
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,180
What's wrong, Xiaojing?

530
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,660
What's wrong?

531
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,460
Didn't you understand what I said?

532
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,540
Take your stuff away.

533
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,380
I don't want your fake kindness.

534
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,420
From now on,

535
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,700
I won't eat anything from you.

536
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,820
And I won't go to your filthy

537
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,860
barbecue stand either.

538
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,580
Today, it caused diarrhea.

539
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,340
Tomorrow, it might cause something worse.

540
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,700
What do you mean?

541
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,540
Xiaojing,

542
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,580
are you saying

543
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,660
your diarrhea was caused

544
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,860
by Duoduo's barbecue?

545
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,940
No, she...

546
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,340
Isn't it obvious?

547
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,860
I ate it and immediately got diarrhea.

548
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,420
How could it be such a coincidence?

549
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,100
Do I need to spell it out even more?

550
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,620
No. That's not what she meant.

551
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,140
She's been having diarrhea lately

552
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,740
and isn't in a good state.

553
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,580
The competition is soon, and she's...

554
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,820
Do I need you to make excuses?

555
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,900
I'm saying

556
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,300
what I think.

557
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,820
I've made it clear.

558
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,620
Your barbecue stand is a scam.

559
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,980
Xiaojing,

560
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,300
there's nothing wrong with our food.

561
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,340
I came to see you

562
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,460
because you're my teammate.

563
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,900
I care about you, so I came.

564
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,300
I hope you're saying these things

565
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
because you're not well.

566
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,380
If not, accusing me of that

567
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,500
is really hurtful.

568
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,220
Duoduo, Duoduo...

569
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,100
Duoduo!

570
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,940
Xiaojing,

571
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,180
I live at Duoduo's house.

572
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,540
I know the best if the food

573
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,460
is clean.

574
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,460
You know I'm a medical student.

575
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,260
Diarrhea can be caused by many reasons.

576
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,460
I know you're upset

577
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,580
because you're unwell.

578
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,660
We understand that.

579
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,580
But please think

580
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,180
about if you've crossed a line.

581
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,220
Hope you'll recover soon.

582
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,140
Bye, Liqiang.

583
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,260
Shao Nian.

584
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,460
Shao Nian.

585
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:46,980
Xiaojing,

586
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,460
why did you have to do that?

587
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,900
Duoduo came to see you out of kindness,

588
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,100
and now you've caused a rift.

589
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,740
Fine.

590
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,900
You're all good people,

591
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,500
and I'm the only bad one, right?

592
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,900
I didn't say that.

593
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,300
Stop talking. Just go.

594
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,500
I'm only trying to help you.

595
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,140
Fine.

596
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,620
Take some time to cool down.

597
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,500
Xixi, I'm alone at the hospital.

598
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,260
Can you come keep me company?

599
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,260
(Quick Treatment for Diarrhea)

600
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,860
Shao Nian.

601
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,060
Did you find it?

602
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,620
Come on. It's your major.

603
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,340
You can't even handle a little diarrhea?

604
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,700
Please be responsible for your words.

605
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm trying to help you,

606
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,860
and you say that about me?

607
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,220
Besides,

608
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,540
a small case

609
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,580
of diarrhea

610
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,380
is still harmful to the body.

611
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,140
Medication is just a remedy.

612
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,340
Real recovery depends

613
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,740
on the immune system.

614
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,340
You're so annoying.

615
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,180
All talk

616
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,620
and no substance.

617
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,140
Annoying!

618
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,220
So annoying

619
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,500
that you can't get enough of me?

620
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,020
Annoying as in irritating.

621
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,300
Duoduo, that's not right either.

622
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,140
It's not related in any way.

623
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,780
Stop it.

624
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,460
Hello, where is the patient

625
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,700
Yan Xiaojing who had diarrhea

626
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,180
yesterday?

627
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,300
She's been discharged.

628
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,660
Discharged?

629
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,100
Finally, you answered.

630
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,060
Where are you?

631
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,540
Why do you care where I am?

632
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,740
Still upset?

633
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,380
Are you feeling any better?

634
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
I bought you breakfast.

635
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,860
I'll bring it over?

636
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,780
Xia Liqiang, can you stop joking around

637
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,660
when I'm serious

638
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,460
about something?

639
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,340
Then what do you want me to do?

640
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,620
Don't ask me.

641
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,340
Figure it out.

642
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,620
Xia Liqiang, I'm telling you.

643
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,220
I don't want to see Li Guoduo

644
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,700
on the team until I've recovered.

645
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,740
Do as you see fit.

646
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,820
I used to be a math problem, right?

647
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,820
I'm so difficult.

648
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
What's wrong?

649
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,020
Did he upset you?

650
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,780
Careful. It's hot.

651
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,860
No, I'm not really mad.

652
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,140
I'm just annoyed,

653
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,220
feeling blocked up inside.

654
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,700
Annoyed with who?

655
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Xia Liqiang?

656
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,660
Or Duoduo?

657
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,260
I'm just angry,

658
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,580
so I said a few things.

659
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,940
Now everyone is standing

660
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,580
on a moral high ground criticizing me.

661
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,420
Yes, I don't have direct evidence,

662
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,220
but I only ate one meal

663
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,300
at Li Guoduo's house.

664
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,220
You know that. I'm not lying, right?

665
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,740
It's reasonable for me to think of it.

666
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,820
Xia Liqiang is just a peacemaker,

667
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,100
saying nice things

668
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,420
but actually just brushing me off.

669
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,420
So annoying. I don't want to see him

670
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,380
or Li Guoduo.

671
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,220
So annoying!

672
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,420
Sweetie,

673
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,860
don't worry.

674
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,020
I'm your friend.

675
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,700
I'm always on your side.

676
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,820
Forget it.

677
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,460
Didn't you say you copied the videos

678
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,940
of the league from the past two years?

679
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,980
Let's study them.

680
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,140
Sure, it's on my computer.

681
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,980
Come on.

682
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
- Sir.
- What?

683
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,900
Look who that is.

684
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,220
Go check it out.

685
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,300
What's wrong, Xixi?

686
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,780
You seem troubled.

687
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,860
What happened?

688
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,540
It's my friend Yan Xiaojing.

689
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,100
You know her.

690
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,060
She suddenly got food poisoning

691
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,940
from eating barbecue.

692
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,140
Isn't that infuriating?

693
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,940
If it were me,

694
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,540
I'd trash their barbecue shop

695
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,700
to teach them a lesson.

696
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,300
Oh, I see.

697
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,620
I'll take care of it.

698
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,740
Leave it to me.

699
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,780
I'll handle it.

700
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,900
What are you going to do?

701
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,500
Don't cause any trouble for me.

702
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,020
I won't. Trust me.

703
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,500
I'll listen to you.

704
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,420
Alright, don't be mad.

705
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,940
- Come and play.
- Alright.

706
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:50,890
Come on.

707
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,740
Let's play!

708
00:26:53,100 --> 00:27:00,100
(Beach Volleyball Activity Room)

709
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,460
It's not training time yet.

710
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,460
You're so diligent.

711
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,540
Well.

712
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,780
Everyone knows you

713
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,500
as the volleyball prodigy.

714
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,500
If they knew how hard you work,

715
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,900
they'd admire you even more.

716
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,620
Admire me for what?

717
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,420
For not making it

718
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,380
into the Seven-School League?

719
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,420
You have

720
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,500
gotten rid

721
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,820
of the mental block now.

722
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,940
Winning should be easy.

723
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,660
I should use this time to practice

724
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,180
and improve my skills.

725
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,420
That's right.

726
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,100
Improving skills

727
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,380
requires hard work.

728
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,940
And tactics

729
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,340
have to change

730
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,420
during matches.

731
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,300
Check this out.

732
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,260
Look at this game.

733
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,020
- How is it?
- Pretty good.

734
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,150
Hello.

735
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,060
She dares to come here?

736
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,020
Someone ended up in the hospital

737
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,020
because of her food.

738
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,100
In the hospital?

739
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,780
Keep your voice down. Come on.

740
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,780
I heard it was someone from their team,

741
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,220
Yan Xiaojing.

742
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,620
Yan Xiaojing?

743
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,860
Li Guoduo screwed over her own teammate?

744
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,900
With the league coming up,

745
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,540
her family's barbecue caused trouble

746
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,860
and screwed over her teammate.

747
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,140
Enough.

748
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,540
I can hear it.

749
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,340
Nothing's wrong with our barbecue.

750
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,420
Stop talking about it.

751
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,380
Enough talking.

752
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,820
- Duoduo.
- Duoduo.

753
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,780
We're going to see Xiaojing later.

754
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,340
Shao Nian,

755
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,780
once the soup is ready,

756
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,220
I'll take it to your uncle.

757
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,100
Take care of the shop.

758
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,180
Alright. Don't worry.

759
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,980
Auntie, I have to say,

760
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,940
you and Uncle Li

761
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
are so sweet

762
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,420
after all these years.

763
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,140
What love?

764
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,660
He likes the soup I make.

765
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,860
I happen to be good at it.

766
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,380
That's how life goes.

767
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,900
It's that simple.

768
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,500
Don't you have any secret tips

769
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,820
to keep love alive?

770
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,620
You young people

771
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,260
always talk about secret tips.

772
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,820
There's no such thing.

773
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,820
Life is like making soup.

774
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,260
The flavor develops over time.

775
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,940
That sounds deep.

776
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,580
You'll get it when you get married.

777
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,820
Don't worry. I've got the shop covered.

778
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,620
Good game. Take a break.

779
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,700
Just you two? Where's Li Guoduo?

780
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,460
Didn't you see the group chat?

781
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,300
What happened?

782
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,140
Check it yourself.

783
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,180
(Food poisoning? At Li Guoduo's shop?)

784
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,380
Coach, I have to go.

785
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,260
- What's wrong?
- Coach.

786
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,100
We have an emergency.

787
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,300
Wulan and I need to leave.

788
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,140
Go ahead.

789
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,460
Where are you going?

790
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,300
Coach, we also want to...

791
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,940
Train.

792
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,980
Here, the kebabs are ready.

793
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,820
Taste the seasoning.

794
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,540
Two beers, please.

795
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,220
- Sure.
- Auntie, I'll get them.

796
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,820
How is it? Tasty, right?

797
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,460
Please take a seat.

798
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,820
I'll bring the menu.

799
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,660
Here you go.

800
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,420
Here.

801
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,780
Take a look.

802
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,820
Anything else, Miss?

803
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,700
Order more. It's on me.

804
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,740
- Money's here.
- Coming.

805
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,660
Don't leave yet.

806
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,860
- Let's go.
- Excuse me.

807
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,140
What do you have here?

808
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,260
Give me a lobster.

809
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,860
A big one.

810
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,700
Well.

811
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,940
I'm sorry.

812
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,420
We're running low on stock today.

813
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,980
We're closing soon.

814
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,380
Maybe come back another day?

815
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,020
Come back another day?

816
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,500
I just sat down.

817
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,620
Are you asking me to leave?

818
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,180
That's not what I meant.

819
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,340
- It's just that...
- Ma'am.

820
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,940
This meat smells off.

821
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,860
Well.

822
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,700
Excuse me.

823
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,700
You can't be here.

824
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,740
Is your kitchen even clean?

825
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,300
Hey, this is our kitchen.

826
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,540
What's going on?

827
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,620
Who are you? Auntie,

828
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,780
- Are you okay?.
- I'm fine.

829
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,180
She fell on her own.

830
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,460
What's going on here?

831
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,340
What do you want?

832
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,180
We're closing for the day. Come back tomorrow.

833
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,620
I'm really sorry.

834
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,940
We just want to eat.

835
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,660
She fell on her own.

836
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,980
Yes, I fell on my own.

837
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,220
What's the problem? Just tell us.

838
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,780
You don't have to make a scene.

839
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,620
Wait a minute, Auntie.

840
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,140
You're Du Weilong.

841
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,980
Mo Xixi's boyfriend?

842
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,460
Who's Mo Xixi?

843
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,100
You must be mistaken.

844
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,860
We're just here to eat.

845
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,380
I don't care what you're here for.

846
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,660
You're not welcome here.

847
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,460
Not welcome?

848
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,980
You don't want your business?

849
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,740
Guys, you know what to do.

850
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,220
- Got it.
- If you...

851
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,540
What are you doing?

852
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,860
Stop it!

853
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,020
What are you doing?

854
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,460
Stop smashing things!

855
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,500
Stop!

856
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,780
- Stop!
- Stop it!

857
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,700
- Call the police!
- Call the police now!

858
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,980
Dafu BBQ.

859
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,140
Hurry and come.

860
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,940
Stop it! Stop!

861
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,100
Stop!

862
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,300
Stop it!

863
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,880
Stop smashing things!

864
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,780
What do you want?

865
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,020
Move aside!

866
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,110
What's going on?

867
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,020
They're trashing the place.

868
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,100
Your mom fell down.

869
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,260
- Duoduo!
- Mom!

870
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,140
Are you alright?

871
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,260
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

872
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,140
What's going on?

873
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,500
It was Mo Xixi's boyfriend,

874
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,620
who came to cause trouble.

875
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,780
- What do you want?
- Get your hands off!

876
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,820
Who's causing trouble?

877
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,740
I'm here to eat.

878
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,460
What do you mean?

879
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,500
Who told you to film this?

880
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,180
It's fine.

881
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,020
Let her film.

882
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,900
I'm a civilized person.

883
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,980
We came here to eat.

884
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,620
I didn't want it to be like this,

885
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,540
but my friend found out

886
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,100
that your food

887
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,580
isn't fresh.

888
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,540
Who says it's not fresh?

889
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,860
Our food is very fresh.

890
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,580
Whether our food is fresh or not is

891
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,500
none of your business.

892
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,620
Yeah, none of your business.

893
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,420
Of course. You open a shop.

894
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,580
If we get sick here, you are responsible.

895
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,260
Our shop doesn't welcome people like you.

896
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,740
Get out.

897
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,700
Go, go, go!

898
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,060
You...

899
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,580
We've called the police.

900
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,820
So noisy.

901
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,860
Fine.

902
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,740
We won't eat here today.

903
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,220
We'll go somewhere else.

904
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,140
But I'll be back

905
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,340
for lobster

906
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,140
and abalone.

907
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,500
- Who are they?
- Let's go.

908
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,820
If you're brave, don't leave!

909
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,860
Go, go, go!

910
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,570
- Don't come back.
- Hurry and go.

911
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,540
Go, all of you. Get out.

912
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

913
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,700
Are you okay from the fall?

914
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,620
I'm fine, really.

915
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,060
Isn't that Du Weilong?

916
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,220
Let's go in and take a look.

917
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:41,900
(Dafu BBQ)

918
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,700
What happened to your leg?

919
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,740
- Let me see.
- I'm fine.

920
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,540
What's wrong with your leg?

921
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,820
- Let me see.
- I'm fine.

922
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,700
- How did this happen?
- What's wrong?

923
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,980
Let me see what's wrong.

924
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,540
- Stay inside.
- Is your back okay?

925
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,740
Is your back alright, Mom?

926
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,980
Take her upstairs and treat it.

927
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,860
Disinfect it.

928
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,060
- I have medicine.
- Go.

929
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,580
- I'll help you.
- Auntie, be careful.

930
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,220
- Go slowly.
- Mom, you go slowly too.

931
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,820
Auntie, what are you doing?

932
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,980
Stay inside for now.

933
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,980
- Come on.
- I need to go check outside.

934
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,180
- Sit down.
- Have a seat.

935
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,100
Come on, sit down.

936
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,740
We will

937
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,060
clean up outside,

938
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,300
then we'll leave.

939
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,300
You should rest early.

940
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,020
Thanks to both of you today.

941
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,740
I'll treat you both to a meal next time.

942
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,500
- You're too kind.
- You're too kind.

943
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,420
It's our duty.

944
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,380
Don't worry, Auntie.

945
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,780
Go slowly. Watch your hands.

946
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,740
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

947
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,060
Can you handle it?

948
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,020
I can.

949
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,820
Hang in there. It might hurt a bit.

950
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,100
You're pretty skilled now.

951
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,420
Almost as good as me.

952
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,100
My dad was an athlete before.

953
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,500
I also play beach volleyball.

954
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,700
And being around you all the time,

955
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,740
I've learned by watching.

956
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,820
How about this?

957
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Be my apprentice.

958
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,340
I'll teach you everything I know
about medicine.

959
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,420
Stop teasing me.

960
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,900
I taught you beach volleyball.

961
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,140
So technically, I'm your master.

962
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,460
Forget it.

963
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,460
I don't want to be your master.

964
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,580
What?

965
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,500
I said I don't want to be your master.

966
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,780
Fine.

967
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,700
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

968
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,180
Are you taking revenge on me?

969
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,220
I didn't mean to.

970
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,260
Let me blow on it for you.

971
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,260
It will hurt less.

990
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,900
Let me ask you.

991
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,620
Who told you to do this?

992
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,420
Didn't you say it that day?

993
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,900
I was just standing up for you.

994
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,860
You said you wanted to trash the shop.

995
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,700
I...

996
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,260
I didn't mean it.

997
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,500
I was angry.

998
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,620
I didn't mean it.

999
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,740
Come on.

1000
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:31,370
You didn't mean it

1001
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,620
but I almost got arrested.

1002
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,460
Do you understand?

1003
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,940
Let's not talk about this for now.

1004
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,340
What are we going to do about this?

1005
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,180
Fine. I'll pay for it.

1006
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,940
But you have to make sure

1007
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,460
I don't end up in jail.

1008
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,140
- That's it, bye.
- You...

1009
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,260
Mo Xixi.

1010
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,380
- Duo.
- What do you mean?

1011
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,940
Why did your boyfriend do it?

1012
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,100
Duoduo.

1013
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,020
I'm sorry.

1014
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,620
I just found out about it.

1015
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,260
I already scolded him.

1016
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,620
Let me apologize

1017
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,460
on his behalf. I'm sorry.

1018
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,500
An apology won't fix this.

1019
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,180
I want to know what I did wrong

1020
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,180
to make you do this.

1021
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,700
No. It's not like that.

1022
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,380
You know, Du Weilong

1023
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,500
is a bit slow-witted,

1024
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,380
and he's got a rough demeanor.

1025
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,900
He heard Yan Xiaojing

1026
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,140
had diarrhea from improper diet,

1027
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,580
so he thought there was a problem

1028
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,860
with your barbecue.

1029
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,860
He acted impulsively

1030
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,260
and trashed the shop.

1031
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,940
Improper diet again?

1032
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,420
That excuse

1033
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,940
is too presumptuous.

1034
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,140
Many ate at our shop.

1035
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,700
Why did only Yan Xiaojing have diarrhea?

1036
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,180
There's nothing wrong with our food.

1037
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,660
Alright.

1038
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,740
Let's assume

1039
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,540
something was wrong with our food.

1040
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,460
You still had no right to do that.

1041
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,140
Duoduo,

1042
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,780
I honestly didn't know

1043
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,060
he was going to trash the shop.

1044
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,900
I would never have let him do it.

1045
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,020
How about this?

1046
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,740
We'll pay for all the damages.

1047
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,780
I'll make him apologize.

1048
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,020
I'll have him apologize at once.

1049
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,580
Compensation is a must,

1050
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,980
and Du Weilong

1051
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,220
will face the consequences.

1052
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,460
And

1053
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,580
I will get

1054
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,500
to the bottom of this

1055
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,420
and prove

1056
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,980
that nothing's wrong with our food.

1057
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,780
Duoduo!

1058
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,420
Liqiang,

1059
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,540
don't you have your own room?

1060
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,420
Why do you always hang out here?

1061
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,860
Oh, you're back?

1062
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,580
This is my dorm room.

1063
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,820
Why can't I come back?

1064
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,820
I thought you only cared

1065
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,260
about Dafu BBQ.

1066
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,740
How's Xiaojing doing now?

1067
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,660
Is she alright?

1068
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,980
She's fine now.

1069
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,460
She just needed fluids and medication.

1070
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,100
- She's all better now.
- That's good.

1071
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,980
Why do you still look so down?

1072
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,740
Bro.

1073
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,260
- Can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.

1074
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,020
Are all girls so extreme?

1075
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,740
If you're nice to them,

1076
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,340
they say you have no personality.

1077
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,820
If you're not nice,

1078
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,140
they say you're irresponsible.

1079
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,140
If you're neither hot nor cold,

1080
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,580
they say you're playing hard to get.

1081
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,060
If you're hot and cold,

1082
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,620
they say you're not serious enough.

1083
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,220
After you finally get together,

1084
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,460
they argue with you every few days.

1085
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,540
If you apologize,

1086
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,420
they say you're not sincere.

1087
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,740
If you don't apologize,

1088
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,700
they say you're rigid.

1089
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,140
They say you're a male chauvinist.

1090
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,700
Being a man is really hard.

1091
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,820
Liqiang,

1092
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,100
with your eloquence,

1093
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,140
it's a shame you're stuck in beach volleyball.

1094
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,380
Stand-up comedy is better.

1095
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,020
Stop making fun of me.

1096
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,900
I'm telling you.

1097
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,100
You'll go through this sooner or later.

1098
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,340
I'm going through it earlier than you.

1099
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,300
Girls

1100
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,260
are really strange.

1101
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,380
Wants to lose weight when she's so thin.

1102
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,140
Some slimming tea might cheer her up.

1103
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,340
Didn't Xiaojing get food poisoning?

1104
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,500
Still want to lose weight?

1105
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,420
You don't understand.

1106
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,500
Losing weight is a lifelong pursuit for girls.

1107
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,260
She was so happy when she drank

1108
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,660
Mo Xixi's slimming tea.

1109
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,580
She'll keep dong it

1110
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,540
once she gets better.

1111
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,020
What did you just say?

1112
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,900
She'll keep dong it?

1113
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,740
Before that.

1114
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,180
Slimming tea?

1115
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,020
What's this?

1116
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,500
Isn't this my slimming tea?

1117
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,780
The reason you had diarrhea

1118
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,900
wasn't caused by the barbecue

1119
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,980
at Duoduo's place

1120
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,900
but this slimming tea.

1121
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,260
No, when did I drink it?

1122
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,340
What are you doing? Stop it.

1123
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,460
This is my slimming tea.

1124
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,340
Here, take it.

1125
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,620
Is it that spicy?

1126
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,420
It's so spicy.

1127
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,180
This slimming tea

1128
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,020
contains orlistat.

1129
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,620
One of its side effects is diarrhea.
