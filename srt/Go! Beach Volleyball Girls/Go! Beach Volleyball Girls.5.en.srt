=Episode 5=

18
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,900
What exactly do you want, Chen Weilan?

19
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,180
Nothing much.

20
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,340
Your leg doesn't hurt anymore?

21
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,380
Did it hurt when I hit you just now?

22
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,460
I just came back to hit you and see.

23
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,500
So, what do you want to do today?

24
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,000
All of us will play with you three to the end.

25
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,780
I don't have time to come back
and play with you now.

26
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,060
I just called the school leaders

27
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,180
and the coach to come and see.

28
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,180
Some people are good at acting

29
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,900
but bad at playing ball,

30
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,140
and they love to bully others.

31
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,540
Fine,

32
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,540
you win.

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,220
You three better watch out.

34
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,420
Alright, Wenxin,

35
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,100
don't be sad.

36
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,260
I'll go with you to the coach

37
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,420
and explain things clearly.

38
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,280
After all,

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,660
we still need to continue training here.

40
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,860
Don't cry.

41
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,220
Thank you for your kindness.

42
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,980
Thank you for coming to help me today,

43
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,490
but I will never,

44
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,620
ever, ever play volleyball again.

45
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,660
- Wenxin, Wenxin.
- Don't chase her.

46
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,180
Let her be alone for a while.

47
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,660
Thank you.

48
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,900
Many thanks to you.

49
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,700
(Gymnasium)
I'll get it, I'll get it.

50
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,580
I'll help you.

51
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,460
Are you okay?

52
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,980
You didn't see it,

53
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,260
you missed a good show.

54
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Chen Weilan, she faced ten people alone

55
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,340
and scared them all. Can you believe it?

56
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,580
Really.

57
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,940
I was so worried, I'm glad you're okay.

58
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,780
But how will you get along

59
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,500
with them afterward?

60
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,620
It's fine.

61
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,620
I'll play my game, they'll play theirs.

62
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,140
Let's go.

63
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,060
I'll do it, I'll do it.

64
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,070
Let me take it.

65
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,340
You're my idol.

66
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,500
Here is your edamame and peanuts.

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,340
Hope to see you next time!

68
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,900
Lingling!

69
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,140
- Long time no see.
- Zhou.

70
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,460
Why don't you come to play with Duoduo anymore?

71
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,580
School started, too busy.

72
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,900
Xiuyun, hurry, Lingling is here!

73
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,300
Why are you standing outside? Come in!

74
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,220
I saw you were busy.

75
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,370
- Come, come, come.
- Quick.

76
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,780
- Take some to eat.
- Thank you, Zhou.

77
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,620
Alright.

78
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,860
Back to work.

79
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,900
Hello, uncle.

80
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,610
- Lingling is here.
- I brought some nutritional supplements.

81
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,060
You shouldn't have.

82
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,140
Your visit is already a favor.

83
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,460
Auntie, how have you been?

84
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,250
Did Duo bully you?

85
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,690
If she did, you tell me,

86
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,620
I'll beat her.

87
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,460
No,

88
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,450
we're fine.

89
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,300
Just busy with school starting and training.

90
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,220
- Let's train.
- Auntie.

91
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,430
Sorry I'm late.

92
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,420
Uncle, I'm here.

93
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,430
Did you take your blood pressure medicine?

94
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,900
No.

95
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,740
Shao Nian.

96
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,780
Shao Nian is like

97
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,290
half a son to me.

98
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,210
You haven't seen each other
for a long time, right?

99
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,290
I'll leave you alone.

100
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,420
I came to see

101
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,780
uncle and auntie,

102
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,340
nothing else.

103
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,500
Tu Lingling,

104
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,900
remember what you said that day.

105
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,860
Even if our relationship
can't go back to the way it was,

106
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,700
I don't want us to become enemies.

107
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,540
I agree,

108
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,980
otherwise, I wouldn't be here today.

109
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,780
Shao Nian,

110
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,820
do you come here to help every day?

111
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,940
Isn't your study very busy?

112
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,900
Busy as it is,

113
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,860
I still have some time.

114
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,980
Besides, studying medicine isn't my interest.

115
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,980
Studying medicine is great.

116
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,900
Studying medicine can...

117
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,740
That's enough.

118
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,260
It's getting late,

119
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,580
you should go back to school.

120
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,420
I'm going back to help out.

121
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,660
Shao Nian,

122
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,620
I don't care why you came here today,

123
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,400
but I hope the things that hurt Duoduo

124
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,700
won't happen again.

125
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,700
So many empty seats,

126
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,970
and you have to sit here?

127
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,410
I just chose to sit here on purpose.

128
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,420
You didn't go to training today?

129
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,580
None of your business.

130
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,420
If you don't go to training,

131
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,420
let's find the

132
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,380
real culprit of the video

133
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,390
after eating.

134
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,460
If you had spent the time
you used to bother me,

135
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,820
you would have found it yourself by now.

136
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,980
Isn't this our genius girl?

137
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,980
What's the matter, stopped training,

138
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,300
just wandering around the school?

139
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,180
Move aside.

140
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,380
Stand still.

141
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,620
I'm telling you,

142
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,900
Today, I'm deliberately targeting you.

143
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,790
I tripped you on purpose before, too.

144
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,870
Who told you to always outshine me?

145
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,460
If your skills are poor, don't blame others.

146
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,780
Just move away.

147
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,340
Xuewei.

148
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,480
Get out of the way.

149
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,220
- Are you okay?
- What are you doing?

150
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,380
Let go.

151
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,020
You're hitting people now, huh?

152
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,300
I'm recording this.

153
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,780
Let go.

154
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,290
Get out of here, all of you.

155
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,770
Gao Ge, what are you doing?

156
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,180
Don't you know it's her
who's causing you trouble?

157
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,570
Don't you understand?

158
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,000
I said, get out.

159
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,100
Leave.

160
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,700
Leave.

161
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,060
- How are you?
- How are you?

162
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,060
Are you okay?

163
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,140
Thank you.

164
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,180
No need, thanks.

165
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,540
- Come here.
- No, thanks.

166
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,970
Teacher, could you please adjust the video?

167
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,040
Yesterday's match video
of Chen Weilan and Song Xuewei.

168
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,140
Set the time to twelve minutes
and thirty-seven seconds.

169
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,900
And adjust the video to

170
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,020
15:16.

171
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,660
Song Xuewei,

172
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,800
explain this to me.

173
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,900
Coach,

174
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,260
I have nothing to explain.

175
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,300
It's just that her spike
was too powerful that day.

176
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,560
It made me fall.

177
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,940
Coach Wang,

178
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,300
listen to this.

179
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,660
(Standard recording)
I'm telling you,

180
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,280
today, I'm deliberately targeting you.

181
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,450
I tripped you on purpose before, too.

182
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,300
It's fault to always outshine me.

183
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,780
Song Xuewei,

184
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,420
you've gone too far.

185
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,660
From today onwards,

186
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,800
resume Chen Weilan's training.

187
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,100
You're suspended.

188
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,500
You'll receive a demerit.

189
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,820
And you guys,

190
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,640
from now on,

191
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,770
anyone who creates discord

192
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,400
will face the same consequences as her.

193
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,780
What are you still standing here for?

194
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,820
Go train.

195
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,900
Thank you.

196
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,500
How did you think of checking the surveillance?

197
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,860
I've been in school longer than you, after all.

198
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,990
That team has this kind of atmosphere.

199
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,420
But you,

200
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,820
you're still practicing here?

201
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,180
Of course.

202
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,340
Anyway, the coach has dealt with it.

203
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,260
They won't dare to do anything in the future.

204
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,980
Alright.

205
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,820
You decide for yourself.

206
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,300
By the way,

207
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,220
this shirt,

208
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,100
return it to me when it's convenient for you.

209
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,220
Thank you.

210
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,300
Chen Weilan,

211
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,300
what are you looking at?

212
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,620
Nothing.

213
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,660
Just went to take a shower.

214
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,820
We've all fought side by side,

215
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,340
and you're still so cold.

216
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,860
Why is it taking so long?

217
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,020
She'll come out soon perhaps.

218
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,590
Let's do this.

219
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,100
Go turn off the hot water valve over there.

220
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,620
I'll take a look.

221
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,500
(Adjusting the water flow)

222
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,220
Chen Weilan,

223
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,620
what are you doing?

224
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,980
(Adjusting the water flow)

225
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,980
Chen Weilan,

226
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,860
let me out.

227
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,740
Are you crazy? What do you mean?

228
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,340
Song Xuewei,

229
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,500
I'm telling you,

230
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,060
Today, we're even.

231
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,020
If you do this again,

232
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,060
it won't be this simple.

233
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,060
How does it feel to be bullied?

234
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,820
I'm telling you, this is the last time.

235
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,780
Don't do this again.

236
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,660
Xuewei.

237
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,500
How did they find out?

238
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,620
Hurry up and change your clothes.

239
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,900
High five.

240
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,820
Thank you.

241
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,540
How does it feel to partner with someone?

242
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,460
Isn't it great?

243
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,220
It's okay, I guess.

244
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,940
How did you know

245
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,420
they took my clothes?

246
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,900
I just went to take a shower.

247
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,740
I saw Zhang Xi take your coat and leave.

248
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,900
I guessed they had bad intentions.

249
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,380
Otherwise, you should just

250
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,060
leave the volleyball team.

251
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,340
Come join our beach volleyball team.

252
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,500
I'm not insisting

253
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,340
you come.

254
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,220
It's just that

255
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,780
if they keep this up,

256
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,620
it wll get worse.

257
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,020
I'm afraid you might get hurt.

258
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,180
I have to deal with

259
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,580
the volleyball team issues too.

260
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,980
Think about it.

261
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,300
Anyway, you're always welcome

262
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,140
on our beach volleyball team.

263
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,540
You look good in this outfit,

264
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,940
- I'll give it back to you.
- It's yours now.

265
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,300
It suits you, so wear it.

266
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,140
No, no, no.

267
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,140
This isn't my style.

268
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
You're doubting my taste.

269
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,700
Yes.

270
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,700
Immature.

271
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,780
You see that?

272
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,180
- Use the bottom of your palm to hit it.
- Okay.

273
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,340
You need to watch the height of your hit.

274
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,620
When you spike,

275
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,820
you need to be quick, accurate, and fierce.

276
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,920
Do it again.

277
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,780
Good.

278
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,300
Jing.

279
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,180
Thank you.

280
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,340
They are freshmen.

281
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,520
Not bad, right?

282
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,250
They played very well.

283
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,470
Beautiful.

284
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,820
- But that was a net touch.
- The height was a bit off.

285
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,900
They touched the net.

286
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,220
Net touch.

287
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,260
The previous net touch was not allowed.

288
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,860
- Okay.
- Good.

289
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,470
This is good.

290
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,620
The key is they didn't find

291
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,140
the right timing for coordination.

292
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,340
The takeoff timing needs to be right.

293
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,460
That's it, that's it.

294
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,380
Don't be hasty with your jump.

295
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,980
Find the right takeoff point.

296
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,220
And it'll be better, you know.

297
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,060
- Beautiful.
- Good shot.

298
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,780
Don't stir things up or make a fuss.

299
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,620
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

300
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,590
No worries. Let's focus on our game
and not worry about them.

301
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,860
Right, let's play our own game.

302
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,700
- Continue.
- Let's go.

303
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,780
Li Guoduo

304
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,420
is really clueless about romance.

305
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,860
With so many handsome guys
and pretty girls behind us,

306
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,180
what if there were rich and handsome guys?

307
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,540
Rich and handsome guys wouldn't

308
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,740
do such low-class things.

309
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,820
That's not the case.

310
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,180
Look, I'm here to watch the game.

311
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,140
They're not targeting you.

312
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,660
They're here for the freshmen.

313
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,250
- The one called Yang Jingxuan.
- You'll hurt yourself with fingertip touch.

314
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,540
If I get serious,

315
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,940
I can play really well too.

316
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,620
Good, you play well.

317
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,700
You're my little princess.

318
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,300
(Beach volleyball activity room)

319
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,290
The timing is still off.

320
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,220
You need to find the right timing.

321
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,940
- Then jump and spike.
- Good.

322
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,140
Do it like this, and take it slow.

323
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,940
Beautiful.

324
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,380
Don't hesitate when jumping.

325
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,420
When playing,

326
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,620
shoulders must be relaxed.

327
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,380
Xia is so cool.

328
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,860
If he played with Gao Ge, he'd be terrible.

329
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,740
Beautiful.

330
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:49,860
Hands must be relaxed.

331
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,060
Don't hesitate when jumping.

332
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,940
- Just jump straight.
- Good.

333
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,900
Hands must be relaxed.

334
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,740
Your shoulders must be relaxed

335
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,620
to hit harder.

336
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,700
Yes, shoulders must be relaxed.

337
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,580
Alright.

338
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,820
You see that, Jingxuan?

339
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,660
That's the way.

340
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,580
Keep going.

341
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,740
- Good job.
- Nice spike.

342
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,420
Chen Weilan,

343
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,620
Chen Weilan,

344
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,140
How did you get here?

345
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,300
What?

346
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,980
Your beach volleyball team
don't accept new members?

347
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,420
Are you joining our beach volleyball team?

348
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,220
That's great!

349
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,700
- Okay, you.
- That's great!

350
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,980
We warmly welcome Chen Weilan

351
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,100
officially joining our beach volleyball team.

352
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,180
Welcome.

353
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,180
Welcome.

354
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,260
Let me make an official introduction.

355
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,780
This is Chen Weilan, transferred
from Beijing No. 8 Middle School.

356
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,110
I'm sure everyone knows her.

357
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,020
Now, she's officially one of us.

358
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,530
We've become acquainted through a fight,

359
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,780
but now that the misunderstanding is cleared,

360
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,980
so welcome to

361
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,070
our beach volleyball team.

362
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,940
How come you seem to

363
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,820
know every girl?

364
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,060
You have quite a few stories.

365
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,110
No,

366
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,140
I don't have any stories with him.

367
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,420
How could there be any?

368
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,260
I'll chat with you later.

369
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,100
And Wenxin,

370
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,940
she is also welcome.

371
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,580
Now she's a member of us too.

372
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,420
Hello everyone,

373
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,380
welcome.

374
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,420
Thank you, Weilan.

375
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,640
She wanted to join

376
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,340
because she told me

377
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,940
not to give up what I like

378
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,340
just because of people I dislike.

379
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,340
So,

380
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,460
we came together.

381
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,340
Good for you, Li Guoduo.

382
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,340
You've managed to poach people

383
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,900
from the volleyball team.

384
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,860
And you poached two

385
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,860
in one go.

386
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,860
Coach Wang Dong must be furious with you.

387
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,860
Yeah,

388
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,060
Jingxuan and I were planning to

389
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,140
crash a volleyball class,

390
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,260
but now we can't go.

391
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,500
No need to go to the volleyball team anymore.

392
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,900
We both came, after all.

393
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,210
Let's go.

394
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,100
- OK.
- Is this how to hold the ball?

395
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,260
Yes.

396
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,860
Our beach volleyball team has finally thrived

397
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,740
under my leadership.

398
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,900
Stop flattering yourself.

399
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,500
Let me ask you,

400
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,220
have you earned enough credits?

401
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,900
Have you submitted your thesis proposal?

402
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,100
Have you found a placement
for your internship or job?

403
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,340
These three questions are soul-crushing.

404
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,540
I'm upset now.

405
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,700
You just can't let me
enjoy my success for a moment.

406
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,180
Little kid,

407
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,140
I'm telling you to face reality.

408
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,100
Reality is harsh.

409
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,180
Let's play some beach volleyball
to relieve stress.

410
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,740
- Quick, give me a ball.
- Pass the ball.

411
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,260
Xiuyun, your precious daughter is back.

412
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,060
- She's back.
- Duoduo, you're back.

413
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,260
You're quite skilled.

414
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,700
You actually know to come back.

415
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,860
If it weren't for Shao Nian helping me,

416
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,940
I'd have been exhausted.

417
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,540
A few days ago, Chen asked me

418
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,900
when I had another son.

419
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,650
He

420
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,820
doesn't feel like family at all.

421
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,230
How am I not like family?

422
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,740
Look at how much my demeanor resembles it now.

423
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,310
- Come on.
- If I had a son as you,

424
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,980
it would be luck earned over eight lifetimes.

425
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,300
Auntie,

426
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,780
a son-in-law is like half a son.

427
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,020
Why don't you

428
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,980
consider me?

429
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,980
Sure.

430
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,940
If you're willing, I can even
pay over the odds.

431
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,020
Of course I'm willing.

432
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,260
Hey, I'm still here, alive and well.

433
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,180
What's going on with you all?

434
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,620
Also,

435
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,220
my one and only crush

436
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,860
- is beach volleyball.
- Beach volleyball.

437
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,060
That's right.

438
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,820
You guys distracted me and I forgot.

439
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,700
I came to share some good news with you.

440
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,660
It's that Chen Weilan

441
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,620
has joined our beach volleyball team.

442
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,020
That's my idol.

443
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,420
- Chen Weilan.
- Really?

444
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,780
Isn't she a volleyball player?

445
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,940
If she joins your beach volleyball team,

446
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,460
Your might will double at least.

447
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,900
Yes, it's a surprise to me too.

448
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,340
I think it might be due to

449
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,300
my personal charm.

450
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,060
Of course,

451
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,060
to keep players on the team,

452
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,420
it's crucial to have strength.

453
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,740
Strength.

454
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,380
I think

455
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,180
you're far behind Chen Weilan.

456
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,860
If you don't work harder,

457
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,020
you definitely won't be able to keep her.

458
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,260
Can't you

459
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,830
avoid saying such discouraging things?

460
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,100
Our girl is so hardworking and excellent.

461
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,580
Right, Duoduo?

462
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,410
You see, to practice her jumps,

463
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,060
she hops around all day at school.

464
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,420
To build arm strength,

465
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,930
she even eats with sandbags strapped on.

466
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,500
Look how muscular her arms are now,

467
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
like a stick.

468
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,300
You haven't noticed the strengths of our girl.

469
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,580
Right, Duoduo?

470
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,980
She's my daughter.

471
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,460
How could I not know her?

472
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,340
Her ability hasn't improved,

473
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,180
but her confidence has skyrocketed.

474
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,140
It's gone through the roof.

475
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,420
Let me tell you, Li Guoduo,

476
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,220
your weaknesses are too obvious.

477
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,300
Even if you can jump high and spike,

478
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,020
your limitations in timing and speed

479
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,260
will hold you back.

480
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,100
And it will restrict you.

481
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,580
This isn't apparent in practice,

482
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,620
but once you're in a game,

483
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,500
any weakness will be magnified.

484
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,100
Duoduo, it's okay.

485
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,060
Do you understand?

486
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,420
If you don't improve yourself,

487
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,020
you'll affect your partner.

488
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,860
- No,
- I came

489
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,180
just tell you about this.

490
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
I have other matters at school,

491
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,540
so I'll leave now.

492
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,090
No, finish your meal before you leave.

493
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,500
Can't you talk to her nicely?

494
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,180
You upset her as soon as she came back.

495
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,900
I'm just stating the facts.

496
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,340
- It's for her own good.
- No.

497
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,420
Can't you be more considerate?

498
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,260
Don't be angry, don't be angry.

499
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,860
I'm also doing this for Duoduo's benefit.

500
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,740
Fine, your aunt has good manners.

501
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,580
I won't argue with him.

502
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,500
Li Guoduo,

503
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,060
your dad didn't mean it that way.

504
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,420
Come back for dinner tonight.

505
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,540
(Li Guoduo, your dad didn't mean it that way.
Come back for dinner tonight.)

506
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,690
We've recruited new members,

507
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,220
so we need to

508
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,300
reassign partners.

509
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,540
How will we distribute?

510
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,420
I have a plan.

511
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,060
This is a more scientific way to assign them.

512
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,740
Experienced members will mentor the new hands.

513
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,460
I won't interfere with the other members.

514
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,140
I will definitely team up with

515
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,460
Xixi.

516
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,420
Right.

517
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,540
Okay, that's fine.

518
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,020
Then Wenxin

519
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,220
and Chen Weilan,

520
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,540
since you both

521
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,620
have played indoor volleyball before,

522
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,900
you'll adapt to beach volleyball more easily.

523
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,860
That makes you two experienced players.

524
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,300
Am I an experienced or a new one?

525
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,140
I've played beach volleyball before.

526
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,780
Of course, you're a new hand.

527
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,420
- Wenxin, you'll be paired with Li Guoduo.
- Alright.

528
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,020
Then Chen Weilan, you'll
be paired with Yang Jingxuan.

529
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,500
Mo Xixi and Yan Xiaojing,

530
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,340
you two will stay as a team.

531
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,660
Does anyone have any objections
to this arrangement?

532
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,580
- No objections.
- No problem.

533
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,340
Alright, then let's start

534
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,380
a 2v2 match now

535
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,580
to see the strength of each team.

536
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,780
Xixi and I need to

537
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,460
submit our thesis proposal shortly,

538
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,380
so you guys start playing first.

539
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,300
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

540
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,020
Okay, let's all

541
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,860
get ready.

542
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,900
- Alright.
- Let's go.

543
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,260
We'll go and submit that proposal first.

544
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,620
- Okay.
- Let's go, let's go.

545
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,580
All the hard work
over the past days was worth it.

546
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,420
Finally won.

547
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,060
I'm making great progress, isn't it?

548
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,660
Don't get too smug.

549
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,820
I'm just not used to the sand.

550
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,780
Wenxin just started playing
beach volleyball too.

551
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,900
I played beach volleyball before
switching to indoor volleyball.

552
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,180
Just some basic skills.

553
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,380
Too modest.

554
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,820
Anyway, remember to help me.

555
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,980
I don't know anything.

556
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,060
No problem.

557
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:26,140
(Dafu BBQ)

558
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,300
- The cups are all washed.
- You have a new order.

559
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,220
Delivery.

560
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,860
With charcoal.

561
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,220
To be delivered to

562
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,140
Xingang University

563
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,460
Beach Volleyball Activity Room.

564
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,020
Isn't this Duoduo?

565
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,380
Duoduo must be

566
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,700
having the team eat skewers.

567
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,020
Just bring the people back.

568
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,460
Why all this fuss?

569
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,500
I'll call Duoduo.

570
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,340
Let's see what's going on.

571
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,620
I'll call her.

572
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,500
If she made the order, cancel it quickly.

573
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,870
All this trouble.

574
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,700
It's going to rain soon.

575
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,740
Check the weather.

576
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,820
Of course.

577
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,340
I heard senior Gao Ge plays ball really well.

578
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,420
Duoduo,

579
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,780
is this order yours?

580
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,180
Cancel it quickly.

581
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,780
Order?

582
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,380
I didn't place an order. How can I cancel it?

583
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,260
The order is already here.

584
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,220
Xingang University.

585
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,420
Beach Volleyball Activity Room.

586
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,340
How odd.

587
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,050
Hello? Hello?

588
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,460
What's going on?

589
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,340
Still not admitting it.

590
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,500
Hanging up on me.

591
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,340
What the hell!

592
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,460
This is getting ridiculous.

593
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,420
Maybe it's someone else's order

594
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,260
for their beach volleyball team.

595
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,860
Duoduo's team recently formed a

596
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,700
new beach volleyball team, right?

597
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,620
They might be celebrating.

598
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,100
Their teammates might have placed
the order without telling Duoduo

599
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,500
while also doing us a favor.

600
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,980
Besides, Uncle Li,

601
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,820
if there's money to be made, why not make it?

602
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,500
If they want skewers,

603
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,780
they can come and get them.

604
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,100
Why all this fuss?

605
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,180
How did you speak to me just now?

606
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,260
Let me tell you,

607
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,900
Li Guoduo is very stubborn.

608
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,260
She listens to everyone

609
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,700
but me.

610
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,700
Kids are all like this nowadays.

611
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,140
I don't listen to my mom either.

612
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,300
Is it because Uncle Li

613
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,500
was a beach volleyball coach before,

614
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,100
so they want you

615
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,380
to guide them?

616
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,580
Didn't Duoduo want you to be

617
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,420
a coach before?

618
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,860
Since there's nothing else to do,

619
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,860
just go and check it out.

620
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,700
All this fuss.

621
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,060
It's disrupting our business.

622
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,700
But I'm here.

623
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,220
Why is the barbecue grill so dirty?

624
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,900
Will it cause diarrhea if we eat it?

625
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,300
Yes, it's too dirty.

626
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,740
Girl, look.

627
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,140
The skewers are grilled on the rack.

628
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,340
It's clean, so don't worry.

629
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,620
What kind of meat is this?

630
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,820
It's not rat meat, is it?

631
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,100
No, don't talk nonsense.

632
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,780
This is lamb front leg meat.

633
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,860
It's the best for grilling.

634
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,060
- Right, Uncle Li?
- Yes.

635
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,500
This part is the most tender when grilled.

636
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,260
(Beach Volleyball Activity Room)
It's so sunny.

637
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,580
The weather feels nice to me.

638
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,580
The weather is fine.

639
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,460
It's just that the sun is a bit glaring.

640
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,260
Duoduo, this is
your family's barbecue, isn't it?

641
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,500
- Did you order it?
- I didn't order it.

642
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,700
How come you're treating us to barbecue?

643
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,340
I don't know what's going on.

644
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,580
What's the situation?

645
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,860
Dad.

646
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,540
Dad.

647
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,660
What are you doing here?

648
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,860
Duoduo, tell your classmates to wait a bit.

649
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,420
I'll have the barbecue ready soon.

650
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,500
Soon we can start eating.

651
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,020
Song Xuewei.

652
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,260
How come it's you again?

653
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,980
Dad, don't grill the barbecue for her.

654
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,180
She's just trying to annoy us.

655
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,020
Don't grill her the barbecue.

656
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,860
What do you mean, Li Guoduo?

657
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
I'm here to bring business to your place.

658
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,140
And you say this?

659
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,820
Be careful, or I'll give you a bad review.

660
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,400
Give you a bad review.

661
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,820
Don't give a bad review.

662
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,140
Girl,

663
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,500
let's talk nicely.

664
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,060
Dad, there's nothing to talk with her.

665
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,780
Leave.

666
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,780
Leave with your fellows.

667
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,700
Li Guoduo, what do you mean?

668
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,540
This activity room is for everyone,

669
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,020
not just for you alone.

670
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,300
Miss,

671
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,540
I'm the captain of the beach volleyball team.

672
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,340
I remember

673
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,380
you're the captain of
the indoor volleyball team.

674
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,580
Isn't it inappropriate for you

675
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,900
to grill here instead of your own venue?

676
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,140
We just wanted to have a beach barbecue today.

677
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,220
Of course it's here.

678
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,500
- Right.
- Besides,

679
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,420
your beach volleyball club
is about to disband, isn't it?

680
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,140
I heard your coach left.

681
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,580
What exactly do you want?

682
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,380
I came to do a social event

683
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,980
with my team.

684
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,060
I can't believe it.

685
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Your beach volleyball club
is left with so few people.

686
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,340
Right.

687
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,460
Outrageous!

688
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,740
Song Xuewei.

689
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,610
It's between us. Just come at me.

690
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,620
Don't disgust the people around me.

691
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,740
Isn't this Chen Weilan

692
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,380
who couldn't make it in our area?

693
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,060
That's true.

694
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,110
Don't go too far.

695
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,070
You are just jealous of her.

696
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,860
You'd better focus on practicing

697
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,430
rather than playing
dirty tricks behind the scenes.

698
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,580
Let me tell you.

699
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,420
You can't even beat me, not to mention her.

700
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,660
If you're capable,

701
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,100
play a fair and just match here.

702
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,190
The loser

703
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,310
should get lost quickly.

704
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,090
Fine.

705
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,140
Good.

706
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,210
Go for it.

707
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,180
Go for it.

708
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,270
Try your best.

709
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,980
- Come on.
- Let's go.

710
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,900
Nice shot.

711
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,220
- Wait a minute.
- What's going on here?

712
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,140
It should be our point.

713
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:51,990
Yes.

714
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,340
No, Duoduo attacked.

715
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,060
Then they blocked, and the ball went out.

716
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,260
That should be our point, right?

717
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,140
- Yes.
- Dad.

718
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,660
You're calling biased fouls.

719
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,660
That's our point.

720
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,420
If you don't respect the game rules,

721
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,380
I'll penalize you.

722
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,420
You'll lose directly.

723
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,820
Why are you helping her and not me?

724
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,820
Since you're participating in the match,

725
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,100
you must respect the rules
of competitive sports.

726
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,900
And now I'm the referee.

727
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,100
You can use the court

728
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,820
and the rules within the framework,

729
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,660
but you cannot violate the rules.

730
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,420
Dad, why are you doing this?

731
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,420
Li Guoduo,

732
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,260
don't bring emotions into it.

733
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,140
Play smart and try again.

734
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,380
It might be that Uncle Li
was sitting in a backlight position,

735
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,980
so he couldn't see the other side's hand
touching the ball.

736
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,940
That's why he called it in their favor.

737
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,500
This is also allowed within the rules.

738
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,300
Uncle Li is professional, after all.

739
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,250
Go for it.

740
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,140
Keep it up.

741
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,380
Come on.

742
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,700
- Good.

763
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,660
This is a court change, right?

764
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,100
Why, Dad? Why do we have to change?

765
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,980
The score hasn't reached yet.

766
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,500
It's because of the wind direction.

767
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,460
So,

768
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,580
during halftime,

769
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,180
- You can change courts.
- Why is that?

770
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,660
It's related to the wind direction,

771
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,500
so to ensure fairness,

772
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,370
the courts are swapped.

773
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,980
That way, we won't have a disadvantage.

774
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,980
Fair, Uncle Li is rather professional.

775
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,220
Go for it.

776
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,820
Dad.

777
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,300
It's okay.

778
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,420
Come over here.

779
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,460
Come on.

780
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,620
Go.

781
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,460
Nice shot, nice shot.

782
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,140
- Come on.
- Nice shot.

783
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,420
We won, we won.

784
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,900
Awesome.

785
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,180
Thank you.

786
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,140
You played really well just now.

787
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,040
Wasn't it particularly impressive?

788
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,140
- They were just like that.
- So impressive.

789
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,260
We defeated them instantly.

790
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,340
- You two are really something.
- It was too easy.

791
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,180
It was really good.

792
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,940
Let's take a break first.

793
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,020
You just got lucky.

794
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,540
I don't accept it.

795
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,140
Girl,

796
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,460
do you know

797
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,660
that you lost because of your unwillingness
to accept defeat?

798
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,660
I refuse to accept because of your daughter.

799
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,020
She doesn't have the strength
to compete with others,

800
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,270
so she tries to undermine others.

801
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,780
I will never accept this.

802
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,700
Your team already has many internal problems.

803
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,020
It will collapse sooner or later.

804
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,340
Who do you think the problem is?

805
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,380
I'm talking about you.

806
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,420
- You…
- Girl.

807
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,220
Listen to my advice.

808
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,420
You need to change your temperament.

809
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,820
You're too impatient,

810
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,380
overly eager to win,

811
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,740
and your ambitions are too high.

812
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,460
The match hasn't even started yet.

813
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,140
You've already lost, you know.

814
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,140
Also, when you spike,

815
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,980
you don't control your footwork well,

816
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,340
which easily leads to balls
going out of bounds.

817
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,740
Your passing speed is also slow,

818
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,940
which doesn't give your teammates enough time.

819
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,660
Instead, it gives the opponents
more time to prepare.

820
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,620
These are all your issues.

821
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,420
Think about it. Is my summary correct?

822
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,100
Uncle Li's analysis is so professional.

823
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,220
I didn't expect that.

824
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,860
If you think I'm right,

825
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,300
go home and practice hard.

826
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,540
If you think I'm wrong,

827
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,300
just forget whatever I said.

828
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,500
Turn a deaf ear to it.

829
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:09,970
Thank you.

830
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,920
I'll think about it when I get home.

831
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,490
Let's go.

832
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,260
Bye-bye. See you later.

833
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,020
Hope to see you again next time.

834
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,980
Let's go, we need to pack up.

835
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,420
Let's go, let's pack up.

836
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,380
Let's give a high five.

837
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,740
I'm your partner, you know.

838
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,180
And we won.

839
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,180
If it weren't for Wenxin not being here today,

840
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,420
I wouldn't be partnering with you.

841
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,180
Chen Weilan.

842
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,180
Can you say something nice?

843
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,020
Change clothes.

844
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,500
Li Guoduo.

845
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,900
Don't be arrogant.

846
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,460
You're still miles away.

847
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,750
Dad.

848
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,460
You've been a bit unfair today,

849
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,300
calling biased fouls.

850
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,340
But it doesn't matter.

851
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,460
We still won after all.

852
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,820
Look at Chen Weilan.

853
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,980
She's far better than you.

854
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,140
And she's not as cocky as you are.

855
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,020
Duoduo,

856
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,940
how should I handle this iron rack?

857
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,100
Don't be angry.

858
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,940
Uncle Li was very serious
while watching the match.

859
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,940
Think about it, if Uncle Li hadn't

860
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,740
told Chen Weilan to use the court's advantage,

861
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,860
you guys would have lost.

862
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,500
Is that so?

863
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,020
Of course, just ask them
if you don't believe me.

864
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,860
Right, Qiang?

865
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,260
Yes.

866
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,380
Move this first.

867
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,700
Not bad.

868
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:58,940
There's progress.

869
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,980
- Hey, Liangzi.
- Hello.

870
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,140
Oh, sister.

871
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,060
You never let me rest for a while.

872
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,940
How's your investigation going?

873
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,860
Let me tell you,

874
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,340
you can count on me.

875
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,300
I've found the IP address of the person
who posted the video.

876
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,820
Where is it?

877
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,220
Well,

878
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,460
specifically, it's in an Internet café.

879
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,500
That Internet café

880
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,540
must be able to trace

881
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,100
who used that computer, right?

882
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,940
Sister,

883
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,820
I'm not a police officer.

884
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,340
I don't have the real authority

885
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,940
to investigate them, right?

886
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,780
I'm not a hacker either.

887
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,060
Hacking into the Internet café is illegal.

888
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,060
So what should we do?

889
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,700
Do you remember that in the video,

890
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,740
there was a shadow?

891
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,620
Can you see it clearly?

892
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,220
Yes.

893
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,140
You saw it too.

894
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,260
But the shadow is too blurry,

895
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,420
it's impossible to make out.

896
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,540
I'll continue to help you investigate.

897
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,380
I'll let you know when I have news.

898
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,060
Okay, goodbye.

899
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,460
Chen Weilan.

900
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,540
Well,

901
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,660
Today, Xia showed me

902
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,540
your match video.

903
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,660
Not bad.

904
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,060
You've made some progress.

905
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,860
I have to leave now.

906
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,580
(Guoguo Duoduo: The beach volleyball
team dinner tonight, everyone come!)

907
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:47,380
(Dafu BBQ)

908
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,460
Duoduo, we have guests at home.

909
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,900
Yes, my teammates are coming today.

910
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,940
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

911
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,460
- Duoduo, you hand out the chopsticks, alright?
- Sure.

912
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,380
Dad,

913
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,100
all the teammates from the
beach volleyball teamare coming today.

914
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,180
Please help me prepare well.

915
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,180
Give me some respect.

916
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,820
Respect

917
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,420
is earned by oneself,

918
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,500
not given by others.

919
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,900
So, if I work hard at beach volleyball,

920
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,100
I'll be earning respect for myself, right?

921
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,420
But it doesn't help if you keep undermining me.

922
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,460
Maybe your own foundation isn't stable enough.

923
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,300
I think

924
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,980
you should stop with the beach volleyball team.

925
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,540
Studying hard is better than anything else.

926
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,160
Dad,

927
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,380
all you know is grilling kebabs.

928
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,340
Have you ever cared about me?

929
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,590
Duoduo,

930
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,780
how can you talk to your dad like that?

931
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,220
If I didn't grill kebabs,

932
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,540
where would your living expenses come from?

933
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,340
Let me tell you,

934
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,900
today, I've shown you enough respect.

935
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,340
Otherwise, I would have taken you back already.

936
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,940
Dad, this is not right.

937
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,700
Song Xuewei hit the ball out of bounds

938
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,420
yet you still called it in her favor.

939
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
That's a wrong call.

940
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,540
I'm the referee, not you.

941
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,140
I saw your performance clearly.

942
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,460
What did you see?

943
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,860
Can't you see my love for beach volleyball?

944
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,220
Can't you see my effort in beach volleyball?

945
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,180
I love playing beach volleyball so much,

946
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,940
and I've wanted you to
guide me since I was young.

947
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,020
You never helped me at all.

948
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,540
I came back with the trophy, excited,

949
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,900
and you don't even glance at me.

950
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,340
I don't understand.

951
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,260
Obviously, you played beach volleyball
since you were young,

952
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,300
and I followed in your footsteps.

953
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,570
Why do you want to stop me?

954
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,820
I'm stopping you?

955
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,060
Don't you know why?

956
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,340
I've told you so many times,

957
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:27,940
you have physical limitations.

958
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:29,270
Do you understand?

959
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,780
No matter how hard you try,

960
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,820
you won't be able to compete with others.

961
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,540
I know I have physical limitations,

962
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,700
but I'll work hard.

963
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,460
One day, I can beat everyone.

964
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,340
No matter how hard you work,

965
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,460
you can only reach others' starting line.

966
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,140
If you work hard, you'll improve,

967
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,700
but others also work hard and improve.

968
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,820
Right?

969
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,530
They are way ahead of you.
