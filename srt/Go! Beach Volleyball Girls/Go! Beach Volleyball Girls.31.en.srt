172
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,540
What is this?

173
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,540
Hand-drawn pictures.

174
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,800
They look good.

175
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,020
So alike.

176
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,380
You drew really well.

177
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
This is for you,

178
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,340
as a gift for winning the championship.

179
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,440

His drawings are so good.

183
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
They should be put online

184
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,900
for more people to see.

185
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,560
Good idea.

186
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,580
That's a great idea.

187
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,420
Good idea, good idea.

188
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,980
We'll post it online tomorrow.

189
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,680
Where will you post it?

190
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,460
Just to show it off.

191
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,200
My mom wouldn't let me go
to the celebration banquet.

192

today's newspaper.

is enjoying the process of the game, right?

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,840
Exactly.

244
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,100
What's wrong?

245
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,860
Don't tell me you've changed your mind.

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,460

I haven't changed my mind,

249
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,720
but do you think this trophy

250
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,860
is worth anything?

251
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,020
Can it compare to the old league?

252
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,200
What?

253
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,380
How can you say it's not worth anything?

254
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,580
This is a formal competition.

255
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,200
I won this championship trophy

256
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,560
with real skill.

257
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,620
Formal competition?

258
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,560
Then why didn't I

259
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,600
see any

260
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,440
well-known teams?

261
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,320
They don't even care to join

262
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,480
such competitions.

263
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,100

Xiaohong,

265
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,440
I think

266
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,900
we should listen to the child's opinion

267
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,520
and hear her thoughts.

268
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,080
Dad,

269
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,860
stop always siding with her.

270
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,180
She's still young and doesn't understand.

271
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,840
But she needs someone

272
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,060
to plan her life's path.

273
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,640
Stop looking.

274
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,420
I'm talking about you.

275
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,580
You've had your fun in the game.

276
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,540
Pack your things and come back

277
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,600
abroad with me.

278
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,600
Grandpa, my mom

279
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,280
never keeps her word,

280
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,500
going back on her promises.

281
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,660
You promised me!

282
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,080
Do I have to follow

283
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,060
the path you planned for me?

284
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,280
I like beach volleyball.

285
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,840
Can't I stay in the country and play?

286
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,580
Do I have to go abroad with you?

287
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,260
This is already decided.

288
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,560
No more discussion.

289
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,080
You've decided everything.

290
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,000

292
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,340
Dad, how come this child

293
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,300
is so uncooperative now?

294
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,380
It's trending. Duoduo, look!

295

297
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,860
I have to tell him.

298
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,580
My phone!

299
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,220

- Duoduo!

301
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,940
Did you see it?

302
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,560
I knew you could do it.

303
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,560
You succeeded!

304
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,540
I saw it.

305
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,900
Thanks for your encouragement.

306
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,120
Do you know that several media outlets

307
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,220
want to interview me now?

308
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,480
Come with me.

309
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,680
Sure.

310
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,960
By the way, before that,

311
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,180
I'd invite your mom to dinner.

312
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,680
Why?

313
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,460
- I'll arrange it.
- Okay.

314
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,540

316
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,800
This.

317
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,700
This will surely catch Shao Nian's eye.

318
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,200
But I'm meeting Shao Nian's mom.

319
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,340

320

321
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,140

322

You look

331
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,820
different today.

332
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,580
I dress like this when I'm not training.

333
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,480
Mom,

334
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,520
let's take our seats.

335
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,800
Let's go.

336
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,160

Come on, sit.

340

The dishes, please.

346

Mom, do you know?

347
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,690
Duoduo just won the new league championship.

348
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,560
Mom, do you know

349
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,440
how strong

350
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,700
the seven schools are?

351
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,360
It wasn't easy for Duoduo to win.

352
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
- Right, Duoduo?
- Yes.

353
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,840
It wasn't easy this time, Auntie.

354
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,400
And she got injured.

355
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,280
The match

356
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,420
was very intense.

357
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,080
Really, it wasn't easy.

358
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,920
Shao Nian.

359
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,520
Your drawing is great too.

360
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,600
On Weibo, it has

361
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,500
over 30 million views.

362
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,640
You've had followers.

363
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,000
- Not bad.
- Auntie.

364
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,220
Did Shao Nian tell you?

365
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,800
Is this why

366
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,900
you called me here today?

367
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,420
To talk about a new league championship

368
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,440
and online data?

369
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,540
What can it prove?

370
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,660
Wearing ill-fitting clothes and shoes,

371
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,660
dressing up as a lady,

372
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,860
does that prove you're the best?

373
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,240
Son,

374
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,720
what do you think?

375
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,740
I think it's great.

376
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,760
Auntie, what we've done

377
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,200
might not seem much to you,

378
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,480
but we put

379
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,880
all our effort into it.

380
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,140
We've proven ourselves.

381
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,200
Yes.

382
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,600
Alright.

383
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,880
I'll wait for you

384
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,180

As a new influencer,

387
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,460
what do you want to say the most?

388
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,860
I really want to thank someone.

389
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,540
Without her encouragement,

390
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,300
I might not have persisted until now.

391
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,360
I hope all my future works

392
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,580
will feature her.

I hope you continue

399
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,600
on this path and don't

402
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,160
I started drawing

403
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,640
after seeing Duoduo and Gao

404
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,580
playing volleyball.

and passion

00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,140
inspired me.

of a passionate volleyball girl.

410
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,120
I wanted to share

411
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
this passion and get

412
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,560
more people to love this sport.

- Why?
- Let me see.

- Hand it over.
- Give it to me.

509
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,960

I'm worried about Shao Nian.

521
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,840
Or should I

call the police?

523
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,500
You need evidence to do that.

524

Don't worry.

525
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,240

526

he won't come back.

about this.

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,200
about Shao's background?

553
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,520
Can you say the match results

554
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,680
have nothing to do with him?

555
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,860
Wait, wait, wait.

556
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,360
Can you stop asking questions

557

unrelated to the match?

558
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,600
Whether there was cheating

559
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,840
can be proven on the court.

00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,020
Li Guoduo wants to prove herself, right?

576
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,830
Go, Xingang!

577
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,100
Are you here to cheer for her?

578
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,410
Go, Xingang!

579
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,420
Have a seat, Mom.

580
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:28,440
Go, Xingang!

581
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:34,900
Go, Xingang!

582
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,840
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

583
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,480
Go, Xingang!

584
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,540
Go, Xingang!

585
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,500
Come on.

586
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,220
Go!

587
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:15,820
Go! Go! Go!

588
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,540
Tu!

589
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:48,890
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

590
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,400
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

591
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,660
Come on!

592
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,320
- Great shot!
- Beautiful!

593
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,900
Mom, what do you think of them?

594
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,150
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful. Great shot!

595
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,700
Come on!

596
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,220
Fantastic!

597
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,980
Look.

598
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,620
(Best wishes from Xinxin Hospital)

599
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,560
Duoduo!

600
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,280
- Beautiful!
- Beautiful!

601
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,120
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

602
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,080
Go, Xingang!

603
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,920
Go!

604
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,420
Come on, come on.

605
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,040
- Tu!
- Lingling, what's wrong?

606
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,340
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

607
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,380
- Doctor!
- Weilan, is your hand okay?

608
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,980
Go check! Go!

609
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,740
Doctor!

610
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,460
- Doctor!
- Doctor!

611
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,320
Weilan!

612
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,760
Weilan! How's your hand?

613
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,220
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

614
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,350
- Let me see.
- Doctor!

615
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,190
Doctor!

616
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,180
How is it?

617
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,400
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

618
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,260
- Should we go to the hospital?
- Let's go.

619
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,920
Does it hurt?

620
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,360
What to do now?

621
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,380
(Outpatient)

622
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,820
Injuries are common in this sport.

623
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,740
But the child suffers the most.

624
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,840
Don't add more pressure on her.

625
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,680
Okay?

626
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,840
Dad,

627
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,980
I'm not trying to pressure her.

628
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,920
I want her to choose

629
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,980
a better path in life.

630
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,220
If she had listened to me earlier,

631
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,780
this wouldn't have happened.

632
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,580
With her wrist injured like this,

633
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,980
who knows if she can play again?

634
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,400
Dad,

635
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,900
please don't interfere this time.

636
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,700
Weilan's coming with me.

637
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,100
I didn't expect this injury to be so serious.

638
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,240
It's my fault

639
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,260
for not stopping her.

640
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,040
Don't blame yourselves.

641
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,420
It was her own choice.

642
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,700
So, Chen Weilan is really leaving?

643
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,420
Chen Weilan?

644
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,600
Impossible.

645
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,120
Given her personality,

646
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,520
she won't listen to her mother.

647
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,460
Don't think too much.

648
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,320
Duoduo,

649
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,520
don't mention it

650
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,820
in front of Gao.

651
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,620
It's all my fault. I'm too blunt.

652
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,580
Go comfort him.

653
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,460
- Go comfort him now.
- I'll go.

654
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,400
Lingling?

655
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,240
You...

656
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,720
Why are you here?

657
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,860
Can't I come to keep you company?

658
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,920
Why are you alone?

659
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,100
No one with you?

660
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,580
If you're here to mock me,

661
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,140
there's no need.

662
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,760
You can leave.

663
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,500
Still so stubborn when sick.

664
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,060
No wonder you're not popular.

665
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,240
Hello, your delivery is here.

666
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,440
Okay, thank you.

667
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,660
- Good review.
- Thanks.

668
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,740
Try this chicken soup.

669
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,040
It might not

670
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,040
be as good as my mom's,

671
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,420
but it should still be good.

672
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,280
Hot.

673
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,860
Here, taste it.

674
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,860
Sorry, I forgot.

675
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,380
Try it. See if it's good.

676
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,660
I'll taste it first for you.

677
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,380
It's quite good. Here.

678
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,980
Now, you can really drink it.

679
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,470
How is it?

680
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,810
Your leg is injured, not your hands.

681
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,140
Hold it yourself.

682
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,250
You have hands. Use them.

683
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,180
Careful, it's hot. Hold it.

684
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,500
Drink slowly.

685
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,360
Duoduo,

686
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,440
why did you

687
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,300
come to see me?

688
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,900
I thought

689
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,520
you looked lonely

690
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,900
and pitiful.

691
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,300
You need someone to be with you.

692
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,420
And you took care of me during the match.

693
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,500
It's my turn to take care of you.

694
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,320
Oh my, look at this mess.

695
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,580
You didn't even clean up.

696
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,240
Eating all this junk food.

697
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,420
And so much of it.

698
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,800
But back when we were competing,

699
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,180
we loved eating this too.

700
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,820
It's tasty. I shouldn't lecture you.

701
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,200
You still like this flavor?

702
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,460
After all these years.

703
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,840
But you need

704
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,440
to cut down on junk food.

705
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,100
It's not healthy, you know?

706
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,220
Did you hear me? I'm talking to you.

707
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,000
I heard you.

708
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,660
If you heard, stop being stubborn.

709
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,160
From now on, tell me

710
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,060
what you want to eat.

711
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,820
Don't eat this stuff anymore.

712
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,740
I'll make chicken soup for you, okay?

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,860
Let me sleep a bit more.

765
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,900
You never used to sleep in.

766
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,020
Why are you getting lazier?

767
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,920
Your time management

768
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,460
is becoming a problem, you know?

769
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,620
Get up now.

770
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,880
Why are you talking so much?

771
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,220
Let me sleep a bit more.

772
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,080
I just started talking and you're complaining.

773
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,560
Do you know what time it is?

774
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,340
Breakfast time is over.

775
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,500
Did you hear me?

776
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,380
You want Grandpa to wait for you to eat?

777
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,900
Fine, sleep.

778
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,040
Morning.

779
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,240
Where are your manners,

780
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,580
making Grandpa wait for you?

781
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,040
It's okay.

782
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,240
My granddaughter must be tired

783
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,320
from the match.

784
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,360
Eat an egg.

785
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,460
Thanks, Grandpa.

786
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,800
Dad,

787
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,220
don't spoil her too much.

788
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,260
It's become a bad habit.

789
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,180
Once formed, it's hard to change.

790
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,040
She won't be able to do

791
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,940
anything properly in the future.

792
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,880
Let's eat first.

793
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,500
We can talk about this later.
