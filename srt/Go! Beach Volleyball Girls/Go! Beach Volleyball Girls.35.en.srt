18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,400
It's been so long.

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,900
Why hasn't the car arrived yet?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,880
I don't know.

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,360
The sun is so hot. It's unbearable.

22
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,380
It's been so long.

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,080
Yeah.

24
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,200
Coach Tian.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,260
How's your preparation?

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,860
We're about to depart.

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,880
You'll be soon? Alright.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,980
We'll meet at the base.

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,280
OK.

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,340
So hot.

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
- Duoduo.
- Right.

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,160
The car has been delayed for an hour.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,780
OK, I'll check again.

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,120
Hello?

35
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,900
- Mom, where are you?
- Get up.

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,400
OK. Hurry up.

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,460
We're running out of time.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,120
Alright. Bye-bye.

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,440
- Anxious?
- Soon.

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,020
They're at the gate. Five seconds.

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,920
Come on.

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,780
It's about time. Let's go.

43
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,720
It's here.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,940
- Here.
- Get in the car.

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,280
- It's arrived.
- After such a long wait.

46
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,120
Good.

47
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,480
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,640
Quick, quick, get in.

49
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,480
Hurry, hurry.

50
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,100
- Dafu, help them.
- I'll help.

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,960
Let the kids carry their own stuff.

52
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,240
- Keep up.
- Hurry, hurry.

53
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,120
Uncle, please go up.

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,440
- Thanks, Uncle.
- Thanks, Uncle.

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,760
- It's nothing.
- Come on.

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,860
- Sit here.
- Come on.

57
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,720
- There's one more.
- Be careful.

58
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,540
- Come on.
- Be careful.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,460
Xia, help out.

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,460
Help out. It's coming.

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,740
Thank you, Uncle.

62
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,080
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

63
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,480
Let's go. Hurry up.

64
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,320
Hurry. Hurry.

65
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,380
Close the door.

66
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
We're leaving.

67
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,640
I should sit in the front.

68
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,480
Sit tight.

69
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,600
Everyone knows

70
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,100
what this competition means.

71
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,560
You will be competing with the best players

72
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,540
in the country.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,140
All eyes will be on you.

74
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,920
This is the best time to test

75
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,080
your training results.

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,920
Of course,

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,240
I also know

78
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,380
this competition will be tough.

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,260
But I believe

80
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,120
you will showcase

81
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,140
the beach volleyball spirit
of Ocean University.

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,480
Do you have confidence?

83
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,320
Yes.

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,980
Go for it!

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,940
- Get ready.
- OK.

86
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,260
Get your luggage ready.

87
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
Jingxuan.

88
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,840
It's too hot.

89
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
Take it slow.

90
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,980
Here, have some water.

91
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,020
Here you go.

92
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,880
Thank you.

93
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,680
Drink slowly.

94
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,920
Jingxuan, hang in there.

95
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,340
We'll be there in half an hour.

96
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,560
No, it's still four or five hours.

97
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,800
What four or five hours?

98
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,380
We'll be there in half an hour.

99
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,460
Sorry. I tried to save money.

100
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,720
Why is this car so crappy?

101
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,400
Blame your dad. He didn't help me

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,380
while choosing cars.

103
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,540
I didn't have time for that.

104
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,740
You couldn't handle such a small thing.

105
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,920
As a woman, I don't

106
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,260
know how to choose a car.

107
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,060
Look how they suffer from the heat.

108
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,320
Jingxuan.

109
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,920
- She's throwing up.
- Stop the car.

110
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,460
- What's going on? Stop the car.
- Stop it.

111
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,420
Take it slow.

112
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,040
Are you okay?

113
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Go on.

114
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,900
Come on. Wipe yourself.

115
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,320
Here, drink some water.

116
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,900
Drink some water. You'll feel better.

117
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,500
Drink slowly.

118
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,180
Drink it.

119
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,760
She's suffering from the heat.

120
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,820
Drive it steadily.

121
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,660
Are you okay now?

122
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,320
Feeling better?

123
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,300
- Feeling better?
- Feeling better?

124
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,400
Are you okay?

125
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,480
Are you okay?

126
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,340
Feeling better?

127
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,100
If it's better, let's go.

128
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,820
- Let's go.
- Take it slow.

129
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,880
Let's go. Come on.

130
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,080
- Slow down.
- Be steady.

131
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,220
Don't need to drive fast.

132
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,220
OK, let's go.

133
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,980
Sir, drive.

134
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,640
Are you okay?

135
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,340
I'm fine, Auntie.

136
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,680
What's happening?

137
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,040
Seems it's the fuel pump.

138
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,900
It won't start.

139
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,860
Oh, no. It needs to be checked.

140
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,180
Check?

141
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,280
Gao Ge, Liqiang.

142
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,640
Set up a warning sign.

143
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,300
- Take out the toolbox.
- OK.

144
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,560
What's going on?

145
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,980
Alright. Don't make things worse.

146
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,420
Here, here. Uncle.

147
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,520
Open it.

148
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,100
Sir, what's wrong with the car?

149
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,820
Something's wrong with the wiring.

150
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,500
Can it be repaired?

151
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,680
How is it?

152
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,660
What's the issue?

153
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,020
The wiring has a problem.

154
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,980
It won't be fixed anytime soon.

155
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,400
Well.

156
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,500
What should we do?

157
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,600
With so many cars,

158
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,020
why did you rent such a crappy one?

159
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,580
They have to check in tomorrow.

160
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,640
You've made things worse.

161
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,680
Complaining now won't help.

162
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,720
Look at the car.

163
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,080
You need to fix it quickly.

164
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,200
Why are you sitting here?

165
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,160
It can't be fixed.

166
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,440
How can it not be fixed?

167
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,480
- Enough.
- Stop arguing.

168
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,600
Don't panic.

169
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,320
Let's think. There must be a way.

170
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,440
That's right. Please stop arguing.

171
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,620
Complaining is of no use.

172
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,800
- Yes.
- Two options.

173
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,160
Either fix the car quickly

174
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,240
or find another car to pick us up.

175
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
Decide quickly.

176
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,480
Lu, call the hotel where we're staying

177
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,080
and ask if they can

178
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,500
send a car to pick us up.

179
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,000
- Yes.
- Good idea.

180
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,140
- Yes.
- Makes sense.

181
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,560
Don't rush. Don't argue.

182
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,200
Hurry up.

183
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,280
- Don't rush.
- Right.

184
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,320
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

185
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,460
Hurry up.

186
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,520
Hello.

187
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,160
Yes. We are the team

188
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,500
from Xingang University.

189
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,420
Yes, we just set off from Xingang.

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,880
Our car broke down

191
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,800
on the way.

192
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,720
Can you send a car

193
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,140
from the hotel to pick us up?

194
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,460
Or it'll affect the league.

195
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,380
Sorry.

196
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,680
There's a landslide

197
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
ten kilometers ahead.

198
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,000
Our car can't get through.

199
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,060
You'll be on your own.

200
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,300
Alright, thank you.

201
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,400
What's the update?

202
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
What did they say?

203
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,840
- What?
- What did they say?

204
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,440
Ten kilometers ahead,

205
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,480
there's

206
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,500
a landslide.

207
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,680
- Landslide?
- We can't get through,

208
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,770
and neither can they.

209
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

210
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,860
So what now?

211
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,970
- You two.
- What to do?

212
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,880
Hurry and see if you

213
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,960
can flag down a car.

214
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,980
- Yes, quickly.
- OK.

215
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,900
It'll be dark soon.

216
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,920
Now, we're

217
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,220
on this suburban road.

218
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,080
There are no hotels

219
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
or inns around.

220
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,360
Where will we stay if we

221
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,300
spend the night here?

222
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,080
No way. Does that mean

223
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,580
we'll have to sleep on the road?

224
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,980
Sir, can the car be fixed?

225
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,760
Gao Ge,

226
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,240
what if there's no car?

227
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,020
We'll have to think of a solution.

228
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,180
This place...

229
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,480
Gao.

230
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,960
- Help me.
- OK.

231
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,800
Come here.

232
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,280
I'll do it.

233
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,060
- Ready? Come on.
- Three, two, one.

234
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,660
- Ready.
- Here.

235
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,200
Secure it well.

236
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,520
- Let me.
- Auntie, let me.

237
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,360
Come on.

238
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
Take it slowly.

239
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,840
Auntie, you've brought so much stuff.

240
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,900
You brought everything.

241
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,080
Not only did I bring a stove,

242
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,280
but also noodles.

243
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,020
And sauces, chili sauce.

244
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,760
You can have spicy food if you want.

245
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,080
You can have meat if you want.

246
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,180
- Good.
- Good.

247
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,800
Auntie, are you taking everything out?

248
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,040
Yeah. Take it out.

249
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
We'll have dinner soon.

250
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,320
- Good.
- Auntie,

251
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,440
you must have planned

252
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,400
for camping long ago.

253
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,240
Try it.

254
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,120
I checked.

255
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,960
Your hotel was too expensive.

256
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,680
There's a beach nearby.

257
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,260
I can set up the tent here,

258
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,120
so I can accompany Duo

259
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,780
and save some money.

260
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,640
My mom

261
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,620
is truly considerate.

262
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,680
Perfect. We can experience

263
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,520
camping in advance.

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Auntie, I want to eat pancakes.

265
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,540
Alright, I'll add salted duck eggs for you.

266
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,960
Getting fatter.

267
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,260
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

268
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,580
Auntie, you brought dried noodles.

269
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,880
Lift your legs.

270
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,140
I bought this. Try it.

271
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,600
Is it good?

272
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,680
A bit spicy.

273
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
Hurry. Bring the noodles.

274
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,140
The pot is boiling.

275
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,440
Coming.

276
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,300
Lift your legs.

277
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,000
Lift your legs.

278
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,660
Your arm movements.

279
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,380
Xia, control your frequency.

280
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,060
I want chips.

281
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,240
Yours.

282
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,420
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

283
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,360
Thank you.

284
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,980
Which round are we in?

285
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,580
Lying on the grass and looking at the stars.

286
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,220
So beautiful.

287
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,120
Yes, the starry sky room in the hotel

288
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,960
costs several hundred per night.

289
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,380
Auntie saved us money.

290
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,940
It's just a bit cramped with so many people.

291
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,320
It's Shao Nian.

292
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,360
Don't let him know we're staying in a tent.

293
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,980
- In case he nags again.
- OK.

294
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,560
Hello.

295
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,220
Hello.

296
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,740
Have you arrived?

297
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,180
Not yet. We're staying at a hotel on the way.

298
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,060
We'll reach the destination tomorrow.

299
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,520
That's not right.

300
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,600
According to the schedule,

301
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,960
you should have arrived by now.

302
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,540
How could you be at a hotel on the way?

303
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,660
The car broke down.

304
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,400
Don't worry.

305
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,940
We're all fine here.

306
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,600
I checked.

307
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,640
It's provincial highways.

308
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,740
How could there be a hotel?

309
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,460
That means you were wrong.

310
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,320
Look, we're not only staying at a hotel,

311
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,160
but it's a starry sky hotel.

312
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,000
See?

313
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,480
This isn't a hotel.

314
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,500
You're in the car.

315
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,840
The car is too small.

316
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,080
We're not staying in the car.

317
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,920
We're in a tent.

318
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,900

We didn't mean to.

322
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Who knew the car

323
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,360
would break down suddenly?

324
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,180
It was purely an accident.

325
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,700
Are you in the wilderness now?

326
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,340
How is it the wilderness?

327
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,600
Look. We're in a very high-end place.

328
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,520
This isn't the wilderness. It's camping.

329
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,880

330
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,740
They're so beautiful.

331
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,520
We can enjoy good food

332
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,440
while stargazing.

333
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,760
If only you were here too.

334
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,460

When you're done with the league,

339
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,500
I'll take you to see the stars.

340
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,900
Sounds good.

341
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,440

A hundred things?

344
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,320
Isn't that too many?

345
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,420
Can we get through all that?

346
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,740
That's not too many.

347
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,640
We'll be together for a lifetime,

348
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,240
so a hundred things aren't too many.

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,020
and family.

379
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,220
I'll provide you

380
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,780
with the best life.

381
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,060
But

382
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,740
after you went to college,

383
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,140
you did many things

384
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,940
that I didn't understand.

385
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,780
At first, I thought

386
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,860
you were having a rebellious phase.

387
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,380
I thought

388
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,300
if I loosened up a bit,

389
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,780
you'd understand

390
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,500
the value of life

391
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,980
after this phase.

392
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,260
But then

393
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,900
I realized

394
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,820
it wasn't a rebellious phase.

395
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,100
You've grown up.

396
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,380
You know what you want.

397
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,040
Mom.

398
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,420
I won't interfere

399
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,580
with your decisions,

400
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,620
but you must remember

401
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,980
one thing.

402
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,420
I'll always be your harbor.

403
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,780
Whether you fail

404
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,740
or face any pain,

405
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,860
my shoulder will always

406
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,580
be here for you.

407
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,260
Thank you, Mom.

408
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,060
Since you've chosen

409
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,100
what you want to do

410
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,740
and the girl you like,

411
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,140
pursue her boldly.

412
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,940
Don't let her down.

413
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,320
I also hope

414
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,340
you cherish your relationship with her.

415
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,020
I'll always bless you.

416
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,420
Mom, don't worry.

417
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,020
I know what I'm doing.

418
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,540
Is she doing okay?

419
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,540
Sort of.

420
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,560
If she wants to become a professional athlete,

421
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,500
these are things she must go through.

422
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,240
Yes.

423
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,520
Aren't there still two paintings

424
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,080
to send to the gallery?

425
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,920
Yes.

426
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,180
I had someone check.

427
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,960
The buyer this time is indeed

428
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,100
a well-known patron in your field.

429
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,780
I hope you seize this opportunity

430
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,720
and prove

431
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,690
that your choice was right.

432
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,320
Alright.

433
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,660
Pack up.

434
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,200
I'll go with you.

435
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,090
OK.

436
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,480
Mom.

437
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,020
Thank you.

438
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,520
Mom.

439
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,380
- Are they asleep?
- Yeah.

440
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,240
Mom,

441
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,440
why did you have to come

442
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,920
and accompany me to the league?

443
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,700
Are you afraid I won't take it seriously?

444
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,540
Being there for you during matches
was your dad's wish.

445
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,900
I never heard him say that.

446
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,760
You know your dad.

447
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,980
He never says it,
but you know what he's thinking.

448
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,700
He loves volleyball the most.

449
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,360
You know he loves volleyball,

450
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,120
but you still pick on him.

451
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,260
Does he have no pride?

452
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,720
It's normal for couples

453
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,900
to quarrel.

454
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,580
Look at you and Shao Nian.

455
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,720
You two have no life burdens,

456
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,860
but you still argue often.

457
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,200
Mom, Shao Nian and I

458
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,700
are just friends.

459
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,620
It's not the same as you and Dad.

460
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,040
Duo.

461
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,460
I think Shao Nian is a good kid.

462
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,520
Look how attentive he is to you.

463
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,140
He supports your volleyball.

464
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,120
Be good. Don't always be temperamental.

465
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,160
When did I act temperamental?

466
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,900
Why are you defending him?

467
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,260
Mom, I have something to tell you.

468
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,180
I understand everything you

469
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,780
and Dad have done.

470
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,120
Thank you.

471
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,060
Alright, stop being so sentimental.

472
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,020
Listen to me seriously.

473
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,420
Take the match

474
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,020
seriously.

475
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,640
Do it for your dad's sake.

476
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,500
Make up for his regrets over the years.

477
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,000
OK, I understand.

478
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,260
- Do it for your dad.
- OK.

479
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,300
You understand Dad the most.

480
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,760
What are you saying?

481
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,220
We've been married for so long.

482
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,460
Take the blanket away.

483
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,400
Mom.

484
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,900
I'm a bit worried about Duoduo.

485
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,060
The athletes will gather tomorrow,

486
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,340
but they're stuck on the road now.

487
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,900
I want to go check.

488
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,200
But you have planned

489
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,780
to go to the gallery.

490
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,540
What about your future?

491
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,040
Mom,

492
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,900
I think as long as I can paint,

493
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,820
I'll still meet a patron.

494
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
But the national league

495
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,300
is important for Duoduo.

496
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,720
Mom,

497
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,420
thank you for supporting me,

498
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,120
but this time

499
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,340
I must stay by her side.

500
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,180
Silly child.

501
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,000
Dad.

502
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,840
What are you doing?

503
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,180
Duoduo, still awake?

504
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,620
I ran a lap along this path.

505
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,260
The air is pretty good.

506
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,860
I feel so relaxed.

507
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,580
Dad, why did you run at night?

508
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,120
Are you nervous?

509
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,220
Nervous?

510
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,900
Why would I be nervous?

511
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,980
It's not me competing.

512
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,460
Drink some water and relax.

513
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,060
It's all my fault

514
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,340
for not checking the car beforehand

515
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,200
and getting you stuck here.

516
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,740
It's not your fault, Dad.

517
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,220
Don't blame yourself.

518
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,140
There will be a solution.

519
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,580
Coach Lu told me

520
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,160
that Weilan and I are still young

521
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,000
in our first year.

522
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,860
There's a long road ahead,

523
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,920
so this competition

524
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,940
doesn't mean anything.

525
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,000
Duoduo,

526
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,740
you've changed.

527
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,780
With your current mindset,

528
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,620
I believe you have the foundation

529
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,260
to become a professional player.

530
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,420
Dad, did I hear that right?

531
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,940
This is the first time you've said this to me.

532
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,580
Is it true?

533
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,740
But I can't make the decision for you.

534
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,980
The final decision

535
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,620
is up to you.

536
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,240
I do want to be

537
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,180
a professional player,

538
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,400
but I don't know

539
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,980
if I can achieve it.

540
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,060
I used to think it was impossible,

541
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,900
but since you joined the beach volleyball team,

542
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,980
your skills have greatly improved.

543
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,460
Your mindset

544
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,380
has also matured compared to before.

545
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,060
You've become sensitive.

546
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,420
Most importantly,

547
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,020
you haven't given up

548
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,980
on your passion.

549
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,100
That's the most valuable thing in life.

550
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,200
Duoduo,

551
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,240
remember.

552
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,260
No matter what happens,

553
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,140
I hope you can always

554
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,260
maintain this passion

555
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,380
in your heart.

556
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,740
It will guide you in the right direction.

557
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,720
Duoduo,

558
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,100
you are my continuation.

559
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,420
- Let me help you.
- This one.

560
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,060
Pack this up.

561
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,680
OK.

562
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,180
Yes. Put it there.

563
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,460
Let me tell everyone some good news.

564
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,640
The only way now

565
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,740
is to walk.

566
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,300
How long will it take?

567
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,940
I checked.

568
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,600
From here

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,880
to the landslide area

570
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,380
will take about four hours on foot.

571
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,340
Then we can take a car.

572
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,820
We should be able to reach the hotel
before nightfall.

573
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,920
How about that?

574
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,180
Any confidence?

575
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,960
- Yes.
- Sure.

00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

577
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,320
Great.

578
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,760
Let's hurry up

579
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
and get ready to set off.

580
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,800
- OK.
- OK.

581
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,640
Come on.

582
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,040

Hurry up.

588
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,700
Yeah, the scenery is pretty good.

589
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:30,400

Be careful.

593
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,480
Slow down, Duo.

594
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,340
Is it okay?

595
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,280
- Slow down.

Weilan, are you tired?

601
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,020
No, no.

602
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,740
(Welcome to the China League)

603
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,740
Can I interview you?

604
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,160
As a champion and a top seed

605
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,080
for the fans,

606
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,180
do you feel pressured?

607
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,500
We've participated in many matches.

608
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,900
When it comes

609
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,200
to pressure, I think

610
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,020
our opponents are under more pressure.

611
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,360
I heard that your old rival,

612
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,840
Chen Weilan, is also competing.

613
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,260
What do you have to say about that?

614
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,740
I have many opponents.

615
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,280
Chen Weilan

616
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,620
is just one of them.

617
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,760
Chen Weilan just won

618
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,960
the Xingang Seven-School League.

619
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,140
What's your opinion on that?

620
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,140
Are you asking me

621
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,780
what I think about the trophy?

622
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,560
To be honest,

623
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,040
I have many trophies at home,

624
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,980
so I don't have much of an opinion.

625
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,220
Chen Weilan and Li Guoduo.

626
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,360
- Can I interview you?
- Hello.

627
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,820
- May I interview you?
- Interview?

628
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,560
Sorry.

629
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,840
- Sorry, no.
- No interviews.

630
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,100
We're not doing interviews.

631
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,620
We meet again.

632
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,260
The scenery here is nice.

633
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,720
I hope you can hold on for a few more sets.

634
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,940
Enjoy your time here.

635
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,940
It would be a pity

636
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,100
if you only did a day trip.

637
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Whether it's a day trip

638
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,640
isn't up to you, is it?

639
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,140
It's up to the referee.

640
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,920
Why are you so chatty?

641
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,540
Are you good enough to fly?

642
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,400
Looks like

643
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,780
you're quite confident.

644
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,580
See you on the court.

645
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,600
Let's go.

646
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,920
Can I interview you?

647
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,340
Sorry. We're not doing interviews.

648
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,120
Why didn't you retort just now?

649
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,560
You're not an easy target.

650
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,620
Is it necessary?

651
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,580
You're pretty fierce.

652
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,240
Good luck on the court.

653
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,220
Of course.

654
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,500
Let's go. We'll check in.

655
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,880
Bro, it's all done.

656
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,720
Alright.

657
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,340
- Let's go.
- OK.

658
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,860
Let's go, everyone.

659
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,340
Don't run around.

660
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
- Take it.
- Rest assured.

661
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,700
- Don't run around.
- OK.

662
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,520
Coach Lu.

663
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,760
Coach Tian.

664
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,680
How about a long-awaited hug?

665
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,520
Be serious.

666
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,960
I am serious.

667
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,820
You really came.

668
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,040
Of course, I had to come.

669
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,960
I had to see you.

670
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,040
Were you missing me?

671
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,360
Just a reminder.

672
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,680
This is a public place.

673
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,780
Everyone here is either a player or a coach.

674
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm usually serious,

675
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,160
but not with you.

676
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,780
In 10 minutes, we'll start drawing lots.

677
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,640
The China University
Beach Volleyball Association

678
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,780
draw ceremony will now begin.

679
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,420
Where's Li Guoduo?

680
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,320
The director of the organizing committee,

681
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,280
Mr. Du Yuxuan,

682
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,580
will announce the drawing rules.

683
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,240
OK.

684
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,120
Now I'll announce

685
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,380
the competition rules.

686
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,600
According to the rules set

687
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,860
by the organizing committee,

688
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,080
we will divide all participating teams

689
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,660
into twenty groups,

690
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,580
with four teams per group.

691
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,940
The team with the most points in each group

692
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,980
will advance to the knockout stage.

693
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,680
Inside the drawing box,

694
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,880
there are twenty numbers

695
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,580
representing the group numbers.

696
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,000
Teams will be divided

697
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,560
into groups

698
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,420
according to the number drawn.

699
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,920
The drawing ceremony begins.

700
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,220
Proceed in an orderly manner.

701
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,560
Group C, Sports University.

702
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,400
I'll go.

703
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,700
You...

704
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,960
I'm rushing to the drawing.

705
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,000
I know, so I came here.

706
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,400
Drawing lots is a big deal.

707
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,960
You can't just rush in.

708
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,800
It determines the result in the knockout stage.

709
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,680
What should I do then?

710
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,520
- Come with me.
- Mom, I need to go.

711
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,440
- I gotta go.
- Hurry.

712
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,640
- Come on.
- Wait a minute.

713
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,880
- Come.
- Mom.

714
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,720
Hurry up.

715
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,540
Wash your hands.

716
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,040
There's more?

717
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,540
Get some good luck.

718
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,720
Oh, my gosh.

719
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
Li Guoduo, where did you go?

720
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,100
It's almost over.

721
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,160
It's too late. It's already started.

722
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,000
Wash your hands.

723
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,180
Wait a minute.

724
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,400
Good luck.

725
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,480
- How did it go?
- How was it?

726
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,520
Where did you go?

727
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,360
I...

728
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,180
It doesn't matter. What's the result?

729
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,580
What are the other three teams?

730
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,660
Petroleum, Medical, and Tu.

731
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,420
We're so lucky.

732
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,380
Yeah.

733
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,280
I didn't expect

734
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,580
we'd be in Group A with Tu Lingling.

735
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,540
I listened to my mom

736
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,840
and did

737
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,240
the incense ritual.

738
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,140
You know.

739
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,580
It really works.

740
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,400
Four teams in a group.

741
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,740
Only one can advance.

742
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,900
With our strength,

743
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,820
it's almost impossible.

744
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,220
How can this be?

745
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,440
We came to the national league

746
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,320
to shine, didn't we?

747
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,380
To shine means to compete with them.

748
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,320
So what's the problem?

749
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
What's there to fear?

750
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,160
Bring it on.

751
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,440
Really?

752
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,420
But if we lose,

753
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,620
we'll lose face.

754
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,580
Why not

755
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,100
choose to withdraw now?

756
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,000
No way.

757
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,900
No matter the possibility,

758
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,520
as long as we do our best,

759
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,780
we will have no regrets.

760
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,820
Keep a calm mindset. Do our best.

761
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,800
We can do this.

762
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,600
Be gentle.

763
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,540
We can do this.

764
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,360
Hurry up.

765
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,000
What are you doing?

766
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,960
Stop.

767
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,540
We're not trying to eavesdrop.

768
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,840
We want to check on you.

769
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,680
Exactly.

770
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,240
Defeating the Medical University

771
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,260
is a given.

772
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,320
You also have a good chance

773
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,800
against the Tu Lingling duo.

774
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,900
But if you encounter

775
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,560
the Lang Yueting duo,

776
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,520
it might be a bit hard.

777
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,900
Lang Yueting's skills are indeed strong.

778
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,630
I'm worried your mindset might collapse.

779
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,700
Yes. That's right.

780
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,880
Now it seems

781
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,080
you two have adjusted

782
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,290
your mindset well.

783
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,250
As expected of the team I trained.

784
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,170
Of course.

785
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,480
They have support from hang-time

786
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,770
and powerful spikes.

787
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,560
No need to worry about the Medical University.

788
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,190
With your current strength,

789
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,520
you can have a good match

790
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,620
with the Tu Long duo.

791
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,180
After talking so much,

792
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,020
do you just think we have no chance?

793
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,900
- No.
- No.

794
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,320
Just wait and see.

795
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,460
We will definitely advance.

796
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,380
If we lose, we'll act like dogs.

797
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,330
What are you standing around for?

798
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,760
Hurry up and eat.

799
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,360
Eating gives you energy for the game.

800
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,200
Yes.

801
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,560
I'm going to eat three big bowls.

802
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,400
Let's eat.

803
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,360
Come on.

804
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,710
Eating well gives you energy.

805
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,550
- Exactly.
- Right.

806
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,400
Actually,

807
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,180
I hoped you'd be in Group A.

808
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,620
Beach volleyball is a sport for the strong.

809
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,400
I know

810
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,280
you must be under a lot

811
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,260
of pressure.

812
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,720
I know.

813
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,780
Since the last Seven-School League,

814
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,420
there's been a lot of talk

815
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,160
that your previous win

816
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,180
might've been an easy one.

817
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,500
So being in Group A is a good thing.

818
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,400
Group A has strong rivals.

819
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,100
It's the best chance to prove yourselves.

820
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,500
Don't worry.

821
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,800
We will do our best.

822
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,220
Rest well tonight

823
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,800
and face tomorrow's game

824
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,940
in the best condition.

825
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,240
Yes, ma'am.

826
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,400
Understood. Coach.

827
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,040
Go back.

828
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,460
We'll head back and rest.

829
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,100
Be safe.

830
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,240
Don't run around.

831
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,080
Go to bed early.

832
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,340
Let's go.

833
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,740
I'll take a shower first.

834
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,220
(Shao Nian)

835
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,300
Li Guoduo.

836
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,340
Your phone's ringing.

837
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,980
Hello, Shao Nian.

838
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,140
Where's Duo? Why isn't she answering the phone?

839
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,040
She was just in the room.

840
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,140
Don't know where she went.

841
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,100
What are you doing here?

842
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,600
I guessed

843
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,340
you'd be here, so I came.

844
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,800
The competition is tomorrow.

845
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,940
It's a lie if I say

846
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,260
I'm not nervous.

847
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,600
But I really didn't expect

848
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,900
to be in the same group as you.

849
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,280
What?

850
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,260
Afraid to lose to me?

851
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,640
Forget it.

852
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,740
I'm afraid you will cry later.

853
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,740
After so much has happened,

854
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,100
I can't believe we can still get along.

855
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,420
Actually, we always could.

856
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,980
I missed too much.

857
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,200
Lingling.

858
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,700
I know what you're going to say.

859
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,700
Maybe we can't

860
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,100
go back to the past.

861
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,640
But

862
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,540
we can be rivals.

863
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,020
They always say let the past be the past,

864
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,900
but it's not so easy to forget.

865
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,480
It's just

866
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,220
that we've both grown.

867
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,520
Exactly.

868
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,040
In the last league,

869
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,380
neither of us won.

870
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
But this time...

871
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,260
I won't be lenient.

872
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,860
I will also give my all.

873
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,020
- Go for it.
- Go for it.

874
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,080
Coach Tian.

875
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,320
Sit down.

876
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,140
I understand the things you told me

877
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,720
to do this morning,

878
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,700
I'll follow through.

879
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,360
Xiaole,

880
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,740
you're good in every way,

881
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,540
but your efficiency is too poor.

882
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,380
You have no rhythm at all.

883
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,240
Yes, Coach Tian.

884
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,240
You're right about this.

885
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,200
I have this problem.

886
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,440
I understand.

887
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,280
Understand, huh?

888
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,500
If you do, why still call me Coach Tian?

889
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,680
Call me Tian.

890
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,160
OK.

891
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,140
I called my mom today.

892
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
She said

893
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,720
that 20 tables

894
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,700
are enough at our place.

895
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,920
Five tables for our colleagues.

896
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,100
How many tables do you need?

897
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,260
What do you mean?

898
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,120
Hold it.

899
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,640
Stand here.

900
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,800
Kneel.

901
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,760
Kneel.

902
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,280
Ask me if I'm willing. I say I am.

903
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,440
Tomorrow, buy a ring for me.

904
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,280
Got it?

905
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,760
About this?

906
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,780
Coach Tian.

907
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,940
I need to call my cousin about this.

908
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,500
- Go ahead.
- OK.

909
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,400
Come back.

910
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,060
Didn't I just talk about rhythm?

911
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,920
Forgot again?

912
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,620
What rhythm?

913
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,920
OK.

914
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,640
Wait for me.

915
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,120
Flowers.

916
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:14,920
Wait for me.

917
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,040
Hurry up.

918
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,200
Idiot.

919
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,820
(China League)

920
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,080
Welcome, everyone,

921
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,680
to the China University

922
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,120
Beach Volleyball Association.

923
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,580
The thrilling competition

924
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,360
in Group A

925
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,780
is about to begin.

926
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,100
Li Guoduo, you can do this.

927
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,910
- Li Guoduo.
- Go for it.

928
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,480
- It's okay.
- Scared?

929
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,320
No.

930
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,380
Xingang, go!

931
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,840
Xingang, go!

932
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,860
Li Guoduo, go!

933
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,880
(Go, Li Guoduo)

934
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,240
Say hello to everyone.

935
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,460
Li Guoduo, you're the best. Go for it.

936
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,320
Xingang, go!

937
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,440
Chen Weilan, go for it!

938
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,840
Xingang, go!

939
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,820
Go for it!

940
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,220
Xingang, go!

941
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,180
Xingang, go!

942
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,060
Xingang, go!

943
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,000
Go for it. Don't lose.

944
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,660
Xingang, go!

945
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,680
(From the beginning,)

946
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,560
(I've been surrounded by opposing voices)

947
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,040
(and unusual looks.)

948
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,120
