Xingang！

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,400
Welcome back, everyone,

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
to the Seven-School League!

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,520
The match is

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,180
still so exciting.

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,720
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

24
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,590
Go, Xingang!

25
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,430
Here!

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,370
Go, Xingang!

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:08,570

Go, Xingang!

31
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
Xingang team spiked!

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,040
They couldn't save it.

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,840
Xingang team ends the match.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,480
Congratulations to the Xingang team

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,860
for winning their first match!

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,040
Great job!

37
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,900
Well done!

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,340
Keep it up! Keep it up!

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,780
Great job! Great job!

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,840
The match is over.

41
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,960
Players from both teams

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,160
shake hands amicably.

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,880
As they say, friendship comes

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,720
before competition.

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,400
Still, congratulations to the Xingang team

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,040
on their first victory in this year's

47
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,060
Seven-School League.

48
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,280
(Cheers, Unity, Hard Work, Struggle)

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,240
- Awesome!
- Victory!

50
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,370
Xingang! Xingang! Xingang!

51
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,100
Duoduo, it's a shame

52
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,100
you can't play this time.

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,720
It's okay. I'm happy!

54
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,020
My teammates are there.

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,600
You have to work hard too.

56
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,240
You can't always cheer for others.

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,400
Isn't your match starting?

58
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,700
Yet you still have time for this?

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,520
Shao Nian,

60
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,340
you know our schedule well.

61
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,740
Make sure to cheer for us later!

62
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
Duoduo, keep working hard.

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,680
Don't just cheer for others.

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,540
Right.

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,520
I will.

66
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
Bye.

67
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,580
We're going to win.

68
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,680
What's with her?

69
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,660
Talking so sarcastically.

70
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,600
How does it feel

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,660
not being able to play?

72
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
Do you feel like you have

73
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,060
energy but nowhere to use it?

74
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,840
I wish I could be on the court,

75
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,940
playing against them.

76
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,000
Why can each school

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,580
only have one team?

78
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,080
I asked Gao about it early on.

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,240
He said that's how the league

80
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,400
has been set up

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,340
since the beginning.

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,680
Probably to make it

83
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,280
more exciting for the audience,

84
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,270
after seeing the best

85
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,900
from each university.

86
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,160
Weilan, it's all my fault.

87
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,400
You teamed up with me,

88
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,920
so you didn't get to play.

89
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,160
Don't overthink it.

90
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
You two just started teaming up.

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,880
Yan Xiaojing and Mo Xixi have

92
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,000
been together for 3 years.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,960
So they're more in sync.

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,480
Don't comfort me.

95
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,000
I know what I'm like.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
That's good.

97
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,260
Just work harder in training.

98
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,120
We have to train hard.

99
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Next time on the court,

100
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,620
it'll definitely be us two.

101
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,480
Still this court?

102
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,320
Why not?

103
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,420
Next year, we'll be on the national youth team.

104
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,520
- Keep working.
- Then in the NYT.

105
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,420
Keep working.

106
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,240
You're now watching

107
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,600
the second group match of the league.

108
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
Ocean University versus Medical University.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,680
The players are Tu Lingling, Long Ya,

110
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,140
and Zhang Hui, Zhao Dan.

111
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,960
Ocean University's two players

112
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,640
are this year's favorites to win the league.

113
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,440
How good are they really?

114
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,580
Let's focus on the court and find out.

115
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,810
Go!

116
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,180
Go!

117
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,020
Go!

118
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,760
Go!

119
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,000
What's with Tu Lingling?

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,920
It's an official match,

121
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,980
but she looks all slack.

122
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,680
They aren't taking it seriously.

123
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,140
Their blocking is half-hearted too.

124
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,040
Are they always like this?

125
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,140
Is this their usual tactic?

126
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,840
Go, Ocean!

127
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,620
Go, Ocean! Go, Ocean!

128
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,240
Go for it.

129
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,540
(Tian Qing)

130
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,810
Good job.

131
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,160
That was obvious.

132
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
Medical University's player
didn't spike it hard.

133
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,800
The angle wasn't tricky.

134
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,080
Long Ya didn't go for the ball.

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,500
She could have easily reached it.

136
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,220
It seems like they aren't

137
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,920
even trying to save the ball.

138
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,760
How could this happen

139
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,980
in an official match?

140
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,580
Could it be Coach Tian's strategy?

141
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,420
Let's keep watching.

142
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,620
The ball is over here.

143
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,860
The Ocean team attacks.

144
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,100
They score!

145
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,100
See? What a beautiful shot!

146
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,960
When Tu Lingling plays seriously,

147
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,420
she's incredibly strong.

148
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,680
Great shot!

149
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,380
(Feel the Passion)

150
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,900
That was a clear setup.

151
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,760
Medical University

152
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,140
seems to have no defense at all.

153
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,840
Medical University is very strong.

154
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,060
They won last year.

155
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,760
Really?

156
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,380
But they're being crushed.

157
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,620
Ocean University's Tu and Long duo,

158
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,800
as the only freshman duo this year,

159
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,260
are the dark horses of the league.

160
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,600
Their skills are impressive.

161
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,180
If they keep playing like this,

162
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,800
Xiaojing and Xixi

163
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,080
will really need to stay sharp.

164
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,660
We need to come up with a plan.

165
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,660
(Dafu BBQ)

166
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,500
Dafu, eat less.

167
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,200
Dafu.

168
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,980
Grill me some kebabs tonight, okay?

169
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,130
No problem.

170
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,300
What's on your mind?

171
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,340
Are you feeling inadequate

172
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,420
after watching those players today,

173
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,940
so you lost your appetite?

174
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,500
I've played against Tu Lingling before,

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
so I know

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,040
she hasn't shown all her skills.

177
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,880
She's holding back.

178
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,880
But I didn't expect her to improve

179
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,500
so much in just six months.

180
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,700
I saw it.

181
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,780
Lingling

182
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,460
has a lot of talent.

183
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,600
When you teamed up before,

184
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,540
you always relied on her offense.

185
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,880
If Weilan and I

186
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,980
entered the match,

187
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,480
we wouldn't be much stronger

188
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,340
than the Medical team.

189
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,580
Don't feel too discouraged.

190
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,100
Though you're not as good as Tu Lingling yet,

191
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,860
you've made a lot of progress

192
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,300
in the past six months.

193
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,920
Duo,

194
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,660
I brought you something to cheer you up.

195
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
What is it?

196
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,760
Look.

197
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,480
"Duoduo Will Win".

198
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,680
Isn't it cool

199
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,900
and motivating?

200
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,940
Here, try it on for me.

201
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,000
- No. You wear it.
- You try it.

202
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,920
It suits you better.

203
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
No, I made it for you.

204
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,000
You should wear it.

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,320
You're supposed to cheer me on,

206
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,600
so you should wear it!

207
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,920
If I wear it, I can't see it.

208
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,800
But if you wear it,

209
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,900
I'll feel inspired,

210
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,040
right?

211
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,980
That's true.

212
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,000
Alright.

213
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,240
Look, I prepared

214
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,560
these for your beach volleyball team,

215
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,640
whether they're playing or not.

216
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,480
So many.

217
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,040
- Mom.
- Let them try it.

218
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,460
This is too many and wasteful.

219
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,620
It's not wasteful.

220
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,220
I got sponsorship money.

221
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,440
Your daughter means

222
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,820
these clothes are too tacky.

223
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,260
Too tacky.

224
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
So tacky.

225
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,880
What?

226
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,260
These aren't tacky at all.

227
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,500
Your daughter has a better taste than you.

228
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,520
- Try it on.
- No, no.

229
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,600
I have to go back to school.

230
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,080
I have to get my things at the dorm.

231
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,100
This child.

232
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,120
I made one for you too. Try it on.

233
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,440
- Try it on.
- Please spare me.

234
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,520
- No.
- Spare me.

235
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,700
Just try it on.

236
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,440
Dafu doesn't want it. I do.

237
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,280
Give me one.

238
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,640
Alright. Wang, take yours too.

239
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,620
Come on, come on.

240
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,040
Weilan.

241
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,320
What's wrong? Who's chasing you?

242
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,360
It's good I ran fast.

243
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,280
My mom made clothes

244
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,880
for my dad and me.

245
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
They're too much.

246
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,580
She insisted I wear them.

247
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,000
You're just in time.

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
Let's watch Tu Lingling's match

249
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,760
carefully.

250
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,250
Did you say we'd lose?

251
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,490
- Who was it?
- So annoying.

252
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,430
- Come.
- Was it you?

253
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,270
Stay back.

254
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,240
Speechless now?

255
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,200
What's going on? Let go.

256
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,120
What are you doing?

257
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,010
- Nothing.
- Let go.

258
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,770
Stop bullying her. Let go.

259
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,360
What are you doing? What's wrong?

260
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,080
None of your business. Get out of here.

261
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,520
- Wait a minute.
- Are you okay?

262
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,980
Are you Sci-Tech students?

263
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,200
So what?

264
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,720
Sci-Tech students bullying

265
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,920
our Xingang students?

266
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,320
She was asking for it.

267
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,740
Yes, we're bullying her right here.

268
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,000
- So what?
- So what?

269
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,320
Don't forget, you're

270
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,920
at Xingang University's court.

271
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,460
You can't bully people on our turf.

272
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,120
We're bullying her here today.

273
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,220
- I'm telling you.
- Fine.

274
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,120
You can either leave now,

275
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,240
or I can call the security

276
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,960
to take you away, okay?

277
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,000
Go ahead and call.

278
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You won't scare us.

279
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,180
Call them.

280
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,540
You think we won't do it?

281
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,060
Have your school come pick you up.

282
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,020
Not leaving yet?

283
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,800
- Stop mouthing off.
- Get out.

284
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,680
Let's wait and see.

285
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,800
- Remember.
- Watch out.

286
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,720
Just go.

287
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,500
- No more nonsense.
- Security?

288
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,340
There are three outsiders here

289
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,690
bullying us on our beach volleyball team.

290
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,120
Are you okay?

291
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,860
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

292
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,140
Ignore them.

293
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,640
Come on.

294
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,400
- Thank you.
- Stop crying.

295
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,780
I'll head back to the dorm now.

296
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,780
These people are unbelievable.

297
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,840
Those three girls are really bold,

298
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,780
coming here to bully people.

299
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,220
I don't think it's that simple.

300
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,680
That girl looked like

301
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,500
it's not the first time she's been bullied.

302
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,120
They're unbelievable.

303
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,940
We can't let them keep getting away with it.

304
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,480
I think we should help her.

305
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,380
How?

306
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,280
You didn't even ask her name.

307
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,860
We don't know which department she's in.

308
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,560
We're at the same school.

309
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,100
I'm sure we'll run into her again.

310
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,400
Tu Lingling and Long Ya

311
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,900
are really strong now.

312
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,280
I'm a little worried

313
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,340
about Xiaojing and Xixi.

314
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,960
Their state

315
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,320
is always unstable.

316
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,860
Sometimes I can't figure them out.

317
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
So I want to watch Tu Lingling's videos to see

318
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
if we can find any

319
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,340
weaknesses to help them.

320
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,200
Look.

321
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,960
Tu Lingling's blocking

322
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,020
is so strong now.

323
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,460
And their serves are powerful.

324
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,700
The opponents never manage a stable reception.

325
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,240
So if the reception

326
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,320
isn't stable,

327
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,620
we have to rely on the setting.

328
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,740
At the right moment, adjust the angle

329
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
to create opportunities

330
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,080
for spiking or tipping.

331
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,920
See?

332
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,440
But the coach said

333
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,320
Xiaojing and Xixi

334
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,120
need to gain control of the serve.

335
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,920
If they don't,

336
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,380
they'll be restrained by the opponent's attack.

337
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,280
Look, look.

338
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,660
They always aim for diagonal shots.

339
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,000
If the defense isn't solid,

340
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,380
it's really tough.

341
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,300
I'm confident I can receive those shots.

342
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,860
If we were in this game,

343
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,380
we could try a one pass attack.

344
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,180
Look at Tu Lingling. She's great at blocking.

345
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,220
If she blocks,

346
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,680
I'll go for the set,

347
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,060
and you can attack.

348
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,020
As long as we fake her out,

349
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,880
we'll have a chance.

350
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,740
Spike or tip, whatever we want.

351
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,520
That's a good plan.

352
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,260
Let's train this way from now on.

353
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,920
Discussing with a top student is different.

354
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,040
So efficient.

355
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,900
I already feel stronger.

356
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,480
You play relying only on strength,

357
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,660
not using your brain.

358
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,280
Yes, yes, I know.

359
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,420
Top student.

360
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Watch carefully.

361
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,260
Tu Lingling

362
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,380
is good at blocking and defense.

363
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,540
I can do that too.

364
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,000
She's strong in offense too.

365
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,180
I can do that too.

366
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,560
Look.

367
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,400
She likes to hit diagonally on offense.

368
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,460
We must defend against it.

369
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,040
Alright.

370
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,920
You'll block.

371
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,900
I'll defend in the back.

372
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,940
Xiaojing, Xiaojing.

373
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,960
Yesterday, Weilan and I

374
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,560
watched the match video

375
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,880
of Long Ya and Tu Lingling.

376
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,240
We came up with a great strategy

377
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,120
that you can use

378
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,960
in your match.

379
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,440
Sweetie, it's Normal University today,

380
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,680
not Ocean University.

381
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,440
She got so excited when she heard

382
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,580
about Ocean University.

383
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,380
I know,

384
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,840
but I'm telling you early

385
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
so you can study it.

386
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,020
- Right?
- Yeah.

387
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,280
With Ocean University's strength,

388
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,500
they'll make it out of the group stage.

389
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,740
We'll use it.

390
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,740
- So...
- Go ahead.

391
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,200
I'll wipe this off.

392
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,500
- Go ahead.
- Here's the thing.

393
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,740
For example,

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,760
Long Ya is here.

395
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,600
Tu Lingling is there.

396
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,280
Long Ya is an offensive player,

397
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,340
and she's very strong...

398
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,200
The match is about to start.

399
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,680
What did you tell them?

400
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,200
I was discussing strategy with them.

401
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
After today's match,

402
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,120
we'll go back to train,

403
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,120
figuring out our next steps.

404
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,240
- Over there.
- Alright.

405
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,280
Jingxuan saved us seats.

406
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,620
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

407
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,120
Let's go.

408
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,460
(Beach Volleyball Activity Room)

409
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,240
First, let's congratulate Xiaojing and Xixi

410
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,140
for winning the match
against Normal University.

411
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,440
Thank you, everyone.

412
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,580
Congratulations!

413
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,360
Keep up the good work.

414
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,300
Don't get complacent.

415
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,640
Make sure to save some experience

416
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,820
for the next match against Tech University.

417
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,560
We all know that Tech University

418
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,920
has powerful players

419
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,440
with strong physical abilities.

420
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,800
So, I think you should be prepared

421
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,440
for more than three sets.

422
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,120
Save some energy

423
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,590
and finish them off

424
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,240
in the final set,

425
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,500
surprising them.

426
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,930
I think

427
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,480
they like to play fast

428
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,000
and often hit diagonal shots.

429
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,680
You two need to be aware of the defense

430
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,210
and make sure to cover that area.

431
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,880
Don't ignore the straight shots.

432
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,960
So, it will depend

433
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,740
on your teamwork.

434
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,360
Defense is crucial

435
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,880
against them.

436
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,860
Focus on it.

437
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,960
Absolutely.

438
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,680
Then, the next match

439
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,600
will be against Medical University.

440
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,720
Medical University.

441
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,920
Medical's players

442
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,440
have been playing for many years.

443
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
That's why

444
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,560
their coordination

445
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,060
is very good.

446
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,000
You need to be wary.

447
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,540
I believe you two can handle it.

448
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,140
No problem.

449
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,700
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

450
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,220
Welcome the secretary general of the league.

451
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,440
You called me here

452
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,180
because I kicked you out, didn't you?

453
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,200
Are you here

454
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,020
because of guilt?

455
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,300
I feel guilty?

456
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,220
It's you who's being petty.

457
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,040
I'm not a petty person.

458
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,320
I've forgiven you

459
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,540
for everything you've done.

460
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,060
What did I do that needs your forgiveness?

461
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,340
Oh, nothing much.

462
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,060
Just that you brought in my brother,

463
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,640
exposing my role as a coach.

464
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,480
Right?

465
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,520
And you took away my ads

466
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,080
and sponsorship

467
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,600
and kicked me out of the court.

468
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,440
Right?

469
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,780
I'm really not a petty person.

470
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,220
It seems I shouldn't have come.

471
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,120
I heard

472
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,400
you remodeled their activity room

473
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,940
to make up for your mistakes.

474
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,740
I felt touched,

475
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,680
thinking I had judged you

476
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,860
too harshly.

477
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,280
But you're blaming me

478
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,500
right off the bat.

479
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,320
Let's stick to beach volleyball

480
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,980
and keep our distance.

481
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,580
Coach Tian,

482
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,640
it's all a misunderstanding.

483
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,080
I went overboard with my attitude.

484
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,680
My feelings for you are as clear as day.

485
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,910
I'll do whatever you want.

486
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,760
Hello?

487
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,640
Coach Tian! Something's happened!

488
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,660
What is it?

489
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,080
There's a big fight

490
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,300
at the Xingang University.

491
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,840
Stay put and wait for me.

492
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,130
- Take care of yourself.
- Okay.

493
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,040
- What's going on?
- Students are fighting.

494
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,160
Wait. Let's go together.

495
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,620
Come on. The bill, please.

496
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,900
Stop fighting!

497
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,340
- You bullied us, huh?
- Stop!

498
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,320
- Stop it!
- Move aside!

499
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,120
- Stop!
- Stop fighting!

500
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,000
Stop fighting!

501
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,020
Try it again.

502
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,120
If you bully people again...

503
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,440
- Stop!
- What's wrong?

504
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,200
- Stop!
- What's going on?

505
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,720
Stop! Put that down!

506
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,740
Stop fighting!

507
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,360
- Stop!
- Pushed me?

508
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,760
- Stop fighting!
- Let go!

509
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,680
Let go!

510
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,740
Stop it!

511
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,060
Stop fighting!

512
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,760
What are you doing?

513
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,880
Stop it!

514
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,980
What are you doing?

515
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,100
What are you doing?

516
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,980
Is your hand okay?

517
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,400
Are you alright?

518
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,740
- I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

519
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,420
I'm fine. I'm fine.

520
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,020
Are you still students?

521
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,940
Is anyone hurt?

522
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,220
What do you all think you're doing?

523
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,120
You're students

524
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,220
and athletes.

525
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,100
If you have issues, settle them on the court.

526
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,600
Do you want

527
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,220
to be disciplined or expelled?

528
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,720
Are you alright?

529
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,020
I'm fine. Don't worry.

530
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,620
It's you again.

531
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,340
It's you again.

532
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,440
Your suspension

533
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,720
was just lifted,

534
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,440
and now you're leading a fight,

535
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,140
dragging the entire team with you.

536
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,480
What do you have

537
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,700
to say for yourself this time?

538
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,600
Secretary,

539
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,020
please don't be angry.

540
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,320
It really wasn't our fault.

541
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,980
They brought people to attack the team.

542
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,280
We only acted

543
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,340
to protect our teammates.

544
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,400
Is that really the case?

545
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,940
It is, absolutely.

546
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,620
Alright, you can go back now.

547
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,980
We'll investigate

548
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,960
what really happened.

549
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,140
Thank you, Secretary.

550
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,640
Coach, we've checked everything.

551
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,280
- Alright, go rest early.
- Okay.

552
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,820
Why did you come here?

553
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,480
Why did you

554
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,700
make such a big fuss?

555
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,180
Now our school's administration

556
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,300
knows about the fight.

557
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,980
Is that what you're talking about?

558
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,960
Your students are too aggressive.

559
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,580
They don't take care of themselves.

560
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,640
Besides,

561
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,060
you didn't take it seriously.

562
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,720
If the administration

563
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,400
can make you take this seriously,

564
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,500
I think it's a good thing.

565
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,180
So it was you who did this?

566
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,600
Are we supposed

567
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,760
to just stand by

568
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,540
while they hit us?

569
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,780
But fighting is wrong.

570
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,500
Students are impulsive.

571
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,640
But they're adults now.

572
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,180
They must handle problems calmly and maturely.

573
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,060
Calm and mature?

574
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,480
So, you like someone

575
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,420
calm and mature, huh?

576
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,420
No wonder...

577
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,700
Anything else?

578
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,080
No, nothing.

579
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,920
Alright, let's go.

580
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
(To Secretary Zhou:
Gao Ge fought again.)

581
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,020
What did the secretary want to know?

582
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,580
Nothing major.

583
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,160
Just asked about the incident

584
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,300
with the Sci-Tech students.

585
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,260
He's not going

586
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,220
to suspend you again, is he?

587
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
No.

588
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,320
I told him it was

589
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,060
the other group that provoked us first.

590
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,540
He'll find out the truth.

591
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,860
I hope so.

592
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,180
How's your wrist? Still hurting?

593
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,180
Yeah, it hurts.

594
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,140
Come on.

595
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,000
Your wrist was injured before.

596
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,180
You should be more careful.

597
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,100
And you,

598
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,080
knowing how dangerous it was,

599
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,460
still rushed in.

600
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,840
I did it for...

601
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,740
For what?

602
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,260
For nothing.

603
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,700
No.5, Chen Weilan.

604
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,880
Room 6, please.

605
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,860
I'll head in.

606
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,580
- What food do you want?
- Thank you

607
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,920
- Dumplings?
- for the internship.

608
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,840
- Let's go.
- Mrs. Shao.

609
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,060
- Sure.
- Let's go.

610
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,260
It's nothing.

611
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,040
I still need your help

612
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,160
with my son.

613
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,180
Of course.

614
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,540
His girlfriend is nice.

615
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,700
Ever since she came to the medical school,

616
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,850
Shao Nian's attendance has improved.

617
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,140
Girlfriend?

618
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,200
She's my son's girlfriend?

619
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,620
Yeah.

620
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,840
You didn't know?

621
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,460
Sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.

622
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,040
But now that I've mentioned it,

623
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,280
I'll finish it.

624
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,420
I think

625
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,080
you should

626
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,120
give him some space.

627
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,480
Let them develop freely.

628
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,060
I can give him space in most things,

629
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,000
but when it comes

630
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,640
to choosing a girlfriend

631
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,540
and his future career,

632
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,200
I won't let him

633
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,340
go his own way.

634
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,680
This way, please.

635
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,680
Your food is ready.

636
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,520
Thank you.

637
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,200
What did the doctor say?

638
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,460
What else?

639
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,840
Just told me to rest.

640
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,820
I'll take care of myself.

641
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,480
You...

642
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,540
Let me see the X-ray.

643
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,280
What exactly is

644
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,120
the problem?

645
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,600
Give it back.

646
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,760
What's the issue?

647
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,840
Can you understand it

648
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,140
just by looking at the X-ray?

649
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,960
No, I can't.

650
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,340
But Shao Nian is studying medicine.

651
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,360
I can give it to him.

652
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,290
He knows professors,

653
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,170
like in orthopedics...

654
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,660
No, don't trouble others.

655
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,260
How can it be a bother when it's family?

656
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,920
Chen Weilan, listen.

657
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,160
You're not taking it seriously.

658
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,180
I told you before.

659
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,900
For an athlete,

660
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,000
an injury

661
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,980
can end their career.

662
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,040
What if it gets worse?

663
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,380
Can you still play?

664
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,240
Even if you can play,

665
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,260
how about

666
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,860
your performance?

667
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,440
If you don't dare to spike,

668
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,540
how can you play well?

669
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,100
Please listen to me.

670
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,960
We're all athletes.

671
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,060
I've been injured before.

672
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,820
In my high school league,

673
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,340
I was injured.

674
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,120
I sat on the bench,

675
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
watching my teammates

676
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,020
play.

677
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,880
Do you know how painful that was?

678
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,680
I'll never forget the way

679
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,140
the coach looked at me.

680
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,680
You know

681
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,060
my skill level, right?

682
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,900
If I could have played,

683
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,240
we would've won the championship easily.

684
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,080
But what happened?

685
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,280
We got second place.

686
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,220
Don't give me that look.

687
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,080
I'm talking about your wrist.

688
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,440
This needs to be solved.

689
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,340
You understand?

690
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,820
Bro, you've been talking non-stop.

691
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,940
Did I say I wouldn't deal with it?

692
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,520
This injury needs to be treated and healed.

693
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,780
Do you think it will get better instantly?

694
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,100
You insist on taking me to eat trotters.

695
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,380
Here, have one.

696
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,500
See? I can use my left hand too.

697
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,460
Enough already.

698
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,720
I'll get it for you.

699
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,120
Enjoy your meal.

700
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,460
It's on me.

701
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,820
Thank you.

702
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,340
Take it.

703
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,500
Hello, Liangzi.

704
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,040
Nothing.

705
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,440
I went to the hospital and got an X-ray.

706
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,460
The doctor said I needed to rest well.

707
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,380
Send it to you?

708
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,120
No, no.

709
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,160
I'll take a picture

710
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,660
and send it to you, okay?

711
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,940
Don't worry.

712
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,820
Alright, bye-bye.

713
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,020
Is that the guy who fought with me?

714
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,740
He seems to care a lot.

715
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,240
He's my childhood friend.

716
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,360
We've grown up together.

717
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,780
Of course, he cares about me.

718
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,460
He doesn't have any common sense.

719
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,580
You can't send this to Beijing.

720
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,380
You'll have to retake it there.

721
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,820
I'll go get some drinks.

722
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,460
What?

723
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,720
Come in.

724
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,100
- Chen Weilan.
- Secretary Zhou.

725
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,420
Have a seat.

726
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,800
Secretary Zhou, I came to talk to you

727
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,540
about Gao Ge's situation.

728
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,100
About the fight with Sci-Tech students?

729
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,200
Yes.

730
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,480
Actually, that day was like this.

731
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,440
Their students

732
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,120
started provoking us.

733
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,200
They had more people

734
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,400
and rushed at us.

735
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,520
That's why everyone joined in.

736
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,640
Gao Ge just happened to be at the front.

737
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,360
It wasn't entirely his fault.

738
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,340
Chen Weilan,

739
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,480
I didn't expect

740
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,500
to hear this from you.

741
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,500
You're quite loyal,

742
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,940
coming here

743
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,540
to defend your teammate.

744
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,200
Because we made the mistake together.

745
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,040
- OK.
- I think...

746
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,200
I've already told Gao Ge.

747
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,180
The school will investigate thoroughly.

748
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,940
But this matter

749
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,100
is difficult,

750
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,520
as it involves students

751
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,900
from two universities.

752
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,580
However, rest assured.

753
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,680
If the Sci-Tech students were

754
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,870
in the wrong first,

755
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,120
I will

756
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,040
definitely

757
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,580
protect our students.

758
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,420
Please give the school some time.

759
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,540
When the truth comes out,

760
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
I will ensure that everyone

761
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,580
gets a fair resolution.

762
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,840
Thank you, Secretary Zhou.

763
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,220
Why the long face?

764
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,920
I just went to see Secretary Zhou

765
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,500
about Gao Ge.

766
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,380
You went to see him for Gao Ge?

767
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,560
Yes, I did.

768
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,400
What's the problem?

769
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,820
It's not just his fault.

770
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,180
We need to explain it to the school.

771
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,900
What did Secretary Zhou say?

772
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,460
The usual.

773
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,120
The school will investigate,

774
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,580
and we should wait.

775
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,020
The usual?

776
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,120
When will that lead to a result?

777
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,980
Can the school investigate thoroughly?

778
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,600
I think

779
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,720
instead of waiting,

780
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,160
we should take the initiative.

781
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,640
After Gao Ge was taken away,

782
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,840
I thought about it.

783
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,920
If we can find the girl

784
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,840
who was bullied by Sci-Tech students

785
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,360
and get her to explain

786
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,440
the situation,

787
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,280
we'll be able

788
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,620
to prove our innocence.

789
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,440
That's true.

790
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,620
But how do we find her?

791
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,760
I saw her

792
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,140
while going back to the dorm,

793
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,000
and I walked with her for a bit.

794
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,540
I know where she lives.

795
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,060
Smart this time.

796
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,500
I've always been smart, okay?

797
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,600
You just didn't notice.

798
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,380
And you're quite strong now.

799
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,620
Come on, let's see.

800
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,800
Come on.

801
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,980
Come on.

802
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,970
Do you still have shampoo?

803
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:41,810
Yes.

804
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:42,770
Come over and get it.

805
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,840
This is the place.

806
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,070
This is the place?

807
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,700
Hey, please come with us.

808
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,440
Why?

809
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,020
Let's clear things up with the school.

810
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,720
I can't explain anything.

811
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,560
Let go of me.

812
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,600
You were bullied,

813
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,040
and we helped drive them away.

814
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,200
Now you need to come with us

815
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,680
and explain things to the school.

816
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Okay? Let's go.

817
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,760
I'm not going.

818
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,600
Let's go.

819
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,300
You go yourselves.

820
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,360
Come on.

821
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,640
I finally got a few days

822
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,820
of peace.

823
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,140
Don't come for me.

824
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,200
I'm not like you.

825
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,140
So you're just going to keep hiding?

826
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,940
Let them bully you?

827
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,260
What about the next four years?

828
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,740
How about that?

829
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,640
Let's go and explain everything. It'll be fine.

830
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,280
- Hurry
- I'm not going.

831
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,980
I'm not going anywhere.

832
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,560
Don't mention them to me anymore.

833
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,360
- Alright, calm down.
- I'm not going.

834
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,380
You've scared her.

835
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,480
Hey,

836
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,740
I understand

837
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,640
you have a lot of worries

838
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,980
and concerns.

839
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,000
But you can't live

840
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,660
under their shadow forever.

841
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,200
Remember.

842
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,520
They bullied you.

843
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,480
They were wrong.

844
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,960
You did nothing wrong.

845
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,120
They like to pick on easy targets.

846
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,800
You need to stand up against them

847
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,420
to stop being bullied.

848
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
You must face

849
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,340
all the pain and hurt

850
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,540
to come out of the shadows and start anew.

851
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,320
If everyone who is bullied

852
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,620
stands up,

853
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,680
these things will

854
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,780
happen less and less.

855
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,620
You won't just protect yourself.

856
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,620
You'll protect others too.

857
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,500
(Dafu BBQ)

858
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,480
Secretary Zhou praised us

859
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,840
for being brave

860
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,280
but gave us funding

861
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,400
for activities.

862
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,720
That's great news.

863
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,640
Cheers!

864
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,540
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

865
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,140
A bad situation turned into something good.

866
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,150
No, it was always a good thing.

867
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,420
We just uncovered the truth.

868
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,710
By the way, let's also wish Xixi and Xiaojing

869
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,920
luck in the next round

870
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,580
to be in the running for the championship.

871
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,030
Great.

872
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,450
Love you.

873
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,360
- Cheers!
- Duoduo,

874
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,920
I went to Secretary Zhou for you too.

875
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,400
Do you want to drink with me?

876
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,800
Sure, let's open another bottle.

877
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,460
- Who's drinking first?
- Who's afraid?

878
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,920
Drink up!

879
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,760
Why are you so careless?

880
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,500
- Wipe it up.
- Why did you shake it?

881
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,180
Go upstairs and change.

882
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,500
Not going home or back to the dorm.

883
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,140
Is this where you should be?

884
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,430
Look, look, look.

885
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,180
Is this what you were supposed to be doing?

886
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,620
I'm so mad.

887
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,340
This kid.

888
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,240
I heard it was you

889
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,980
and Duoduo who cleared my name today.

890
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,740
Your news travels fast.

891
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,400
With a friend like Xia,

892
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,820
it's hard not to get the news.

893
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,620
So, are you here to thank me?

894
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,980
I wasn't planning on it.

895
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,080
Aren't we teammates?

896
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,420
It's what you should do.

897
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,140
Why should I do this?

898
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,260
If not, why did you do it?

899
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,420
Helping others?

900
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,560
Doesn't seem like it.

901
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,500
I'm just worried that your bad behavior

902
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,300
would affect the team.

903
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,800
And besides,

904
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,640
you've been helping me at the hospital

905
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,720
these past few days.

906
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,620
We'll be even then.

907
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,650
Just for a few days?

908
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,080
Is your wrist fully healed?

909
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,320
I'm telling you.

910
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,460
You'll always owe me

911
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,860
until it's fully healed.

912
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,700
You're cheating.

913
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,080
It's because of your injury.

914
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,960
You played terribly.

915
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,100
I was too anxious.

916
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,540
Let's play a game

917
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,040
once I'm healed.

918
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,520
No problem.

919
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,640
Ladies and gentlemen,

920
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,560
welcome

921
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,520
to the 22nd Beach Volleyball League

922
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,220
of Seven Schools in Xingang.

923
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,360
After several

924
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,580
intense matches,

925
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,120
the number of competing teams

926
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,220
has dwindled.

927
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,920
Who will claim victory

928
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,240
in today's match?

929
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,180
Let's watch and find out!

930
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,620
Xingang!

931
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,560
(The 22nd League)

932
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,660
Go!

933
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,740
Xingang!

934
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,620
Go!

935
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,020
Go, Xingang! Go!

936
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,060
Xingang University versus Tech University.

937
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,420
The match begins.

938
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,420
- Nice shot!
- Great, beautiful!

939
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,740
What a great shot!

940
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,700
That's pure anger.

941
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
Tech University is

942
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,760
a strong team in the league,

943
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,120
but they're not performing well.

944
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,400
Their tactics are off.

945
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,480
They're too focused on low shots,

946
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,460
which leaves their defense weak.

947
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,240
- Nice!

Xixi, your phone keeps ringing.

Coming, coming.

987
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,260
What's up?

988
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,880
Nothing.

It's fine.

994
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,920
Didn't you say you broke up

995
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,180
and heard nothing from him?

996
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,080
We did break up.

calls occasionally

999
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,900
to bother me.

1000
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,280
Let me tell you.

1001
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,400
Be wary of guys like that.

1002
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,120
If you've broken up, don't stay in touch,

1003
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,060
or he'll stick to you like glue.

1004
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,860
Got it. I know.

1005
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,560
Xixi,

1006
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,760
if something happens, tell me.

1007
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,680
We'll figure it out together.

okay?

00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,440
Okay.

1011
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,100

- You scared me!
- Two.

1023
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,920
- Where were you?
- One.

1024
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,440
- I saw an ice cream stand.
- Xingang!

1025
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,040

1026
