18
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,020
Everyone,

19
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,100
athletes from both teams...

20
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,580
Don't be nervous,

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,580
especially you, Duoduo.

22
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,620
I feel a bit uneasy playing with her.

23
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,900
Just work well together.

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,140
I feel a bit uneasy playing with you.

25
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,980
- They're
- Don't worry.

26
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,460
students from the University of São Paulo.

27
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,140
They're also Chinese girls.

28
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,100
See them?

29
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,260
They look quite tall.

30
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,100
Go for it!

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,300
- And their opponents
- Go for it!

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,580
are the beach volleyball girls
from our university.

Chen Weilan.

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,820
Li Guoduo.

00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,860
Go, go!

36
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,700
Go!

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,540
I got it.

43
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,820
Position two.

44
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,220
Nice!

45
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,100
Great shot!

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,100
Good.

47
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,620
We scored first!

49
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,300
A powerful spike from Player No.2.

50
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,540
It's okay. It's okay.

51
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,260
São Paulo scores a point.

Mine.

54
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,540
Xingang University attacks.

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,060
São Paulo University with an effective block.

56
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,020
- Another point.
- What are they doing?

57
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,340
Her shot was too sharp.

58
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,180
It really was.

59
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,460
- I thought you had it.
- Isn't that your spot?

60
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,680
No. I saw you were getting it.

61
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,690
Stick to your position.

62
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,260
Go for it!

63
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,460
Great shot!

64
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,100
Attack!

65
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,780
Block, block, block, block!

66
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,620
Nice!

(Great Victory, Aim for Excellence)

68
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,140
They're in good form.

69
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,860
- I got it.
- That shot...

70
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,940
Xingang University messed up.

71
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,420
You need to call it out!

72
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,860
You shouldn't have rushed for a second attack.

73
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,260
You insisted on taking it yourself.

74
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,660
You should have set it for me.

75
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,180
I saw the ball

76
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,140
coming to my spot.

77
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,380
I couldn't react in time.

78
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,580
Why couldn't you react in time?

79
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,860
You're usually quick.

80
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,700
What's going on now?

81
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,620
Alright, alright.

82
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,380
They shouldn't argue now.

83
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,180
- Right.
- The more they argue, the worse it gets.

84
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,940
Where's Wen Xin today?

85
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,940
No idea. She suddenly...

86
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,980
Where's Wen Xin?

87
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,300
Come on, don't argue.

88
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,460
Actually, just now,

89
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,660
you both

90
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,180
had no technical issues.

91
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,500
The only problem

92
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,260
was you two didn't work together.

93
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,100
Didn't work together?

94
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,220
This is our first time playing together.

95
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,580
We haven't played before.

96
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,020
I'll pay more attention next time.

97
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
Let's work well together,

98
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,980
okay?

99
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,740
Go for it!

100
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,340
Call for the ball if you need it.

101
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,660
Louder.

102
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,900
Got it.

103
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,980
(Xingang University, University of São Paulo,
Score, Possession, Set Score)

104
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,980
Great shot!

105
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,060
Good!

106
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,900
Awesome!

107
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,220
Great shot!

108
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,180
- Beautiful!
- Go for it!

109
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,180
Great shot!

110
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,060
Good job, Weilan!

111
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,820
I got it.

112
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,620
You go.

113
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,940
Receive!

114
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,140
What is she thinking?

115
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,860
Why didn't she spike it?

116
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,980
What...

117
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,700
Come on.

118
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,540
What happened to Weilan?

119
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,740
No idea, no idea.

120
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,380
What's she doing?

121
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,020
- No idea.
- Is she distracted?

122
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,300
What's going on?

123
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,540
This is a game! Wake up!

124
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,660
What's happening?

125
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,140
I'll get it.

126
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,900
Why were you trying to get the ball I called?

127
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,150
It seems Xingang University's players

128
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,900
are having communication issues.

129
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,740
It's okay. Keep it up.

130
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,220
What's wrong with her?

131
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,860
- Again?
- What's going on?

132
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,100
Chen Weilan, come on!

133
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,140
- Focus!
- Come on!

134
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,420
My position was perfect.

135
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,540
Why didn't you set it to me?

136
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,980
I could have spiked it.

137
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,020
- Come on!
- Come on, come on!

138
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,020
Receive!

139
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,620
São Paulo University scores with a block.

140
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,460
The match is over.

141
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,540
Let's congratulate São Paulo University

142
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,660
for winning this match.

144
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,460
What's happening?

145
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,660
Don't force the spike.

146
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,780
I think even though

147
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,900
they didn't work well together,

148
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,740
the main problem was

149
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
Chen Weilan wasn't in form today.

150
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,300
Was Duoduo in form?

151
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,860
I saw several good positions

152
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,700
for Weilan.

153
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,180
She could have easily spiked it over,

154
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,740
but she jumped.

155
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,020
Hello?

156
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,740
Hi, this is Secretary Zhou.

157
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,740
Secretary Zhou?

158
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,810
I called to inform you

159
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,700
your punishment has been reduced
to three months.

160
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,580
What?

161
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,380
Reduced to three months?

162
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,850
Really?

163
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,980
Then...

164
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,940
Then next month,

165
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,740
I can join the Seven-School League?

166
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,260
Thank you, Secretary!

167
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,500
But why?

168
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,700
Gao Ge,

169
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,060
we received the original video,

170
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,380
proving your fight

171
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,740
had a cause.

172
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,260
So, we decided

173
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,060
to reduce your punishment.

174
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,940
The official decision

175
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,780
has been sent to your email.

176
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,900

177

Okay, okay.

178
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,020
May I ask

179
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,020
who sent you

180
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,100
the original video?

181
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,540
Chen Weilan delivered it

182
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,900
to my office.

183
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,980
Gao Ge,

184
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,620
train hard.

185
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,580
We're counting on you

186
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,980
to bring honor to the school.

187
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,860
Okay, Secretary.

188
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,580
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

189
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,380
Alright then.

190
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,340
Chen Weilan.

191
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,220
Duoduo.

192
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,900
Duoduo.

193
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,860
Duoduo.

194
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,580
Duoduo, don't be sad.

195
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
Duoduo.

196
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,380
It's just a game.

197
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,340
Don't be sad.

198
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,540
We lost, but it's okay.

199
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
We found the problem,

200
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,260
and we'll work hard next time.

201
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,820
Duoduo.

202
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,380
Duoduo.

203
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,220
It's just a beach volleyball game.

204
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,900
Losing isn't a big deal.

205
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,900
We'll work hard next time.

206
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,740
One match's win or loss

207
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,660
doesn't decide anything.

208
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,020
Duoduo.

209
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,820
Roast some garlic later.

210
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,700
Da Fu, busy here.

211
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,580
Yeah.

212
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,100
The business is good.

213
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,220
Any skewers ready?

214
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,740
- Serve the skewers.
- Got it.

215
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,700
Over there.

216
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,620
Alright.

217
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,100
Thanks, thanks.

218
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,180
How did it go?

219
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,180
Did they win?

220
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,580
No.

221
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,620
No?

222
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,580
Isn't Chen Weilan a genius from Beijing?

223
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,140
How did they lose?

224
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,700
- There were many reasons.
- Waiter.

225
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,580
- Two beers, please.
- Coming right up.

226
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,850
Uncle Li, I'll explain it in detail later.

227
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,140
I'll get the beers first.

228
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,860
Secretary Zhou surely thought we would win.

229
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,100
Now, with this result,

230
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
I'm not sure if our team can stay.

231
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,140
I just learned how to play beach volleyball.

232
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,660
The team won't disband because of this, right?

233
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,060
I don't think so.

234
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,780
It's just one loss.

235
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,260
Victory or defeat is a common thing.

236
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,380
Secretary Zhou understands this well.

237
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,940
Don't worry.

238
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,180
As long as I'm here,

239
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,060
the team won't disband.

240
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,340
So, what should we do now?

241
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,860
We'll regroup

242
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,220
and train as usual.

243
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,580
But I noticed

244
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,860
Duoduo and Weilan

245
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,340
are feeling down.

246
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,860
They won't skip practice, will they?

247
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,700
I bear a lot of responsibility

248
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,460
for this.

249
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,620
It's okay.

250
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,180
It's not your fault you got injured.

251
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,470
I'm not injured.

252
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,140
Come on.

253
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,740
What kind of players did I recruit?

254
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,180
Some fake injuries.

255
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,420
Some hold back.

256
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,460
Xia Liqiang,

257
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,380
can you stop picking on them?

258
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,780
What's your real reason for this?

259
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,540
I just wanted them

260
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,620
to team up.

261
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,460
I thought

262
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,100
their skills complement

263
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,500
each other well.

264
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,660
But for some reason,

265
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,620
they couldn't

266
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,180
work together.

267
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,620
So I came up with this idea.

268
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,980
I'm sorry, everyone.

269
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,180
Sorry.

270
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,980
It's okay. I'm not blaming you.

271
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,220
But you're right.

272
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,640
They do lack teamwork.

273
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,790
It's okay.

274
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,060
Wen Xin pretended to be injured

275
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,340
to pair Duoduo and Weilan.

276
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,320
She hoped they would discover

277
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,580
how they complement each other during the game.

278
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,340
But the match didn't go well,

279
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,660
and they lost.

280
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,900
Wen Xin only saw the technical complementarity

281
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,860
between Duoduo and Chen Weilan,

282
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,860
but the most important thing

283
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,820
between partners is connection.

284
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,380
(Dafu BBQ)

285
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,260
Duoduo is really down today.

286
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,100
I think this loss

287
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,740
affected her a lot.

288
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,780
If she can't handle this setback,

289
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,500
she should quit now.

290
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,060
Uncle Li,

291
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,380
I've been wanting to ask you something.

292
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,140
You're always so nice to Duoduo,

293
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,700
but as soon as beach volleyball comes up,

294
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,380
you change completely. Why is that?

295
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,860
What do you mean?

296
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,380
Just say it.

297
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,100
Look.

298
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,500
When Duoduo likes something

299
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,580
or wants something,

300
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,700
you do everything to satisfy her.

301
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,340
But when it comes to beach volleyball,

302
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,580
you're pretty decisive

303
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,740
to refuse her.

304
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,620
Why is that?

305
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,880
Because I played beach volleyball.

306
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,220
I know how hard

307
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,460
and tough

308
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,580
this path is.

309
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,780
Duoduo's physical condition

310
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,140
isn't suited for beach volleyball,

311
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,020
yet she insists on taking this difficult path.

312
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,590
You're a smart person.

313
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,060
Think about it for her.

314
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,900
Should she really go down this path?

315
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,940
Whether she's suited or not is one thing.

316
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,780
I think Duoduo has a lot of passion

317
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,460
for beach volleyball.

318
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,980
She works very hard

319
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,220
and is serious about closing

320
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,740
the gap with others.

321
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,620
There's nothing else in her eyes

322
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,900
but beach volleyball.

323
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,020
I think that's really valuable.

324
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,700
Like, this loss

325
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,140
affected her a lot,

326
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,300
but I believe

327
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,740
she can get back up.

328
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,580
She's like a cockroach that can't be defeated.

329
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,900
Is she still feeling down now?

330
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,980
Duoduo is really down today.

331
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,820
Uncle, why don't you go check on her?

332
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,260
Auntie and I can handle things here.

333
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,660
No, I won't go up.

334
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,860
I'm afraid I'll make her feel worse.

335
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,810
Do you know how to make shredded pork noodles?

336
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,500
No.

337
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,980
I'll tell you.

338
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,740
Add the shredded pork before the noodles.

339
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,580
Then all the seasonings.

340
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,420
Stir-fry for five minutes, and it's done.

341
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,420
Got it?

342
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,500
No, Uncle Li, I...

343
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
I only understand it in my head.

344
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,780
I've never actually cooked.

345
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,060
Bring her a serving upstairs.

346
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,420
The skewers are cold. I'll reheat them.

347
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,500
Duoduo.

348
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,740
I made you something to eat.

349
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,260
Open the door.

350
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,980
Duoduo, Duoduo.

351
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,180
Finally, you opened the door.

352
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,620
I made you shredded pork noodles and skewers.

353
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,900
Try them.

354
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,180
Duoduo.

355
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,140
Duoduo.

356
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,300
- You talk about shredded pork noodles
- Quick.

357
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
and skewers

358
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,580
like they're a feast.

359
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,100
Don't underestimate them.

360
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,740
Let me tell you. The noodles

361
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,020
went through 49 steps.

362
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,020
And these skewers

363
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,900
went through 81 cooking times.

364
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,340
It's complicated.

365
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,500
How is it?

366
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,540
Delicious?

367
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,500
It's delicious.

368
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,060
So tasty. Smells so good.

369
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,980
Try some.

370
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,580
I'll eat from this side.

371
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,260
- Here.
- Why is it so salty?

372
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,780
Uncle told me to add some sugar for flavor.

373
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,660
I might've used salt.

374
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,980
Chef Shao,

375
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,860
you can't even tell sugar from salt?

376
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,540
Sorry, I'll make another one for you.

377
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,620
It's okay. No need.

378
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,300
I'm not hungry anyway.

379
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,940
I'll just drink more water.

380
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,980
Thank you.

381
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,260
I'm going

382
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,300
to review yesterday's match.

383
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,660
Good for you, Li Guoduo.

384
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,540
I knew I was right about you.

385
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,580
You're like a cockroach...

386
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,540
What?

387
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,910
You're a girl that can't be defeated.

388
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,270
What's my problem?

389
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,740
I know.

390
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,540
Stamina.

391
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,780
My problem is stamina.

392
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,580
As the game goes on,

393
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,860
I can't keep up my heavy spiking.

394
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,700
So, besides training my stamina,

395
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,260
I need to improve my speed.

396
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,340
If I'm strong and fast enough,

397
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,860
it can become my killer move.

398
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,340
I think you're right.

399
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,820
Instead of envying Chen Weilan's heavy spikes,

400
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,380
I should focus on my quick attacks.

401
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,860
That's right.

402
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,100
Losing one game doesn't matter.

403
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,420
You've found a direction now.

404
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,540
Thanks to your shredded pork noodles.

405
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,700
What's that got to do with my noodles?

406
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,980
Look.

407
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,900
You mixed up the sugar and salt.

408
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,140
If the seasoning is in the wrong place,

409
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,500
of course, it won't taste good.

410
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,980
But if it's in the right dish,

411
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,020
it can make it delicious.

412
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,900
Right?

413
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,180
Alright, you're right about everything.

414
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,080
Glad you're okay.

415
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:49,980
I'll take this away now.

416
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,820
Okay.

417
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,300
Thanks.

418
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,700
This spike...

419
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,140
This...

420
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,220
Save point, set point...

421
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
Good shot!

422
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,020
Come on, throw another one.

423
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,180
Are you still part of our team?

424
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,060
The match is over,

425
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,300
and you haven't asked about it.

426
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,780
I'm just working on my stamina

427
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,020
for the game in a month.

428
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,860
Right.

429
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,460
The Seven-School League starts in a month.

430
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,220
Wait.

431
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,900
Haven't you been suspended?

432
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,300
Has something changed?

433
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,420
Let me tell you, buddy.

434
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,700
The six-month suspension

435
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,980
was reduced to three months.

436
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,220
Really?

437
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,660
It must be true.

438
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,580
Secretary Zhou called me.

439
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,820
That's great news!

440
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,980
Then our team won't disband.

441
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,140
If you hit me harder,

442
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,900
we will surely disband.

443
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,180
Let me massage it for you.

444
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,660
Alright, alright.

445
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,980
I watched the match.

446
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,340
Our team won't disband.

447
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
How so?

448
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,860
Chen Weilan's skills

449
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,100
are top-notch,

450
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,340
especially her spiking.

451
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,140
It's powerful and precise.

452
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,940
But there's a problem.

453
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,300
She needs a partner

454
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,470
who can work well with her.

455
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,540
Then

456
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,180
what about Li Guoduo?

457
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,520
Not bad.

458
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,580
So, you watched the whole game

459
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,140
just for Chen Weilan?

460
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,780
Cut the nonsense.

461
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,060
She's quite pretty.

462
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,060
Do you want me

463
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,820
to set you up?

464
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,900
Enough already.

465
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,460
I'll set you up.

466
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,500
Alright, alright.

467
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,620
I won't tease you anymore. Go play.

468
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,580
I'm off to eat.

469
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,540
Li Guoduo,

470
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,340
did Shao Nian tell you about my wrist?

471
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,300
Shao Nian?

472
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,420
Looks like he didn't.

473
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,340
Take a good look at the year.

474
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,060
It's been over a year.

475
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,780
My wrist has almost recovered.

476
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,380
Next time, check carefully.

477
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,740
Shao Nian is more tight-lipped than you.

478
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,700
Stop it.

479
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,380
(Injury Report)

480
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,420
(Patient's Condition: Right wrist dislocation)

481
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,780
Duoduo, why are you here?

482
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,420
Shao Nian.

483
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,940
I can't believe you didn't tell me

484
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,940
about Chen Weilan's injury

485
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,020
from over a year ago.

486
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,180
We've known each other for so long.

487
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,320
How long have you known Chen Weilan?

488
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,740
Where's your loyalty?

489
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,380
How did you find out?

490
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,500
I just thought

491
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,540
we're all on the same team,

492
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,060
and she didn't want to tell you guys.

493
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,460
So, I didn't say anything.

494
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,300
You made me worry for nothing.

495
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,500
I was fighting for the ball with her
during the friendly match.

496
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,220
I was afraid she'd get hurt.

497
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,500
It's all my fault.

498
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,420
If I had told you earlier,

499
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,660
we wouldn't have lost the match.

500
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,980
Forget it.

501
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,940
It's not all your fault.

502
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,860
I've figured it out.

503
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,420
I think

504
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,620
since we just formed a team,

505
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,020
we're not very coordinated yet.

506
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,980
Plus, our opponents were really strong.

507
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,700
Losing is normal.

508
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,500
Do you think

509
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,020
we can continue to team up?

510
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,260
Why not?

511
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,380
Think about it.

512
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,740
Chen Weilan's wrist injury

513
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,140
was over a year ago.

514
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,860
She's definitely recovered now.

515
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,300
And she's so strong.

516
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,220
Isn't she the partner you're looking for?

517
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,940
But how can we

518
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,660
work together better?

519
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,140
We don't have a coach

520
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,780
or a unified strategy

521
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,580
and scientific training method.

522
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,340
What do we do?

523
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,940
Uncle Li has so much experience.

524
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,500
Why not ask him?

525
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,820
Him?

526
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,900
(Happy BBQ)

527
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,380
You two need to work faster,

528
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,300
or we won't have enough skewers
for the evening.

529
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,740
Got it.

530
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,860
What's wrong? Something on your mind?

531
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,820
Our team is facing some difficulties.

532
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,500
I want my dad

533
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,740
to be our coach

534
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,260
and guide us.

535
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,500
No matter how much the team needs me,

536
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,420
the BBQ restaurant needs me more.

537
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,940
Get those skewers ready quickly.

538
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,340
Selling more skewers is more practical
than playing beach volleyball.

539
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Hurry up.

540
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,060
Come on.

541
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,180
Your daughter isn't happy.

542
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,220
In life,

543
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,780
the most important thing

544
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,660
is to know your own limits.

545
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,340
Do what you're capable of.

546
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,700
Don't aim too high,

547
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,860
or you'll get hurt.

548
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,740
Can't you say less?

549
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,980
How much

550
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,300
was the meat yesterday?

551
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,540
I forgot.

552
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,100
I'll go check on her.

553
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,660
Hurry up, hurry up.

554
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,900
I'm really not in the mood to eat.

555
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,420
But I already paid.

556
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,820
If you don't eat, it'll be a waste.

557
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,740
Just have one.

558
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,900
You're right.

559
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,580
Wasting food is shameful.

560
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,340
I don't want to eat actually.

561
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,580
Have you thought about how to work with her?

562
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,020
I haven't.

563
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,980
That's why I'm worried.

564
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,020
I've heard

565
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,260
that ice cream goes well with yogurt.

566
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,460
- Really?
- Want to try it?

567
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,980
- Sure.
- I'll get the yogurt.

568
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,340
Wait a second. Really?

569
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,780
Let me see.

570
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,380
There's yogurt in the fridge.

571
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,420
Let's try it.

572
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,660
- Will it be too sour?
- Take it for me.

573
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,780
It won't be.

574
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,060
How is it?

575
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,220
Such an interesting taste.

576
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,460
Not bad, right?

577
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,500
My dad is so frustrating.

578
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,860
He doesn't care about me at all.

579
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,340
Don't keep saying that about your dad.

580
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,140
Uncle cares about you.

581
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,900
After the friendly match,

582
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,900
he came to me

583
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,020
to ask about your performance

584
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
in detail.

585
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,460
He just wanted to find faults in me

586
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,660
and put me down.

587
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,780
If he wanted to put you down,

588
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,060
he could just ignore you

589
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,660
and let you play however you want.

590
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,310
His bark is worse than his bite.

591
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,980
The fact is he doesn't want to help me at all.

592
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,260
Chen Weilan and I don't even

593
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,660
have a good training method right now.

594
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,960
Weilan,

595
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,710
sorry about that last shot.

596
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,370
Why are you apologizing?

597
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,180
If you can't cover your area properly,

598
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,700
how about letting me handle it?

599
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,140
Well, how about we work out a plan?

600
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,180
Look.

601
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,780
I can cover this area.

602
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,140
You cover that area.

603
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,940
We can take turns receiving the ball.

604
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,620
Is it that complicated?

605
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,460
No need for turns.

606
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,020
I'll handle the reception.

607
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,460
You focus on the setting.

608
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,420
Okay?

609
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,020
But the last shot...

610
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,380
What's wrong with the last shot?

611
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,500
It was a perfect angle,

612
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,380
but you still got blocked.

613
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,900
I just think

614
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,220
we need

615
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,780
to work together better as a team.

616
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,500
Can't I attack?

617
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,580
From now on,

618
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,220
I'll handle the attack and reception.

619
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,540
You focus on the setting.

620
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,940
- Alright?
- No.

621
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,460
It's impossible to play.

622
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,460
Wen Xin.

623
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,580
What a coincidence to see you here.

624
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,580
Please sit down.

625
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Wen Xin.

626
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,020
What's wrong?

627
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,100
I just feel like there's no coordination

628
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,340
between me and Chen Weilan.

629
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,500
What should I do?

630
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,820
I think you two are quite compatible.

631
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,940
It's just that she's not used

632
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,620
to teaming up with you yet.

633
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,940
But

634
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,460
beach volleyball is a two-person sport.

635
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,260
Indoor volleyball has 6 players

636
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,540
on a 9-meter court,

637
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,020
but beach volleyball

638
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,500
has just 2 people on an almost 8-meter court.

639
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,660
If we don't coordinate well,

640
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,260
we can't be a team.

641
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,300
Take it slow.

642
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,340
It's just a matter of time. Don't rush it.

643
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,580
Wen Xin.

644
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,380
I have an idea, and I need your help.

645
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,620
How is it?

646
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,980
As you can see,

647
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,020
it's impossible for one person

648
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,300
to cover the entire court.

649
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,020
Beach volleyball

650
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,780
needs coordination.

651
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,260
It's not like indoor volleyball.

652
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,780
Got it?

653
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,420
Is your wrist okay?

654
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,180

00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
It's so uncomfortable.

759
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,620
0.85 degrees?

760
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,460
Why not say you've darkened

761
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,980
by 3.1415926 degrees?

762
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,140
You're 3 degrees darker.

763
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,020
Here, have one as a friendly gift.

764
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,300
Tell me.

765
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,780
How many boxes did you stockpile?

766
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,500
Just two.

767
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,460
Well.

768
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,900
My birthday's coming up.

769
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,220
I don't want anything else.

770
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,060
Well.

771
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,860
Just give me this.

772
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,570
Give it back!

773
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,140
Come on.

774
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,860
Your birthday is months away.

775
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,100
If you want it,

776
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,860
trade me for it.

777
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,820
I've had my eye on this for a long time.

778
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,060
I think it's meant to be with me.

779
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,180
No way.

780
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,460
Only kids make choices.

781
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,780
I want it all.

782
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,340
Give it here. Give it here!

783
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,300
You still want it? You still want it?

784
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,340
Give it to me.

785
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,460
Fine, I'll give you a box, okay?

786
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,500
I'll give you a box.

787
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,940
(Beach Volleyball Activity Room)

788
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,380
Hey, Gao.

789
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,820
Your leg muscles are pretty tight.

790
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,220
Have you been training a lot lately?

791
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,260
His suspension was reduced

792
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,220
from six months to three.

793
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,780
He's still riding that high.

794
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,020
My goal

795
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,100
is to win the Seven-School League.

796
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,250
Wait, Liqiang.

797
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,580
How did his suspension

798
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,620
suddenly get reduced

799
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,540
from six months to three?

800
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,820
I don't know.

801
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,340
He won't say.

802
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,260
Something's wrong with him.

803
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,380
Nonsense.

804
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,460
The school found out I was wrongly accused.

805
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,900
Come on.

806
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,890
The school must need evidence.

807
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,220
Where's the evidence?

808
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,980
Isn't that video recorded by Chen Weilan?

809
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,070
It must be her.

810
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,780
I've been wondering why

811
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,420
you've been mentioning Chen Weilan every day.

812
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,180
She's your great benefactor, huh?

813
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,660
Can't keep your hands still.

814
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,980
Slow down.

815
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,020
Gao.

816
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,420
- Not bad, bro.
- Take it back.

817
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,940
- You draw well.
- Yeah, good job.

818
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,620
- Move aside.
- I just want a look.

819
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,220
What's up with you two?

820
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,700
Spring's here.

821
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,620
Mind your own spring!

822
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,300
Shao Nian.

823
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,500
Stop drawing Li Guoduo.

824
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Draw me instead.

825
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,060
Stop making a fuss.

826
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,020
- Let me see.
- Don't look. What's with you?

827
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,060
Let me see.

828
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,220
Stop it.

829
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,580
What club activity?

830
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,740
You make a good point.

831
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,900
It's okay. I'll discuss it

832
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,380
with the team.

833
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,260
We're in the activity room.

834
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,620
Alright, you focus on your paper.

835
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,860
Tomorrow,

836
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,460
we'll meet at the cafeteria.

837
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,660
Liqiang.

838
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,220
What club activity?

839
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,740
Well, our team

840
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,860
has been around for a while,

841
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,740
but we haven't had a get-together.

842
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,380
We wanted to plan a club event.

843
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,900
Where are we going?

844
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
And the budget?

845
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,340
Well.

846
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,300
We'll discuss it with the team later.

847
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,380
Do you want to join us?

848
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,460
Of course, I do.

849
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,540
I'm the team's medic, after all.

850
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,340
The medic.

851
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,380
- Tell us about that first.
- Let me see.

852
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,360
Let me see.

853
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,700
- Hi, Mr. Zheng.
- Hello, hello.

854
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,740
Uncle Li,

855
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,220
I have a business opportunity.

856
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,620
What's the good deal?

857
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,860
The team wants to have a team-building event.

858
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,220
We thought

859
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,660
of doing a BBQ.

860
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,980
You take care

861
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,340
of the food and skewers.

862
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,140
You guys aren't great at volleyball,

863
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,860
but you're good at partying.

864
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,660
No, they say

865
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,620
proper entertainment

866
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,620
helps relax and unite the team,

867
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,700
so we can play better.

868
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,660
Chili pepper.

869
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,980
I think you're just

870
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,620
looking

871
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,460
for an excuse to have fun.

872
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,660
No.

873
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,340
Psychology says it's true.

874
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,220
Besides,

875
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,340
Duoduo loves your BBQ.

876
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,940
If she's well-fed,

877
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,100
she'll be more motivated.

878
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,340
- Alright, stop chatting.
- Cumin.

879
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,380
Do you have something ready?

880
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,740
- Yes, yes.
- Here, fish tofu.

881
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,660
Great.

882
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,780
There.

883
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,500
Uncle Li, you...

884
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,060
It's settled then?

885
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,980
Here.

886
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,490
We owed you six skewers,

887
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,820
so there's an extra skew of cow throat.

888
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,460
Okay, thank you.

889
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,540
I'll deliver it.

890
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,520
Here, your skewers.

891
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,820
(Lang Yueting)

892
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,080
This game's trash. I'm done.

893
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,140
Bro,

894
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,620
I heard

895
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,460
Lang Yueting's going to compete.

896
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,400
It's close to Xingang City.

897
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,900
I saw that.

898
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,340
So, don't you have anything

899
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,540
to say?

900
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,860
Say what?

901
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,340
Nothing to say.

902
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,540
Who dragged me

903
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,940
to Beijing to watch her match?

904
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,140
Now that it's close. You're not going?

905
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,780
Forget it.

906
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,100
You're just being stubborn.

907
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,860
Aren't you feeling

908
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,140
bottled up?

909
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,220
Yes.

910
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,540
I admit it.

911
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,070
I admire Lang Yueting.

912
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,580
But only her skills.

913
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,060
Still being stubborn.

914
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,500
She's here.

915
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,220
Just go and see her.

916
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,820
Express your appreciation

917
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,660
for her skills.

918
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
I'll do it when I get the chance.

919
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,140
You make your own chances.

920
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,620
I'm not leaving today.

921
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,980
I'm sleeping in Shao Nian's bed.

922
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,500
I warn you.

923
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,900
Don't snore.

924
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,420
If I fall asleep,

925
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,780
who knows what I'll do?

926
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,260
Maybe I'll sleepwalk.

927
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,620
Bro, come on.

928
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,860
Shao Nian's bed is pretty comfy.

929
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,780
How many layers are on this?

930
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,700
Bro.

931
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,900
- What?
- Look at this.

932
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,060
So pretty.

933
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,500
Definitely a girl's thing.

934
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,380
A gift for...

935
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,740
Li Guoduo.

936
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,900
Look at Shao Nian and then at yourself.

937
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,340
He's taking action,

938
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,460
and you're just on your phone all day.

939
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,420
Don't drag me into everything.

940
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,100
This...

941
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,420
It's really nice.

942
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,500
Alright, alright.

943
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,420
Put it back.

944
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,780
Okay, okay.

945
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,620
Goodnight.
