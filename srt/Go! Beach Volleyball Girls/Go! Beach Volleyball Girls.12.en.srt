00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,120
Everyone,

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,040
I have some good news.

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,680
Duoduo, Weilan, have a seat.

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,120
What's the good news?

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,200
You'll know in a moment.

23
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,560
Such a mystery.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,560
Here they come.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,480
Come on.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,800
Let me introduce everyone.

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,400
This is

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,760
the coach from the National Youth Team.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,000
Lu Daxing.

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,280
Lu Daxing.

31
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,240
Everyone, let's welcome him.

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,240
- Welcome, Coach.
- Welcome, Coach.

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,080
Welcome.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,280
Welcome, Coach.

35
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,150
Welcome.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,200
Okay, okay.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,080
Hello, everyone.

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,480
I'm Lu Daxing.

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,240
Nice to meet you.

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,280
For the next week,

41
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,040
Coach Lu will be here to guide us.

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,560
Come on, have a seat.

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,760
Let's sit.

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,360
No need to be so nervous.

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,600
- No need to be so formal.
- He's really here.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,720
- I just got back from abroad.
- A surprise for you.

47
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,400
I've accepted the invitation

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,160
from the National Youth Team

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
to join the coaching staff.

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,160
I used to coach the indoor women's team.

51
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,280
I haven't officially started,

52
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,640
so I rushed over

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
to help out.

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,760
If you have any thoughts during this time,

55
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,800
we can communicate openly.

56
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
Okay. How thoughtful.

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,000
- Thank you, Coach.
- Thank you, Coach Lu.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thank you, Coach Lu.

59
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,080
Thank you.

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,680
Coach, how about this?

61
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,440
Let's play a match,

62
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,720
so you can get to know

63
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,560
our team.

64
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,280
Sure.

65
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,300
Alright.

66
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,920
Everyone, prepare for 10 minutes.

67
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,320
Let's meet at the court.

68
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,260
Okay.

69
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,120
- Alright.
- Okay.

70
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,000
Coach, let me show you around. This way.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,960
Let's go.

72
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,480
Let's go.

73
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,400
Here is our resting area.

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,280
Coach Lu

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,680
dresses like he's on vacation.

76
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,000
It's casual abroad.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,760
These are some of our previous awards.

78
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,600
Shao Nian.

79
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,440
Thank you.

80
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,720
Let's go.

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,160
This is our volleyball court.

82
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,960
The sand here is really good.

83
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,520
We imported it.

84
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,080
Imported?

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,040
We're here.

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,240
Come on.

87
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,440
Warm up.

88
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,640
So you don't get injured.

89
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,600
- Gao Ge.
- What's next?

90
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,800
What's the plan?

91
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,920
Coach Lu

92
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,520
looks so young.

93
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,600
It's normal

94
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,040
for athletes to look young.

95
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,920
But he's from the National Youth Team.

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,040
Will he have enough time

97
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,120
to train us?

98
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,560
Coach Lu

99
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,040
used to be Uncle Li's partner.

100
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,520
He'll do Uncle Li a favor.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,840
Okay.

102
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,440
Now, Coach Lu will

103
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,480
give us some feedback.

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,600
In position.

105
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,750
Her serve has improved a lot.

106
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,600
Good, good.

107
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,360
Go.

108
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,720
Okay, gather around.

109
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
Take it slow.

110
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,600
Alright, now let's have Coach Lu

111
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
give us some feedback.

112
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Watching you play

113
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,800
takes me back

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,920
to my college days,

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,240
playing on this very beach,

116
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,400
diving

117
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,120
and rolling around every day.

118
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,840
My coach in the U.S. once told me

119
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,440
champions

120
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,080
aren't made

121
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,160
in the arena.

122
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,720
They just prove themselves there.

123
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,520
This sentence

124
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,560
has stuck with me.

125
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,440
Until today, I realize

126
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,040
the true essence of being a champion

127
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,800
is in the daily grind.

128
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,200
If you train

129
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
like this every day,

130
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,120
you'll play well and get good results.

131
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,960
Coach, we played a match just now.

132
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,080
It's not training.

133
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,040
- Really?
- Coach.

134
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,720
Thanks for your recognition

135
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,760
and encouragement.

136
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
But could you

137
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
give us more specific feedback

138
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,680
on our shortcomings?

139
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,840
Areas where we can improve?

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,200
Shortcomings?

141
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,440
Of course, you have shortcomings.

142
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,760
After all, you're young

143
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,920
and haven't been playing for long.

144
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,000
Your match experience is limited.

145
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,840
With consistent training,

146
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,320
these shortcomings can be overcome.

147
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,600
For example, you two played tenaciously,

148
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,880
coming from behind to score points.

149
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,640
Your mental strength is impressive.

150
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,720
Very good.

151
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,120
These two.

152
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,360
Excellent.

153
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,600
Your teamwork

154
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,880
is seamless,

155
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,240
complementing each other.

156
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,520
It's clear you've been

157
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,080
playing together for a long time, right?

158
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,320
That one, that one.

159
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,160
Come over.

160
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,280
Well. I have

161
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,000
watched the match.

162
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,280
Let's start training.

163
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,240
Training?

164
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
Alright, everyone. Come over.

165
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,480
Let's practice passing.

166
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,680
Alright, come on.

167
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Li Guoduo.

168
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,160
You were good at the beginning.

169
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,960
But why did you stop passing to me?

170
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,800
I was worried about your wrist.

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,790
My wrist is perfectly fine.

172
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,480
You didn't play seriously with me,

173
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,330
so the coach didn't see anything.

174
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Haste makes waste.

175
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,200
You need to overcome your injury gradually.

176
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,400
Don't push yourself too hard.

177
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,760
I know I need to overcome it,

178
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,600
but weren't we playing a match?

179
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,360
If you don't play your best,

180
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,640
I can't either.

181
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,740
So, of course, the coach

182
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,470
had nothing to comment on.

183
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,640
Come on.

184
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,120
I was taking it seriously.

185
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,000
How can you play

186
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,200
with an injured wrist?

187
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,800
My wrist is none of your concern.

188
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,600
What's wrong, Duoduo?

189
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,680
Who upset you?

190
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,280
She doesn't trust me.

191
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,200
She thinks I have a mental block with spiking.

192
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
That ball was

193
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,120
more suitable for me to spike.

194
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
The last ball

195
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,440
was clearly her mistake.

196
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,040
I just hit it out once

197
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,440
and made a mistake.

198
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,320
Everyone makes mistakes.

199
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,170
Why can't I spike?

200
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,840
Why?

201
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,120
When she spikes,

202
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,000
she just uses brute force.

203
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,120
Everyone makes mistakes?

204
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,200
She just refuses to admit it.

205
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,200
I know.

206
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,480
She's trying to prove to herself

207
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,840
she can overcome this mental block,

208
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,790
but I'm also worried about her wrist.

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,080
I know.

210
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
She's worried about my wrist
getting injured again.

211
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,360
But during a game,

212
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
you have to give it your all.

213
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,410
What's the big deal about getting injured?

214
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,680
Let's eat.

215
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,200
So annoying.

216
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,880
Let me see.

217
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,920
It's fine.

218
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,160
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

219
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
- No, no, no.
- Come on.

220
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,640
Let go of me.

221
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,360
I want to eat. What are you doing?

222
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,320
Let's go.

223
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,840
Eat after the infirmary.

224
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,920
I'm taking care of this.

225
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,680
Duoduo.

226
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,920
I know you mean well,

227
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,560
but trust

228
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
is mutual.

229
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,000
Weilan said she's fine,

230
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,720
so you should trust her.

231
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,880
Of course, I know trust is mutual.

232
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
The problem is she doesn't trust me at all.

233
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,080
I think she might not know

234
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,400
how capable you are.

235
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,760
So practice well

236
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,960
and show her how good you are, okay?

237
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,440
Alright.

238
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,560
I'll definitely practice hard

239
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,560
and show her.

240
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,440
Stop fussing and eat.

241
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,720
We can think of ways

242
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,040
to help her

243
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,080
with special training.

244
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,400
Help her?

245
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
Why?

246
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,680
I'm always the one reaching out to her.

247
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,480
I'm like a leech sticking to her.

248
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,030
Why can't she come to me for once?

249
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,040
Does it matter?

250
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,080
Besides, you're the captain.

251
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,440
It's different.

252
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,760
And I'm the captain.

253
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,480
I don't need her as a teammate.

254
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,080
But you two are partners.

255
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,160
No way. Not this time.

256
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,880
Okay. I won't mention it.

257
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,000
Eat up.

258
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,960
Don't be mad.

259
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,880
You don't want to go hungry.

260
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,600
Coach Lu is quite strange.

261
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,040
He spent the whole day here

262
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,000
without doing anything,

263
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,200
just giving pep talks.

264
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,440
Maybe it's because it's his first day.

265
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,880
He doesn't know much

266
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,800
about our team yet.

267
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,400
You said it yourself. Haste makes waste.

268
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,360
He's the National Youth Team coach,

269
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,520
but he's not a miracle worker.

270
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,040
Anyone could say

271
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,320
what he said.

272
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,680
He doesn't sound like a professional coach.

273
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,680
Did you pick up the wrong person
at the airport?

274
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,920
No way.

275
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,280
We went together to pick him up.

276
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,400
Don't overthink it.

277
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,640
We're going to his dorm

278
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,640
to reimburse his airfare soon.

279
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,120
The ticket should have his name on it.

280
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,720
- Eat up.
- Okay.

281
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,440
I told you I'm fine.

282
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,480
But you still dragged me here.

283
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,680
A little Yunnan Baiyao spray

284
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,760
and some ointment will do.

285
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
You're lucky.

286
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,920
Come on.

287
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,440
I got injured. Why are you so nervous?

288
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Who's nervous?

289
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,280
I'm worried that if you get hurt,

290
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,480
our team will lack a player.

291
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,800
Is there only me on the team?

292
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,520
There are others,

293
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,440
but they don't spike as well as you do.

294
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,240
What? Want me to praise you?

295
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,880
The dorm is this way.

296
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,040
I'll go to eat.

297
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,920
Come in.

298
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,160
Coach Lu.

299
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,120
We brought you

300
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,960
some food and supplies.

301
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,120
Have a seat.

302
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,480
Sit. Make yourself at home.

303
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,440
You sit first.

304
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,280
- Okay.
- Alright.

305
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,800
Sit.

306
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,080
Coach Lu,

307
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,000
these days you might have

308
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,080
to rough it out with us in the dorms.

309
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,000
How is this roughing it?

310
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,200
I often dream

311
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,000
about sleeping in my college dorm.

312
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,640
Being able to stay in the dorm again

313
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,760
feels great.

314
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,400
Right, Coach.

315
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,320
This is your meal card.

316
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,360
You can eat

317
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,840
at our school's cafeteria.

318
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,760
Please give us your plane ticket

319
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,920
so we can reimburse you.

320
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,760
Yeah.

321
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,840
The plane ticket?

322
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
I thought we agreed

323
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,880
I'd cover it myself.

324
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,840
No, that's not right.

325
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,160
You're staying in the dorms
and eating at the cafeteria.

326
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,000
We can't let you pay for the ticket.

327
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,160
Yes, you're too nice.

328
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,200
It's making us feel bad.

329
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
How could this make you feel bad?

330
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,200
Aren't you all still students?

331
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,520
How much money is on this meal card?

332
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,760
I'll pay you back.

333
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,320
No, no, no.

334
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,800
You're taking the time to coach us,

335
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,070
- which is our honor.
- Right, right.

336
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,400
We can't let you pay for that.

337
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Just give us the ticket.

338
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,320
We'll reimburse you.

339
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,600
Okay.

340
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,560
You're so hospitable.

341
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll accept the meal card.

342
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,000
But

343
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,200
I must pay for the plane ticket.

344
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,720
- I...
- Alright.

345
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,920
That's settled then.

346
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,400
What time is your training tomorrow?

347
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,960
We train every day at 4 pm.

348
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,640
Alright. When it's time for training,

349
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,480
call me.

350
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

351
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,360
How long will you stay here?

352
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,360
Well.

353
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,400
About a week.

354
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,760
My team doesn't

355
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,600
have much going on.

356
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,920
Alright. Thank you.

357
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,360
Let me tell you.

358
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
I'm not much older

359
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,720
than you.

360
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,040
No need to be so formal.

361
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,400
How's Dafu?

362
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,040
Is he okay?

363
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,010
When will he be discharged?

364
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,720
He's still in the hospital.

365
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,240
It'll still be a while

366
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,840
before he's discharged.

367
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,320
Alright.

368
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,720
I'll visit him then.

369
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,760
Okay.

370
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
Coach, please rest.

371
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,280
We'll have a day off tomorrow.

372
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,000
- We'll start formal training after that.
- Okay.

373
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,440
Rest well.

374
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,560
- We're leaving.
- Okay.

375
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,400
Thank you.

376
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,360
- Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

377
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,600
- Bye-bye.
- Take care.

378
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,760
How can I let you see this?

379
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
What's this?

380
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,680
Today, I must train

381
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,760
for the Seven-School League.

382
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,000
I disagree.

383
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,160
I'm really fine.

384
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,560
It's just a small injury.

385
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,760
I can handle it.

386
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,760
You're injured.

387
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
The team isn't just you.

388
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,440
Don't overexert yourself.

389
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,880
But spiking depends on me, right?

390
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,840
That's what you said.

391
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,120
Come on.

392
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,600
Just admit you need a partner.

393
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,440
Is it so hard?

394
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,480
Do I need it?

395
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,120
Look at her.

396
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,020
(Xingang University)

397
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,160
What's going on with Duoduo?

398
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,680
She isn't talking to Chen Weilan now.

399
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,240
Do they still want to be partners?

400
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
Gao, I need to say this to you.

401
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,400
Why does Duoduo have to give in?

402
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,880
Chen Weilan can give in too.

403
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,160
You two

404
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,840
should mind your own business.

405
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,440
I'm doing this for the team.

406
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,840
Xia. Come on.

407
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,960
Why are you playing games?

408
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,600
Can you be a responsible captain?

409
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,360
I'm telling you.

410
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,640
Their issue

411
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,520
is just like a couple arguing.

412
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,320
One of them needs to speak up first.

413
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,960
So, you mean

414
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,480
they need an excuse?

415
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,080
Or what?

416
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,400
Do you have any ideas?

417
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,840
Gao, how about this?

418
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,640
I'll ask Duoduo out tomorrow.

419
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,200
You ask Chen Weilan out.

420
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,480
Give them a chance.

421
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,230
I ask Chen Weilan out?

422
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,600
On a date? No way.

423
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,920
Why not?

424
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,880
Help a friend out.

425
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,400
You can't watch

426
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,000
the former captain's

427
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,930
hard work go to waste.

428
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,780
Come on.

429
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,640
It has nothing to do with me.

430
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,720
How does it not?

431
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,120
Alright.

432
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,120
It's for my buddy.

433
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Not for you.

434
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,240
Fine. For me.

435
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,400
Hurry up and text Weilan.

436
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,120
Haven't I been good to you?

437
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,960
So, tomorrow,

438
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,260
you four should go out together.

439
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,610
(Chen Weilan; How about a meal tomorrow?)
I'm going to the library for my paper.

440
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,840
Wait.

441
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,280
What does that mean?

442
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,360
The four of us are going?

443
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,440
Yes.

444
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,840
I still don't want to go.

445
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,360
Why not?

446
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,600
- What are you doing?
- You must go.

447
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,320
Oh, no.

448
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,600
She replied.

449
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,920
That's good.

450
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,280
Go on a date.

451
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,840
Thanks to you.

452
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,160
Welcome. How many people?

453
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,600
I have a reservation.

454
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,440
Okay.

455
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,640
Welcome.

456
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,560
Duoduo, why aren't you coming in?

457
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,400
Why is she here too?

458
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,920
I didn't invite her.

459
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,880
Why did you take so long?

460
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,720
Do you know how long I waited for you?

461
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,040
You asked me out to eat.

462
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,080
What's wrong with waiting for me?

463
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,440
I asked you out to eat.

464
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,040
Weilan, why aren't you sitting?

465
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,120
Are you waiting for us?

466
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,680
You didn't invite her?

467
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,520
I really didn't.

468
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,480
Gao Ge did.

469
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Nice.

470
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,760
Passing the blame now?

471
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,240
No, it's a casual gathering for the team.

472
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,640
Besides,

473
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,040
I ordered a meal for four.

474
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,880
Don't waste it.

475
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
I also got a go-kart voucher

476
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,760
for this afternoon.

477
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,800
We can go play together.

478
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,600
I remember there's

479
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,040
something free there.

480
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,880
Right, Gao?

481
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,200
Drinks are free.

482
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,680
Yes. There's a bar

483
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,040
with free drinks and ice cream.

484
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,280
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

485
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,720
Team bonding.

486
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,520
Yes, team bonding.

487
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,640
Is eating this complicated?

488
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,880
What are you afraid of?

489
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,680
I'm afraid?

490
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,480
Yes.

491
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,560
What's there to be afraid of?

492
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,440
- Waiter.
- Ordering.

493
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,360
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

494
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,200
You're welcome.

495
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,800
Have some soup.

496
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,400
This is fish maw chicken soup.

497
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,440
Very rich and delicious.

498
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,480
Let me serve you.

499
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,240
- I'll do it myself.
- It's okay.

500
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,920
Thanks.

501
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,880
Gao, this soup is excellent.

502
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,040
She has hands.

503
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,850
- I'll serve you.
- I'll do it myself.

504
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm telling you.

505
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,060
This place is usually hard to book.

506
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,660
Don't be fooled

507
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,740
by the emptiness now.

508
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,700
Last time I came,

509
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,820
I had to wait several hours

510
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,740
for a table.

511
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,340
It's really good.

512
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,580
The meat is very nice.

513
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,140
Add this meat.

514
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,460
This meat is very good.

515
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,940
This morning,

516
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,820
the owner said the meat was airlifted
from New Zealand.

517
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,580
- Very fresh.
- Impressive.

518
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,340
It's okay.

519
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,580
Just put it all in.

520
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,740
Everyone can eat together.

521
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,660
I'll put the tripe in now.

522
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,790
Don't put it in like that.

523
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,990
The tripe needs to be cooked in and out.

524
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,140
Or it'll be overcooked.

525
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,180
So many details.

526
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,600
You should cook it like this. See?

527
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,700
Like this. You know?

528
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,420
Gao.

529
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,260
Water, please.

530
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,820
Put a piece of tripe for her.

531
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,500
Here you go.

532
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,500
I have hands.

533
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,700
Eat up, eat up.

534
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,940
Or the tripe will be overcooked.

535
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,460
There's still a lot left.

536
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,860
There's more.

537
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,260
Only this one piece is left.

538
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,420
Order another serving.

539
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,460
Yes, yes.

540
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,340
Waiter, another serving of tripe.

541
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,460
(This time, I won't talk to you first.)

542
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,420
(Li Guoduo.)

543
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,980
(When will you talk to me?)

544
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,940
(Go-Kart Club)

545
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,780
How did it go?

546
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,980
Did they say anything?

547
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,460
Can't you see?

548
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,940
Still joking.

549
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,100
Think of a way.

550
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,540
How about this?

551
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,060
During the match,

552
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,060
we'll be a team,

553
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,980
and they'll be a team.

554
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,940
If they want to win,

555
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,140
they'll have to talk.

556
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,980
Bro,

557
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,180
did you leave your brain at home?

558
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,340
Look at this.

559
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,540
Can they even team up?

560
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,860
Gao,

561
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,060
don't look down on me.

562
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,460
I have my own ways.

563
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,020
Look. We'll shuffle the cards.

564
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,100
One card each.

565
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,480
The same suits will be on the same team.

566
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,580
It's up to fate, okay?

567
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,660
Did you do it on purpose?

568
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,650
I shuffled the cards in front of everyone.

569
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,700
Who wants to be on your team? Useless.

570
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,100
What do you mean, Gao?

571
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,780
I don't want to be on your team either.

572
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,660
You're useless.

573
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,500
Wait for me.

574
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,180
Duoduo.

575
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,780
Your relay with Chen Weilan

576
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,900
just now was so in sync.

577
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,500
If it weren't for Gao, we'd never have lost.

578
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,660
You're useless, okay?

579
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,140
You crashed countless times.

580
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,380
Was it because of you that we lost?

581
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,540
I don't want to talk to you.

582
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,460
Alright, alright.

583
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,590
I play go-karts often,

584
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,620
so winning is normal.

585
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,900
It doesn't matter who I partner with.

586
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,260
What's there to be proud of in winning once?

587
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,380
You two were letting us win.

588
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,300
Do you think I can't tell?

589
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,580
Is this how you race?

590
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,420
Will she also play beach volleyball like this?

591
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,300
Unfair things must be eliminated.

592
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,220
No, Duoduo.

593
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,540
See you on the court.

594
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,540
Duoduo, are you okay?

595
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,500
What a coincidence.

596
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,500
Congratulations to you.

597
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,980
Finally together.

598
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,220
Unlucky on the court, but lucky in love.

599
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,740
That's you, right?

600
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,820
Tu Lingling.

601
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
What are you talking about?

602
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,100
I'm talking about you.

603
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,740
Li Guoduo.

604
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,060
I always considered you my best friend.

605
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,620
You knew I liked Shao Nian,

606
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,740
but you stole him from me.

607
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,660
You were the one who promised

608
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,820
to help me pursue him.

609
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,660
And now?

610
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,740
Is this what you call help?

611
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,780
First,

612
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,940
Shao Nian and I aren't what you think.

613
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,100
And

614
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,500
from the moment you abandoned me,

615
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,020
we were no longer friends.

616
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,700
Keep acting.

617
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,980
Don't you know why I abandoned you?

618
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,260
You pretend to be innocent

619
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,050
and naive every day.

620
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,250
Others don't know what you're thinking,

621
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,460
but do you think I don't know?

622
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,980
What acting? What am I thinking?

623
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,740
You abandoned me and refused to be my friend.

624
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,340
Now you turn around and blame me?

625
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,500
Are you reasonable?

626
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,340
I'm not reasonable?

627
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,780
Li Guoduo.

628
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,900
You should know.

629
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,860
With your abilities,

630
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,260
you can't get into Ocean University.

631
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,820
You don't deserve to be with Shao Nian.

632
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,620
If it weren't for me,

633
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,060
you couldn't have played beach volleyball.

634
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,980
In high school,

635
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,340
no one wanted to be your partner.

636
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,180
Do you know why?

637
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,500
It's because you're not worthy.

638
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,460
What do you mean?

639
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,460
Is that up to you to decide?

640
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,820
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

641
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,980
What does it have to do with you?

642
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,360
I'm her partner. Chen Weilan.

643
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,580
You didn't make it to the National Youth Team.

644
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,580
What's there to boast?

645
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,340
You talk too much.

646
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,740
Tomorrow at 9 am,

647
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,420
at your school's court,

648
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,260
let's have a match.

649
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,420
See you there.

650
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,180
Weilan.

651
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,140
Thank you.

652
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,620
What for?

653
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
Good luck tomorrow.

654
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,260
If I had known,

655
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,460
why did I bother so much?

656
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,820
With your little tricks?

657
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,900
It was all to get you two to make up.

658
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,140
We came up with this plan.

659
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,820
Not we. It was your idea.

660
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,700
Gao, come on.

661
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,780
Don't undermine me.

662
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,700
When did I have issues

663
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,980
with Weilan?

664
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,140
We've always been fine.

665
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,000
Let's go. Still want to play?

666
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,500
- Yeah.
- Weren't they arguing?

667
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,500
Yes. Let's go.

668
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,700
Women are really interesting.

669
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,740
I don't understand.

670
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,140
What should I do for them?

671
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,460
Who is it?

672
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,740
Coach Lu, it's me.

673
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,380
Come in, come in.

674
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,220
Coach Lu.

675
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,220
We have a match tomorrow.

676
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,580
We'd like you to be the referee.

677
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,500
A match?

678
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,220
What match?

679
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,540
The opponent is Ocean University.

680
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,140
It's a private match we organized.

681
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,220
Ocean University?

682
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,860
A private match?

683
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,820
What time tomorrow?

684
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,020
- At 9 am at Ocean University.
- Yes.

685
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,340
At 9 am. Okay.

686
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,700
I'll see you at 9 am

687
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,700
tomorrow.

688
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,020
Okay, see you tomorrow.

689
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,020
Alright.

690
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,300
- We're leaving then.
- Okay.

691
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,420
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

692
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,340
- Bye-bye, Coach.
- Thanks.

693
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,300
Rest well.

694
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,260
Okay.

695
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,900
Ocean University.

696
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,940
(Basic Info)

697
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,740
This girl is good.

698
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,260
- Go, go.
- Go!

699
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,620
Lingling, go!

700
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,820
Go, Ocean University!

701
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,150
Go, Duoduo!

702
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,880
- Go!
- Go!

703
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,820
Go!

704
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,140
- Mine.
- Mine.

705
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,070
Again. No worries. Keep going.

706
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,380
- Are you okay?
- Go!

707
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,580
Keep going.

708
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,140
Beautiful.

709
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,060
- Good.
- Beautiful.

710
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,300
- Good shot.
- Go, go, go!

711
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,660
Go!

712
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,260
Go!

713
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,880
Good.

714
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:20,860
Perfect.

715
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,700
It's OK. Just keep up.

716
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,060
Too perfect.

717
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,940
Defend the cross smash.

718
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,100
- Focus on Long Ya.
- What's going on?

719
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,700
Stop, stop.

720
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,780
Stop.

721
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,700
Didn't I tell you?

722
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,500
Don't play matches on your own.

723
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,580
Especially meaningless matches.

724
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,420
What if you get injured?

725
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,860
As athletes,

726
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,700
you must train hard and strive,

727
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,340
but protecting yourselves is more important.

728
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,220
Please leave.

729
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,300
Tian Qing, right?

730
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,980
Hello.

731
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,860
Let me introduce myself.

732
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,940
I am

733
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,460
Lu Daxing,

734
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,420
the coach of the National Youth Team.

735
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,380
Actually, I don't agree

736
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,260
with what you just said.

737
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,140
We must take any form

738
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,460
of competition seriously.

739
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,420
We can't slack off.

740
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,940
It's not as you said.

741
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,420
It's not meaningless.

742
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,460
I don't care which team you coach.

743
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,780
I must be responsible

744
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,100
for my own players.

745
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,900
Why are you standing there?

746
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,780
Pack up and go back.

747
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,740
Run 10 laps as a penalty.

748
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,580
Yes.

749
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,260
Coach Tian.

750
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,420
Don't be so serious.

751
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,260
Look at you.

752
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,580
So pretty.

753
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,890
It's not good.

754
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,660
This is Ocean University's court.

755
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
Please leave.

756
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,500
Why are you standing there?

757
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,780
Run 20 laps as a penalty.

758
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,580
No wonder she's still single

759
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,100
at this age. Personality issues.

760
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,940
What? Envious?

761
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,700
Really envious of having

762
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,700
such a tough coach.

763
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,700
A coach like this

764
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,820
has a professional aura.

765
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,700
You're good too.

766
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,500
Secretary Zhou,

767
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,980
I heard our school secured

768
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,380
a graduate slot for the volleyball team.

769
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,900
Why doesn't our team have one?

770
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,460
Because the volleyball team

771
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,740
won the Volleyball Seven-School League.

772
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,740
We have Chen Weilan,

773
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,540
who can win the Beach Volleyball
Seven-School League.

774
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,140
If Chen Weilan wins,

775
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,180
I can give her a graduate slot.

776
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,820
But what about you?

777
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,060
Secretary Zhou,

778
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,380
what if

779
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,380
I can also win?

780
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,220
According to school regulations,

781
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,900
winning

782
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,940
directly secures a graduate slot.

783
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,980
If you make it to the top three,

784
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,860
you can get extra points

785
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,860
for the graduate exam.

786
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,340
Alright.

787
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,540
Thank you, Secretary Zhou.

788
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,060
Perfect.

789
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,900
How is it?

790
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:50,980
Secretary Zhou

791
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,860
turned you down?

792
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,140
Not entirely.

793
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,180
So there's still a chance.

794
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,100
He said

795
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,530
I have to make it to the top three
in the league.

796
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,890
The Seven-School League

797
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,780
has only one team

798
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,860
per school.

799
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,180
Just in terms of qualification,

800
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,220
we're...

801
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,660
But

802
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,180
I can't give it up.

803
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,060
Xixi,

804
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,980
you're the best.

805
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,620
We're the best.

806
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,220
Yesterday,

807
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,020
I got to know you generally.

808
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,900
Next, I'll focus

809
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,540
on specialized training

810
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,540
for each of you and your teams.

811
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,140
But before we start this training,

812
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,420
we have something important to do.

813
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,260
Physical training.

814
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,140
When I was in the National Youth Team,

815
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,260
we had this physical training every year.

816
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,620
We call it

817
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,140
devil training.

818
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,060
How do you all feel?

819
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,060
Does it make you nervous?

820
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,140
Don't be nervous.

821
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
I guarantee

822
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,860
our physical training

823
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,220
will be something you've never had,

824
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,500
and it'll be unbearably painful.

825
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,140
You won't want to look it back.

826
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,420
That's not necessary.

827
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,580
We're not professional athletes.

828
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,180
Why do we need such intense

829
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,220
physical training?

830
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,660
And Coach,

831
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,180
starting physical training now,

832
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,980
won't it be too late to have an effect?

833
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,220
This physical training is something

834
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,220
I both love and hate.

835
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,140
Your physical condition is poor.

836
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,380
You need to practice more.

837
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,300
So specifically, how will we train?

838
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,540
Let me tell you.

839
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,580
Any improvement in sports skills

840
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,860
must be built

841
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,460
on a solid physical foundation.

842
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,260
Before this foundational training,

843
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,460
you must greatly improve

844
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,500
your physical fitness.

845
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,540
Starting today,

846
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,580
you can suspend

847
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,060
your previous training.

848
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,100
Alright, we'll follow your arrangement.

849
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,660
Okay.

850
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,220
Let's get started.

851
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,340
Weilan.

852
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,220
Duo.

853
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,420
For the graduate slot,

854
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,260
I must participate in the Seven-School League

855
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,610
and make it to the top three.

856
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,040
So,

857
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,580
I was wondering

858
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,620
if you could let me

859
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,260
have two balls

860
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,340
during the qualification match.

861
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,940
Let you have it?

862
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,460
Xiaojing, did I hear it correctly?

863
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,060
You want us to let you win?

864
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,540
Just once.

865
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,860
You're in your first year.

866
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,300
There will be many opportunities,

867
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,620
but this is my last hope.

868
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,860
Please. I beg you.

869
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,620
Xiaojing,

870
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,940
we really want to help you,

871
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,480
but we can't

872
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,820
just let you win.

873
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,460
Weilan,

874
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,380
what about you?

875
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,010
Xiaojing,

876
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,860
no one can convince me.

877
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,500
Competitive sports emphasize strength

878
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,890
and fairness.

879
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,870
Whether it's beach volleyball or volleyball,

880
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,430
it's not about winning

881
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,700
but to be true to ourselves.

882
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,580
I know how anxious

883
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,900
you are about the graduate slot.

884
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,300
But

885
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,980
if it goes

886
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,420
against sportsmanship,

887
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,300
we really can't do it.

888
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,620
Though the last match wasn't finished,

889
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,620
their coordination was quite good.

890
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,900
We also need to hurry up.

891
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,980
So,

892
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,220
we need to study

893
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,220
our own tactics carefully.

894
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,300
Makes sense.

895
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,500
You haven't overcome

896
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,300
your psychological barriers.

897
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,300
I suggest

898
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,940
focusing on one pass attacks.

899
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,820
One pass attacks?

900
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,420
I think issues like this

901
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,060
should be discussed with Coach Lu.

902
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,300
He knows it better than us.

903
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,780
- Lu.
- Looking for me?

904
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,060
Coach.

905
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,540
We're used to the physical training

906
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,380
by now.

907
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,980
We were wondering

908
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,060
if we should focus on training

909
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,140
one pass attacks.

910
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,260
Yes.

911
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,580
One pass attacks?

912
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,660
Your physical fitness

913
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,020
has improved a lot compared to the first day.

914
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,340
But it's still not enough.

915
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,260
One pass attack is a good idea.

916
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,100
You can do this.

917
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,900
Coach Lu,

918
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,220
do you have any advice

919
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,300
on our one pass attack?

920
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,500
No opinions, no advice.

921
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,620
One pass attacks, third balls.

922
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,060
Play as you like. Good. Keep it up.

923
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,300
(Lu Daxing)

924
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,380
Why not answer it?

925
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:53,940
Spam call.

926
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,980
No. I see it has words on it.

927
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,940
Lu Dayang, my brother, a gambler.

928
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,500
Always asking me for money. What a jerk.

929
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,860
Get back to work.

930
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,540
Keep going.

931
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,180
He said two pass attack?

932
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,380
They're being unreasonable.

933
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,380
Li Guoduo?

934
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,380
Isn't she just a freshman?

935
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,380
If you hadn't let her be the captain,

936
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,660
would she talk to you like this?

937
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,140
No way.

938
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,260
I need to teach her a lesson.

939
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,740
They're right.

940
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,980
Xiaojing,

941
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,060
you're also very capable.

942
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,180
Your time with beach volleyball

943
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,300
isn't shorter than theirs.

944
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,420
There's still some time before the match.

945
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,820
Let's give it a try.

946
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,220
Alright.

947
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,340
I support you.

948
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,340
Don't you think something's wrong

949
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,500
with Lu Daxing?

950
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,700
He doesn't know about one pass attack.

951
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,460
Something's off with him.

952
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,820
I think he might be trying to improve

953
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,380
our ability to learn independently.

954
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,380
Here's the tutorial

955
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,900
on one pass attack I found.

956
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,140
See if it helps.

(Energetic Volleyball,
One Pass Attack Tutorial)

958
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,340
Weilan,

959
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,460
I think

960
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,220
if you follow this method,

961
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,940
it might help you overcome

962
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,180
your psychological barrier.

963
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,940
Also, it seems suitable for us.

964
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,580
This way, our chances of winning

965
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,580
will be higher.

966
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,580
What do you think?

967
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,060
I'm not sure.

968
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,740
It requires high coordination

969
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,660
and teamwork.

970
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,500
Can you handle it?

971
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,260
We do have that level

972
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,500
of coordination and teamwork.

973
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,980
Believe in me.

974
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,860
We just need

975
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:03,980
to strengthen our training.

976
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,660
Then do your best.

977
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,380
Xiaojing.

978
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,620
Go for it!

979
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,940
Play well.

980
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,820
Go for it!

981
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,820
Go for it!

982
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,740
Victory is ours.

983
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,060
Come on.

984
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,780
Go for it!

985
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,140
