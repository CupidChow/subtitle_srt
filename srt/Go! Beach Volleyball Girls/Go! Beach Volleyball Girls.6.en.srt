00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,340
You won't be able to beat them anyway.

19
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,020
I know I have physical limitations,

20
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,490
but I can work hard.

21
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,460
One day, I'll defeat everyone.

22
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,550
No matter how hard you work,

23
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,370
you'll only reach their starting line.

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,700
You work hard and improve.

25
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,660
They work hard and improve too.

26
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,620
Right?

27
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,580
They've already left you far behind.

28
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,880
I think you should give up early.

29
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,340
Be sensible.

30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,380
Duoduo.

31
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,060
Uncle Li, I'll go check on Duoduo.

32
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,100
Duoduo.

33
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,780
Duoduo, what are you doing here?

34
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,620
Don't be mad.

35
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,460
Uncle Li didn't mean it that way.

36
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,020
Then what did he mean?

37
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,180
You heard what he said just now.

38
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
Tell me, Shao Nian.

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,860
If you were me, wouldn't you be mad?

40
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,020
I'd be mad too.

41
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,900
But Uncle Li is your father.

42
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,140
You know him better than anyone.

43
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,980
His bark is worse than his bite.

44
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,420
You see him

45
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,480
being strict with you,

46
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,990
but when you're not at the shop,

47
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,150
he's watching videos of your matches

48
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,070
on his phone.

49
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,300
When you score with a block,

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,620
he gets really happy.

51
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,020
He just pretends to be calm.

52
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,950
I don't know what he's like behind me.

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,500
He always criticizes me to my face.

54
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,340
Today, at school, he said in front of everyone

55
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,580
that I'm not as good as Song Xuewei.

56
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,520
Don't be mad.

57
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,550
Have you ever thought

58
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,980
maybe Uncle Li is trying to motivate you?

59
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,580
He wants to put pressure on you

60
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,540
to help you improve.

61
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,310
Whether it's motivation or not,

62
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,380
he's been treating me like this
since I was little.

63
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,420
I'm used to it.

64
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,180
But no matter what,

65
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,260
I'll prove to him

66
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,580
that he's wrong.

67
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,580
Alright, alright.

68
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,620
Let's go back now, okay?

69
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,980
Gao and Weilan are coming soon.

70
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,540
Let's go back and prepare the skewers.

71
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,220
Coming. Coming.

72
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,180
- Thank you, Auntie.
- Thank you, Auntie.

73
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,900
Auntie, take a rest. There's plenty of food.

74
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,420
- Yes, Auntie, there's enough.
- There's one more dish.

75
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,100
Coming. The skewers are here.

76
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,980
So much food.

77
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,220
- So much food.
- Thank you.

78
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,060
- Gao is here.
- Gao.

79
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,300
Gao Ge.

80
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,380
It smells so good.

81
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,580
How are things with Weilan?

82
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,980
None of your business. Don't mess with me.

83
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,060
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Thank you, Uncle.

84
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,300
- Thanks, Uncle Li.
- It's delicious.

85
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,150
- There are more skewers. Start with these.
- Thank you, Uncle.

86
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,220
Eat up.

87
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,090
Anyone else?

88
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,060
Duo, take care of the guests.

89
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,040
- Okay, got it.
- Help yourselves

90
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,220
to drinks from the fridge.

91
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,820
- Thank you, Auntie.
- Thank you, Auntie.

92
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,660
Duoduo, is there any alcohol?

93
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,420
Yes, it's in the kitchen. Get it yourself.

94
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,740
Are you crazy?

95
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,020
Just one can.

96
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,160
- I'm having some too.
- Get me two.

97
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,300
How can you drink?

98
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,700
I'm an adult now.

99
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,820
Ignore them. Let's eat.

100
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,260
Come on. Fresh off the grill.

101
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,340
Eat while it's hot.

102
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,180
Come on.

103
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,620
Choose together.

104
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,620
Weilan, Weilan.

105
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,340
This isn't like you, Chen Weilan.

106
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,420
What's going on?

107
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,420
It's the rules.

108
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,820
Let me call it.

109
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,700
Come on.

110
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,420

113
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,700
Of course. I'm not afraid.

114
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,260
- Just take a sip.
- It's okay.

Stop drinking, Duoduo.

122
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,700
Drink less.

123

Li Guoduo always loses

128
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,700
in this game.

129
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,820
She's the one drinking all the time.

130
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,780
Let's change the game.

131
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,620
Why?

132
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,180
Say it again. Who never wins?

133
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,660
- You never win.
- This game...

134
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,820
It's not difficult at all.

135
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,420
My dad criticizes me.

136
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,500
Why are you criticizing me too?

137
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,100
Why does everyone criticize me?

138
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,060
No, no.

139
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,180
Stop drinking.

140
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,140
- Give it to me.
- Duoduo.

141
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,020
- Wait, Duoduo.
- Duoduo.

142
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,340
I'll take her upstairs.

143
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,780
- You all continue.
- Go, go, go.

144
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,420
- Go back to sleep.
- Don't touch me. I can still play.

145
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,020
Chen Weilan, what do you mean?

146
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,940
- Who said the game's over?
- Let's go.

147
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,460
- I'm still playing!
- Go, go, go.

148
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,180
You all think I'm not good, right?

149
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,020
Alright, let's go.

150
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,340
- No, I'm still playing. I haven't...
- Uncle Li.

151
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,020
- I'm not done yet.
- Why did you let her drink?

152
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,620
- How much did she drink?
- Li Dafu.

153
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,390
You think I'm no good too, right?

154
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,540
Alright, alright.

155
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,100
- I'll take her upstairs.
- I'm still playing.

156
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,580
What are you doing? Today, I'll...

157
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,140
- Chen Weilan, you're in trouble!
- Alright, alright.

158
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,780
Chen Weilan.

159
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,220
- Look at you. So drunk.
- Let go of me.

160
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,220
Rest early, Duoduo.

161
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,060
Drink less.

162
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,260
Alright, Uncle Li.

163
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,620
Let go of me, Dad.

164
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,700
What are you doing?

165
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,260
- Let's go.
- Call a cab and go home.

166
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,220
I'll clean up here.

167
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,740
- Leave it to me.
- Let me help you.

168
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,620
Can you manage alone?

169
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,660
I clean it up every day.

170
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,500
What help do I need?

171
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,340
Call a cab and head home.

172
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,580
Liqiang, are you okay?

173
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,100
I'm fine.

174
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,600
Fine? You don't look fine.

175
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,640
Message me when you get home, okay?

176
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,100
Post in the group to let us know you're safe.

177
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,780
- Okay, okay.
- Sure, sure.

178
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,540
Thanks for everything.

179
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,820
- No worries.
- Thanks. Thanks.

180
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,660
Let's go.

181
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,780
Keep an eye on her.

182
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,780
I've got her. I've got her.

183
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,620
Alright, go, go.

184
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,700
Take it slow.

185
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,900
It's fine.

186
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,860
- We're leaving.
- Goodbye.

187
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,140
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

188
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,060
Let us know when you get home.

189
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,180
Okay, got it.

190
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,030
We're leaving now.

191
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,980
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

192
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
Li Dafu.

193
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,420
- You're still up?
- Li Dafu.

194
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,620
What's that noise?

195
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,740
Li Dafu.

196
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,860
Open the door.

197
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,380
Can't you hear that noise?

198
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,460
Li Dafu.

199
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,940
Li Dafu, come out.

200
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,280
- Duoduo.
- Li Dafu.

201
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,180
Come out. I want to talk to you.

202
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,020
Duoduo, you're drunk.

203
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,250
- I'll make you some honey water.
- Li Dafu.

204
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,100
Li Dafu, where are you?

205
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,580
Go back to your room.
Your dad will be out soon.

206
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,220
Li Dafu.

207
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,180
Duoduo.

208
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,740
Li Dafu, open the door.

209
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,140
- I want to talk to you.
- This is my room, Duoduo.

210
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,060
Why do you always criticize me? Tell me.

211
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,300
- This is my room, Duoduo.
- Make it clear.

212
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,540
- Second floor.
- Let's go back to your room.

213
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,180
Yeah, this is the second floor.

214
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,700
Li Dafu.

215
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,380
Where are you going, Duoduo?

216
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,820
- Li Dafu.
- Come back.

217
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,220
I'm looking for you.
Can't you hear me, Li Dafu?

218
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,240
- Li Dafu, come out.
- Duoduo, Duoduo.

219
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,700
- Li Dafu.
- Come on, come on.

220
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,140
Why are you dragging me?

221
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,570
Shao Nian.

222
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,380
Shao Nian.

223
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,260
Uncle Li.

224
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,820
Did you call me just now?

225
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,060
No.

226
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,340
Didn't you hear any noise?

227
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,860
What noise? I was sleeping.

228
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,220
Go to bed early.

229
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,660
If there's anything, tell me.

230
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,380
You should sleep early too, Uncle Li.

231
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,660
Duoduo, get up.

232
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,260
Slowly, slowly.

233
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,780
Li Dafu.

234
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,100
Stop calling. Your dad just came.

235
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,940
Li Dafu.

236
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,900
Duoduo, stop talking.

237
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,020
Your dad is coming. What if he scolds you?

238
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,580
Shao Nian!

239
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,060
- What are you doing?
- I didn't do anything, Uncle Li.

240
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,300
- Do you want to die?
- Uncle Li.

241
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,140
Li Dafu, you're finally here.

242
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,660
I just want to ask you.

243
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,140
Why do you always criticize me?

244
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,900
I've worked really hard.

245
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,420
I like playing beach volleyball.

246
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,780
I want to follow in your footsteps.

247
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,980
Why do you always criticize me?

248
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,060
Always criticize me.

249
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,780
Come on.

250
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,860
I know I'm not suited for beach volleyball,

251
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,700
but I just like playing it.

252
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,380
Why don't you ever support me?

253
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,380
Why do you only know

254
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,740
how to criticize me?

255
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,900
Why can't you encourage me just once?

256
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,700
Li Dafu.

257
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,340
Am I really that unsatisfactory to you?

258
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,420
Dad.

259
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,620
Can't you support me just once?

260
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,020
After all these years,

261
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,500
Uncle Li,

262
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,020
actually, Duoduo

263
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,060
really wants your approval.

264
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
I understand

265
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,900
what my daughter says.

266
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,100
I don't need you to translate.

267
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,300
- There, there.
- Dad.

268
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,220
There, there.

269
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,300
Don't cry.

270
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,460
Li Dafu, you...

271
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,300
- There, there.
- What's wrong with you?

272
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,180
You're not my friend anymore.

273
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,820
Go sleep in the living room.

274
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,420
How dare you act like this in my house?

(Xingang University)

276
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,540
I'll go back to the dorm by myself.

277
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,900
Stop following me.

278
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,620
Who's following you?

279
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,500
We're on the same path back to school.

280
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,650
By the way,

281
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,220
how's it going

282
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,340
with the video?

283
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,300
My friend checked.

284
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
So far, we can only find out

285
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,460
where the video was posted from,

286
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,260
but we can't find out who posted it.

287
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,900
What about the surveillance?
Can we see anything?

288
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,540
The place where the video was shot

289
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,860
is a blind spot.

290
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,980
What surveillance could have captured it?

291
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,300
Nothing visible, huh?

292
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,020
But I saw a shadow

293
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,380
on the TV.

294
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,460
I'm not sure what it was.

295
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,500
Have you offended anyone?

296
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,980
Kidding me?

297
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,220
Could I have offended anyone in Beijing?

298
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,660
Then

299
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,180
you should ask yourself.

300
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,820
Think carefully.

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
She switched to playing beach volleyball.

304
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,140
Thanks.

305
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,620
Who switched to beach volleyball?

306

Lang Yueting.

307
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,660
She just posted it on her Moments.

308
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,500
Look.

Keep pushing forward.)

Alright, I'm off.

311
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,860
Such great jumping ability and perfect skills.

312
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,460
She'll be invincible in beach volleyball.

313
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,300
Such great jumping ability and perfect skills.

314

Dad, Shao Nian.

320
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,180
Why are you guys sleeping here?

321
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,860
You're awake.

322
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,420
You still have the nerve to talk.

323
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,100
You're a girl.

324
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,220
No more drinking from now on.

325
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,060
I'll heat up some soup for you.

326
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
You were drunk too?

327
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,060
Such a strong alcohol smell.

328
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,980
Such a strong alcohol smell?

329
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,340
Smell it. Where does it come from?

330
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,420
And think about what you did

331
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,460
after getting drunk last night.

332
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,940
What did I do last night?

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,020
What did you do?

334
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,980
Think about what you said

335
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,020
to your dad

336
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,300
after getting drunk last night.

337
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,300
I'm telling you.

338
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,660
It's a good thing you drank at home,

339
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,740
with your parents and friends around

340
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,580
to take care of you.

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,220

You're still a girl.

345
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,900
You can't drink like that outside.

346
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,260
Can you take responsibility for yourself?

347
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,740
How am I not responsible for myself?

348
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,820
You're still arguing.

- I would've...
- What would you have done last night?

352
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,460
Uncle Li, last night,

353
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,860
I shouldn't have let Duoduo drink.

354
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,340
I should've let her drink soup,

355
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,980
just like the soup you're bringing now.

356
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,460

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,340
Bro,

370
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,660
go back and change now.

371
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,500
They smell sour.

372
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,380
Hold on.

373
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,780
The scent on your clothes smells nice.

374
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,820
Did you change the detergent?

375
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,660
Don't ask nonsense.

376
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,500
Did some girl

377
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,460
wash your clothes?

378
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,180
You said you'd find a girlfriend
to wash your clothes.

379
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,050
Did you find one so quickly?

380
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,950
I'm not wasting time with you.

381
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,820
Go change now.

382
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,620
Send me a WeChat message later.

383
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,980
Bye-bye.

384
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,980

389
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,180
Did you see that?

390
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,050
The São Paulo student team

391
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,180
is coming to our school.

392
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,740
Maybe we can have a friendly match.

393

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,380
(Pain in the right wrist joint,
weakness in the wrist)

395
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,940
I borrowed a book from you

396
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,900
for writing.

397
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,060
The cafeteria's serving lunch. Want to go?

398
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,500
You go ahead.

399
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,340
I'll be there soon.

400
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,780
Alright, I'm going then.

401
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,940
Why are you carrying so many books,?

402
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,910
Shh.

403
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,460
(Wrist)

404
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,380
They're all in Chinese.

405
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,660
Why are they so hard to understand?

406
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,220
Could you have some sort of reading disorder?

407
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,060
Don't talk.

408
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,180
Let me finish this section.

409
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,780
What kind of books did you get?

410
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,900
Bone Regeneration.

411
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,940
Spine, Regenerative Therapy.

412
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,260
These are all textbooks for my major.

413
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,300
Why are you reading these?

414
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,820
Is someone in your family injured?

415
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,660
Is it Uncle Li or Auntie?

416
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,940
Do they need to go to the hospital?

417
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,820
No, no.

418
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
Then who's injured?

419
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,020
Chen Weilan.

420
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,500
Chen Weilan?

421
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,980
She was fine playing volleyball

422
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,860
a few days ago.

423
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,920
If I hadn't seen her medical report,

424
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,780
I wouldn't have known

425
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,540
she's been training with an injury.

426
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,900
I'm worried her old injury might flare up.

427
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,020
If it gets serious,

428
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,100
what will she do if she can't play?

429
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,500
So, I need to think of a solution for her.

430
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,100
If necessary,

431
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,060
I'll take her to the hospital.

432
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,060
But, Duoduo,

433
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,420
you know Chen Weilan well.

434
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,820
She's a seasoned athlete.

435
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,180
She must know her injuries best.

436
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,620
If she doesn't want to go to the hospital,

437
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,180
I don't think you can persuade her.

438
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,900
Liqiang has good news.

439
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,580
Now, the São Paulo University team

440
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,350
is confirmed to come.

441
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,980
He wants us to go to the activity room
for a meeting.

442
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,980
Didn't you know

443
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,020
about this a few days ago?

444
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,100
I thought we'd just get

445
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,500
to see their match.

446
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,900
But now their team

447
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,980
wants to have a match with us.

448
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,260
Really? That's great.

449
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,340
If that's the case,

450
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,020
I need to think of a solution

451
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,020
for Weilan quickly.

452
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,700
Liqiang, Liqiang.

453
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,620
Is it true?

454
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,060
That's awesome!

455
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,580
The São Paulo student team is so famous.

456
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,300
If we can win

457
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,960
(Tutorial for Passing the Ball)
the friendly match,

458
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:23,910
our team will be famous.

459
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,460
Then our beach volleyball team

460
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,100
will be packed with people.

461
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,700
Hey, kid, wake up.

462
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,500
Though the São Paulo team is coming

463
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,820
and wants to play a friendly match,

464
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,740
the school doesn't want us to play.

465
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,820
Why don't they want us to play?

466
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,340
It's a bit complicated.

467
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,500
It's actually simple.

468
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,220
Our team was just established.

469
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,300
We have no experience.

470
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,780
We'd just be giving them a free win.

471
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,750
Who wants that embarrassment?

472
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,580
I do.

473
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,140
No.

474
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,540
What I mean is

475
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,300
the São Paulo student team

476
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,860
is one of the best in the world.

477
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,460
If I had a chance to play against them,

478
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,540
I don't think it would be shameful to lose.

479
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,020
The spirit of competitive sports

480
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,900
is about fighting and competing.

481
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,420
Actually, I think Duoduo is right.

482
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,290
If I were the school leader,

483
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,260
I'd be moved by your words.

484
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,460
Where are you going?

485
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,490
I'm going to find Secretary Zhou.

486
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,700
Why?

487
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,340
I'm requesting to compete.

488
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,980
Our purpose for engaging

489
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
in sports activities

490
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,420
is to strengthen our bodies.

491
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,060
So,

492
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,700
this kind of match is unnecessary.

493
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,460
Don't strive for victory and glory.

494
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,180
What's important for us

495
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,740
is to overcome ourselves,

496
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,380
not to defeat others.

497
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,620
But Secretary Zhou,

498
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,020
do you know why the Qing Dynasty fell behind?

499
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,900
It was because we closed ourselves off
from the world.

500
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,620
We only saw ourselves,

501
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,540
but didn't see others.

502
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,060
Why did we open up and reform?

503
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,260
It's because we could

504
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,580
see a bigger world

505
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,700
and better understand ourselves.

506
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,060
Emperor Taizong of Tang said,

507
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,270
"Using others as a mirror
can correct one's clothes."

508
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,580
Now, São Paulo University

509
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,780
is such a mirror.

510
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,420
Seeing how excellent they are,

511
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,980
we know how to improve ourselves

512
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,500
and how

513
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,380
to overcome ourselves.

514
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,740
Well.

515
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,860
You make some sense.

516
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,980
But

517
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,340
São Paulo University

518
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,060
is a traditionally strong team.

519
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,100
Our school's team

520
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,780
was just established.

521
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,900
I'm worried

522
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,580
it might hurt the confidence

523
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,780
of the team members.

524
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,580
Secretary Zhou,

525
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,180
they came all the way here

526
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,060
and asked to play a match with us.

527
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,500
It's an honor for us.

528
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,580
If we don't accept the challenge,

529
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,340
they might think we're cowards

530
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,100
and take this news

531
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,260
back to Brazil,

532
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,320
which would damage the school's reputation.

533
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,780
Our confidence,

534
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,380
compared to the school's reputation,

535
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,740
is nothing.

536
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,860
That's right, Secretary Zhou.

537
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,820
We're thinking

538
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,220
of the school's honor, too.

539
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,060
Secretary Zhou,

540
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,820
although our beach volleyball team

541
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,820
was just established,

542
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,140
we can still accept the challenge.

543
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,980
- Right?
- Right!

544
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,060
Don't worry. We definitely won't

545
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,300
disgrace Xingang University.

546
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,460
Speaking of which,

547
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,220
I remember

548
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,340
we have a volleyball player

549
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,100
named Chen Weilan.

550
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,340
Yes, yes.

551
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,700
I personally

552
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,540
approved her back then.

553
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,180
I heard

554
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,780
she's also on your team, right?

555
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,660
Yes, yes.

556
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,620
She's a volleyball prodigy.

557
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,390
With her here, there's no need to worry.

558
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,120
In that case,

559
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,970
I'll contact

560
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,820
the São Paulo University immediately.

561
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,820
From now on,

562
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,740
our school's honor

563
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,780
is in your hands.

564
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,210
Great! Thank you, Secretary Zhou.

565
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,340
But

566
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,780
I have one condition.

567
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,660
Chen Weilan must play

568
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,260
and represent Xingang University in the match.

569
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,420
Since she's a prodigy,

570
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,260
she should bring glory to the school.

571
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Don't worry, Secretary Zhou.

572
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,740
Beach volleyball is a two-player sport.

573
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,660
Let Chen Weilan

574
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,300
choose her own partner.

575
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,740
They need to work well together

576
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,120
to win this friendly match.

577
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,340
Alright, don't worry, Secretary Zhou.

578
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,970
You can do this.

579
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,020
- We can do this.
- We can do this.

580
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,940
Why are you here alone?

581
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,860
I'm worried about Chen Weilan.

582
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,220
What's wrong with her?

583
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,740
Today, Secretary Zhou requested her

584
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,500
to represent Xingang in the friendly match.

585
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,580
I'm not sure if she can handle it.

586
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,420
Just because of that?

587
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,740
Her wrist is injured.

588
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,980
If her wrist injury flares up,

589
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,020
I don't know if she could make it.

590
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,620
No need to worry so much about it.

591
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,860
Chen Weilan has a lot of experience in sports.

592
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,260
If her wrist injury was serious,

593
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,700
she would have told us long ago.

594
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,260
She wouldn't risk her career

595
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,780
over one match.

596
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,580
I hope so.

597
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,860
Secretary Zhou said

598
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,500
Chen Weilan has to play

599
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,740
against São Paulo University.

600
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,850
Of course.

601
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,220
It has to be the best player.

602
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,780
Who will play with me?

603
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,380
That's what we need

604
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,300
to discuss today.

605
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,140
Secretary Zhou said

606
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,300
you should choose your own partner

607
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,340
since you know best

608
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,460
what kind of partner you need.

609
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,940
I get to choose?

610
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,620
Me! Pick me!

611
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,700
Her.

612
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,700
Why Wen Xin?

613
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,500
We both play indoor volleyball,

614
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,140
so we should be able

615
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,580
to work together better.

616
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,260
But neither of you has played beach volleyball.

617
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,260
Isn't it easy to transition

618
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,620
from indoor to beach volleyball?

619
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,260
Plus, we still have some time before the match.

620
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,100
We can train for it.

621
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,500
Can you get used to the sand?

622
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,100
- No problem.
- Okay.

623
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,420
Do we need to tell Secretary Zhou?

624
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,900
No, I'll let him know.

625
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,460
- Okay.
- So it's settled.

626
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,220
You all can discuss freely now.

627
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,100
Weilan.

628
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,740
- Duoduo.
- Today...

629
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,700
She just wants to win

630
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,820
this friendly match.

631
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,050
We two can work together.

632
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,250
- I know.
- It should be good, right?

633
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,620
Weilan,

634
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,620
why don't the two of us

635
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,660
be your sparring partners?

636
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,460
Sure.

637
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,860
Great.

638
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,180
Let's go.

639
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,420
How should we train later?

640
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,260
What should we practice?

641
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,540
- Should we start with passing?
- Or bumping?

642
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,500
Wait a minute.

643
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,260
What's up, Duoduo?

644
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,220
Duoduo.

645
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,380
What's going on?

646
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,140
During practice,

647
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,380
follow my instructions.

648
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,620
Wen Xin,

649
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,380
you'll handle the reception

650
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,740
and spiking.

651
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,420
Jing Xuan, when you spike,

652
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,820
try to aim towards Wen Xin.

653
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,380
Why?

654
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,220
Chen Weilan is quite skilled.

655
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,820
Though she may not be used to the sand now,

656
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,100
with her skills,

657
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,300
she'll adapt quickly.

658
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,380
Just do as I say,

659
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,220
okay?

660
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,260
But Duoduo,

661
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,780
if you don't explain,

662
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,500
it's hard for us to follow.

663
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,780
Duoduo,

664
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,900
you're her roommate.

665
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,460
Do you know something?

666
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,980
She has an injury on her hand.

667
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,820
She's injured?

668
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,620
Ask her to go to the hospital right away.

669
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,020
I thought the same,

670
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,340
but she's so strong-willed.

671
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,560
She wouldn't want others to know.

672
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,980
So, keep this a secret

673
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,940
and don't tell anyone else.

674
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,980
I understand your point.

675
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,340
Don't worry.

676
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,580
- Don't worry.
- Okay, thanks.

677
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,740
Let's go.

678
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,100
I don't get it.

679
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,860
What's up with you three today?

680
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,100
Why are we practicing passing all the time?

681
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,460
We're just trying to improve our passing

682
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,840
- before moving on to other things.
- Yes.

683
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,380
I can't pass well,

684
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,980
so I want to practice more with you.

685
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,340
Yes, Chen Weilan.

686
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,340
Passing is important in beach volleyball.

687
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,740
If the setting isn't good,

688
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,780
it's hard to spike.

689
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,460
Isn't spiking important?

690
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,940
Which one can score, passes or spikes?

691
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,020
If you want to keep practicing passes,

692
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,020
you can do it. I'm going to practice spiking.

693
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,460
We're not saying you can't practice spiking.

694
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,100
You just can't practice spiking for a while.

695
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,980
Do it later.

696
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,220
What?

697
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,900
Why can't I

698
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,820
practice spiking now?

699
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,780
As a professional athlete,

700
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,060
you should do something professional.

701
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,340
I don't understand what you're saying.

702
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,700
What does spiking have to do

703
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,580
with being professional?

704
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,580
If you were professional,
you wouldn't train with an injury.

705
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,460
Duoduo.

706
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,740
You told them, didn't you?

707
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,900
You all know, don't you?

708
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,460
You didn't need to share my business
with everyone.

709
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,460
I'm perfectly fine.

710
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,260
Weilan...

711
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,060
(Guoguo Duoduo)

712
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,020
(Dafu BBQ)

713
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,260
- Sir.
- Your skewers.

714
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,140
Thank you.

715
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,220
Please wait a moment.

716
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,300
Okay.

717
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
It smells so good today.

718
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,500
It's always like this.

719
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,580
Duoduo.

720
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,180
How's training been? Is it tiring?

721
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,100
The team is being disbanded.

722
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,580
The match is canceled too.

723
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,260
Why?

724
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,860
Are you still angry?

725
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,860
I didn't mean

726
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,980
to look at your injury report.

727
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,900
I saw it by accident.

728
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,780
But you saw it.

729
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,460
Why did you have to tell everyone?

730
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,420
I was worried

731
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,820
that if we didn't work well together

732
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,300
during training,

733
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,820
your condition might worsen.

734
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,620
This is my privacy.

735
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,100
Didn't I tell you not to meddle?

736
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,100
But we're on the same team now.

737
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,260
We're teammates.

738
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,340
I have an obligation to help you.

739
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,640
If you're injured,
I have a duty to help you heal.

740
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,260
Besides,

741
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,740
it's not shameful for an athlete
to get injured.

742
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,460
Many athletes get injured.

743
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,860
It's unavoidable.

744
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,020
Injuries should be treated promptly,

745
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,860
so you can perform better

746
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,420
in training and matches.

747
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,060
Is that the reason you told everyone?

748
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,740
To make them pity me?

749
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,500
Pity?

750
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,100
This isn't about pity.

751
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,540
This is for your own good.

752
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,580
We're all trying to help you heal.

753
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,540
We want to help you.

754
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,700
Li Guoduo,

755
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,540
I don't need that kind of help.

756
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,300
I know my own issues.

757
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,860
If you all keep playing like today,

758
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,180
going easy on me during training,

759
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,100
I don't see any reason

760
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,340
to stay on this team.

761
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,700
That's all.

762
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,100
Chen Weilan feels

763
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,700
her pride is hurt

764
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,980
and doesn't want to stay on the team.

765
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,460
What should I do?

766
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,900
I don't think that's possible.

767
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,940
Chen Weilan loves volleyball so much.

768
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,260
How could she just quit?

769
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,220
She's been training secretly every day.

770
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,060
Saying she won't play now

771
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,980
doesn't make sense.

772
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,100
She just said that in the heat of the moment.

773
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,540
Really?

774
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,540
It must be. Think about it.

775
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,380
Shao Nian.

776
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,500
- Coming.
- Serve the food.

777
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,860
Don't worry. I'll help you out.

778
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,540
Coming.

779
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,860
- That table.
- That table, right?

780
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,700
Okay.

781
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,860
Here you go.

782
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,700
This is the rest.

783
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,500
Okay, thanks.

784
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,300
Your wrist is fine, right?

785
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,300
Duoduo was worried you'd quit the team

786
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,620
and worried all night.

787
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,180
I never planned to quit the team,

788
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,580
but I also don't plan to forgive her.

789
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,180
Duoduo was wrong in this.

790
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,860
She even considered moving out of the dorm

791
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,180
to make it up to you.

792
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,700
Is it really that serious?

793
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,700
Move out?

794
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,740
Come on.

795
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,700
How childish.

796
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,540
Duoduo has always been like this.

797
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,940
You know her.

798
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,740
She's a bit clumsy.

799
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,780
Let me tell you.

800
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,540
My injury report is from a year ago.

801
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,340
Not only is she clumsy,

802
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,900
but her eyes aren't great either.

803
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,660
Your wrist injury

804
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,820
was from a year ago?

805
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,140
Duoduo thought

806
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,540
you were training with an injury

807
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,740
and felt bad for you.

808
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,260
Well, that's settled then.

809
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,660
No need to worry about you quitting the team.

810
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,420
I never thought about quitting the team.

811
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,780
She's the one overthinking it.

812
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,940
Why is she overthinking it?

813
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,380
Isn't it because she cares about you?

814
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,740
If she didn't care,

815
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,140
she could easily find another partner.

816
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,340
Does she care about me?

817
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,420
She cares about having a partner.

818
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,860
Duoduo loves beach volleyball.

819
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,460
From the day I met her,

820
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,180
she's never given up on it.

821
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,940
She would do anything for it.

822
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,500
Do you know

823
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,620
how worried she was

824
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,940
when she saw your diagnosis?

825
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,400
She was terrified you'd

826
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,640
have to stop playing beach volleyball

827
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,900
because of your injury.

828
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,020
She knows you're like her.

829
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,180
It's fine.

830
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,020
Okay.

831
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,860
Take a break.

832
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,860
Duoduo,

833
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,580
you saved the ball beautifully today.

834
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,020
If only I could spike

835
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,460
as powerfully as Weilan.

836
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,620
I've been practicing for so long

837
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,660
but still can't get it right.

838
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,500
If I had finished those spikes,

839
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,020
we wouldn't have lost so many points.

840
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,220
Take your time.

841
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,180
She's been professionally trained
for a long time.

842
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,140
And your defense and passing are already great.

843
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,020
If my spikes were stronger,

844
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,820
I could become a versatile player.

845
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,900
I need to practice hard.

846
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,820
You can do it. Keep going!

847
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,380
I can do it.

848
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,740
Weilan.

849
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,740
What's up?

850
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,980
I wanted to discuss something with you.

851
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,700
Go ahead.

852
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,060
We have just joined the beach volleyball team,

853
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,380
and this is our first time partnering.

854
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,580
We have some strong opponents ahead.

855
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,420
So...

856
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,460
Just say it.

857
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,060
So,

858
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,380
I've thought it over

859
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,460
and I might not be the best partner for you.

860
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,380
Someone else might be more suitable.

861
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,700
It doesn't matter who I play with.

862
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
Even a newcomer is fine.

863
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,820
Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?

864
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,980
It's okay.

865
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,580
(São Paulo University VS Xingang University)

866
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,260
Hey, everyone!

867
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,500
We're at the venue now.

868
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,780
Today's match

869
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,380
will be held here.

870
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,330
Intercollegiate matches like this

871
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,690
happen often.

872
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,860
Look at today's cheerleaders.

873
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,020
You guys are really in for a treat.

874
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,900
Xingang University is playing at home today,

875
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,700
and São Paulo University
has sent their international team.

876
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,300
The two players are back home for this match.

877
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,500
They must be confident too.

878
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,340
Let's look forward

879
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,820
to an exciting performance from both teams.

880
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,020
You guys are so lucky!

881
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,500
They're all so beautiful.

882
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,980
Let's take a selfie.

883
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,460
Come on, let's do the pose they want.

884
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,460
Come on, come on!

885
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,460
Stop taking pictures. Hurry up!

886
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,300
It's about to start.

887
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,460
Don't shout. Don't shout.

888
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,740
What's going on, Liqiang?

889
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,820
Got hit again?

890
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,420
Why are you here alone? Where are the others?

891
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,740
Chen Weilan said she was coming
from her grandpa's house.

892
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,350
Duoduo and Wen Xin
were coming from the school.

893
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,220
They haven't arrived yet?

894
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,460
Nope.

895
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:57,740
Let's wait a bit longer.

896
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,580
They should be here soon.

897
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,020
Okay.

898
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,700
Can the car be fixed?

899
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,460
We're running out of time. What do we do?

900
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,740
What should we do?

901
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,180
Let's take a cab.

902
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,060
Duoduo, there's a car over there.

903
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,290
Taxi! Taxi!

904
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,660
Go, go, go!

905
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,940
- Wen Xin, what's wrong?
- Sorry, sorry.

906
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,060
- Sorry, sorry.
- Are you okay?

907
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,500
What's wrong with you?

908
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,900
How's your foot?

909
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,300
I think I twisted my ankle.

910
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,340
Are you okay?

911
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,820
Let me take you to the hospital.

912
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,780
Okay, let's go.

913
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,900
No, no, no.

914
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,900
It hurts a lot.

915
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,260
How did it get so bad?

916
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,380
Hello, Shao Nian?

917
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,140
How's it going? Have you reached the venue?

918
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,260
We have a bit of an emergency here.

919
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,980
Wen Xin twisted her ankle.

920
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,380
Okay, send me your location.
I'll come to find you.

921
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,460
Alright, I'll send it right now.

922
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,700
Hurry over, please.

923
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,340
What time is it?

924
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,940
It's almost time.

925
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,060
Is it still hurting?

926
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,020
It's much better now.

927
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,860
Alright, alright.

928
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,980
Is the bone okay?

929
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,820
I've already told her.

930
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,660
She's on her way now.

931
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,540
You should go too.

932
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:18,900
Okay, then Wen Xin...

933
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,880
I'll take her to the infirmary.

934
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,660
Don't worry about me.

935
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,100
It's just a minor injury.

936
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,820
Focus on the match.

937
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,740
Xingang University's reputation

938
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,620
is on your shoulders.

939
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,820
- Go for it.
- Sure.

940
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,420
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

941
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,780
Hurry to the venue.

942
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,580
I'll rest a bit and head back on my own.

943
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,500
There's no one around now.

944
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,620
Be honest with me.

945
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,580
Why are you pretending to be injured?

946
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,500
This

947
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,060
is a real injury.

948
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,740
When I treated your sprain today,

949
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,620
I realized you could actually play.

950
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,980
But I didn't expose you

951
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,580
because I didn't want
to hurt Duoduo's feelings.

952
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,380
Duoduo has been abandoned once

953
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,020
in a match.

954
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,460
I don't want her to be abandoned a second time.

955
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,020
You misunderstood.

956
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,060
I never intended to abandon her.

957
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,780
I've long noticed

958
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,580
Weilan excels at offense.

959
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,380
Spiking is her specialty.

960
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,100
And Duoduo,

961
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,220
with her quick reflexes,

962
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,100
is excellent at defense.

963
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,380
Think about it.

964
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,260
One is the strongest spear.

965
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,740
The other is the sturdiest shield.

966
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,060
I think they're the perfect pair.

967
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,780
But before today,

968
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,140
I never knew

969
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,620
how to let them

970
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,980
team up.

971
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,540
Then I accidentally fell today,

972
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,380
and that gave me this idea.

973
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:57,860
Do you really think

974
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,020
they make a good team?

975
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,980
As long as they work well together,

976
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,580
today's match will be fine.

977
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,980
Alright, you should get to the venue.

978
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,500
I'll head back soon.

979
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,620
Are you okay managing your injury alone?

980
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,340
Go. Don't miss the match.

981
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,900
Alright, I'll go now.

982
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,900
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

983
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,620
I'm here. I'm here!

984
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,620
How's Wen Xin's foot?

985
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,300
Wenxin is fine.

986
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,540
Shao Nian has taken her to the hospital.

987
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,500
It should be nothing serious.

988
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,780
Hospital?

989
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,540
What do we do now?

990
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,780
The match is about to start.

991
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,780
I'll take her place.

992
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,300
But we haven't played together even once.

993
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,140
Are you sure?

994
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,420
I'm sure. Don't worry.

995
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,580
I'll play my best.

996
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,340
Okay then.

997
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,180
That's all we can do.

998
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,300
Hurry and change.

999
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,660
Okay, I'll do my best.

1000
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,140
I can do this. I can do this.

1001
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,460
- Make sure to coordinate.
- Okay.

1002
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,340
Are you sure?

1003
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,620
We don't have any other options.
