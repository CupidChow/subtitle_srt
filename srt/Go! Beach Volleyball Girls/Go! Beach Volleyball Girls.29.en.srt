Duoduo.

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,840
Duoduo, let me explain.

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,860
Explain what?

22
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,200
What I said to my mom

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,780
was just to get her to sponsor it.

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,560
But that's not

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,580
what I heard.

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,560
I had to say that,

27
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,620
so my mom would agree.

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,480
Shao Nian,

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,960
if how we have

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,420
to win sponsorship,

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,620
I'd rather not have it.

32
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,720
Duoduo.

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,740
The reason we made it this far

34
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,540
is all due to your love
and dedication to the sport.

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
And now, with such

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,680
a big league coming up,

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,600
I don't want anything

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,020
to hinder your dream.

39
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,360
I know how happy it is

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,640
to do what you love.

41
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,100
I want you to be happy.

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,800
Do you think

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,780
I can be happy

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,460
without seeing you?

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,580
Sorry, I...

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,760
I was just too eager

47
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,140
to help you secure sponsorship.

48
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,380
I didn't think it through

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,980
before I told my mom.

50
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,800
So you

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,160
gave up painting

52
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,220
to work at the hospital

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,700
for me.

54
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,480
Right?

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,340
You've done so much for me.

56
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,060
I'm just realizing it now.

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,920
Thank you.

58
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,880
But

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,420
I don't want you to give up anything you love.

60
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,180
I hope we can always chase our dreams

61
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,940
and do what we love most.

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,740
That's the happiest thing.

63
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,860
Actually, for me,

64
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,540
the happiest thing

65
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,220
is having you by my side.

67
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,600
Duoduo, I had

68
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,020
a friend who knows the internet

69
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,740
find the first batch of posts that exposed you.

70
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,320
They were sent from a phone

71
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,780
using different accounts.

72
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,280
I've sent the specific path

73
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,340
and phone number

74
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,560
to you.

75
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,460

Why did you call me over

78
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,800
so late?

79
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,540
Do you remember

80
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,980
our first beach volleyball game?

81
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,500
What do you want to say?

82
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,700
How did we end up like this?

83
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,520
If you called me here

84
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,500
to reminisce,

85
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,280
sorry, I don't

86
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,420
have time for that.

If I post this online,

90
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,020
will I be able to clear my name?

91
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,840
This is a misunderstanding.

92
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,960
I didn't know it was you.

93
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,380
Why did you do it?

94
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,040
Are you worried that my

95
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,940
new league's success

96
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,340
would affect your previous championship?

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,100
The championship means nothing to me.

99
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,140
I don't even like beach volleyball.

100
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,020
Then why did you do it?

101
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,940
Because of Shao Nian.

102
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,660
He likes beach volleyball.

103
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,920
That's why I worked hard

104
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,660
to win the championship.

105
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,620
He likes beach volleyball,

106
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,160
so I wanted to prove to him

107
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,360
how excellent I am.

108
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,040
But he doesn't care.

109
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,120
He only has eyes for you.

110
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,820
I hate you. Do you know that?

111
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,760
If it weren't for you,

112
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,140
I would've had a chance.

113
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,560
So whatever I do,

114
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,460
you'll stop me.

115
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,080
Did you never think I would find out?

116
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,260
What if you did?

117
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,440
If Shao Nian stays away from you and hates you,

118
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,760
I'll do anything.

119
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,020
You'll do anything?

120
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,400
Then what about this?

121
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,280
Whatever you do,

122
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,560
the result won't change.

123
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,060
You won't get what you want.

125
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,580
I'm not here

126
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,080
for any purpose.

127
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,620
I'm not here to say anything to you.

I want to tell you

129
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
I can't forget

all our memories

131
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,900
and happy times.

132
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,620
I believe you can't forget them either.

133
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,020
As for this evidence,

134
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,660
I won't tell anyone.

135
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,100
I won't post it online.

I also hope

we can have a fair

Today, I must get into Ocean University.

157
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,020
So, I need a stronger partner.

We can't partner up forever.

After we start university,

161
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,180
we'll still need to change partners.

162
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,460
So you've been resenting me?

163
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,860
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

164
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,780

Did you ever consider my feelings?

167
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,620
I didn't consider your feelings?

168
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,040
Don't forget.

169
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,520
We're not just partners.

170
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,640
We're also classmates.

171
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,720
We've been high school classmates
and best friends

172
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,200
since sophomore year,

173
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,340
inseparable until now.

174
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,100
I didn't consider your feelings?

175
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,900
Do you remember this coat?

176
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,560
You always liked it

177
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,600
but never bought it

178
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,740
because it was too expensive.

179
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,880
We saved our pocket money for 3 months

180
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,920
to finally buy it.

181
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,900
For what?

182
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,800
So we could

183
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,640
wear it together

184
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,060
and get into Ocean University.

about what I truly care about.

188
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,840
You're selfish

189
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,060

Guessed right.

327
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,960
She refused yesterday.

328
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,940
Why is she here today?

329
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,320
How could it be Shao Nian's mom?

330

is their family business.

is a fair and open competition.

340
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,220
And our league has gained a lot of popularity.

341
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,480
Many schools are willing

342
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,320
to participate.

343
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
We hope to give

344

volleyball enthusiasts

345
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,500
a chance to achieve their dreams.

346

Very good, very good.

It sounds like

350

It aligns with our company's mission.

How about this?

353
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,020
Prepare a detailed budget.

354
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,500
Then we'll discuss

355
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,720
the specifics.

356
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,840
No problem.

357
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,320

358

Right away.

359

Good.

360
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,240
Looking forward to our cooperation.

361
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,100
Looking forward to it.

362
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,680
Yes, me too.

363
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,040
Thank you.

Ms. Sun.

366
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,780
Wait a moment.

367
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,720
What is it?

368
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,000
Auntie,

369
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,600
are you sponsoring us because

370
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,300
Shao Nian promised	not to see me anymore?

371
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm sponsoring your competition

372
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,920
because it aligns

373
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,140
with our company's mission.

374
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,820
It has nothing to do with anyone.

375
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,600
Anyway,

376
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,780

377
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,800
By the way,

378
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,700
I want to tell you something else.

379
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,420
For now,

380
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,020
Shao Nian and I won't be meeting.

381
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,720
What do you mean?

382
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,980
We agreed that the most

383
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,380
important thing now

384
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,020
is to focus on our own tasks

385
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,700
and become better people.

386
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,180
Thank you again.

387
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,840
Goodbye, Auntie.

388
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,080
Thanks.

389
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,400
This kid

390
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,540
is really stubborn.

391
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,660
(Forming the Committee, Funding)

392
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,000
Great.

393
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,640
Now the funding issue is solved.

394
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,820
We just need to
find a referee team and a venue.

395
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,220
We must find

396
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,180
a good, proper venue.

397
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,300
The best venue around here

398
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,260
is Ocean University's beach volleyball court.

399
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,040
But so far,

400
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,020
Ocean University hasn't registered a team.

401
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,160
It'll be hard for us to use

402
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,000
their venue.

403
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,100
I'll handle

404
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,460
the venue.

405
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,820
You get the referees ready.

406
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,640
Wow, Coach, you're amazing.

407
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,940
Of course. No big deal.

408
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,460
- Great.
- Great.

409
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,200
For our New Seven-School League,

410
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,860
we must ensure fair and impartial refereeing.

411
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,840
How can we assure everyone

412
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,720
that our referees

413
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,980
are fair and impartial?

414
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,400
I have an idea.

415
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,620
Let all the participating players vote.

416
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,240
The referees with the most votes

417
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,420
will form the referee team.

418
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,600
I believe this way,

419
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,100
no one will have objections.

420
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,200
Good.

421
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,800
Good.

422
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,960
Xiaoxue, watch your wrist.

423
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,220
Use your palm strength, Xiaoqi.

424
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,360
Wrist, wrist.

425
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,560
Palm strength.

426
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,320
Coach Tian.

427
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,160
Coach Lu.

428
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,140
I have good news.

429
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,480
The new league is almost ready.

430
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,040
You guys are quick.

431
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,880
Of course.

432
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,240
I'll handle publicity and sponsorship.

433
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,760
Li Guoduo will find referees.

434
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,500
Our team is very enthusiastic.

435
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,180
Coach Tian, do you want to join us?

436
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,640
Coach Lu,

437
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,720
do you need my help

438
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,580
with something?

439
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,980
You know me well, Coach Tian.

440
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,240
I wasn't

441
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,420
planning

442
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,680
to trouble you,

443
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,820
but

444
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,940
Ocean University's

445
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,940
beach volleyball court

446
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,200
is top-notch

447
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,520
and authoritative.

448
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,900
Do you want to use our venue?

449
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,560
But our school

450
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,020
hasn't joined the competition.

451
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,460
Your competition is self-organized,

452
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,100
without any authority.

453
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,620
The school won't support your request.

454
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,560
Coach Tian, you know

455
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,000
that the professionalism of a league

456
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,820
depends on the athletes' level.

457
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,080
Besides,

458
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,120
our participants

459
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,160
are selected

460
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,000
from the old league.

461
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,520
I know that.

462
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,000
You don't need to tell me.

463
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,860
But it's not up to me.

464
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,820
Think of another way.

465
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,040
Coach Tian,

466
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,640
you know

467
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,740
how much effort Li Guoduo

468
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,420
has put into this new league.

469
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,900
Now we just need the venue.

470
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,560
You can't

471
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,680
let it fail

472
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,540
because of this.

473
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,520
Fine, it seems

474
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,780
you aren't

475
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,200
very interested either.

476
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,040
Forget about it.

477
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,220
Don't feel bad.

478
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,200
Our competition isn't good enough

479
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,060
for your school.

480
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,120
Alright, I'm leaving.

481
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,000
Have Li Guoduo

482
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,840
treat you to a meal.

483
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,300
Lu Xiaole.

484
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,320
What's up?

485
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,560
I'll try,

486
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,660
but it might not work.

487
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,680
Okay.

488
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,380
(Who is your favorite referee?)

489
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,340
Everyone, come see this.

490
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,520
I just posted it ten minutes ago,

491
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,300
and it already has over 100 replies.

492
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,720
Look.

493
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,920
See?

494
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,760
Over a hundred.

495
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,660
Isn't that Li?

496
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,460
He's really stubborn.

497
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,060
Inviting him won't be easy.

498
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,260
These referees are veterans.

499
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,180
- This one.
- Forget about refereeing.

500
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,080
Just getting them together

501
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,140
for a meal is a rarity.

502
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,320
Plus,

503
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,900
many of them are retired.

504
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,920
Let's not worry about that now.

505
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,160
We'll write down the names

506
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,580
and do a vote.

507
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,300
Let's write down the names.

508
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,540
- Okay.
- Look.

509
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,200
(Coach Zhou)
Zhou?

510
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,040
Yes.

511
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,280
I've only heard

512
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,840
- of this coach.
- I know him.

513
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,020
- Never met him.
- Zhou.

514
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,160
After all,

515
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,360
this league

516
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,600
is a self-organized

517
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,980
student competition.

518
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,160
It's not big

519
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,420
and lacks authority.

520
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,580
I don't think the school

521
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,800
will agree.

522
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,920
Coach Tian,

523
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,100
our school isn't participating.

524
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,460
Why are you so concerned?

525
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,940
I have connections with them.

526
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,360
Seeing them so dedicated

527
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,420
to this event,

528
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,740
I want to help if I can.

529
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,920
Those kids

530
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,060
really love beach volleyball.

531
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,720
We mustn't dampen

532
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,980
their enthusiasm.

533
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,720
I think

534
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,420
the school has two concerns.

535
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,880
First,

536
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,380
the previous league

537
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,140
caused a huge stir.

538
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,280
If the new league

539
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,100
becomes a public focus,

540
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,360
any small mistake

541
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,880
will be magnified.

542
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,540
It's easy to get caught in the spotlight.

543
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,100
Second,

544
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,140
this league

545
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,860
is a self-organized

546
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,240
small event.

547
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,560
So I think it's hard

548
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,020
to convince the school.

549
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,580
I have an idea.

550
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,440
What is it?

551
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,780
I need your cooperation.

552
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,160
Director Li,

553
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,580
without competition, there's no progress.

554
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,340
As a coach,

555
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,020
I want my team

556
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,620
to bring glory to our school.

557
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,700
Without games, how can we achieve that?

558
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,940
Yes, yes.

559
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,080
Coach Tian,

560
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,080
how can you say that?

561
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,920
You know

562
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,680
how much funding your club gets

563
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,220
every year, right?

564
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,540
This isn't about funding.

565
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
We just want to borrow

566
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,220
the school's venue.

567
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,320
But our university

568
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,260
isn't participating.

569
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,060
If you lend them the court,

570
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,740
what about the costs? Like the utility,

571
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,840
maintenance,

572
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,980
and staff's overtime.

573
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,160
Who's going to cover those costs?

574
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,040
Mr. Li,

575
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
you're a teacher.

576
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,560
Don't always think about money.

577
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,800
What's more,

578
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,040
if the court is occupied,

579
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,360
our team's training

580
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,260
will be affected.

581
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,780
Both of you, calm down.

582
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,760
Ms. Tian wants to do this

583
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,620
for the school's reputation.

584
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,960
- Exactly.
- Director.

585
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,420
If it's for the school's reputation,

586
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,140
take the team to compete provincially

587
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,700
or nationally.

588
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,860
Bringing outside teams here,

589
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,260
what does that achieve?

590
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,120
Do you think the school is a hotel or a mall,

591
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,240
making money from this?

592
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,260
Can you be reasonable?

593
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,340
Did I complain when you

594
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,580
organized the track meet?

595
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,440
The track stays there

596
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,520
whether it's used or not.

597
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,760
The court is different.

598
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,080
How is it different? Tell me.

599
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,700
- What's different?
- Let him explain.

600
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,200
Can we stop arguing?

601
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,920
Let's sit down and discuss this calmly.

602
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,760
Okay?

603
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,320
Director Li,

604
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,280
why can they host the track meet,

605
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,300
but we can't host the league?

606
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,340
If you keep pushing,

607
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,160
I'll have to find

608
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,440
and rent a place outside

609
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,340
for the competition.

610
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,920
Tian, don't think you can do
whatever you want

611
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,760
because of your name.

612
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,900
Going outside for a venue

613
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,820
is a slap in our school's face.

614
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,560
I firmly oppose this

615
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,480
disloyal behavior

616
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,120
that harms the school's reputation.

617
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,700
- Who's being disloyal?
- Mr. Li.

618
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,780
Your statement is inappropriate.

619
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,800
Ms. Tian has high esteem

620
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,100
at our school.

621
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,200
Besides...

622
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,840
Lu Xiaole!

623
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,000
Shut up.

624
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,740
Lu Xiaole, are you crazy?

625
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,320
Coach Tian!

626
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,280
Listen to me.

627
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,120
Let me explain.

628
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,840
I didn't know you two

629
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,880
were coordinating.

630
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,560
I thought he was insulting you.

631
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,620
What did you think?

632
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,160
The leaders were about to agree,

633
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,420
and you messed it up.

634
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,840
I didn't mean to.

635
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,060
I just couldn't stand him
treating you like that.

636
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,060
Lu Xiaole, who are you to me?

637
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,900
How can you interfere in my matters?

638
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,060
I'm not belittling you,

639
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,200
but you're just

640
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,320
a troublemaker.

641
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,340
What can you accomplish?

642
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,680
Tian Qing,

643
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,460
don't underestimate me.

644
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,720
It's just a training court.

645
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,660
I'll handle it myself.

646
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,480
- Is everything ready?
- In the bag.

647
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,320
- Let's do it.
- OK.

648
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,800
- We'll complete the task.
- Yes.

649
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,820
We can do it.

650
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,400
Let's go.

651
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,040
Alright, change your pose.

652
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,540
Lower your head slightly.

653
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,860
Smile, smile.

654
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,380
Look more innocent.

655
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,940
More innocent.

656
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,020
Didn't you hear me say innocent?

657
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,980
Have you been a model before?

658
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,940
I said innocent. Got it?

659
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,000
Yes.

660
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,300
I'll try to get it.

661
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,500
Girl, don't move.

662
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,640
Alright, alright.

663
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,480
Stand still.

664
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,360
Pose again.

665
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,860
Smile, smile.

666
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,200
Good, good.

667
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,100
Alright, change poses.

668
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,160
Come on, come on.

669
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,900
Lower your head a bit.

670
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,500
Don't move.

671
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,680
Alright.

672
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,660
Alright.

673
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,680
Change pose again.

674
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,520
Come on, come on.

675
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,160
- Good. Don't move.
- Hello, Mr. Zhang.

676
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,000
- I'm a student from Xingang Uni.
- Alright.

677
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,160
We'd like you to be a referee

678
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,220
- for the new league.
- Alright.

679
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,260
I've changed careers, no longer a referee.

680
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,340
Alright, alright.

681
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,020
Girl, that last pose was good.

682
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,740
Girl, why aren't you moving?

683
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,400
You know each other?

684
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,960
Mr. Zhang,

685
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,380
are we still photographing?

686
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,600
Yes, let's continue.

687
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,360
I'll handle the lighting.

688
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,620
Sure, come on.

689
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Come on, come on.

690
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,480
Good.

691
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,320
How about this?

692
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,200
Yes, aim the light at her face.

693
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,340
- Come on.
- Alright.

694
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,460
Alright, alright.

695
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,100
Xia, is Mr. Yang suitable?

696
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes, he's a seasoned volleyball referee

697
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,160
from Xingang Sports School.

698
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,680
He's officiated nearly 200 matches

699
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,640
without mistakes.

700
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,320
200 matches? That's impressive.

701
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,160
Of course.

702
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,120
Let's go.

703
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,600
Mr. Yang, isn't it

704
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,560
boring refereeing here?

705
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,580
Come to our competition.

706
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,960
Who are you?

707
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,320
Hello, Mr. Yang.

708
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,180
We're the staff of the new league.

709
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,800
Mr. Guan,

710
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,620
the former prodigy from Xingang,

711
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,180
was selected for the NYT.

712
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,720
He got injured and retired,

713
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,560
and became a referee.

714
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,340
He's known as the Iron Whistle.

715
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,600
Five years ago,

716
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,340
at the national league held in Xingang,

717
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,680
he single-handedly

718
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,180
challenged the entire referee team,

719
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,640
overturning three

720
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,820
controversial calls in the final.

721
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,480
The Xingang University team

722
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,780
lost the game because of this.

723
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,200
Since then, he left

724
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,420
the referee circle.

725
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,640
At that time,

726
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,500
he was called a traitor to Xingang,

727
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,100
but because of this,

728
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,740
he became the most respected and fair referee

729
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,820
in the eyes of all players.

730
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Such a referee

731
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,440
is well-deserving to be

732
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,480
the head referee

733
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,380
of our new league.

734
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,140
All the other referees are settled.

735
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,100
He's the last one.

736
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,820
(Spicy Crayfish)

737
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,660
- Mr. Guan.
- Your crayfish.

738
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,260
Mr. Guan, Mr. Guan.

739
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
We sincerely want to invite you this time.

740
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,820
You don't need to say anything more.

741
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,460
If you want to eat crayfish,

742
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,660
you're always welcome.

743
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:22,960
But

744
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,960
nothing else.

745
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,160
Mr. Guan, Mr. Guan.

746
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,620
Wherever you go today, we'll follow.

747
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,160
We sincerely hope you can

748
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,520
be our referee for the league.

749
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,360
- Enough.
- We...

750
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,600
I can see it now

751
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,960
you're not

752
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,920
very interested

753
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,900
in my crayfish.

754
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,780
You should go back.

755
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,100
- Mr. Guan.
- Mr. Guan.

756
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,480
You are highly regarded

757
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,980
as one of the top referees among students.

758
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,080
But honestly, these crayfish

759
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,900
are very ordinary.

760
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,000
- Hey.
- Weilan.

761
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,080
What do you mean?

762
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,700
I mean your crayfish are not tasty,
and they lack flavor.

763
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,860
What are you doing? Stop talking.

764
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,740
I'll make you a new batch.

765
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,280
Thank you.

766
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,280
What are you doing?

767
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,120
Sit down.

768
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,480
Here.

769
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,720
This batch

770
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,560
is on the house,

771
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,500
and it's well-seasoned.

772
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,580
Let's see

773
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,340
if you can handle it.

774
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,000
Go ahead.

775
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,020
It is well-seasoned.

776
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,780
It looks really spicy.

777
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,400
Go ahead.

778
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,000
Who's afraid?

779
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,260
It looks so spicy.

780
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,920
So spicy.

781
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,380
- Too spicy.
- Too spicy.

782
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,180
How do you feel?

783
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,180
Spicy.

784
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,900
So spicy, so spicy.

785
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,770
Oh, my god.

786
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,430
Too spicy.

787
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,660
Really...

788
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,290
We still have to eat it.

789
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,030
It's tasty.

790
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,770
Are you okay?

791
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,640
Too spicy.

792
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,500
Li Guoduo, can you still eat?

793
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,720
Let me do it. I'm telling you.

794
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,560
I'll handle

795
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,760
all of it.

796
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,240
- Can you handle it?
- Can you?

797
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,900
Yes. Let me tell you.

798
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,120
I usually don't show it,
but I can handle spice.

799
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,540
Then why didn't you start earlier?

800
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,960
It's tasty.

801
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,180
- What's wrong?
- What's with your face?

802
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,840
Gao Ge

803
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,720
Why are you having a rash on your face?

804
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,900
It's all red.

805
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,520
I'm fine.

806
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,920
I just have

807
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,860
a slight allergy to shrimp.

808
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,700
- You're allergic to shrimp?
- Why eat it?

809
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,420
Stop eating. You need to go to the hospital.

810
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,440
- Come on.
- Quickly.

811
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,500
Hurry up, hurry up.

812
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,640
Let's go. Let's go.

813
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,200
Let's go.

814
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,260
(Floor Plan of the Court)

815
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,840
What's this?

816
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,560
The court.

817
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,580
I can't tell from this.

818
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,680
This is our university's court.

819
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,720
If we can change a bit

820
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,780
and add a row of stands,

821
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,460
it can be turned into a venue.

822
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,900
You can't fool me with this.

823
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,880
This isn't fooling.

824
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,560
The inspiration came from your school's

825
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,600
beach volleyball court.

826
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,920
Of course, it's not comparable.

827
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,800
But...

828
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,700
Anyway,

829
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,980
we have a venue now.

830
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,380
It sounds like an idea,

831
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,200
but to transform it

832
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,620
into a formal venue

833
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,660
would cost a lot.

834
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,020
Necessity breeds resourcefulness;
being poor teaches thrift.

835
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,820
This is my expertise.

836
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,040
I've scheduled a meeting with the suppliers

837
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,880
for tonight.

838
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,480
Do you want to come with me

839
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,260
and see my persuasive skills?

840
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,320
I'm not going.

841
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,660
I'm hungry. I need to eat first.

842
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,740
This?

843
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
What's wrong with this?

844
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,920
Do you want it? There's a seafood flavor.

845
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,800
Never mind.

846
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,640
Come on.

847
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,420
I'll show you real culinary skills.

848
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,960
Let's go.

849
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,340
Can you cook?

850
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,160
Ring the bell after the IV drip.

851
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,000
Thank you.

852
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,880
You're welcome.

853
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,720
You're awake.

854
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,300
You slept for quite a while.

855
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,680
It's nothing serious.

856
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,220
I just look worse than I feel.

857
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,860
I'll be fine in a bit.

858
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,260
You really scared us.

859
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
You knew

860
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,800
you were allergic to shrimp,

861
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,920
but you still ate it.

862
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,980
Why act tough?

863
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,840
I saw you

864
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,140
couldn't finish it,

865
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,980
so I wanted to help you out.

866
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,500
I got anxious and forgot.

867
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,340
Why help me?

868
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,060
I wasn't just helping you.

869
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,900
I was helping myself.

870
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,720
I was really afraid

871
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,920
that if you ate all that chili,

872
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,240
you'd say something

873
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,120
unpleasant

874
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,660
and burn me with your words.

875
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,540
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

876
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,540
- Can you be nicer to the patient?
- Sorry.

877
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,060
I get it. I get it.

878
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,040
Li Guoduo.

879
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,640
Hello?

880
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,480
Hello, how's Gao doing?

881
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,320
He's awake.

882
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,680
I have good news.

883
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,820
Gao made it.

884
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,700
Guan agreed to be our referee.

885
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,240
Really?

886
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,080
Of course.

887
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,960
Tell him quickly.

888
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,300
Okay, I'll let him know.

889
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,900
- Bye.
- Bye.

890
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Guess what?

891
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,240
What?

892
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,020
Mr. Guan agreed.

893
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,620
Really?

894
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,500
Still itchy?

895
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,020
But it's worth it.

896
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,140
It's just

897
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,280
you've suffered.

898
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,040
It's okay.

899
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,420
Dinner's ready.

900
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,320
Come taste it.

901
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,480
Our dorm's conditions

902
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,420
are limited.

903
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,740
The induction cooker might not make great food.

904
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,940
I'm impressed, Lu Xiaole.

905
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,800
I didn't know you could cook.

906
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,140
The ingredients are just average.

907
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,740
The key is who's cooking

908
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,140
and for whom

909
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,940
it's cooked.

910
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,080
You really make a big deal

911
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,100
out of it.

912
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,200
But

913
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,660
the food is indeed delicious.

914
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,940
Eat more if you like it.

915
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,900
I'll get you some soup.

916
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,040
Don't mind me saying this.

917
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,660
Listen to me.

918
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,240
Well.

919
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,580
You aren't young anymore.

920
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,180
You can't keep eating instant noodles.

921
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,460
They're not nutritious.

922
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,440
You should eat better.

923
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Women should take care of themselves.

924
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,260
You're perfect

925
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,220
inside and out.

926
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,960
You shouldn't worry

927
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,660
about trivial things.

928
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,980
At our age,

929
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,600
who would

930
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,020
dare to date you if you

931
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,660
continue like this?

932
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,180
Thanks for dinner.

933
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,600
I'm full.

934
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,940
At least let me finish.

935
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,740
Coach Tian, I want to date you.

936
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,260
Coach Tian, at 8:30 pm...

937
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,660
How can the food ruin this?

938
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,180
Mr. Qi, come see.

939
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,800
This is our future main venue.

940
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,480
It's dark now, so it's hard to see clearly,

941
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,400
but the scenery is very nice.

942
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,240
Look.

943
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,700
The area is big enough.

944
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,360
With stands on both sides,

945
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,220
it becomes an official venue.

946
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,600
It won't be hard.

947
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,440
Coach Lu,

948
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,020
according to your blueprints,

949
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,380
it won't be

950
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,420
a simple task.

951
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,940
Materials and labor

952
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,540
will cost a lot of money.

953
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,100
Mr. Qi, rest assured.

954
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,900
You'll get your money.

955
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,020
Not a penny less.

956
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,520
But

957
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,660
can you give us a discount

958
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,020
on your quote?

959
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,660
Listen.

960
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,100
I got too emotional today.

961
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,500
Your cooking is pretty good.

962
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,940
Just verbal apologies?

963
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,100
Don't push your luck.

964
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,080
Then how about

965
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,480
you're punished

966
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,380
by eating my cooking for a month?
