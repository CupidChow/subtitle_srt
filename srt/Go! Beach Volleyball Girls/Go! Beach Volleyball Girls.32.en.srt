18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,460
From indoor volleyball to beach volleyball,

19
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,100
I don't see much improvement.

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,700
Isn't it too early in the morning for this?

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,060
My granddaughter's won many championships.

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,820
Isn't that good enough?

23
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,940
I'll get some more porridge.

24
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,000
Weilan,

25
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,820
I want to talk to you.

26
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,640
Look.

27
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,860
you promised me

28
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,240
that if you didn't make the NYT,

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,380
you'd go abroad with me.

30
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,440
But you broke your promise,

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,500
and I didn't say anything.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
Then you decided to attend Xigang,

33
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,860
and I still didn't say anything.

34
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,060
But do you know
what your biggest problem is now?

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,420
It's your wrist injury.

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,420
If you don't heal it properly,

37
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,620
another injury could mean

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,860
saying goodbye

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,620
to volleyball forever.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,360
You may not like the life

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,740
I planned for you,

42
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,820
but how do you know it's bad

43
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,580
if you haven't experienced it?

44
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,180
You should at least respect my wishes.

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,220
I want you

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,580
to go abroad

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,720
to think carefully

48
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,020
about what kind

49
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,360

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,560
Lower.

54
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,360

Weilan's mad at you?

78
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,440
Sort of.

79
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,920
I...

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,460
I said the wrong thing that day.

81
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,220
Why did you tell them that?

82
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,400
Are we supposed to bear the blame forever?

83
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,220
I just wanted to prove our strength.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,180
I know you want to,

85
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,220
but such matches

86
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,260
drain you greatly.

87
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,500
Do you know that?

88
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,780
Compared to clearing our name,

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,420
this little exhaustion is nothing.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,780
Really? You said that to her?

91
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,580
I was just being honest.

92
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,520
Girls need to be coaxed,

93
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,800
not lectured.

94
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,260
Anyone would be mad that way.

95
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,440
Well.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,940
Should I lie to her?

97
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,140
You can't lie, but you

98
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,320
need to understand

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,380
talking to girls requires skill.

100
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,080
When you compliment her,

101
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,660
make it subtle.

102
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,940
Even if she's wrong,

103
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,300
encourage her positively.

104
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,300
Chen Weilan just wants to play.

105
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,360
You don't support it.

106
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,380
But how can you stop her?

107
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,020
Right, right, right.

108
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,380
I was too harsh.

109
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,800
After all, she's risking

110
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
getting injured for this.

111
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
Exactly.

112
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,240
So what should I do?

113
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,480
Apologize.

114
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,040
But

115
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,340
if you don't want to apologize,

116
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,740
there's another way.

117
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,920
What way?

118
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,700
Just find another path.

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,220
Like Yang Jingxuan.

120
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,580
Go away.

121
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,000
You're full of bad ideas.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,840
Then you should

123
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,760
switch to Tu.

124
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,020
Why would I switch to Tu Lingling?

125
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,100
What's wrong with you?

126
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,060
I'm helping you. This is what I get?

127
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,500
Your ideas are so lousy.

128
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,280
Alright.

129
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,160
Weilan.

130
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,680
Weilan!

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
Put some effort in!

132
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,940
Coach Lu, have you seen Weilan?

133
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,300
Can't you look for yourself?

134
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,060
Where could she go?

135
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,840
Fine, I'm leaving.

136
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,180
- Where to?
- To find her.

137
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,380
The spike is in vain.

138
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,640
Dad.

139
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,800
Dad.

140
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,900
I've packed most of the things.

141
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,700
I've booked tomorrow's flight.

142
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,380
You're too strict with Weilan.

143
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,580
I still think

144
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,960
whether she plays beach volleyball

145
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,780
or does other sports,

146
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,110
as long as

147
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,130
she likes it,

148
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,460
we as adults should support her.

149
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,080
Dad,

150
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,380
I'm not against her playing.

151
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,980
She'll have better opportunities abroad.

152
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,160
Rest assured.

153
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,360
I've arranged

154
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,860
a good school for her over there.

155
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,740
How could I be at ease?

156
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,610
What's so great about abroad?

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,360
Is their education

158
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,100
really better than ours?

159
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,840
If so, why do they still lose

160
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,380
to us in some competitions?

161
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,040
Yes, yes.

162
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,580
That's not what I meant, Dad.

163
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,860
You've misunderstood me.

164
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,320
Look.

165
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,960
We have

166
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,220
the financial means now.

167
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,960
While Weilan is young,

168
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,400
sending her abroad to gain

169
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,480
more experience and learn

170
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,660
isn't a bad thing.

171
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,000
I've checked out

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,140
their beach volleyball team.

173
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,180
They don't even have a professional coach.

174
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,040
They're just relying on the kids'

175
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,740
physical fitness and skills.

176
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,000
In the long run,

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,420
it's a waste of time.

178
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,740
And Dad, you see

179
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,740
Weilan's wrist

180
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,460
needs to be treated.

181
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,900
If she continues like this,

182
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,980
she might not be able to play anymore.

183
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,180
I'm doing this for her good.

184
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,740
I hope you can support me.

185
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,540
Anyway, on this matter,

186
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,100
Weilan and I are of one mind.

187
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,900
As long as she agrees,

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,140
I won't oppose it.

189
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,100
You're her mom. You talk to her.

190
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,640
Duoduo, come on.

191
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,660
Come in.

192
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,320
Thanks, Grandpa.

193
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,780
Here to see Weilan?

194
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,060
Is she here?

195
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,560
Hi, Auntie.

196
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,880
Hello.

197
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,780
Are you leaving, Auntie?

198
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,360
Yes.

199
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,320
Sit for a while.

200
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,380
I'll continue packing.

201
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,020
She's leaving.

202
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,460
So is Weilan.

203
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,980
They're going abroad.

204
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,020
Weilan's going abroad?

205
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,220
Why suddenly?

206
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,120
Her mom thinks

207
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,460
it's better for her development,

208
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,720
and her hand

209
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,900
hasn't healed.

210
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,740
She's taking her for treatment.

211
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,380
It's all for her good.

212
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,160
Yes.

213
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,820
It's all for the kid's good.

214
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,830
- Hello?
- Weilan.

215
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,700
I've packed your luggage.

216
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,580
I've booked tomorrow's flight.

217
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,820
I hope you

218
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,820
think carefully.

219
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,180
If you agree,

220
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,220
come with me tomorrow.

221
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,520
Alright.

222
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,900
I'll go abroad with you.

223
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,960
Good.

224
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,180
I'll wait for you at home.

225
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,340
I came to apologize.

227
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,560
I shouldn't have said

228
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,820
those hurtful things.

229
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,460
I'm not mad.

230
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,080
That's good.

231
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,880
By the way,

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,520
why didn't you train today?

233
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,580
You didn't answer my calls.

234
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,240
You don't know

235
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,700
how worried they were, like ants on a hot pan.

236
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,460
Only I could find you.

237
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,440
Did something happen?

238
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,980
Nothing.

239
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,100
It's just that maybe...

240
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,720
Weilan,

241
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,780
I don't know what happened,

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,180
but I'll support

243
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,900
any decision you make.

244
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,120
Thanks.

245
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,880
Bon voyage.

246
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,220
For our dreams.

247
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,800
Duoduo.

248
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,000
What's wrong?

249
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,840
You look so worried.

250
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,060
I just went to find Chen Weilan.

251
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,980
Grandpa said

252
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,980
she might go abroad.

253
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,920
Going abroad?

254
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,900
She didn't mention it.

255
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,020
Because her hand hasn't healed,

256
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,880
and her mom thinks

257
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,300
it's better for her development.

258
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,580
You don't want her to go?

259
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,460
Of course.

260
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,820
Our team just won the new league championship.

261
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,240
We were finally becoming

262
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,500
more in sync.

263
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,300
But if she's really going,

264
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,100
I have to support her.

265
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,480
But Duoduo,

266
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,140
have you asked her yourself?

267
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,600
Right.

268
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,820
I only heard about it.

269
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,960
I haven't asked her directly.

270
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,800
Right?

271
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,340
I'll go ask her.

272
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,580
Are you really leaving?

273
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,820
Do you have to go abroad?

274
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,900
If I don't

275
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,140
heal my hand,

276
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,520
I won't be able

277
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,020
to play,

278
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,460
let alone with you.

279
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,900
So I agreed to go with my mom.

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,060
When are you leaving?

281
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,800
Tomorrow.

282
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,120
For how long?

283
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,320
Will you come back?

284
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,820
I don't know how long I'll be gone.

285
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,460
I never thought you'd really leave.

286
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,980
But since you've decided,

287
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,320
I'll support you.

288
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,520
Duoduo,

289
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,940
thank you for helping me

290
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,180
with my mental block.

291
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,100
But no one can

292
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,100
help me with my hand.

293
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,460
I have to face it myself.

294
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,120
So while I'm away,

295
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,300
go find

296
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,620
a new partner quickly,

297
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,690
adapt soon,

298
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,540
and face the challenges ahead.

299
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,960
Don't worry.

300
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,540
When you see me next time,

301
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,640
I'll be a very healthy

302
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,480
Chen Weilan.

303
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,280
Thanks.

304
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,660
Xia, what's up?

305
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,460
You'll know soon.

306
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,380
You heard Chen Weilan is leaving, right?

307
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,180
I know she's leaving.

308
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,820
You know she's leaving?

309
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,960
You know it too?

310
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,900
Duoduo told us.

311
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,880
Gao Ge, I know

312
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,780
you're upset.

313
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,060
If it were me,

314
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,980
I wouldn't get over it soon either.

315
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,180
It's alright, bro.

316
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,300
I know she's leaving to heal.

317
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,600
And

318
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,820
for better opportunities.

319
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,920
I don't have the right

320
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,860
to keep her here.

321
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,520
I don't.

322
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,580
That's your reaction?

323
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,340
What else can I do?

324
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,780
Confess.

325
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,020
Tell her face-to-face that you like her.

326
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,260
Do you want her to leave with regrets?

327
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,600
Gao,

328
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,600
if you don't confess now,

329
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,660
you'll lose your chance.

330
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,460
Yes, bro.

331
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Don't leave any regrets.

332
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,100
Yeah, what are you afraid of?

333
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,980
The Gao Ge I know

334
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,460
isn't a coward.

335
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,660
I want to...

336
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
I want to confess to her.

337
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,700
- But I...
- Don't worry.

338
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,740
We've arranged everything else.

339
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,180
All that's left is your courage.

340
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,080
Think of tomorrow's confession

341
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,060
as a competition.

342
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,140
Weilan is the championship trophy.

343
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,840
Don't worry.

344
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,940
With all of us here,

345
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,820
you won't lose this match.

346
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,760
One, two, three.

347
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,600
Go!

348
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,640
What are you filming?

349
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,560
I'll post this online.

350
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,960
- Give me your phone!
- Stop!

351
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,480
Put it down. What are you filming?

352
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,800
- Stop filming!
- Delete it!

353
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,080
- Stop filming.
- Filming you.

354
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,120
- Stop!
- Don't touch me.

355
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,960
Delete it.

356
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,840
- Stop.
- Just wait.

357
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,360
Don't stop me. Don't stop me.

358
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,200
Weilan,

359
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,560
Yesterday,

360
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,740
I suddenly thought about the first time we met.

361
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,200
You recorded

362
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,060
a video of me fighting.

363
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,540
I was really angry.

364
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,380
I swore I'd find you

365
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,500
and make you apologize.

366
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,820
Unexpectedly, we met the next day.

367
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,620
Then we started bickering every day.

368
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,700
You began teasing me and annoying me.

369
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,420
I had a bad temper.

370
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,660
You made me lose sleep every time.

371
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,500
I kept thinking of ways

372
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,180
to get back at you.

373
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,920
One day, I managed

374
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,580
to make you lose sleep.

375
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,340
When I returned to the dorm,

376
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,540
I realized that I didn't

377
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,460
want to upset you.

378
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,860
I started worrying about you.

379
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,700
If you couldn't sleep, would you feel unwell?

380
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,560
I found

381
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,940
that what I wanted each day

382
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,260
was just to see you a bit more.

383
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,580
Since then,

384
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,660
my impression of you

385
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,700
began to change.

386
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,560
You became someone

387
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,920
positive,

388
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,960
optimistic,

389
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,700
and willing to do a lot

390
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,820
for your dreams.

391
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,860
I still couldn't sleep,

392
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,180
with my mind full of you.

393
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,960
In the end,

394
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,660
I started hating my cowardice.

395
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,400
I hated that I wasn't there

396
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,620
for you when you were hurt.

397
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,000
I hated myself

398
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,860
for not daring to confess my feelings

399
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,460
when I took you to treat your wrist.

400
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,840
I hated that I didn't

401
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,180
tell you all this sooner.

402
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,980
I've been a coward.

403
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,960
Today,

404
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,460
I don't want to be a coward anymore.

405
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,680
Weilan,

406
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,900

No. I'm not sad.

But I think

450
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,820
our confession ceremony today

451
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,420
was quite successful.

452
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,240
Look at Weilan.

453
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,220
She seemed touched and happy.

454
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,400
What kind of confession do you like?

455
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,320
A grand one

456
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,780
or an unexpected one?

457
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,780
Why should I tell you what kind I like?

458
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,580
Who will you tell then?

459
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,960
Tell...

460
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Xia Liqiang.

461
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,460
Why would you tell Xia Liqiang?

462
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,780
Stop joking. Tell me what kind you like.

463
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,760
OK, I'll tell you.

464
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,000

Give me that.

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,220
- I can do it.
- Your hand can't.

471
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,580
this is our home.

472
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,720
Close the door.

00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,640
Come in, come in.

474
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,780
I'll show you around.

475
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,840

Unlike in China with apartments.

478
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,940
This is the dining room.

479
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,200
There's a kitchen.

480
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,340
Tell me if you want to eat something.

481
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,460
We have plenty of time now.

482
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,700
I'll cook for you.

483
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,260
Let me show you around.

484
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,420
This is a small living room.

485
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,580
There's a study here.

486
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,760
Your room is upstairs. Let's go.

487
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,220
When will we go to the hospital?

488
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,860
What's the rush?

489
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,120
We just arrived.

490
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,460
Don't we need to rest?

491
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,000
I've arranged a language teacher for you.

492
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,420
You'll study English tomorrow.

493
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,160
Why do I need English lessons

494
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,420
to see a doctor?

495
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,460
Learning English

496
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,000
will help you integrate soon

497
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,100
into the environment here.

498
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,980
Language barriers can be very limiting.

499
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,200
I came here to treat my wrist.

500
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,580
Do I have to stay long?

501
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,300
Why integrate into life here?

502
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,700
With maps so convenient now,

503
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,380
I can find my way to the hospital myself.

504
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,720
Anyway, learning English

505
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,060
won't harm you.

506
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,180
I've found a teacher.

507
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,420
Lessons tomorrow.

508
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,900
Hospital the day after.

509
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,200
Is that okay?

510
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,700
Can we go upstairs, Missy?

511
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,420
Aren't these things all mine from before?

512
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,440
Yes, I found things that match

513
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,700
what you used to have.

514
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,620
They might not be exactly the same,

515
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,980
but they're quite close.

516
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,180
It must have been hard to find them.

517
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,800
It wasn't too bad.

518
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,340
It took some effort,

519
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,460
but I managed to get them.

520
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,140
See if there's anything missing,

521
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,580
and I can look for it.

522
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,760
Alright.

523
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,900
You should get some rest.

524
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,520
The bathroom is the first door on the right

525
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,540
when you step out.

526
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,040
Get some rest.

527
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,420
Thanks, Mom.

528
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,460
Just try not to upset me.

529
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,660
I've arrived.

530
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,680
Hello.

531
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Why are you calling me now?

532
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,520
Yeah.

533
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,620
I miss you.

534
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,780
How was the flight? Was it tiring?

535
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,000
Not too bad.

536
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,580
Just a bit long.

537
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,660
We're gonna check my wrist
the day after tomorrow.

538
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,440
Okay.

539
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,160
Let me know

540
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,100
the results right away.

541
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,080
Of course.

542
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,100
Where are you now?

543
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,520
Take a look.

544
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,940
Still training?

545
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,180
Why are you so diligent all of a sudden?

546
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,020
Because you left.

547
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,900
I can only relieve my sorrow through training.

548
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,240
You're really glib now.

549
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,740
Did you learn this from Xia Liqiang?

550
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,140
Maybe it's because I'm in love.

551
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,060
It's different now.

552
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,040
Today is

553
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,540
our first day together

554
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,960
and also

555
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,300
the first day without you.

556
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,260
Sixteen hours have passed since I left.

557
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,600
You're being

558
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,880
so sappy.

559
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,320
I can't take it.

560
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,140
Alright, I'll stop.

561
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,060
It's already midnight here.

562
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,460
It's got dark.

563
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,280
My mom said she got me

564
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,100
an English teacher tomorrow.

565
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,140
I have a class.

566
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,720
I'm going to take a hot shower

567
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,620
and then go to bed.

568
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,470
Okay.

569
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,800
Get some rest.

570
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,720
Okay.

571
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,420
Don't overexert yourself during training.

572
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,720
Alright.

573
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,940
- Bye.
- Bye.

574
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,440
(Activity Room)
Coach Lu.

575
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
I'm Gao Ge.

576
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,580
Hey, Gao. What's up?

577
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,560
I was wondering if it's still possible

578
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,660
to join the NYT tryouts this year.

579
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,300
Why are you suddenly interested in applying?

580
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,760
Coach, if there's

581
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,220
still a spot and time permits,

582
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,560
count me in.

583
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,940
Thank you in advance.

584
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,600
Sure.

585
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,480
Okay.

586
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,100
Her condition is improving.

587
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,720
Our recommendation is

588
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,100
more medication and plenty of hot water.

589
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,280
I've written it all down for you.

590
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
- Not serious.
- OK.

591
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,680
A minor surgery will let her recover

592
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,520
- Thanks.
- soon.

593
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,400
Thank you.

594
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,000
Once the surgery is done, she'll be

595
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,120
on the path to recovery.

596
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,360
- Yes.
- OK.

597
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,660
Thank you, doctor.

598
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,400
The doctor said

599
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,680
your hand

600
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,920
only has muscle and ligament strain,

601
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,330
no damage to the bones or joints.

602
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,700
So a minor surgery

603
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,940
will heal it in a month.

604
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,250
Do I need surgery?

605
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:26,980
Don't worry.

606
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,800
It's a minor surgery.

607
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,640
With me here,

608
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,000
you'll be fine.

609
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,900
We can arrange it in the next couple of days.

610
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,640
No need to worry.

611
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,580
Everyone, hold on.

612
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,700
I have news.

613
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,240
Other schools have

614
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,200
heard about the vacancy in our team

615
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,060
and are eager to sign up as an extra

616
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,740
to pair with Li Guoduo.

617
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,360
Here's the signup sheet. Take a look

618
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,200
and pick someone.

619
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,040
No need.

620
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,680
Duoduo,

621
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,000
we understand you're not used to it

622
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,260
as Weilan went abroad.

623
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,060
But you can't train alone forever.

624
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,880
Yeah, Duoduo.

625
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,100
You really need a partner.

626
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Really, it's fine.

627
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,220
I can train alone.

628
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,500
Training alone is one thing.

629
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,800
What about the games?

630
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,980
Ms. Guo, congratulations.

631
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,260
Your daughter's surgery was successful.

632
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,900
However, she should

633
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,320
avoid any intense physical activity for now

634
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,540
to prevent a relapse.

635
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,680
With proper rest,

636
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,800
I believe she will fully recover

637
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,140
and return to her previous form.

Have a sip.

649
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,840
You'll sleep well tonight.

650
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,680
Here.

651
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,040
Thank you.

652
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,920
Weilan,

653
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,940
do you love beach volleyball that much?

654
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,500
Yes, I do.

655
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,860
Do you know how happy I am when I play?

656
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,620
Nothing in the world

657
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,700
compares to that happiness.

658
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
I can't just give up

659
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,940
because of a minor injury.

660
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,980
All my years of training would be wasted.

661
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,040
Wouldn't it be better to follow the path

662
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,880
I've chosen for you?

663
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,020
Stay here to study and live.

664
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,100
If you still want to go back,

665
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,580
you can do so after graduation

666
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,220
with a bright future ahead.

667
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,880
Mom,

668
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,740
I don't want to repeat myself.

669
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,780
This is the life you want.

670
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,200
This is the life you want for me,

671
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,740
not the one I want.

672
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,120
I've drunk it. Come on.

673
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,960
Go on.

674
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,080
Get some rest.

675
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,220
I have two more sets to finish training.

676
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,560
Good night.

677
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,760
- Gao.
- Bro.

678
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,060
I'm looking for you. Come.

679
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,360
What's the rush?

680
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,320
Someone's here for you.

681
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,180
- Who?
- Stop dawdling, come on.

682
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,200
Aren't you always with the team?

683
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,220
Why suddenly?

684
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,160
You introduced us.

685
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,320
Here we are.

686
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,180
Coach Lu.

687
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,100
Good luck.

688
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,780
Come on, sit.

689
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,460
Coach Lu.

690
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,180
Why are you here?

691
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,120
You called to say you wanted

692
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,700
to apply for the NYT, right?

693
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,700
I spoke with them,

694
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,220
and the notice just came in.

695
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,840
So I came

696
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,980
to tell you in person.

697
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,240
Well.

698
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,420
What's the result?

699
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,980
You got in.

700
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,400
Really?

701
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,500
But you need to pass a test.

702
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,920
Given your good physical condition

703
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,060
and strong basic skills,

704
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,660
it shouldn't be a problem.

705
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,480
Once you pass,

706
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,580
you can train with the NYT.

707
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,880
Thank you, Coach Lu.

708
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,500
I won't let you down.

709
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,740
Good luck.

710
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,040
I can do this.

711
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,520
I wondered why Gao
has been training so hard lately.

712
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,020
Turns out he wants to join the NYT.

713
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,720
Gao

714
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,300
really is dedicated.

715
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,940
What do you mean?

716
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,740
Something I don't know?

717
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,420
Chen Weilan left, right?

718
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,340
She really wanted to join the NYT.

719
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,020
Gao is helping fulfill her dream.

720
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,220
Wow.

721
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,420
He really can do anything for love.

722
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,840
Gao Ge joining the NYT is

723
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,340
a big deal for our club.

724
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,300
I need to call Tian Qing.

725
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,320
Hello?

726
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,780
Fine, fine.

727
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,540
I'm leaving now.
