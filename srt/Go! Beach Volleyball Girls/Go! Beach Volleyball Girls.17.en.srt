18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,460
What's this?

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,940
Isn't this my slimming tea?

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,240
The reason you had diarrhea

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,360
wasn't because of the BBQ

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,420
at Duoduo's place,

23
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,460
but because of this slimming tea.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,780
When did I drink it?

25
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,850
I...

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,240
What are you doing?

27
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,920
Stop it. This is my slimming tea.

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,780
Here.

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,060
Is it that spicy?

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,860
It's so spicy.

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,640
This slimming tea

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,660
contains orlistat.

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,180
One of its side effects is diarrhea.

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,920
That day, I drank it too.

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,140
Why am I fine?

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,720
That's normal.

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,240
Everyone has a different constitution.

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,580
Metabolism varies as well.

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
So the side effects

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,980
show differently.

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,160
You misunderstood Duoduo this time.

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,540
You need to apologize to her.

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,680
I've been eating our BBQ

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
for years

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,900
without any issues.

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
How come Yan Xiaojing

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,140
had problems with it?

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,660
Didn't she go to the hospital?

49
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,020
Do they have the lab report?

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,540
We need to see the lab report.

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,280
Now she thinks

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,160
no matter what,

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,520
it's all because of us.

54
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,180
She believes our place is shady.

55
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,560
Even the damage to our shop

56
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,600
is because of this.

57
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,860
So what do you want to do?

58
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,600
I don't care.

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,880
I need to find Yan Xiaojing and clear this up.

60
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,100
We can't leave it like this.

61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,680
Come in.

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,220
Duoduo.

63
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,460
I'm here to apologize.

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,820
They came to apologize.

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,540
Duo,

66
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,280
it wasn't your BBQ

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,180
that caused my food poisoning.

68
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,940
Shao Nian found the real reason.

69
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,120
I drank Xixi's diet tea that day.

70
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,740
I forgot about it.

71
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm sorry, Duo.

72
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,180
I've misunderstood you these days.

73
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,040
I'm really sorry.

74
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,940
Sorry.

75
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,180
Yes, it was the diet tea.

76
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,660
I had no idea Xiaojing would react so badly.

77
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,140
I'm really sorry.

78
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,420
I'm truly sorry.

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,420
Duo, really.

80
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,760
How could I have said

81
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,900
all those things to you?

82
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,660
It's my fault for being too hasty.

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,900
Your shop got damaged because of me.

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,820
Really.

85
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,460
So it was because of that?

86
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,000
It's fine now.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,620
At least we know the truth.

88
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,500
Let's just put this behind us.

89
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,640
About the BBQ shop,

90
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,420
it's mainly my fault.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,980
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,340
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,280
Well.

94
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,580
Duoduo, can you forgive us?

95
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,500
At the hospital that day,

96
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,760
I didn't handle it well either.

97
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,540
You were sick, and I was yelling at you.

98
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,340
That day,

99
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,180
I was a bit emotional too.

100
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,560
Okay.

101
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,500
It's been clear.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,840
Duoduo's BBQ is fine, right?

103
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,880
Yes.

104
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,400
Then let's just...

105
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,360
Well.

106
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,200
Duoduo, thank you

107
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,540
for forgiving us.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,480
I have one more favor

109
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,940
to ask.

110
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,320
Well.

111
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,640
She was trying to help me,

112
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,240
standing up for me.

113
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,780
This is all my fault.

114
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,080
Duo, I'm sorry.

115
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,840
About your BBQ shop.

116
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
We'll take full responsibility.

117
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
We'll compensate

118
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,640
for all the damages.

119
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,020
We'll pay for everything.

120
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,200
Could you please delete

121
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,780
that video of Du Weilong?

122
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,180
(Delete local file)

123
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,500
Done.

124
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,960
Thank you, Duoduo.

125
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,800
Thank you.

126
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,960
Thank you, Duoduo.

127
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,140
Thank you.

128
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,940
It's nothing.

129
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,380
I just hope our team

130
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,220
can be like a family

131
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,620
with mutual understanding.

132
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,300
No more suspicion or misunderstandings.

133
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,680
Thank you.

134
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,320
Okay.

135
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,460
Thank you, Duoduo.

136
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
No problem.

137
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,460
(Yu Lu: So happy to see Coach Lu today!)

138
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,480
Coach Tian.

139
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,400
Sorry

140
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,480
for keeping you waiting.

141
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,700
It's really not right.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,620
No worries. I came early.

143
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,580
Something's odd today.

144
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,540
Oh?

145
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,140
What's odd?

146
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,180
You're oddly charming.

147
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,620
Coach Lu, you're quite interesting.

148
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,520
Actually,

149
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,880
after we met last time,

150
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,380
I found that Coach Tian

151
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,620
is straightforward.

152
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,940
You're too kind.

153
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,640
Usually,

154
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,360
I'm busy coaching the team.

155
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,560
My mind is full

156
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,800
of strategies, tactics,

157
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,060
and technical guidance.

158
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,500
Without a wide social circle,

159
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,180
when it comes to compliments,

160
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,240
I'm quite slow.

161
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,100
My vocabulary is limited.

162
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,100
If I have

163
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,360
to put it another way,

164
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,200
when I was a kid,

165
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,780
my coaches

166
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,820
never taught me how to express emotions.

167
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,140
Coach Lu, you're funny.

168
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,200
Let's skip the formalities.

169
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,940
Today's meal is on me. What would you like?

170
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm not picky about food.

171
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
Anything is fine.

172
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,060
You order.

173
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,540
Alright.

174
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,240
If what I order isn't to your taste,

175
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,200
don't blame me.

176
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,260
No, no, no.

177
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,580
Anything you order will be great.

178
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,720
Waiter.

179
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,760
Hi.

180
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,860
Can I see the menu, please?

181
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,400
Thank you.

182
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,470
Thank you.

183
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,100
(Seafood and Steak Series)

184
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's get the Australian steak.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,780
Sure. How would you like it cooked?

186
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,960
I think

187
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,700
steak is good,

188
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,880
but wasn't there a wildfire in Australia?

189
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,080
All the grass got burned.

190
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,160
The cattle must be starving.

191
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,460
How can the beef be good?

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,140
Let's order something else.

193
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,640
Right.

194
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,420
Well.

195
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
How about

196
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,000
Japanese Hokkaido

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,640
king crab?

198
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,480
Alright.

199
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,060
Wait.

200
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,220
Well.

201
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,620
Isn't there a nuclear leak in Fukushima?

202
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,180
The king crabs

203
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,620
might be affected.

204
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,680
Hokkaido is far from Fukushima.

205
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,860
But still,

206
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,060
Japan is a small island.

207
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,160
We should be cautious

208
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,500
about what we eat.

209
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,400
So, what do you suggest

210
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
we eat?

211
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,380
You order.

212
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,280
Don't all ladies like

213
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,660
to eat green, healthy foods?

214
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,780
(Boston Salad $45)
This.

215
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,420
(Pea Soup $49)
This.

216
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,360
So, one salad

217
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,540
and one pea soup, right?

218
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,720
Yes.

219
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,380
One for each.

220
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,540
Got it.

221
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,880
Eating so lightly?

222
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,740
It's not light.

223
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,120
You're so beautiful.

224
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,280
Everything tastes good.

225
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,880
How about something else?

226
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,540
Something sweet or a main dish?

227
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,280
No, that's enough.

228
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,840
Okay, please wait a moment.

229
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,680
Thank you.

230
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,880
Please take your menu.

231
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,780
Sorry.

232
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,720
(Send this to Shao Nian.)

233
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,980
(He'll definitely like it.)

234
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,720
Your food is ready.

235
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,560
Enjoy your meal.

236
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,020
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

237
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,280
Coach Tian,

238
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,400
why did you ask me out?

239
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,900
Do you need my help with something?

240
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,720
Coach Lu,

241
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,020
since we're on this topic,

242
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,660
I wanted to ask about your experience

243
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,940
with the National Youth Team.

244
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,620
Actually,

245
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,640
it's pretty similar to now.

246
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,680
Mainly training

247
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,100
and competitions, nothing much else.

248
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,420
Could you be more specific?

249
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,020
Like when did you join the NYT?

250
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,980
And how do you usually train?

251
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,540
Am I asking too much?

252
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,160
I hope you don't mind,

253
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,160
but I really want to know.

254
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,300
No, no, no.

255
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,260
I've been organizing my thoughts.

256
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,100
Since you're

257
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,220
so interested in me,

258
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,300
let me introduce myself.

259
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,980
Well. I joined

260
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,960
the NYT

261
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,340
ten years ago.

262
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,040
For the first 5 years,

263
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,480
I was the head coach of the women's

264
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,700
beach volleyball team.

265
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,220
Then I transferred

266
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,360
to the men's beach volleyball team.

267
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,200
Generally,

268
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,860
we go to Hainan for winter training.

269
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,300
We divide it into three phases.

270
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,860
The first phase

271
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,700
focuses on recovery training,

272
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,980
strengthening the basics.

273
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,460
The second phase

274
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,500
is all about physical fitness,

275
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,500
enhancing the athletes' overall condition.

276
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,940
The third phase is

277
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,480
national training camps.

278
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,220
We compete with many teams

279
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,040
to improve tactics and skills

280
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,860
through real matches.

281
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,760
(Good thing I was prepared.)

282
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,300
(I knew you'd ask these.)

283
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,140
Actually,

284
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,000
I prefer my current job.

285
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,860
Well.

286
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,380
The NYT

287
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,460
was too dull.

288
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,160
Really?

289
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,980
You see.

290
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,140
At least here

291
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,260
I can

292
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,380
have meals with you.

293
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,940
Coach Lu, you're really interesting.

294
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,760
Have some soup.

295
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,220
Coach Tian,

296
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,180
you asked me

297
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,680
so many questions.

298
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,780
You should've known me a bit.

299
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,040
So,

300
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,240
can I ask you

301
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,660
a few questions?

302
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,900
Of course.

303
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,360
- Do you think...
- Sorry.

304
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,460
I have to take this call.

305
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,020
Hello, what's up?

306
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,780
Sprained your ankle?

307
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,100
Is it serious? Have you seen a doctor?

308
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,120
Okay. Enough.

309
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,380
I'm coming. Wait for me.

310
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,980
Coach Lu, I'm sorry.

311
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
My student got injured.

312
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,260
I need to go.

313
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:24,940
- Okay.
- So we...

314
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,420
You go ahead.

315
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,560
That question you asked...

316
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,760
- Let's leave it.
- Sure.

317
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,660
We still have time.

318
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,340
Waiter, the bill, please.

319
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,080
- Coming.
- No need.

320
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,940
You go ahead.

321
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,440
Thanks.

322
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,280
No problem.

323
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,580
Be careful on your way.

324
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,010
Hello?

325
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,440
Bro?

326
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,820
Why did I ask about the NYT?

327
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,060
I was just concerned about you.

328
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,300
Why do you keep bringing it up?

329
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
No worries.

330
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,060
I'm fine. Bye.

331
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,900
(Bro? The NYT?)

332
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,020
(What's up with Coach Lu?)

333
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,840
Sir,

334
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,060
your total is 239 RMB.

335
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,180
Is there a discount?

336
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,680
Sorry, sir.

337
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,520
No discount.

338
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,280
Miss,

339
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,100
can I make a deal with you?

340
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,160
I'll have my beach volleyball team

341
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,740
promote your place.

342
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,760
That's not possible.

343
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,900
WeChat or Alipay?

344
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,640
Exclusive sponsor.

345
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,780
Is WeChat okay?

346
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,440
Credit card.

347
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,340
Sure, sir.

348
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,240
To go.

349
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,780
Alright, please wait a moment.

350
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,020
Sir, here's your to-go order.

351
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,900
Please sign here.

352
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,580
Hope to see you again.

353
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,960
Lu Xiaole?

354
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,980
This drink's on me.

355
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,840
Good drink. Fill it up.

356
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,080
- Du Weilong.
- Fill it up.

357
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,060
Du Weilong.

358
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,620
Why are you here?

359
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,240
Why did you smash

360
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,860
Li Guoduo's BBQ shop?

361
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,020
Smash the shop?

362
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,820
I was standing up for you.

363
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,720
I only complained.

364
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,960
I didn't expect you to do it!

365
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,640
I did it to make you happy.

366
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,580
Come on, sit down.

367
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,680
Let's have a drink. Come on.

368
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,020
Sit down and drink.

369
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,740
Come with me.

370
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,740
Be right back.

371
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,180
Be right back.

372
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,420
What are you doing?

373
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,100
Apologize to Li Guoduo.

374
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,240
Mo Xixi,

375
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,240
are you crazy?

376
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,640
Why should I apologize?

377
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,480
Why?

378
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,600
She deleted

379
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,960
the video.

380
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,100
What more do you want?

381
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,140
I don't care. You need to apologize.

382
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,260
She's smart for deleting it.

383
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,480
If she hadn't,

384
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,180
her business would be ruined.

385
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,800
How can you say that?

386
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,940
We're teammates.

387
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,160
I don't care. Just apologize.

388
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,000
Come on.

389
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,460
What if I don't go?

390
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,460
We break up.

391
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,840
Break up?

392
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,100
It's not that easy.

393
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,240
Sweetheart,

394
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,080
listen to me.

395
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,540
Either you come in and drink with me,

396
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,100
or go home and sleep well.

397
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,980
We'll be fine tomorrow.

398
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,520
Okay?

399
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,780
(Xingang University)

400
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,640
Lu Xiaole.

401
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,760
You've finished your date,

402
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,440
The league is starting soon.

403
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,560
If you don't make a plan,

404
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,820
we'll be exposed.

405
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,500
Don't you have a plan?

406
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,300
Time to get your training book out.

407
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,040
In the qualifiers,

408
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,840
Chen Weilan and Li Guoduo

409
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,180
made many mistakes

410
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,260
with their quick attack combo.

411
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,600
Yan Xiaojing and Mo Xixi

412
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,160
were very stable together.

413
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,920
Chen Weilan's team lost this game,

414
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,840
which is a shame.

415
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,200
But luckily,

416
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,680
Chen Weilan's state

417
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,500
wasn't too affected.

418
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,200
We need to help them

419
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,320
master the quick attack combo

420
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,100
in training.

421
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,240
Impressive.

422
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,980
That's all Lu Daxing can do?

423
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,860
Should you ask Coach Lu Daxing again?

424
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,520
Is it necessary?

425
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,420
Of course, it is.

426
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,980
Don't you like Coach Tian?

427
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,480
You should learn

428
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,820
about beach volleyball too.

429
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,460
Who said I like Coach Tian?

430
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,440
When we were at the island,

431
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,260
your suitcase was full of things for girls.

432
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,020
You were always around her.

433
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,140
Anyone could tell.

434
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,700
You noticed?

435
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Bro,

436
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,560
can you be more reliable?

437
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,400
If I were you,

438
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,780
I'd at least study beach volleyball

439
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,360
like Shao Nian

440
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,540
to have something to talk about.

441
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,620
Yes.

442
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,620
You're right.

443
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,190
I'll call my brother now.

444
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,360
Put it on speaker.

445
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,340
Alright, alright.

446
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,180
(Lu Daxing)

447
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,280
Bro, what are you up to lately?

448
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,240
What's up? Hurry up.

449
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,660
I'm asking about beach volleyball.

450
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,940
What have you been training recently?

451
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,720
Us?

452
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,800
Today we trained passing

453
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,640
and spiking.

454
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,060
Why do you ask?

455
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,520
Well,

456
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,720
I have two relatives who want

457
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,640
to play volleyball.

458
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,140
Wanted to ask about it.

459
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,380
Relatives?

460
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,940
Whose relatives?

461
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,000
Your relatives

462
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,220
are my relatives, right?

463
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
Yes.

464
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,560
Yes.

465
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,000
Your relatives are my relatives.

466
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,300
But that's not the point.

467
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,400
Hold on.

468
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,680
I'll send you their profiles.

469
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,520
Take a look.

470
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,700
(Please wait)

471
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,760
So, did you see it?

472
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,240
What do you think?

473
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,780
Their basics aren't very solid.

474
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,300
They're not very consistent.

475
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,240
Especially the one

476
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,500
wearing the sun-proof cloak.

477
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,380
Her serve is better,

478
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,720
but she's easily influenced.

479
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,120
If she serves well,

480
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,420
it lifts both their spirits.

481
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Their subsequent attacks

482
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,900
will go smoothly.

483
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,840
Ask about serving techniques.

484
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,220
Serving.

485
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,060
How to serve?

486
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,420
Any good training methods for that?

487
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,120
Serving?

488
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,960
Yes.

489
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,500
Follow my instructions.

490
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,760
Listen to me.

491
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,120
For jump serves,

492
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,600
they're very aggressive,

493
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,780
but

494
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,680
they lack stability.

495
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,280
You should practice more float serves.

496
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Focus on precise placement and practice.

497
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,120
I've noted it down.

498
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,580
(Beach Volleyball Activity Room)

499
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,980
When Lu Xiaole comes,

500
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,420
be cautious.

501
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,720
Morning.

502
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,810
- Morning.
- Hello.

503
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,080
Shao Nian,

504
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,280
I wanted to ask you

505
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,960
about that painting in your room...

506
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,020
- Everyone's here?
- Look.

507
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,200
Everyone's here. Let's talk

508
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,360
about our strategies.

509
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,120
- Come on.
- Strategies?

510
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,600
- This is rare.
- Let's listen.

511
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,500
Let's hear the coach's analysis.

512
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,020
Come on. Hurry.

513
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,080
Our Seven-School

514
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,380
League is starting soon.

515
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,360
We've built

516
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,780
a solid foundation.

517
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,480
Now, let's discuss

518
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,280
the training plan for Yan Xiaojing

519
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,380
and Mo Xixi.

520
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Yan Xiaojing,

521
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,240
you're responsible for defense,

522
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,780
but you often run off-course.

523
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,740
Do you know why?

524
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,900
It's because you overthink.

525
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,160
As a defender,

526
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,780
you need to make choices.

527
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,000
Focus

528
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,200
on one side,

529
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,040
and leave the other

530
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,360
to your teammate.

531
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,560
Trust your teammate.

532
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,760
If the opponent is about to score,

533
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,100
don't dwell on it. Focus on scoring.

534
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,100
And Mo Xixi,

535
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,440
you're a player who thrives on emotion,

536
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,360
but you react

537
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,440
too slowly.

538
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
Do you know

539
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,940
when you react quickly?

540
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,180
When?

541
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,940
I remember Xixi

542
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,920
is quick to react

543
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,340
when she scores from serving.

544
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,560
Yes.

545
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,000
Gao is right.

546
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,700
So, remember.

547
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,000
Try to score with your serve.

548
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,920
It sets the pace

549
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,780
for us

550
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,480
and can lower the opponent's

551
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,880
morale.

552
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,840
Got it?

553
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,060
Got it.

554
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,420
In the league,

555
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,680
pay attention

556
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,200
to a few things.

557
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,040
First,

558
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,920
you're all

559
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,440
strong attackers.

560
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,500
Trust in yourselves.

561
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,640
Second,

562
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,340
don't dwell on the opponent scoring.

563
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,720
Focus on executing your attacks.

564
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,580
Got it?

565
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,060
And third.

566
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Shao Nian,

567
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,920
you say it.

568
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
Third,

569
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,200
when the other team isn't defending,

570
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,160
we should aim to place

571
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,160
our second ball close to the net.

572
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,600
This way, we can

573
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,900
maximize our strengths.

574
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,660
Yes, yes, yes.

575
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,980
Shao Nian?

576
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,720
Coach taught me on the way here.

577
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,600
Yes.

578
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,460
I taught him that.

579
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,680
Coach, what about...

580
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,560
What do you think?

581
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
Coach Lu's analysis

582
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,340
is quite thorough, right?

583
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,260
Of course.

584
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,900
He's an NYT coach.

585
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,440
His analysis was clear

586
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,140
and comprehensive.

587
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,460
Unlike you, who's stumbling.

588
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,660
Yeah, Xixi's smart.

589
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,800
Okay.

590
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,640
That's all I have to say.

591
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,280
Did everyone get that?

592
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,340
- Got it.
- Alright.

593
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,580
Based on Coach Lu's advice,

594
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,540
let's have a practice match.

595
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,240
Everyone, get ready.

596
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,020
- Okay.
- Okay.

597
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,520
Go on.

598
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,360
How was that?

599
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,660
Good, right?

600
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,560
Get lost.

601
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,700
- Get lost.
- Get lost.

602
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,080
Sure.

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,720
Well?

627
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,140
You saw my painting?

628
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,400
You...

629
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,580
Forget it. I'm happy, so I'll let it go.

630
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,520
Then why did you mention it?

631
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,360
Go on.

632
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,220
It makes me mad just thinking about it.

633
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,560
The painting you made

634
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,840
of me eating tofu skewers.

635
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,940
It looked like a...

636
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,500
A demon, you know?

637
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,820
You must be from the Picasso school.

638
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,960
Yeah.

639
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,380
Is that how you see me?

640
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,560
Yeah.

641
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,480
What else?

642
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,820
Say it again, Shao Nian.

643
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,960
Say it again.

644
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,260
Say it again,

645
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,560
and I'll beat you.

646
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,400
Shao Nian.

647
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,780
Here it is.

648
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,480
What's this?

649
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,480
It's a wheelchair.

650
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,380
Haven't you seen one?

651
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,840
I know,

652
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,880
but why did you bring it?

653
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,520
Did you stop selling supplements

654
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
and start selling cars?

655
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,480
What cars?

656
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,440
This is for you.

657
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,320
- Come on, try it.
- Don't joke around.

658
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,620
- Hurry.
- I'm not crippled.

659
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,300
Take it easy.

660
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,000
I still have to go to the team.

661
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,960
How can I face anyone if I sit in this?

662
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,560
You got in it yourself.

663
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,540
I didn't help you.

664
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,000
Face who?

665
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,180
Lu Daxing?

666
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,120
He hasn't come to see you

667
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,460
since he got back.

668
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,840
Isn't the league

669
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,260
starting soon?

670
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,700
He's busy.

671
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,740
He still should find time.

672
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,720
He's different now.

673
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,760
He's an NYT coach.

674
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,460
Maybe he's forgotten about you.

675
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,820
We came out of Xingang together.

676
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,200
We're seven-year partners.

677
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,900
That's not something you forget.

678
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,480
Anyway,

679
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,060
if I hadn't gotten injured,

680
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,940
who knows what might've happened?

681
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,880
He's returned

682
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,440
in glory.

683
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,860
A hero coming home.

684
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,300
It's a whole different story now.

685
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,620
You should just let it go.

686
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Alright, alright.

687
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,480
All this talk

688
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,260
is giving me a headache.

689
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,100
(Dafu BBQ)

690
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,580
Coming.

691
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,600
- Thank you.
- This is mildly spicy.

692
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,440
Mildly spicy.

693
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,660
The bill, please.

694
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,840
Coming right up.

695
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,540
That'll be 156.

696
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,320
Alright, I've paid.

697
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,420
Great, come again!

698
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,940
The grilled gluten is a bit overcooked.

699
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,340
Just chew it a bit more.

700
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,820
The flavor's richer.

701
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,560
Sorry about that.

702
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,100
It was grilled by my spouse.

703
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,960
Okay.

704
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,320
A bottle of beer, please.

705
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,360
- Sure.
- Comings.

706
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,000
Dad, you just left the hospital. Go and rest.

707
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,200
- It's okay.
- Your beer.

708
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,340
We'll take care of this.

709
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,040
Uncle Li, you should go rest.

710
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,200
Duoduo and I can handle this.

711
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,040
- Right.
- No need.

712
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,420
We can't rely on your mom to sell supplements.

713
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,280
Dad, take a good rest at home.

714
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,300
No need to go to the team.

715
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,860
Coach Lu's been training us well.

716
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,100
Really well?

717
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,340
Didn't you say he wasn't good?

718
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,280
That was before.

719
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Chen Weilan and I

720
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,600
didn't have good teamwork before,

721
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,540
but now we've gotten quite good.

722
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,600
Yeah.

723
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,300
Glad it doesn't affect your training.

724
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,980
Uncle Li, you should rest.

725
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Get back with us sooner.

726
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,240
Everyone misses the days

727
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,540
when you trained us.

728
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,600
Right, Duoduo?

729
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,600
- Really?
- Really.

730
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,280
Really, no joke.

731
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,160
Plus, we'd love to see

732
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,200
how you and Coach Lu Daxing

733
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,500
trained before.

734
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,500
Did he mention me?

735
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,480
I don't think so.

736
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,040
Well.

737
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,940
He definitely didn't.

738
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,820
Uncle Li, think about it this way.

739
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,840
Duoduo is the captain now.

740
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,760
If Coach Lu mentioned

741
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,920
you or Duoduo in front

742
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,880
of others every day,

743
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,840
people might think it's

744
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,800
due to your relations.

745
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,480
How could she lead the team, right?

746
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,320
Yeah.

747
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,920
You're right.

748
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,660
I still need to go.

749
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,180
The game is coming up.

750
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,340
I can see my old partner again.

751
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,080
I was wondering where you were.

752
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,680
I've been running around like crazy,

753
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,600
yet you're here.

754
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,760
- Get moving.
- Alright.

755
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,400
- See how tough it was for me?
- Hey.

756
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,690
- Let's go, Dad.
- I'll do it.

757
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,200
I'll take you back. Don't worry.

758
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,880
- What do you want?
- Enough.

759
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,380
- Enough people here.
- Napkins?

760
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,880
What are you doing?

761
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,720
Why packing for me?

762
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,670
Uncle Li will be here.

763
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,510
If you don't pack up,

764
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,730
you'll confront him.

765
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,940
What's wrong with that?

766
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,520
I've been cramming

767
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,280
a lot of knowledge these days.

768
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,140
I could go a few hundred rounds with him.

769
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,360
Don't be ridiculous. A few hundred rounds?

770
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,420
One round is good enough.

771
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,060
Unless Uncle Li has amnesia.

772
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,420
Bro, you really got into acting, huh?

773
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,220
You're not your brother.

774
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,560
No.

775
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,880
Guys, stop packing.

776
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,860
Don't rush.

777
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,960
Where am I supposed to sleep tonight?

778
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,800
On the street?

779
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,660
I just don't see him.

780
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,730
Even so, you still can't hide it.

781
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,360
He can't leave.

782
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,660
He's supposed to stay for a month.

783
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,100
If he suddenly leaves now,

784
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,080
it'll be more odd.

785
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,000
Exactly.

786
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:04,820
If you ask me,

787
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,340
it's simple.

788
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,040
Xiuyun.

789
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,540
Xiuyun.

790
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,280
Coming.

791
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,680
What are you doing?

792
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
Pulling out all the clothes from the closet?

793
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,880
Look, help me choose.

794
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,020
Which one looks good?

795
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,340
How about this one?

796
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,300
What are you going to do in a wheelchair?

797
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,100
Going to Duoduo's school.

798
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,000
I haven't seen them in a long time.

799
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,840
Just checking in.

800
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,160
How about this one?

801
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,140
You're going to see Lu Daxing, aren't you?

802
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,340
Afraid of losing face in front of him?

803
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,420
Why would I be afraid?

804
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,740
I'm not scared of him.

805
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,300
I'm doing this for Duoduo.

806
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,720
Fine.

807
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,700
Wear this one.

808
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,960
You'll definitely look better

809
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,220
than Lu Daxing in this.

810
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,580
Were you and Lu Daxing

811
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,940
rivals in love before?

812
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,880
Go away.

813
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,580
That one's good.

814
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,060
Welcome back, Coach Li.

815
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,780
- Coach Li.
- Coach Li.

816
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,920
- Coach Li.
- Careful.

817
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,680
- Come on.
- One, two, three.

818
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,140
- Go.
- Go.

819
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,800
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

820
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,640
Welcome.

821
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,200
Uncle, are you feeling better?

822
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,040
Much better.

823
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,720
Let me tell you all.

824
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,680
Don't try to flatter me.

825
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,240
If you regress,

826
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,580
I'll still scold you.

827
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,800
But if we improve,

828
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,140
don't hold back on the praise.

829
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,380
Where's Lu Daxing?

830
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,860
Yeah, where's Coach Lu?

831
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,560
Coach Lu got drunk last night.

832
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,820
He's resting now.

833
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,200
Resting.

834
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,340
Yeah, yeah.

835
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,640
I remember he used

836
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,820
to be a good drinker.

837
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,120
He could outdrink

838
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,820
a whole table.

839
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,380
What happened now?

840
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,940
Is he avoiding me?

841
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,940
Why would he avoid you, Dad?

842
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,020
Uncle Li, I just remembered.

843
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,640
Coach Lu drinks, so he has...

844
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,260
What do you call it?

845
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,800
- Alcoholic liver disease.
- Yeah.

846
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,920
The doctor told him not to,

847
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,320
but he drank last night,

848
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,780
so he's not feeling well today.

849
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,120
Yeah, yeah.

850
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,280
He's resting in his dorm.

851
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,200
- Yeah.
- Coach Li is here.

852
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,300
Let him rest.

853
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,680
Could it be that with Coach Li here,

854
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,920
- Coach Lu is leaving?
- No way.

855
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,620
Two tigers can't share one mountain?

856
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,140
That's impossible.

857
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,740
We're the "Happy Duo".

858
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,060
We're old friends.

859
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,540
He's an NYT coach.

860
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,000
Why would he be afraid of me?

861
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,840
Right?

862
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,540
Is he alright?

863
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,800
Why not go check on him?

864
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,680
- Let's go.
- No, no.

865
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,400
Coach, please look at our recent

866
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,440
- training results.
- Yes, yes.

867
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,560
Everyone, sit down.

868
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,920
Let's report to Coach.

869
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,160
- Sit.
- I'll take Duoduo

870
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,400
to find Coach Lu.

871
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,280
Go ahead. Bye-bye.

872
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,360
Coach, take a look at this training plan.

873
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,480
Everyone, report

874
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,120
your recent progress.

875
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,960
Yes, yes.

876
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,560
Who is it?

877
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,260
- Coach.
- What?

878
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
You ran so fast.

879
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,720
Duoduo.

880
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,180
You're not really leaving, are you?

881
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,860
Who said I'm leaving?

882
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,380
Your luggage is all packed.

883
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Maybe the coach just wanted

884
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,780
to tidy up the room.

885
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,840
Right?

886
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,140
Coach, you don't have to leave.

887
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,360
My dad said

888
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,120
even if he's here, you're still in charge.

889
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,180
He'll assist you.

890
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,860
Da Fu is too polite.

891
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,240
Actually, I'm fine.

892
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,220
Just not feeling well.

893
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,680
Another day,

894
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,180
I'll treat Dafu to a drink.

895
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,320
Drink again?

896
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,620
You're already like this.

897
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,960
I mean.

898
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,540
We'll catch up another day.

899
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,340
After all, we're the "Revival Duo".

900
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,000
Revival?

901
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,200
My dad said

902
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,700
you two are the "Happy Duo".

903
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,680
Be it revival or happy, it's all the same.

904
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,040
The point is

905
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,240
they prioritize each other.

906
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,840
Duoduo, we should head back.

907
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,760
Coach Lu seems really unwell.

908
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,260
Let's let him rest well.

909
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,840
Alright, Coach.

910
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,980
Take care and rest well.

911
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,400
We're leaving now.

912
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,180
We're leaving. Bye-bye.

913
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,800
Let's go.

914
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,010
- Let's go.
- Bye-bye.

915
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,180
It's all wet.

916
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,140
Dad, we're back.

917
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,300
How's Daxing?

918
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,280
He's fine, just lying in bed.

919
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,460
He just drank too much.

920
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,080
Sit down.

921
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,980
Sit down.

922
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,420
Do you think we can keep this up?

923
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,940
I just reviewed everyone's tests.

924
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,980
I can see that you've all

925
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,820
made progress recently.

926
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,220
We have to thank Coach Lu for that.

927
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,040
Thanks to him,

928
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,740
you didn't miss out on training.

929
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,180
I just got the match schedule for the league.

930
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,140
Everyone, take a look.

931
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:19,840
How is it?

932
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,260
Any familiar faces this year?

933
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,760
Here.

934
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,640
Let me see.

935
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,120
(League Match Schedule)

936
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,580
In the women's division,

937
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,600
except for Ocean University's
Tu Lingling and Long Ya,

938
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,940
who are freshmen,

939
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,460
everyone else,

940
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
including the two of us,

941
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,340
are upperclassmen.

942
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,540
Freshmen already qualifying,

943
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,820
Ocean University is strong this year.

944
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,560
Duo,

945
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,680
you said on the island

946
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,480
Tu Lingling's skills had declined.

947
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,540
Look at her now, officially competing.

948
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,980
She was holding back on the island.

949
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,380
We didn't go all out either.

950
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,940
I reviewed the past competitions.

951
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,420
I think

952
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,180
Keji University's Liu Shutong

953
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,280
and Lin Fang

954
