00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,060
Well.

19
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,060
Gao Ge.

20
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,320
With the recent weather changes,

21
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,700
please take care of your health.

22
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,540
Thanks.

23
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,060
Gao Ge.

24
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,060
I'm done with my studying here.

25
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,400
I'll head to the library now.

26
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,420
You go.

27
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,660
But remember to keep up

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,840
with your training.

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,300
Well, Gao Ge.

30
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,860
I made the goji tea

31
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,650
on the table.

32
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,690
The goji berries are from my hometown.

33
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,760
It's for you.

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,760
- What?
- Remember to drink it.

35
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,860
Here.

36
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,720
What are you doing?

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,240
Sit down first.

38
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,360
Fine.

39
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,120
Drink this.

40
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,840
Why?

41
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,980
I saw you in the water room.

42
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,560
You didn't look well.

43
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,520
What's wrong today?

44
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,060
My period.

45
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,100
I guessed right.

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,060
Let me tell you.

47
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,420
This is really good

48
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,480
for periods.

49
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,760
You're so considerate. Thank you.

50
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Is it good?

51
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,400
What's wrong?

52
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,120
My period.

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,100
Don't squat.

54
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,380
- Sit here.
- No need.

55
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,720
- I feel comfortable squatting.
- Go and sit.

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,260
Sit down.

57
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,420
Wait a moment.

58
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,520
I'll get you some hot water.

59
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,320
No need.

60
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,860
Oh.

61
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,320
It's ready.

62
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,660
Here.

63
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,120
Drink it while it's hot.

64
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,300
Is it too hot?

65
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,360
It's fine.

66
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,500
Why are you drinking brown sugar water?

67
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,640
Just drink it.

68
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,580
Thank you.

69
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,480
I'll drink it later.

70
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,380
You rest.

71
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,220
Okay.

72
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,400
Is this a couple's cup?

73
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,820
I've seen him use it.

74
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,840
Really? He used it?

75
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,900
I think

76
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,560
I still have hope.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,900
He's the type

78
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,220
to frustrate girls.

79
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,720
You've seen him use it?

80
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,900
Drink more.

81
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,060
I'm fine. I'm fine.

82
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,920
I'm holding it to warm my stomach.

83
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,400
So warm.

84
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,480
Thank you.

85
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,220
I didn't expect you'd like

86
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,220
to train extra.

87
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,720
You came for extra training too.

88
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,680
Are you alone?

89
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,660
Why?

90
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,360
Didn't see the person you wanted?

91
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,680
Why

92
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,680
are you acting strange lately?

93
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,120
Strange?

94
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,680
How?

95
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,740
Well.

96
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,600
You've always been strange.

97
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm strange?

98
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,520
Strange people find everyone strange.

99
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,900
What do you mean by that?

100
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,960
Explain yourself.

101
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,420
Nothing.

102
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,440
I'm here.

103
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,900
Weilan.

104
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,790
The person you wanted to see is here.

105
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,640
Gao Ge.

106
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,080
Well.

107
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,180
I'm here for extra training too.

108
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,720
I'll run with you.

109
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,020
Alright.

110
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,980
Gao Ge, guide her.

111
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,180
I'll leave you to it.

112
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,600
Wait, Chen Weilan.

113
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,720
You two have been

114
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,700
messing around lately.

115
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,320
Can you stop it?

116
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,620
I...

117
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,480
What are we messing with?

118
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,780
Weilan, Gao Ge seems in a bad mood today.

119
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,500
- I'll go.
- No, no.

120
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,540
Come back.

121
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,620
Why are you leaving?

122
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,560
Come here.

123
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,220
Gao Ge.

124
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,580
Look.

125
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,460
She likes you.

126
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,740
She's talking like that.

127
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,700
How can you still be so condescending?

128
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,720
Chen Weilan,

129
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,820
ask directly if you have questions.

130
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,260
What do I want to ask?

131
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,060
- Weilan, I know you mean well.
- I...

132
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,060
But today isn't the right day to talk about it.

133
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,120
- I'm leaving.
- Wait.

134
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,180
Since Jingxuan is here,

135
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,100
I didn't want to intervene,

136
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,320
but now I will.

137
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,600
Gao Ge, if you don't like her,

138
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,180
make it clear.

139
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,740
Stop leading her on.

140
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,000
It's pointless.

141
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,420
Is that what it is about?

142
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,360
Yes.

143
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,180
Alright.

144
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,440
I'll tell you.

145
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,980
I'm not interested

146
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,280
in dating right now.

147
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,240
Understand?

148
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,280
Jingxuan,

149
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,660
if you're not here

150
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,020
for beach volleyball,

151
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,280
you can leave now.

152
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,520
Is that clear?

153
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,680
Wow, this guy.

154
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,960
Jingxuan,

155
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,740
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,060
I wanted to help,

157
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,200
but I didn't expect him...

158
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,480
Weilan,

159
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,930
Gao Ge speaks

160
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,440
just like he plays.

161
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,400
So cool.

162
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,640
You think he's cool even now?

163
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,070
Yes.

164
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,320
Very cool.

165
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,960
Please take a look.

166
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,820
Alright.

167
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,500
Excuse me, take a look.

168
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,160
This is our town's beach volleyball game flyer.

169
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,740
Town beach volleyball game?

170
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,960
Excuse me, take a look.

171
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,050
- There's a cash prize.
- Town beach volleyball game flyer.

172
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,300
- Excuse me.
- Thanks.

173
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,140
Excuse me, excuse me.

174
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,120
- Please take a look.
- Take a look.

175
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,420
Hey, stay focused.

176
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,480
Look closely.

177
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,860
Remember it.

178
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,240
Learn about this.

179
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,680
Like this.

180
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,080
Jumping rope.

181
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,360
Hopping.

182
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,460
These

183
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,240
are non-ball training exercises.

184
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,400
Come on. Non-ball training?

185
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,280
What kind of coach is he?

186
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,880
Watch carefully.

187
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,340
How about it?

188
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
Understand now?

189
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,470
Got it?

190
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,900
Later,

191
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,340
we'll focus on these exercises

192
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,040
for non-ball training.

193
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,900
Like grabbing flags.

194
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,980
It includes

195
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,380
standing up,

196
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,380
running,

197
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,360
and grabbing.

198
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,220
These are all essential

199
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,440
for beach volleyball.

200
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
Receiving,

201
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,740
running up,

202
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,720
and spiking.

203
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,380
Even without a ball,

204
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,740
we can practice.

205
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,980
Beach volleyball

206
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,500
requires adapting to the sand.

207
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,780
We'll start

208
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,100
with the basics, okay?

209
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,680
Dad,

210
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,980
I've been doing these non-ball exercises

211
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,160
since I was a kid. I'm tired of them.

212
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,840
Any new tricks?

213
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,800
A mountain's fame comes from its spirit.

214
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,640
An exercise's value comes
from its effectiveness.

215
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm the coach, you're not.

216
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,820
Duoduo,

217
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,060
listen to Uncle Li for now.

218
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,900
We can practice other things tonight.

219
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,840
Fine.

220
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,080
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

221
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,960
Everyone, look at this.

222
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,620
A beach volleyball competition
held by a company.

223
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,830
As long as we make it to the semifinals,

224
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,060
we'll get prize money.

225
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,640
It's very easy.

226
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,100
If you can lead us to the semifinals,

227
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,160
I'll acknowledge you as the coach.

228
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,840
Wholeheartedly. How about that?

229
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,660
(Wuxi Town Beach Volleyball Grand Prix)

230
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,440
I have a condition too.

231
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,560
You must strictly follow

232
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,480
the training plan.

233
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,080
No problem.

234
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,300
Sure.

235
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,040
Deal.

236
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,660
(Dafu BBQ)

237
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,880
What are you doing up so late?

238
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,420
Nothing.

239
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,200
They've been training lately.

240
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,340
Duoduo practices every day

241
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,600
and then trains extra.

242
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,140
I'm worried she'll overdo it

243
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,200
and get hurt.

244
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,740
I'm not judging you,

245
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,700
but you're her father.

246
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,200
Don't treat her like a workhorse.

247
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,780
She's a girl.

248
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,740
Can't you be a little more considerate?

249
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,720
You know her stubborn nature.

250
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,520
Can I stop her?

251
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,980
If she gets hurt,

252
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,020
I'll blame you.

253
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,880
Hey.

254
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,820
I'm her dad.

255
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,340
I care about her too.

256
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,920
You're coaching now,

257
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,900
so I'm handling the store.

258
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,740
I can't always look after her.

259
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,100
If something happens to her,

260
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,240
I'll hold you responsible.

261
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,940
Fine.

262
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,040
Let's talk about something.

263
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,000
Let's analyze this together.

264
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,140
Sure.

265
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,140
Stop it.

266
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,060
It's half done.

267
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,440
- I...
- Can you listen to me first?

268
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,780
Do you think

269
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,160
Duoduo has someone she likes?

270
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,740
Really?

271
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,740
I don't know.

272
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,040
Do I know him? Is he handsome?

273
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,640
I just have a feeling.

274
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,380
That's why I'm asking.

275
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,700
You need to tell me more

276
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,360
so I can help analyze.

277
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,320
She's been training extra, right?

278
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,560
Shao Nian has been

279
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,540
tagging along every day,

280
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,200
never missing a session.

281
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,160
Shao Nian

282
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,040
is a student too.

283
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,320
Why doesn't he attend classes?

284
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,240
And

285
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,720
why did Shao Nian come to work here?

286
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,640
Is it because of Duoduo?

287
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,180
Oh, you're talking

288
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,240
about Shao Nian?

289
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,200
Those two? No way.

290
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,660
They're so close.

291
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,480
Nothing romantic will come of it.

292
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,220
I'm not worried about Duoduo.

293
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,900
She's all about beach volleyball.

294
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,720
She doesn't see anything else.

295
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,420
Do you think Shao Nian

296
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,200
has feelings for our Duoduo?

297
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,560
He wouldn't dare.

298
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,140
I'd kick him out right away.

299
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,480
Why are you so worked up?

300
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,840
Our daughter is in college.

301
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,160
Having a boyfriend is normal.

302
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,620
It shows

303
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,180
she's attractive

304
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,140
and excellent.

305
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,500
Boyfriend?

306
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,640
She's too young.

307
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,240
Right, you'd be happy if she never got married.

308
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,760
No way my daughter won't get married.

309
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,760
Just not so soon.

310
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,180
Let her graduate

311
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,520
and work for a few years.

312
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,920
Can you accept

313
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,760
that boy?

314
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,840
I think

315
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,220
Shao Nian is pretty good.

316
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,280
He's hardworking

317
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,480
in the shop

318
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,180
and kind to Duoduo.

319
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,840
Plus, he's good-looking.

320
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,600
Well.

321
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,840
They've been friends for so long.

322
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,480
It'll be hard for them to start a relationship.

323
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,160
What a pity.

324
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,920
That's not a pity.

325
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,180
I just think they'd make a good pair.

326
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,260
You really like him, huh?

327
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,560
Can't I consider it?

328
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,720
Alright.

329
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,620
Stop overthinking.

330
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,460
Alright.

331
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,260
It's late. Get some sleep.

332
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,140
We have work tomorrow.

333
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,960
Who's overthinking?

334
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,700
Go to sleep.

335
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,540
What do you think

336
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,480
about Shao Nian?

337
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,780
Shut up.

338
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,240
I think they're a good match.

339
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,880
Let me talk more...

340
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,560
- Go to sleep!
- Let's discuss it more.

341
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,460
(Beach Volleyball Activity Room)

342
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,880
I'll be home during the competition.

343
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,700
I'll be busy

344
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,060
with my thesis back home.

345
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,240
So, I won't participate.

346
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,460
Same here.

347
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,060
I can't join either.

348
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,420
But it's fine.

349
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,820
I'll ask Gao to stay with you.

350
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,860
Is that okay?

351
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,080
No problem for me.

352
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,580
It'll be a good chance

353
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,800
to try out Coach Li's new training plan.

354
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,640
I'll stay to experience it too.

355
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,520
Me too.

356
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,700
So, except for me,

357
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,740
Mo Xixi and Yan Xiaojing,

358
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,020
you'll still have six people.

359
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,840
You can pair up however you want.

360
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,180
With you gone,

361
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,480
who will I partner with?

362
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,660
Me.

363
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,660
You?

364
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,580
Can you receive the ball?

365
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,640
Why wouldn't I?

366
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,800
Oh, I have an announcement.

367
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,140
Xiaojing and I

368
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,220
discussed it.

369
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,680
We're almost seniors,

370
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,020
busy with theses

371
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,400
and job hunting.

372
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,320
We won't have enough time.

373
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,200
So,

374
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,120
I'm stepping down as captain.

375
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,880
Are you making Gao Ge the captain?

376
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,760
No, I chose you.

377
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,520
Me?

378
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,900
Yes.

379
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,380
Everyone has seen

380
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,100
your progress

381
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,460
and contributions to the team.

382
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,300
Right?

383
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

384
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,240
Can I be the captain?

385
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,940
If Xia Liqiang can,

386
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,900
why can't you?

387
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,140
What are you saying?

388
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,720
What did I say? I didn't say anything.

389
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,360
Do you think I can be captain?

390
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,080
Just remember you're the captain.

391
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,140
Here comes the coach.

392
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,280
- Coach.
- Coach Li.

393
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,720
Sit, sit, sit.

394
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,640
Coach Li,

395
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,420
I have an announcement.

396
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,990
I'm stepping down

397
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,180
as captain,

398
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,480
and I'm appointing Li Guoduo.

399
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,520
You don't mind, right?

400
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,960
I have no objections.

401
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
I'll announce the training plan,

402
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,580
which requires

403
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,250
Captain Li's cooperation.

404
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,110
Yes.

405
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,800
We have 52 days

406
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,350
until the competition,

407
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,340
and 22 days

408
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,820
until your school break.

409
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,080
Our intensive training

410
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,580
will start

411
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,080
the day after your break.

412
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,380
It will last 25 days.

413
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,660
Got it?

414
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,740
So, Coach Li,

415
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,040

are actually pretty amazing.

451
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,720
He should've won that last game.

452
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,180
Really?

453
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,500
That doesn't sound like you, Chen Weilan.

454
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,960
You're not even teasing Gao.

455
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,280
I keep things separate.

456
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,660
He is

457
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,140
pretty good at beach volleyball.

458
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,640
He could make it to the National Youth Team.

459
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,780
National Youth Team? Really?

460
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,940
I always thought

461
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,900
Gao was just called

462
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,060
the beach volleyball god as a joke.

463
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,380
Beach volleyball god?

464
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,780
Well, he's okay at volleyball.

465
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,640
He doesn't look like

466
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,880
a god.

467
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,920
There's the Chen Weilan I know.

468
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,820
Well.

469
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,020
Actually,

470
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,520
I have a question for you.

471
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,380
Since you and Duoduo

472
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,580
are teammates,

473
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,540
you must know

474
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,700
her playing style well.

475
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,500
Could you teach me a few tricks

476
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,660
so I can

477
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,000
play a few rounds with her?

478
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,340
Why would a surgeon like you

479
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,960
want to play volleyball?

480
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,420
I just want

481
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,440
to share a hobby with Duoduo.

482
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,920
To have something to talk about?

483
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,180
First,

484
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,960
you don't have the basics.

485
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,700
Second,

486
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,200
do you have time to train?

487
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,900
Third,

488
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,260
with Li Guoduo's current progress,

489
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,960
she could easily beat you.

490
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,320
Don't try to play with her.

491
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,620
Just spend more time with her.

492
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,100
- That's more reliable.
- Fine, fine.

493
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,180
You're sharp-tongued now.

494
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,180
I can't win.

495
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,420
Just pretend I didn't ask.

496
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,400
Goodbye.

497
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,640
Gao,

498
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,740
if I hadn't talked

499
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,180
to Chen Weilan today,

500
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,260
I wouldn't have realized

501
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,760
there are so many hidden talents around.

502
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,420
She told me you're good at beach volleyball,

503
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,720
easily making the National Youth Team.

504
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,940
You've never mentioned it.

505
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,120
I didn't know you were so good.

506
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,560
National Youth Team?

507
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,680
Who wants to join that?

508
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
Why do you get so serious

509
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,360
because of that?

510
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,680
I didn't.

511
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,640
I just don't want to hear about Chen Weilan.

512
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,540
Come on, you're a big guy.

513
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,130
Chen Weilan is better than you in this regard.

514
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,070
Yeah.

515
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,320
I guess I'm not as good as her.

516
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,660
I just lost to her,

517
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,500
right?

518
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,000
What's wrong with you?

519
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,440
Chen Weilan didn't say that.

520
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,140
Chen Weilan told me

521
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,540
you played really well

522
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,220
and should've won.

523
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,620
She said you're the beach volleyball god

524
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,020
of our Xingang University.

525
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,020
Nonsense.

526
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,240
What does that mean?

527
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,300
She's praising

528
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,920
not just your skills

529
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,400
but also

530
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,340
your looks.

531
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,540
She really said that?

532
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,920
Yes. Why would I lie?

533
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,380
Wait, Gao.

534
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,560
Are you smiling?

535
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,540
Who's smiling?

536
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,020
Keep it up, and I won't help you anymore.

537
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,500
Go play with Chen Weilan instead.

538
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,440
Why are you betraying me?

539
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,660
Today's practice is over.

540
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,140
- We'll resume tomorrow.
- Sure.

541
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,560
You're still my buddy.

542
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,920
You told Shao Nian

543
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,600
I could join the National Youth Team?

544
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,780
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

545
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,480
Where did you see that potential in me?

546
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,940
You play well.

547
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,880
Your skills are solid.

548
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,400
You could do it too.

549
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,520
Go for it.

550
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,880
Thanks for the encouragement.

551
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,500
Here's to the new holiday.

552
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,220
- Cheers!
- To the upcoming training!

553
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,240
Cheers!

554
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,820
Sorry.

555
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,860
But this holiday

556
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,040
is very important to me.

557
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,840
What's special about it?

558
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,520
I am

559
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,540
taking Xiaojing home

560
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,440
to meet my parents.

561
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,340
Good for you.

562
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,820
You're moving to the next stage in life.

563
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,080
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

564
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,560
Xiaojing told me

565
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,500
Mo Xixi can't come either.

566
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,880
She's going on vacation with her boyfriend.

567
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,260
I thought we'd all be together

568
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,980
for the training.

569
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,320
Why can't you all be here?

570
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,860
It can't be helped.

571
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,800
When you're close to graduation,

572
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,400
you have a lot to think about.

573
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,180
Here.

574
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,760
By the way, Gao,

575
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,420
both Yang Jingxuan and Chen Weilan

576
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,500
are your teammates.

577
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,840
You need to balance that.

578
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,740
You're a guy. Why are you so gossipy?

579
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,580
I...

580
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,580
Liqiang, what gossip?

581
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,440
Tell us.

582
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,280
- You haven't heard?
- No.

583
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,460
Gao is the beach volleyball god.

584
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,360
He has won the hearts of two girls.

585
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,860
Only two?

586
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,080
Over the years,

587
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,260
plenty of girls

588
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,120
have admired him.

589
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,020
This time it's different.

590
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,280
- You two...
- They used to admire from afar,

591
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,420
but now

592
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,480
they'll be together for 25 days.

593
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,940
Wait.

594
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,720
I don't understand. What do you mean?

595
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,260
Let me explain.

596
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,200
Xia.

597
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,380
You...

598
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,920
Can you stop?

599
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,060
You'd make a great paparazzi team leader,

600
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,660
now that you're not our captain.

601
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,280
Not important. Let's drink!

602
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,540
Duoduo, I actually

603
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,320
wanted to talk to your dad today.

604
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,400
Is there enough food?

605
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,500
Uncle Li.

606
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,840
No, Coach Li.

607
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,140
I'm Shao Nian, and I'm officially

608
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,460
applying to be a substitute player

609
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,500
for our beach volleyball team.

610
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,400
Officially.

611
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,420
You?

612
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,220
I think

613
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,580
you should stick

614
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,920
to being a doctor.

615
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,640
Yeah, Dad.

616
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,100
He doesn't look

617
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,200
like an athlete at all.

618
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,420
As the captain,

619
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,440
I'm the first to disagree.

620
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,780
Hey, Li Guoduo.

621
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,480
That feels like a personal attack.

622
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,660
I may not

623
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,220
look like an athlete,

624
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,960
but I have a passion for beach volleyball.

625
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,220
I think you should

626
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,660
focus on being a doctor

627
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,400
and not cause any trouble here.

628
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,980
Uncle Li.

629
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,920
Coach Li.

630
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,040
Sports are great

631
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,500
for health and well-being.
The more, the better.

632
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,810
The day after tomorrow,

633
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,360
come over during training.

634
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,740
Dad,

635
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,300
that's really biased.

636
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,140
Thank you, Coach Li.

637
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,620
Burning!

638
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,600
The chicken wings are burning!

639
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,920
Why are you two looking at me?

640
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,160
What's on your mind?

641
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,960
Beach volleyball or the beach volleyball girl?

642
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,520
Come on, have a drink.

643
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,280
Celebrate yourself.

644
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,740
Gao.

645
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
What are you doing here?

646
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,720
Mascot.

647
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,740
What are you doing borrowing so many books?

648
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,980
Glad you're here.

649
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,700
Let me borrow your library card.

650
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
I can't borrow this many on my own.

651
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,540
Come on.

652
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,120
Why do you need so many books?

653
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,660
Is Xia fooling you again?

654
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,520
No.

655
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,220
They're all about beach volleyball.

656
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,500
I want to join the beach volleyball team,

657
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
so I need to learn more about it

658
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,600
since I don't know anything.

659
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,000
Joining the beach volleyball team now?

660
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,740
I remember persuading you

661
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,500
to join before, but you refused.

662
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,260
- What do you want now?
- Come on.

663
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,100
When did you ever persuade me?

664
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,260
You just casually asked

665
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,500
without any sincerity.

666
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,520
I wasn't sincere?

667
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,500
Duoduo

668
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,220
doesn't want you on the team,

669
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,740
but you're still trying so hard.

670
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,180
You're my buddy. Don't do this.

671
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,200
Are you helping me or not?

672
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,400
You're not sounding very grateful.

673
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,400
- Mr. Gao.
- Fine, fine.

674
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,810
Let me think. Wait a minute.

675
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,030
Thanks.

676
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,480
Wait.

677
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,680
Even if I lend you my card,

678
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,580
can you read all these books?

679
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,920
I read fast.

680
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,260
Bro,

681
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,180
the day after tomorrow

682
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,080
is training.

683
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,660
That's plenty for two days,

684
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,840
yet you're borrowing more?

685
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,400
Look, Gao.

686
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,720
You know Duoduo well.

687
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,660
Even if I can't finish all these books,

688
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,740
I have to read as much as I can.

689
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,820
I have to borrow the books

690
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,750
to learn more,

691
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,320
or she won't let me join the team.

692
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,920
And I bet

693
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,260
she won't just test my theoretical knowledge.

694
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,060
She'll make me play a match

695
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,160
to stop me.

696
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,860
A match?

697
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,240
- Yes.
- Alright.

698
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,700
Forget the books.

699
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,560
They won't help.

700
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,620
What?

701
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,460
Why?

702
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,020
Aren't we supposed to play?

703
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:18,860
Yes.

704
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,800
I'll help you with that.

705
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,420
You need to put some power in your wrist

706
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,960
when you hit the ball. Remember that.

707
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,320
Gather up!

708
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,600
It's the first day of training.

709
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,520
Let me introduce a new member.

710
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,140
Shao Nian.

711
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,800
Shao Nian, you're joining us?

712
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,860
Yes.

713
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,140
Some team members

714
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,160
are against Shao Nian joining the team,

715
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,440
so we'll decide by a vote.

716
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,160
Majority rules.

717
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,540
Dad, a beach volleyball player

718
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,780
needs to know how to play.

719
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,440
He can't play. Why can he join us?

720
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,080
I didn't know how to play at first,

721
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,360
but now I'm learning, right?

722
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,800
How about this?

723
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,540
Let Shao Nian

724
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,580
go through the entry test.

725
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,680
If he passes,

726
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,600
he joins. Deal?

727
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,660
What's the test?

728
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,600
I have an idea.

729
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,380
I'll ask you three questions
about beach volleyball.

730
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,860
If you get them right...

731
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,220
I can join the team.

732
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,200
Answer first, then we'll see.

733
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,260
Come on.

734
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,740
First question.

735
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,920
How many timeouts can each team call

736
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,580
in a beach volleyball match,

737
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,900
and how long is each?

738
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,360
Four, each 30 seconds.

739
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,040
Lucky guess.

740
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,380
Second question.

741
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,980
Where can players

742
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,400
make offensive hits?

743
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,400
Any area on our side.

744
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,000
He knows that too?

745
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,420
Where was the first two-player
beach volleyball match held?

746
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,260
California.

747
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,800
That's easy.

748
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,580
Are you sure?

749
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,500
Absolutely.

750
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,400
At the State Beach.

751
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,220
- Nice job, kid.
- Amazing.

752
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Good for you.

753
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,340
You really studied hard.

754
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,860
- Not bad.
- Good, man.

755
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,200
You've done your homework.

756
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,440
Don't get too excited.

757
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,960
Being good at theory is one thing.

758
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,200
As the team captain,

759
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,660
I won't let anyone join

760
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,480
just based on book knowledge.

761
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,040
If you want to join us,

762
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,640
you need to have physical strength.

763
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,780
Join us

764
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,620
in our upcoming training.

765
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,940
Sure.

766
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,180
He's a medical student.

767
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,540
With his physique,

768
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,320
can he keep up with our training?

769
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,520
Keeping up is only the first step.

770
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,940
You'll also need to beat me in a match.

771
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,480
Win three points against me,

772
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,620
and you're in.

773
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,480
How's that?

774
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,680
Wait.

775
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,740
Isn't this entry test

776
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,740
a bit too tough

777
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,080
for a newbie?

778
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,940
But everyone who wants

779
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,820
to join our team

780
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,100
has to pass the test.

781
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,400
It's only fair.

782
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,160
I accept your challenge.

783
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,920
Thank you.

784
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,660
Well done.

785
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,960
You answered everything right.

786
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,520
As expected.

787
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,000
Right.

788
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,260
But

789
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,220
why don't you

790
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,280
look happy about your victory?

791
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,680
Just as I guessed.

792
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,240
Duoduo doesn't want me on the team.

793
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,520
As you said,

794
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,900
her test

795
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,240
is indeed quite tough.

796
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,960
Exactly.

797
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,840
If it were just physical training,

798
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,740
I could grit my teeth

799
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,360
and push through.

800
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,700
But playing a match against Duoduo

801
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,820
and winning three points?

802
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,920
That's impossible.

803
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,500
Bro,

804
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,040
let me give you some extra training.

805
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,880
I'll help you

806
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,260
with the physical training,

807
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,940
and I'll coach you on the techniques.

808
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,320
Just three points, right?

809
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,040
How hard can it be?

810
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,760
Are you serious?

811
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,080
But you know.

812
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,680
The basics have to be built up bit by bit.

813
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,680
So, we'll have to do it quickly.

814
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,340
What I have in mind

815
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,560
is combining physical fitness
with practical skills.

816
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,800
That doesn't sound reliable.

817
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,600
Don't worry.

818
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,400
Come on, speed up!

819
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,760
Speed up!

820
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,880
Speed up!

821
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,640
Come on!

822
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,080
Come on, speed up!

823
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,200
Hold on!

824
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,020
Go. Good.

825
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,740
I'm telling you. Bend your knees.

826
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,300
Keep your arms straight.

827
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Yes, straight.

828
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,140
Straighten them up.

829
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,180
Lift your shoulders.

830
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,020
Come on.

831
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,420
Good. Keep going.

832
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,260
- Yes.
- Okay.

833
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,020
Come on, go.

834
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,680
Keep practicing.

835
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,260
Come on!

836
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,540
Speed up!

837
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,740
Doing okay?

838
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,580
- Come on!
- Keep going!

839
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,140
Forward and back.

840
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,280
- Forward and back.
- Good.

841
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,200
Be flexible. Be flexible.

842
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,880
Don't just stand there.

843
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,500
Yes.

844
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,920
Feet, feet.

845
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,540
Watch your feet!

846
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,440
Good, good.

847
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,900
Keep practicing, okay?

848
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,500
Coach, her hand is off.

849
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,380
I'm telling you.

850
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,260
You see the ball?

851
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,540
When you hold it,

852
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,500
throw it up.

853
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,980
Throw it up higher than your elbow.

854
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,420
- Like this, in a straight line.
- Elbow.

855
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,040
Yes, the elbow must be high.

856
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,920
Use your whole strength.

857
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,580
- Okay.
- Got it?

858
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,420
- Try it.
- Okay.

859
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,860
Yes, yes, yes.

860
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,240
- Alright, I'll try again.
- That's right.

861
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,320
Go, steady.

862
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,580
Steady.

863
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,560
Come on, keep the speed.

864
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,360
Keep the speed.

865
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,740
Come on, faster.

866
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,480
Faster, faster.

867
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,580
Throw it up.

868
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,480
Elbow, elbow. Yes, higher.

869
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,540
Yes.

870
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,460
Smash it down.

871
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,300
Smash it hard.

872
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,040
♪No matter how hard the process♪

873
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,320

Come on.

875
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,240
Come on.

Speed up, speed up, speed up.

Faster.

887
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,380
You okay?

888
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,700
Speed up.

889
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,500
Just stay home and use your scalpel.

890
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,800
Why insist on training with us?

891
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,180
Let's go.

892
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,020
I want to.

893
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,280
Weight training.

894
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,920
To strengthen your calves
and core explosiveness.

895
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,960
I'll start timing now.

896
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,600
Speed up.

897
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,360
Speed up.

898
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,500
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

899
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,920
- How are you?
- Thanks.

900
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,900
Adjust and speed up.

901
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,000
Speed up, speed up.

902
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,180
Come on, faster.

903
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,260
Gao,

904
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,320
I feel like in a past life...

905
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,520
I just know.

906
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,360
- It hurts so much.
- Alright, alright.

907
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,860
Stop whining.

908
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,860
You just started.

909
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,260
Not even close

910
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,320
to our usual training intensity.

911
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,480
But

912
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,900
I'm not a professional.

913
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,480
I've never trained like this before.

914
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,960
Wait, Gao.

915
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,420
I have something to discuss with you.

916
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,640
I need your help.

917
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,940
Haven't I been helping you all along?

918
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,780
Tell me.

919
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,020
Do you

920
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,900
remember the time

921
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,820
at Jin Yun Hotel,

922
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,230
when I set up a perfect spike

923
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,360
for Chen Weilan?

924
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,340
Wasn't that a fluke?

925
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,960
Well, yeah.

926
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,780
Even if it was a fluke,

927
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,060
and it indeed was,

928
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,940
doesn't it show

929
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,420
I have a good awareness

930
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,460
and athletic talent?

931
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,860
I managed to save the ball

932
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,380
and did

933
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,540
a perfect setting

934
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,920
for Chen Weilan's spike.

935
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,620
And?

936
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,660
So I was thinking.

937
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,060
Can I

938
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,060
ask Chen Weilan

939
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,000
to recreate

940
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,900
that moment

941
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,540
during my test

942
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,780
with Duoduo?

943
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,140
I'll set up another great ball,

944
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,550
and she'll spike it.

945
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,780
It'll prove to Duoduo

946
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,800
that I'm capable.

947
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,300
- Ask Chen Weilan?
- Yeah.

948
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,740
- Fluke it again?
- Yeah.

949
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,040
Don't think about it.

950
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,660
You...

951
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,980
You're usually smart.

952
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,980
Why are you coming up with these crooked ideas?

953
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,060
I don't have

954
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,140
any other options.

955
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,740
What's wrong with asking Chen Weilan?

956
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,320
No, it's very wrong.

957
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,100
Stop talking nonsense and lie down.

958
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,220
I'm telling you.

959
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,160
If I don't loosen you up,
you'll be sore tomorrow.

960
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,780
Ow, not so hard, not so hard!

961
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,620
Bear with it.

962
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,680
It's not too bad, actually.

963
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,720
Alright, this midpoint here.

964
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,630
Slightly inward.

965
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,440
Outside ankle.

966
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,960
From this point,

967
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,970
we'll find an acupuncture point

968
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,820
in the knee's lateral posterior area.

969
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,300
Alright, from here to here.

970
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,820
Pay attention.

971
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,510
We'll take a midpoint here.

972
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,530
This is our

973
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,970
midpoint here.

974
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,850
Slightly inward.

975
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,340
Toward the bone's inner surface.

976
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,700
Tibial periostitis.

977
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,400
Then toward the lateral direction.

978
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,730
Alright, this midpoint is here.

979
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,930
And slightly inward.

980
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,080
Bro, what's wrong?

981
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,860
I've stuck myself.

982
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,040
Are you okay?

983
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,420
You came.

984
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,320
Dad, you're here too.

985
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,620
How is he?

986
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,760
Could I not come?

987
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,820
He's got a muscle strain.

988
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,140
He needs at least a month
of no intense activity.

989
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,200
That serious?

990
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,120
Yes. It's serious.

991
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,640
So,

992
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,580
he's been injured for at least half a month.

993
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,590
Bro,

994
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,480
why didn't you say something earlier?

995
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,820
I thought since I was studying medicine,

996
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,080
I could treat it myself.

997
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,840
I didn't expect to make it worse.

998
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,180
He's been wanting

999
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,080
to keep training with us.

1000
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,540
It's just a minor injury.

1001
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,520
I'll be fine after ten days or so.

1002
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,900
No.

1003
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,860
You're hurt this bad.

1004
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,140
You need to rest.

1005
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,840
Don't join our training anymore.

1006
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,500
Who says he can't continue

1007
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,760
with the beach volleyball team?

1008
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,480
Dad, this...

1009
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,840
Shao Nian,

1010
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,280
you've got good theoretical knowledge,

1011
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,860
and you've gained some practical experience

1012
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,440
training with us.

1013
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,240
You can stay on the team as an assistant coach.

1014
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,840
Assistant coach?

1015
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,840
Uncle, are you serious?

1016
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,400
Good for you.

1017
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,300
All that studying and training

1018
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,400
didn't go to waste.

1019
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,580
I think it's a good idea.

1020
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,180
Anyway, Xiaojing is about to graduate,

1021
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,720
and we need an assistant coach.

1022
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,860
And Shao Nian is a medical student.

1023
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,000
He can also be our doctor.

1024
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,040
Really, Uncle?

1025
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,760
I mean what I say.

1026
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,640
Well done, bro.

1027
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,100
All that hard work and training

1028
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,360
wasn't for nothing.

1029
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,720
Shao Nian,

1030
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,120
from now on, during team training,

1031
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,180
you'll assist me.

1032
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,020
And

1033
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,780
if anyone gets injured

1034
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,420
during practice,

1035
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,880
make sure to help them out.

1036
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,200
Slowly, slowly.

1037
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,160
Consider it done.

1038
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,060
(Wuxi Town Beach Volleyball Grand Prix)
Hello, everyone!

1039
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:56,900
Stretch out to warm up.

1040
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,900
Welcome, everyone.

1041
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,640
Warm up.

1042
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,500
- to the Wuxi Town Beach Volleyball Grand Prix.
- Stretch out.

1043
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,780
For Wuxi Town,

1044
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,140
a coastal city,

1045
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,420
the beach volleyball prix

1046
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,860
is an annual event.

1047
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,820
Great! They seem strong.

1048
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,380
All beach volleyball enthusiasts

1049
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,580
gather here

1050
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,500
to celebrate.

1051
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,580
- It should be okay.
- Yeah.

1052
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,200
They aren't professional players.

1053
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,820
Remember your positions

1054
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,820
on the court, okay?

1055
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,120
Keep a good mindset

1056
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,500
and play as we practiced,

1057
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,720
alright?

1058
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,860
- Alright!
- Alright!

1059
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,760
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

1060
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,620
Watch carefully.

1061
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,600
Wen Xin, Jingxuan,

1062
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,040
you two will play in the first round.

1063
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,300
Why?

1064
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,400
Got it.

1065
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,220
Coach.

1066
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,540
Wen Xin and I?

1067
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,600
Get ready quickly.

1068
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,660
It's okay.

1069
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,980
Go for it!

1070
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,380
Go for it!

1071
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,860
Go for it!

1072
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,360
One, two. We can do this.

(Dafu Team vs. Liulu Team, Score)

1075
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,840
Go for it.

1076
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,160
- Good shot!
- Good shot!

1077
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,000

Good shot!

1080
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,680
Go, Jingxuan!

1081
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,100
Their drop shots aren't high enough.

1082
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,040
Yes, just like that.

1083
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,860
Right, right.

1084
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,000
A bit unfortunate with that shot.

1085
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,140
Come on!

00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,140

1088
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,300
after all my strength training,

1089
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,440
why didn't you start with me and Chen Weilan?

1090
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,080
Dad.

1091

Warm up.

1094
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,620
