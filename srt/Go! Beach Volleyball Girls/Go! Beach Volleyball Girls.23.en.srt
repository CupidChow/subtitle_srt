00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,860
Chen Weilan?

Chen Weilan?

20
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,680
Dr. Wu.

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,480
I remember you told me last time

22
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,460
nothing was wrong with my wrist bones.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,740
But it's still quite painful recently.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,140
I haven't even dared to train.

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,400
I just want to know if this

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,100
will affect playing beach volleyball.

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,060
It's hard to say now.

28
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,340
We need to do two more tests to see clearly.

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,380
Two more tests?

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,420
But don't worry too much.

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,560
The tests are

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,800
to better confirm your current hand condition.

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,300
It doesn't mean the condition
is necessarily severe.

34
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,240
But we need X-rays

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,460
to see more clearly.

36
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,680
Gao Ge.

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
I called you many times.

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,780
I had to search everywhere.

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,300
I was playing ball, so I didn't hear it.

40
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,640
Why aren't you

41
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,580
practicing with us?

42
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,860
What's the point?

43
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,140
The team is about to disband.

44
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,000
Is it because Xiaojing

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,240
didn't win the championship?

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,140
Is that why?

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,840
Don't worry.

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
As long as the team has us

49
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,480
and Chen Weilan,

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,100
we'll win sooner or later.

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,500
Chen Weilan?

52
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,060
You don't know, right?

53
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,020
Chen Weilan is leaving.

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,100
Where is she gonna go?

55
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
Beijing.

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,940
She's going back to the NYT.

57
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,920
Impossible.

58
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,420
How could I not know if she's leaving?

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,800
Don't believe it?

60
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,720
Go ask her.

61
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,760
You're back.

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,060
You ran back?

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,080
What's going on?

64
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,280
Going back to Beijing,

65
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,340
why aren't you packing?

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,860
Where am I going?

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,980
I know everything.

68
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,780
Chen Weilan, I just want to know

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,440
why you didn't tell me you planned

70
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,480
to leave the team

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,600
and went back to Beijing.

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,260
Still want to hide it from me?

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,420
Who told you?

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,980
Don't worry about that.

75
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,040
I'm the captain,

76
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,280
and you're on my team.

77
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,400
You can't come and go

78
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,520
as you please.

79
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,360
Li Guoduo,

80
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,700
speak with evidence.

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,780
Gao Ge just told me directly

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you're leaving the team

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,220
to go back to Beijing to play.

84
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,660
Li Guoduo, if you're going to say that,

85
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,020
I really do want to leave.

86
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,100
Do you know how bad you are at playing?

87
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,280
Can you even pass the ball properly?

88
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,600
Can you even receive the ball?

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,360
Which is playing, the ball or you?

90
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
Say it again, Chen Weilan.

91
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,260
You've finally spoken your mind, right?

92
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
Do you think you're so great?

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,320
NYT and other national team.

94
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,200
Whatever.

95
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,720
Do you really think you're that good?

96
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,400
You're always forcing yourself to spike.

97
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,240
You don't even understand what teamwork is.

98
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,080
After so many years,

99
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,580
you still don't know about teamwork.

100
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,920
I have to tell you to play.

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,840
I have to coordinate.

102
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,960
Can't you see that?

103
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,000
Playing beach volleyball

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,200
with you is a waste of time.

105
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,540
- Say it again.
- Exactly.

106
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,800
Let me tell you.

107
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,160
I also look down on you.

108
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,140
Who do you think you are?

109
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,360
Let's go separate ways.

110
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,980
No one needs to care about the other.

111
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,240
You're crazy.

112
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
Liang,

113
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,620
I'm going back.

114
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,120
I've booked my ticket.

115
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,220
Come pick me up then.

116
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,480
Tu Lingling,

117
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,280
I will go to Ocean University.

118
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,480
Tell the leaders as well.

119
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
I will arrive on time.

120
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
Okay?

121
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,040
Duoduo.

122
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,720
What's wrong?

123
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,560
Nothing.

124
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,400
Well.

125
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,240
Duoduo,

126
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,960
that was a misunderstanding at the karaoke.

127
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,900
Don't overthink.

128
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,800
Shao Nian,

129
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,320
you don't need to explain

130
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,480
your matters with Tu to me.

131
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,440
Not now,

132
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,360
and not in the future.

133
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,260
Why not?

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,220
Lingling is a very outstanding girl.

135
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,900
You should get to know her better.

136
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,640
Li Guoduo, do you really want me

137
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,860
to continue to get to know her?

138
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,280
Yes.

139
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
She's beautiful and a good player.

140
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,440
So, I'm also going to Ocean University

141
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,340
as a non-roster player.

142
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,720
You're leaving Xingang

143
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,980
to play at Ocean University?

144
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,180
What about our team? You're the captain!

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Captain?

146
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,720
Does anyone see me as the captain?

147
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,780
Does anyone listen to me?

148
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,640
I can't manage anything now.

149
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,020
I just want to be the best player.

150
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,340
(Coach Zhang)

151
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,220
(Coach Zhang)

152
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,260
(Coach Zhang)

153
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,460
- Please take a look.
- Okay, okay.

154
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,120
Hope you can come again.

155
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,960
Okay.

156
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,880
Take care.

157
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,320
You go.

158
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,460
Go check on her.

159
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,980
- Sprinkle some seasoning.
- Go check.

160
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,160
Two more kebabs, please.

161
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay.

162
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,000
Drink up.

163
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,000
One can of juice.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,980
I can still make the decisions.

165
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,280
Here it is.

166
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,200
Your kebabs. Enjoy.

167
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,040
What's wrong?

168
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,180
Going to Ocean University to play

169
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,440
makes you so happy

170
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,500
that you can't even drink the juice?

171
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,600
Dad,

172
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,140
why does Chen Weilan

173
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,900
want to go back to Beijing?

174
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,340
Why do you want to go to Ocean University?

175
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,100
Because I want to make myself stronger.

176
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,300
That's right.

177
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,900
Chen Weilan thinks the same way.

178
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,600
But I only said those things out of anger.

179
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,340
I don't want to go to Ocean University.

180
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,380
I also don't want her to leave.

181
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,780
Words once spoken are like spilled water.

182
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,700
In life,

183
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,500
you have to look forward.

184
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,940
Besides,

185
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,200
Chen Weilan

186
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,240
has good talent

187
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,100
and physical condition.

188
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,940
She should have

189
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,660
a better future.

190
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,420
Don't think too much.

191
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,760
Come on.

192
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,880
Drink the juice.

193
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
Drink up.

194
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,820
If you don't drink it, I will.

195
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,540
Just one sip. Come on.

196
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
Sweetie.

197
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,400
Mom.

198
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,620
Look.

199
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,980
I made you some hot soup noodles.

200
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,940
- Thanks, Mom.
- Eat up.

201
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,880
Is it good?

202
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,800
It's good.

203
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,480
I've arranged an orthopedic hospital

204
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,380
for you to intern.

205
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,620
You can start tomorrow.

206
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,360
Mom,

207
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,900
when did I say I wanted to intern
at a hospital?

208
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,740
If you don't intern,

209
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
are you going to work

210
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,740
at that dirty barbecue shop?

211
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,420
Mom, I told you.

212
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,100
Uncle Li's barbecue shop isn't dirty.

213
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,560
We clean the kitchen

214
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,860
many times a day before we start.

215
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,520
All the ingredients, plates, and skewers

216
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,600
are washed thoroughly.

217
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,940
It's very hygienic and clean.

218
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,660
So, you do all kinds of chores there?

219
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,360
Did I raise you

220
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,400
and send you to college

221
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,320
so you could do these

222
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,920
dirty and tiring jobs for them?

223
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,120
What's wrong with doing

224
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,320
what I want and being with the person I like?

225
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,600
The person you like
may not want to be with you.

226
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,440
Impossible.

227
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,960
I'm confident.

228
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,800
Fine.

229
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,420
Let's make a bet.

230
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,480
If I'm right,

231
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,320
you'll intern at the hospital.

232
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,160
Deal?

233
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,520
A bet is a bet.

234
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,600
I'm not afraid.

235
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,180
- Get it.
- Gather up.

236
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,600
Gather up.

237
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,400
Come on, quickly.

238
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,280
Faster.

239
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,820
Let me introduce

240
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,420
our new team member, Li Guoduo.

241
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,620
Let's welcome her.

242
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,300
I've watched Li Guoduo's games before.

243
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,560
She's agile

244
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,180
and has quick defensive moves.

245
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,980
There's a lot we can learn from her.

246
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,940
In future training,

247
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,700
I hope you all work together

248
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,060
and get along soon,

249
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,880
to be fully prepared

250
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,100
for the next competition.

251
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,940
Guoduo, introduce yourself.

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,720
Hello, everyone. I'm Li Guoduo.

253
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,520
I've always loved playing beach volleyball.

254
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,600
Nice to meet you all.

255
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,440
Thank you.

256
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,900
Li Guoduo, go.

257
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,960
Okay.

258
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,300
Let's start training.

259
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,280
Come on, let's train.

260
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,420
- Let's go.
- Come on.

261
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,480
Thank you.

262
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,640
Get moving.

263
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,020
It's been half an hour. Where are they?

264
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,320
Coach,

265
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,720
hasn't Weilan missed training

266
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,780
for a few days?

267
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,520
Yes.

268
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,220
She's not here. Guoduo isn't here either.

269
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,220
What's going on?

270
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,460
How about we start practicing first?

271
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,800
No, something is clearly up.

272
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Can you practice

273
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,900
without figuring it out?

274
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,760
I just called them.

275
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,400
Guoduo didn't answer.

276
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,260
Weilan said she was not feeling well.

277
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,280
Maybe Shao Nian knows where they are.

278
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,900
How about calling Shao Nian?

279
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,680
I'm off to see another patient.

280
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,100
No fever, 36 degrees.

281
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,600
Dr. Zhao is here.

282
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,440
Hello.

283
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,040
Zhang.

284
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,660
How are you feeling?

285
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,840
Much better.

286
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,940
It doesn't hurt anymore.

287
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,960
Any other discomfort?

288
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,800
No.

289
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,340
I'll step out to take a call.

290
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,760
- Hello?
- Shao Nian.

291
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,200
Duoduo missed her training.

292
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,420
Do you know why?

293
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,840
She…

294
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,040
Why are you stammering?

295
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,100
What happened?

296
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,220
Nothing.

297
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,030
She's gone to Ocean University to play.

298
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,540
I have to go. Bye.

299
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,380
Hello?

300
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,720
What's up?

301
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,620
Shao Nian said Duoduo

302
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,180
went to Ocean University to play.

303
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,480
Duoduo abandoned us

304
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,660
and the team?

305
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,120
I don't believe it.

306
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,320
No matter who leaves the team,

307
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,620
Duoduo won't leave.

308
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,660
But

309
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,920
if you see your former partner

310
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,400
winning the Seven-School League

311
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,180
while you are still nothing,

312
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,900
it's hard to say.

313
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,620
Alright, stop guessing.

314
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,900
I'll go check it out. You guys carry on.

315
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,000
Gao.

316
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,480
Gao.

317
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,780
Think of something.

318
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,580
You're a senior member of the team.

319
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,240
With such a big issue,

320
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,440
you should think of something.

321
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,720
Li Guoduo has left.

322
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,060
Chen Weilan is going to Beijing.

323
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,120
You two are about to graduate.

324
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,860
Forget about the team.

325
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,960
What?

326
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,660
Chen Weilan is going to Beijing?

327
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,900
What's going on?

328
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,600
Yeah.

329
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,140
Stop practicing.

330
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,680
Why?

331
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,820
I was about to win.

332
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,920
What's going on?

333
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,220
What happened?

334
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,540
The team is in chaos.

335
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,280
Duoduo is going to train
at Ocean University.

336
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,900
Chen Weilan is going back to Beijing.

337
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
The team is falling apart.

338
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,160
What?

339
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,020
So much happened when I was not there?

340
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,800
Who knows?

341
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,100
If you can't handle

342
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,920
Chen Weilan's issue,

343
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,980
no one else can.

344
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,300
Li Guoduo went to train at Ocean University?

345
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,360
Did she argue with Shao Nian?

346
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,300
Why is that?

347
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,900
Don't mention Shao Nian.

348
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,000
This guy

349
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,520
hasn't returned to the dorm lately.

350
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,340
Now, he's interning at a hospital.

351
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,100
I knew it.

352
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,960
He hasn't replied to my messages

353
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,920
these days.

354
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,460
He hangs up after just a few words.

355
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,740
Let's talk to him.

356
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,760
How?

357
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,260
We can't even see him.

358
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,480
Let's go to his home.

359
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,600
Have you been there?

360
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,440
I haven't.

361
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,820
(Address)

362
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,870
Is it this one?

363
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,560
Really?

364
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,300
Is it really this place?

365
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,920
Let's ask.

366
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,580
You're going in like that?

367
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,920
What else?

368
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,560
Should I bring a gift?

369
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,400
Well.

370
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,980
How are you going to explain?

371
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,140
Just say what needs to be said.

372
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,920
Call him.

373
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,740
I did. He didn't answer.

374
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,260
Slow down.

375
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,460
Who are you looking for?

376
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,700
Is Shao Nian here?

377
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,320
Please have some tea.

378
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,760
Thank you.

379
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,400
Have some tea.

380
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,740
Now I understand why

381
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,500
you were forced to study medicine.

382
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,580
I didn't know your family situation before.

383
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,940
I thought your parents were old-fashioned.

384
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,220
I wanted to help you

385
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,980
and persuade you.

386
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,580
Now, I see I was overthinking.

387
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,120
Shao Nian, you told me

388
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,300
you wanted to study art.

389
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,740
I used my past experiences to advise you.

390
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,360
Shao Nian,

391
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
when you listened to me back then,

392
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,100
did you think it was a joke?

393
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,820
No, I didn't mean to hide it from you all.

394
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,200
Shao Nian,

395
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,780
it's nothing.

396
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
A lot has happened

397
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,400
in the team recently.

398
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,240
We're worried.

399
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,340
Then why are you interning at the hospital?

400
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,900
I'm not interning

401
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,660
at the hospital.

402
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,300
I'm just helping out.

403
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,780
I had a bet with my mom.

404
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,940
If Duoduo doesn't accept me,

405
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,300
I'll work at the hospital.

406
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,360
You confessed to Guoduo?

407
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,200
Not yet.

408
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,740
I had no chance.

409
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,560
She's at Ocean Uni.

410
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,400
Shao Nian,

411
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,160
Going to Ocean University

412
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,620
was Li Guoduo's choice.

413
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,640
No one knows

414
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,720
exactly what happened.

415
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,700
What are you doing?

416
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,040
What do you mean?

417
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,160
Are you giving up?

418
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,300
I'm not giving up.

419
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,280
I just don't know

420
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,300
what to do right now.

421
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,560
Sweetie.

422
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,120
Oh, we have guests.

423
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,060
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

424
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,160
Mom,

425
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,720
this is Gao Ge. This is Xia Liqiang.

426
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,560
My schoolmates.

427
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,700
- Hello.
- Hello, Auntie.

428
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,580
Come on, have a seat.

429
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,800
Welcome.

430
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,340
Are you Shao Nian's schoolmates?

431
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,900
Are you studying medicine?

432
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
I'm studying management.

433
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,460
I'm studying sports.

434
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,240
Mom,

435
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,960
Gao Ge is good at beach volleyball.

436
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,220
He's well-known in the city.

437
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,540
Yeah, girls line up to chase him.

438
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,320
Is Li Guoduo

439
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,220
also very good at beach volleyball?

440
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,760
Does she

441
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,040
have a line of admirers too?

442
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,880
Auntie,

443
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,480
Li Guoduo is our captain.

444
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,680
Her skills are top-notch.

445
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,740
She has a great character.

446
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,860
Great character?

447
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,100
I've met her a few times.

448
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,720
She's always

449
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,060
so aggressive towards me.

450
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,200
Mom,

451
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,860
that's because you've crossed a line.

452
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,860
I'm an elder.

453
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,460
I don't want to deal with her.

454
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,940
I don't care who she is.

455
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,520
I need to know...

456
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,780
Mom, can you drop this, please?

457
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,160
Auntie,

458
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,780
it's getting late. We should go.

459
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,660
No, no, no, wait.

460
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,880
Don't leave yet.

461
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,240
Stay for dinner.

462
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,620
We can chat some more.

463
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,340
You have no idea.

464
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,240
I do business.

465
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,380
I have many connections.

466
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,260
When you graduate,

467
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,780
I can help you with jobs.

468
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,780
If you need anything, just ask.

469
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,220
I will definitely help you.

470
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,600
Auntie,

471
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,440
thanks,

472
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,520
but I prefer to rely

473
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,420
on my own efforts.

474
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,620
Thank you, though.

475
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,280
Shao Nian,

476
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,720
sorry.

477
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,940
I came unannounced today.

478
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,460
Sorry for all the trouble.

479
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,510
Gao.

480
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,800
Gao.

481
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,280
Bro, it's okay.

482
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll go talk to him.

483
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,420
Auntie, we'll be going now.

484
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,700
Alright, goodbye.

485
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,100
What's with them?

486
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm off to study.

487
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,720
What?

488
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,460
What's wrong with him?

489
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,220
Did I say something wrong?

490
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,180
(Ocean University)
Qianqian

491
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,760
and Xiaoxue

492
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,660
have the same problem.

493
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,700
They don't cooperate

494
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,200
or trust each other.

495
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,080
Can you focus?

496
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,380
Do you always pass like this?

497
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,520
We always train like this.

498
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,960
Can't you keep up?

499
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,920
No, let's go again.

500
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,220
Let's switch.

501
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,480
Come on.

502
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,080
Again.

503
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,740
- Catch it.
- Good shot.

504
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,400
Okay.

505
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,360
Come on.

506
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,240
Nice shot.

507
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,120
Give it to me.

508
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,560
Come on.

509
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,040
Not bad.

510
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,300
- Last month.
- Your finger.

511
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,540
This month again?

512
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,160
- Okay.
- Catch.

513
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,680
She can't take any more leave.

514
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,520
Okay.

515
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,390
- Good shot.
- Again.

516
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,440
Coach Lu.

517
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,220
Why the gifts?

518
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,960
It's nothing.

519
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,740
Eat more fruits. They're good for your skin.

520
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,380
What do you need?

521
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,280
Let's talk outside.

522
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,280
Okay.

523
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,080
I want to court you,

524
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
so you poached my player.

525
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,460
You've got nerve.

526
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,320
- Coach Lu.
- Hello, Coach.

527
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,160
Hello.

528
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,720
Work and personal matters

529
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,940
shouldn't mix.

530
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,080
Fine.

531
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,920
About my matter.

532
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,560
I know a lot about you,

533
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,680
but you don't know me.

534
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,220
I can get to know you slowly.

535
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,660
Do you know

536
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,840
why I invited Li Guoduo

537
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,740
to play here?

538
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,220
Isn't it because

539
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,360
you have an eye for talent

540
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,420
and want more time to get to know me?

541
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,220
You know she's a good talent.

542
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,640
Why not train her well

543
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,980
for better development?

544
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,840
Coach Tian,

545
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,860
this is

546
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,060
beyond my capability.

547
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,220
That's being irresponsible at work.

548
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,520
If you can make

549
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,360
a detailed resume,

550
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,040
why can't you create a plan

551
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,440
to train your players well?

552
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,280
Right.

553
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,820
You're right.

554
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,220
I humbly accept it.

555
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,600
Li Guoduo also believes

556
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,840
she can improve here.

557
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,680
That's why she came.

558
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,000
Can I

559
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,940
see her and talk to her?

560
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,100
Have some water.

561
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,280
Thank you.

562
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,720
When you were practicing,

563
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,980
the finger strength was lacking.

564
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,080
- I think...
- Tu.

565
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,260
The coach wants to see you.

566
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,940
Want to see me?

567
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,440
Wait a moment.

568
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,820
- What's up?
- Just come with me.

569
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,720
Do you know?

570
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,980
Li Guoduo

571
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,860
used to be Lingling's partner.

572
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,120
Really?

573
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,480
Lingling won the championship.

574
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,040
Isn't it embarrassing to be

575
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,880
her partner now?

576
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,720
I saw her basics

577
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,780
seem solid.

578
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,080
No wonder Coach Tian wanted her here.

579
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,140
If you think she's good,

580
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,060
then you partner with her.

581
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,680
Coach.

582
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,100
What's up?

583
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,580
Our team... Well...

584
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,720
What's wrong?

585
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,320
Nothing.

586
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,440
Nothing.

587
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,560
I saw you were earnest in training.

588
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,240
Coach Tian values you.

589
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,680
You're

590
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,720
in a high-level team now.

591
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,740
Make the most of it

592
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,780
and strive for good results soon.

593
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,840
I understand.

594
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,780
Is that all, Coach?

595
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,000
That's all.

596
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,280
Don't worry.

597
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
With me here, nothing

598
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,580
will go wrong with our team.

599
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,080
Well.

600
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,930
You

601
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,520
take good care

602
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,860
of Coach Tian.

603
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,680
I'll visit you often.

604
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,640
Go back to training.

605
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,700
I'm off. Bye.

606
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,960
This…

607
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,780
Quick. Go.

608
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,920
Come in.

609
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,640
Weilan.

610
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,600
What's up?

611
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,220
Are you upset that Duoduo

612
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,780
went to Ocean University?

613
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,960
Don't worry.

614
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,360
We'll bring her back

615
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,320
and question her

616
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,660
about what happened.

617
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,740
She can go wherever she wants.

618
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,500
I don't care.

619
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,840
Bringing her back

620
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,220
doesn't mean she's willing.

621
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,700
You make it sound

622
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,900
like a love affair.

623
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,140
Well, it's a bit like that.

624
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,600
We argue all the time.

625
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,060
I'm not sure why.

626
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,020
If you two are dating,

627
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,380
what about Gao Ge?

628
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,880
What?

629
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,260
What does this have to do with Gao Ge?

630
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,960
Oh, my god.

631
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,980
Suit yourself.

632
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,300
I have stuff to look up.

633
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,740
I'm off then.

634
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,920
Bye.

635
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,460
She must be mad.

636
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,820
Your injury isn't a big deal anymore.

637
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,300
So, can I spike now?

638
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,560
Yes, you can.

639
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,820
Anything else I should be aware of?

640
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,040
Nothing else.

641
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,540
Just come back for your follow-ups.

642
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,920
Alright.

643
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,300
Is that patient named Chen Weilan?

644
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,160
In Room 6.

645
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,000
Room 6.

646
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,760
Come in.

647
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,440
Dr. Wu,

648
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,440
are you busy?

649
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,680
Not too much.

650
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,640
I wanted to ask if there's

651
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,560
a patient named
Chen Weilan in this room.

652
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,520
Did you attend to her?

653
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,740
Yes, why?

654
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,080
Oh, nothing. She's my junior from school.

655
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,320
I saw her in the hall just now,

656
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,400
so I wanted to check on her.

657
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,300
What's wrong with her?

658
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,480
It's nothing major.

659
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,060
Her old injury on her wrist flared up.

660
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,260
She's been coming for follow-ups these days.

661
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,320
She's almost healed.

662
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,340
Has she been coming lately?

663
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,180
For several days in a row.

664
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,040
She's fine. Good.

665
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,320
Since she's my junior,

666
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,200
I wanted to ask you

667
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,560
to keep an eye on her.

668
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,700
You can tell me about her.

669
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,000
- Okay.
- Sure.

670
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,240
Thanks a lot.

671
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,460
- Sure.
- Thank you.

672
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,300
Rock-paper-scissors.

673
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,000
My turn.

674
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,280
Place it here.

675
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,920
I'm back.

676
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,040
You're back.

677
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,340
Where did you go?

678
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,760
I ran out of my toys,

679
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,600
so I went to restock.

680
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,760
I messaged you, but you didn't reply.

681
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,320
But I'm back now.

682
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,580
Don't be mad.

683
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,540
Why aren't you all training?

684
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,420
Duoduo and Weilan aren't here.

685
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,180
The coach isn't here either.

686
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,460
We just can't focus on training.

687
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,720
What's this? Let me see.

688
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,250
My toy. Super cute.

689
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,940
I know it.

690
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,660
What do you know?

691
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,520
Do you remember a few days ago,

692
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
we were speculating

693
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,760
about why Weilan didn't come,

694
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,280
and Duoduo guessed

695
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,720
she went to Beijing?

696
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,620
- Yeah.
- Right.

697
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,700
Guess who I saw today?

698
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,180
I saw Chen Weilan at the hospital.

699
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,620
I checked her record.

700
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,860
Her old wrist injury flared up.

701
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,460
She's been at the hospital.

702
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,000
So, Duoduo

703
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,360
misunderstood Weilan.

704
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,100
Duoduo has a fiery temper.

705
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,560
It's not surprising she misunderstood.

706
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,640
Weilan isn't one to explain herself,

707
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,220
so the misunderstanding just grew.

708
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,600
That's true.

709
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,900
What should we do now?

710
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,880
Stop pretending.

711
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,820
Guess who I saw today?

712
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,080
Who?

713
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,260
Chen Weilan.

714
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,600
She didn't leave.

715
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,180
When is she leaving?

716
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,600
Should I take her

717
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,540
to the station myself

718
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,220
so she never wants to come back?

719
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,740
What's with you?

720
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,360
She didn't plan to leave.

721
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,280
She missed training

722
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,540
because she was in the hospital.

723
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,800
Is her wrist

724
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,560
okay?

725
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,340
You knew she hurt her wrist?

726
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,840
Yeah.

727
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,700
What's wrong with you?

728
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,820
If you knew it, why accuse her?

729
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,640
Weilan wasn't trying to join the NYT.

730
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,860
She's been getting treatment.

731
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,780
She can do whatever she wants.

732
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,420
It's none of my business.

733
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,100
I'm telling you out of kindness,

734
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,200
unlike some people who knew

735
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,820
she was injured and didn't tell us.

736
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,560
That's because

737
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,980
she wanted to keep it private.

738
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,240
I even thought about bringing you

739
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,140
- the X-ray.
- Enough.

740
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,300
Will you go to see her?

741
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,720
She's back. Why should I go see her?

742
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,440
Look at yourself.

743
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,540
If you don't go, I will.

744
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,880
Then Duoduo can return.

745
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,740
I'm off. Bye.

746
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,900
Am I in Beijing?

747
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,840
You went to Ocean University for a few days

748
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,400
and forgot what the captain

749
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,620
of the Xingang team looks like?

750
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,620
This isn't Beijing,

751
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,260
and it's not Ocean University.

752
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,060
This is Xingang's team.

753
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,960
Duoduo, come here.

754
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,280
Sit down.

755
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,960
Sit, sit, sit.

756
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,440
Today,

757
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,460
I called both of you here

758
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,900
to clear things up.

759
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,860
It's just a misunderstanding.

760
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,120
I won't get involved.

761
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,280
You two talk it out.

762
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,260
I have nothing to say.

763
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,600
Look for yourself.

764
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,880
(Zhang Yecheng)
I'm grateful

765
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,730
to you for your guidance,

766
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,000
but I've decided to stay

767
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,860
at Xingang to play beach volleyball.

768
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,950
Here,

769
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,060
I can not only improve my skills,

770
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,230
but I also gain something more valuable.

771
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,330
Must you read it out loud?

772
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,660
What valuable thing?

773
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,360
Is it me?

774
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,440
Don't flatter yourself.

775
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,500
It's playing beach volleyball.

776
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,920
Where are you going?

777
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,760
To practice.

778
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,250

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,500
Of course not.

803
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,580
I just think it's great

804
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,300
that our team has finally stabilized.

805
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,580
You and Duoduo

have built up good chemistry.

- Call me.
- Sure.

822
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,020
Coach, I'm leaving.

823
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,600
Bye-bye.

824
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,120
Have a reasonable schedule.

825
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,960
Okay.

826
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,190
Bye-bye.

827
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,500
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

828
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,400
Lingling,

829
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,180
I want to tell you something.

830
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,400
What is it?

831
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,780
I don't have a partner here.

832
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,260
I want to return to Xingang.

833
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,580
Duoduo, listen to me.

834
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,140
Your school's training

835
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,540
is very unsystematic.

836
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,220
Without a solid foundation,

837
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,140
it's hard to improve your skills.

838
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,900
It's not that bad.

839
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,420
We have coaches to guide us.

840
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,910
To be honest,

841
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,500
your coach is a fraud.

842
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,980
Can you trust his words?

843
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,960
Isn't my dad there too?

844
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,060
He gives me extra training.

845
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,400
Yes,

846
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,940
Uncle Li is great,

847
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,260
but he played men's beach volleyball.

848
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,920
Men's and women's beach volleyball

849
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,920
have different techniques

850
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,380
and power dynamics.

851
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,360
Coach.

852
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,200
Guoduo,

853
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,240
Lingling is right.

854
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,220
When I watched your training,

855
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,660
I noticed your spikes are too straightforward.

856
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,380
Women's and men's

857
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,260
are different.

858
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,160
The power difference

859
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,120
is significant

860
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,220
for these two.

861
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,020
You need to use more feints and techniques,

862
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,180
like in chess.

863
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,360
Beach volleyball

864
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,240
is a two-person game

865
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,220
of strategy at the net.

866
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,320
Right.

867
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,420
Don't overthink it.

868
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,000
Thanks, Coach.

869
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,100
Let's have tasty food.

870
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,700
- Hello, Jingxuan.
- Hey, Weilan.

871
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,820
Where are you?

872
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,640
Can you come to the big classroom?

873
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,040
- I...
- Don't worry.

874
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,880
I'm coming.

875
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,360
Careful, careful.

876
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,620
- Slow down.
- Jingxuan.

877
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,720
What happened?

878
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,800
What's going on?

879
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,660
To the hospital.

880
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,340
Quickly, check her out.

881
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,620
Someone left this on her desk.

882
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,580
Oh, my.

883
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,160
Hurry, hurry.

884
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,020
Slow down, slow down.

885
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,660
(Outpatient)

886
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,960
This student

887
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,020
is fine physically,

888
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,700
just a bit shaken.

889
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,140
She'll be okay.

890
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,460
Her psychological state will take

891
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,660
some time to recover.

892
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,960
Is there anything else?

893
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,220
Nothing special.

894
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,400
Just make sure

895
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,500
not to scare her anymore.

896
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,080
Got it, thank you.

897
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,240
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

898
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,340
Take good care of yourself.

899
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,740
Is she okay?

900
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
What kind of person would do such a thing?

901
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,420
We need to find this person.

902
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,500
What if they threaten her again?

903
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,380
We can't handle this alone.

904
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,820
We need to report it to the school.

905
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,660
I'll go to the school.

906
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,760
You stay with her.

907
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,860
Call me if anything happens.

908
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:08,810
Okay.

909
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,800
This behavior

910
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,700
is outrageous

911
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,460
and a disgrace to our school.

912
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,000
We cannot tolerate

913
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,040
or condone

914
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,580
such morally corrupt actions.

915
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,120
Well.

916
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,430
Let's call the cops.

917
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,280
Wait, Secretary.

918
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,820
I think we should check

919
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,360
the surveillance first.

920
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,340
The police can wait.

921
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,040
If we find no leads,

922
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,140
then we can report it.

923
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,620
After all, this involves

924
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,480
the school's

925
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,860
and students' reputations.

926
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,400
Yes, Secretary. Plus,

927
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,970
Jingxuan is quite timid.

928
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,200
Reporting this to the police

929
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,160
might make her

930
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,700
