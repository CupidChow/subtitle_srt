18
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,340
Alright.

19
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,720
Shao Nian

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,240
must treat us someday

21
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,920
for the trouble we went through

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,100
helping him appease Li Guoduo.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,140
I'd really appreciate it.

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,860
Actually, I'm worried about him.

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,140
What are you worried about?

26
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,560
Coach Lu.

27
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,420
That impostor.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,180
If only he hadn't come.

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,540
He's been messing with us.

30
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,560
Everyone thought

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,380
he was good at tactics.

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,300
If they know he's a fraud,

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,460
what will they think?

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,200
We aren't afraid

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,260
of the Seven-School League.

36
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,540
What about Xiaojing and the others?

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,460
Ultimately,

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,280
you're worried your girlfriend

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,380
won't get her graduate slot.

40
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,800
As the former captain,

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,720
I'm worried about my successors.

42
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,740
Come on.

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,420
Seriously,

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,440
even if we had a real

45
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,840
National Youth Team coach,

46
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,900
it might not work out.

47
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,660
Why are you so sure?

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,100
I just know.

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,400
Now that we know he's a fraud,

50
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,240
it's a good thing.

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,680
We still have time

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,940
to find a solution.

53
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,140
- Leaving.
- Wait. What solution?

54
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,660
(Former China women's volleyball team captain,
Olympic champion, Hui Ruoqi)

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,300
Bro,

56
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,940
you're serious about your mascot.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,720
You didn't take this many notes

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,060
even for your finals.

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,820
Always joking around.

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,760
I'm doing this for the team's future.

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,180
Let your future wave on.

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,340
I can't keep up.

63
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,100
Come on.

64
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,080
Finish the last two videos.

65
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,540
Fine. I'll continue.

66
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
If you were a coach,

67
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,260
you'd definitely be a tough one.

68
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,040
Why do you say that?

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,940
You're already pretty tough now.

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,380
I'm on it.

71
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,480
Focus.

72
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,860
(Coordinating the pass...)

73
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,320
The cafeteria has the same dishes.

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,740
I'm tired of them.

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,400
It's because your parents

76
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,640
are such good cooks.

77
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,200
You're surrounded by good food,

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,340
so you don't like the cafeteria meals.

79
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
Jingxuan,

80
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,840
aren't you tired of these dishes?

81
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,320
It's the same few dishes every day.

82
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,400
Over and over.

83
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,620
Aren't you tired of it?

84
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,340
Just feed yourself in the cafeteria.

85
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,500
If you want better food, just go home.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,960
I'm going home this weekend

87
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,080
to treat myself

88
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,300
to a good barbecue.

89
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,120
By the way, we're going to train

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,080
with Xiaojing and Xixi later.

91
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,920
Wanna join us?

92
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,400
You all go ahead.

93
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,580
I have a class later.

94
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,720
Alright.

95
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,580
I'm having two steamed buns today.

96
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,360
Hey.

97
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,320
Hey.

98
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
Shao Nian.

99
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,840
What are you looking at?

100
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,680
Nothing.

101
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,500
Here, have some fish.

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,580
Isn't this

103
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,460
the training guide you gave each of us?

104
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,000
You wrote this?

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,140
You can't even play volleyball.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,020
Jingxuan.

107
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,120
- Four or five pages for Jingxuan.
- Why can't you stop it?

108
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,820
Only five or six pages for me?

109
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,800
Chen Weilan, seven, eight, nine, ten...

110
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,220
Why does Chen Weilan have so many pages?

111
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,580
I train a lot.

112
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,500
Is this really written by you?

113
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,680
I helped.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,960
Don't I train enough?

115
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,040
Why do I only have this much?

116
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm the captain,

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,540
and I train hard.

118
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,180
I'm done eating.

119
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,100
You guys take your time.

120
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,180
Jingxuan.

121
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,260
Are you okay?

122
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,220
I can tell

123
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,340
that Gao Ge

124
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,220
really likes Chen Weilan.

125
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,020
Chen Weilan likes Gao Ge too,

126
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,380
but she might not realize it yet.

127
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,860
I know what you're going to say.

128
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,040
At first, I joined the team

129
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,380
because of Gao Ge,

130
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,080
but now

131
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,760
I genuinely love the sport.

132
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,980
So, don't worry.

133
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,700
I won't

134
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,060
leave the team.

135
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,020
And

136
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,540
liking him

137
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,140
doesn't mean I have to be with him.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,300
If you can say that,

139
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,300
I feel reassured.

140
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,060
I believe

141
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,400
you'll find great success

142
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
both in beach volleyball

143
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,760
and in love.

144
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,620
Trust me.

145
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,060
By the way, Duoduo,

146
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,620
I want to remind you too.

147
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,020
When love comes,

148
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,340
make sure to seize it.

149
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,600
Of course.

150
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,980
But I haven't encountered it yet.

151
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,060
Shao Nian.

152
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,640
He?

153
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,080
No way.

154
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,520
He's my buddy.

155
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,360
Impossible.

156
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,500
Come on.

157
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,060
Is it brotherhood

158
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,500
or love?

159
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,460
Think it through.

160
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600
I think the notes

161
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,700
are pretty detailed.

162
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,000
Wei Lan, look.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,280
I think they're fine.

164
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,220
What do you think?

165
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,220
His grades are average.

166
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,700
His handwriting is decent.

167
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,060
Always focusing on superficial things.

168
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,520
That's our effort

169
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,900
to help you cover up the truth.

170
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,660
Just you? Or both of you?

171
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,400
Both of us.

172
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,180
You're lying through your teeth.

173
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,140
You dare care about other girls?

174
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,560
If Xiaojing finds out,

175
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,400
you're

176
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,640
done for.

177
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,340
Don't say it out loud.

178
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,010
What's up with Chen Weilan?

179
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,380
No idea.

180
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,800
Let's wait and see.

181
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,420
Don't get caught in the crossfire.

182
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,220
What's wrong?

183
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,140
Can't spike anymore?

184
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,080
Looks like my words

185
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,500
got to you.

186
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,640
Why would your words

187
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,900
affect me?

188
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,460
I'm concerned

189
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,740
about Coach Lu.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,100
Coach Lu?

191
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,300
So,

192
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,000
you recognize

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,140
Coach Lu?

194
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,620
Why? You don't?

195
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,500
He's just a National Youth Team coach.

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,260
You know

197
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,780
his level.

198
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,500
I don't care about his level.

199
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,820
I care about beach volleyball.

200
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,600
Don't you

201
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,780
care about his level?

202
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
Or do you just

203
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,140
care about where he's from?

204
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,060
Why couldn't you join

205
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
the National Youth Team?

206
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,660
Lack of skill?

207
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,980
I wasn't selected

208
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,180
because I didn't want to go.

209
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,240
That can't be.

210
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,400
Lang Yueting was selected.

211
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,220
Why wouldn't you want to go?

212
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,780
Is it because you weren't good enough?

213
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,380
Not everyone is like you,

214
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,680
failing to get into the Team

215
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,060
due to a lack of skill.

216
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,540
But everyone knows

217
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,920
I didn't get into the Team

218
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,740
and the Sports University.

219
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,680
You keep it to yourself.

220
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,900
No one can mention it.

221
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,180
Are you afraid of being laughed at?

222
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,820
During the last Team selection,

223
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,620
I was determined to get in.

224
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,300
But somehow, I wasn't chosen.

225
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,860
Regardless, neither of us

226
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,640
made it to the National Youth Team.

227
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,380
What gives you the right to lecture me?

228
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,220
I don't have the right to lecture you.

229
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,580
But

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,100
this must be important to you.

231
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,420
Otherwise, why can't you let it go

232
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,780
after all this time?

233
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,040
I have let it go.

234
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,260
What would I hold on to?

235
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,260
Didn't you say

236
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,260
beach volleyball matters most to you?

237
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,060
With your current attitude,

238
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,140
have you really let it go?

239
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,360
Why?

240
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,740
What's so amusing?

241
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,100
Because you brought me to school.

242
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,700
Darling.

243
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,920
You got tanned.

244
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,380
No, you got tanned.

245
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,380
I'm not tanned at all.

246
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,140
Girls shouldn't play beach volleyball, okay?

247
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,080
I can't help it.

248
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,840
I'm graduating and need the credits.

249
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,140
Beach volleyball is my only option.

250
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,560
But getting tanned isn't attractive.

251
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,500
That's too bad.

252
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,740
Are you saying I'm unattractive?

253
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,160
Of course not.

254
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,440
You always look good.

255
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,080
That's better.

256
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,000
Alright.

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,840
I'm off.

258
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,160
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

259
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,500
Answer my call, okay?

260
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,120
Miss me.

261
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,140
Sure, bye.

262
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,800
- That's it for today.
- Take a break.

263
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,900
Everyone, rest up.

264
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,080
Rest.

265
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,220
Stretch.

266
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,080
Xixi.

267
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,820
What's wrong? You look down.

268
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,120
Xiaojing,

269
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,440
I don't want to train.

270
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,560
The sun is too harsh.

271
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,880
I'm getting tanned,

272
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,200
and it's ugly.

273
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,540
What's ugly?

274
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,960
No, no.

275
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,040
It looks healthy.

276
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,400
Not ugly. So pretty.

277
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,320
Right.

278
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,160
But I'm much darker than you all.

279
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,080
No way.

280
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,040
Let's compare.

281
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,160
We're the same.

282
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,080
No, we're not.

283
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,920
I don't think she's tanned much.

284
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,720
You look great. Believe me.

285
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,080
Your muscles are nice.

286
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,400
Looks great.

287
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,580
- I believe you.
- I'm the one who's tanned.

288
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,080
Duoduo.

289
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,960
Why are you training alone?

290
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,800
Where's your coach?

291
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,040
We're self-disciplined.

292
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,380
We don't need supervision.

293
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,660
Just checking.

294
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,880
We're serious

295
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,060
about the Seven-School League.

296
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,140
How did this turn into a chat?

297
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,720
No idea.

298
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,740
Our coach said

299
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
we'd train

300
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,620
at Yuzhou Island.

301
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,460
What about you?

302
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,940
We should have plans.

303
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,260
We take the league seriously too.

304
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,420
Still chatting?

305
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,520
Hurry up.

306
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,360
Coming.

307
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,720
Good luck.

308
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,240
Stretch.

309
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,300
- Hurry.
- That leg.

310
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,580
Stop playing.

311
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,640
You can't be good at it anyway.

312
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,720
I have to play.

313
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,160
Your beach volleyball

314
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,500
has aged me ten years.

315
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,940
You weren't young to start with.

316
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,580
Look at this.

317
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,380
Gao made these notes.

318
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,740
They should be helpful.

319
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,060
Take a look.

320
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,140
What's this?

321
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,540
Coach Lu,

322
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,880
I heard Coach Tian is taking the team

323
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,360
to Yuzhou Island for training

324
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,680
to prepare for the league.

325
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Are there any training plans

326
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,660
for us?

327
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,640
Coach Tian?

328
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,720
Yuzhou Island?

329
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,980
- Yes.
- Duoduo.

330
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,880
Our budget is limited.

331
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,140
We can't go to Yuzhou Island.

332
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,820
(Dafu BBQ)

333
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,280
Hello, your kebabs.

334
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,120
Thank you.

335
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Waiter, I'd like to order.

336
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,440
Sure.

337
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,720
One lamb skewer.

338
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,620
Lamb skewer.

339
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,080
- Can you handle spicy?
- Yes.

340
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,100
Extra spicy.

341
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,400
What are you thinking about?

342
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,720
The Seven-School League is starting soon.

343
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,240
- Two beers, please.
- One more serving.

344
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,420
Sure, coming right up.

345
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,880
One more lamb chop.

346
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
Lamb chop.

347
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,760
Spicy too, right?

348
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,620
Yes, same.

349
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,160
Alright, that should be enough.

350
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,560
Alright, coming right up.

351
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,000
I'll leave the menu with you.

352
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,940
Okay.

353
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,820
Two beers, please.

354
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,880
Sure.

355
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,160
Thank you.

356
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,620
Wait. I'll open them for you.

357
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,860
Your beers.

358
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,600
What were you thinking about?

359
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,780
So engrossed?

360
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,400
I...

361
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,100
Thinking about beach volleyball.

362
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,240
Beach volleyball?

363
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,100
Yeah.

364
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,140
We only focus on physical training.

365
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,340
I'm not saying it's bad,

366
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
but training

367
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,080
on an island

368
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,500
sounds enviable.

369
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,980
You want to go to the island, huh?

370
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,640
Here, this is for Table Two.

371
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,740
- This one.
- Got it.

372
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,180
(I'll handle the funding issue.
Let's train at Yuzhou Island.)

373
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,020
Everyone's here.

374
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,440
- Coach.
- Coach.

375
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,800
What's up, Coach?

376
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,780
You look so happy.

377
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,900
It's probably not good news.

378
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,980
I've got an announcement.

379
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,440
I applied for some funding from the school.

380
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,160
Starting tomorrow, we can go to Yuzhou Island

381
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,120
for a week of special training.

382
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,370
- Special training?
- Really?

383
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,980
- Really?
- It's true.

384
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,800
You're amazing, Coach.

385
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,900
Long live the coach!

386
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,820
Long live the coach!

387
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,100
Long live the coach!

388
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,980
Gao.

389
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,320
Thanks, buddy.

390
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,900
I should be thanking you for the notes.

391
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,880
But I was thoughtless

392
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,760
about the coach this time.

393
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,620
If I had known more about him,

394
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,020
I wouldn't have made such a big mistake.

395
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,980
You meant well,

396
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,860
but it was

397
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,060
a bit careless.

398
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,240
Buddy,

399
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,620
finding a coach

400
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,500
isn't just about their level.

401
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,700
They need to be a good fit for us.

402
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,380
You're right.

403
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,040
It's just

404
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,780
that I found a fake one.

405
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,080
If I had found a coach

406
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,100
who led the National Youth Team,

407
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,740
he'd definitely be great for us.

408
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,300
A National Youth Team coach is great.

409
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,160
Otherwise, how could Chen Weilan

410
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,340
and I have not been selected?

411
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,600
We're going to the island tomorrow.

412
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,060
We need to prepare some things.

413
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,760
I've made a checklist. Take a look.

414
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,500
Great. Let's see.

415
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,760
Come on.

416
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,480
The first part looks reasonable,

417
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,620
but what's this at the end?

418
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,740
Mosquito repellent for Gao Ge.

419
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,740
Hot sauce for Gao Ge.

420
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,960
Are you buying things

421
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,060
for Gao Ge or for me?

422
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,960
This is Shao Nian's list. I got it wrong.

423
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,380
Ours is over here.

424
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,950
Shao Nian's?

425
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,960
He's so attentive to Gao Ge, huh?

426
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,800
Well.

427
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,900
Gao Ge is pretty attentive to Shao Nian too.

428
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,480
Remember the notes?

429
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,040
(My attitude towards Shao Nian earlier...)

430
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,480
Because Shao Nian likes Duoduo,

431
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,780
so Gao Ge is doing this.

432
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,740
So,

433
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,180
you're like a sour fish, huh?

434
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,600
Sour fish?

435
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,300
Sour, lame, and unnecessary.

436
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,740
Then you must be my chocolate.

437
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,780
Sweet, cute, and beautiful.

438
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,520
Look at Shao Nian.

439
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,920
He's buying so many things for Gao Ge.

440
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,200
Am I not your chocolate?

441
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,640
What about me?

442
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,120
Didn't I prepare too?

443
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,320
I'll act right now.

444
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,780
What action? What is it?

445
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,300
Let's go shopping.

446
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,900
I want to buy chips.

447
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,800
- The one you mentioned last time...
- Hurry up.

448
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,040
- The weather's great today.
- Yes.

449
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,880
Why are you so late?

450
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,120
Let me explain it again.

451
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,680
We're going to Yuzhou Island today.

452
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,300
The school approved limited funds

453
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,900
for this trip,

454
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,240
so let's

455
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
give it our all

456
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,600
and perform well, okay?

457
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,480
- No problem.
- Sure.

458
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,600
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

459
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,460
- Go.
- Go.

460
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,020
Let's go.

461
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,000
What a coincidence to meet you here.

462
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,840
Out for a run?

463
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,820
Mind your own business.

464
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,360
It's basic courtesy for the loser

465
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,640
to step aside for the winner, isn't it?

466
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,560
Loser?

467
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,720
Who's the loser?

468
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,280
We didn't finish our match last time.

469
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,960
I'm sure Chen Weilan and I could beat you.

470
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,240
Even if we finished, you wouldn't have won.

471
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
Why not play a match now?

472
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,460
Not possible.

473
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,800
Our coach said

474
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,880
we shouldn't play

475
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,620
against nobodies.

476
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,880
You're just afraid

477
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,900
of losing to us.

478
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,240
What a joke!

479
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,280
Afraid of you?

480
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,380
Beach volleyball is about skills.

481
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,420
Then let's have a real match now.

482
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,080
If you're not playing, step aside.

483
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,540
I'm just curious

484
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,280
why you're here.

485
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,640
Did you see us

486
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,800
and follow us?

487
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,000
We're here to train.

488
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,060
Nothing to do with you.

489
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,060
I'm not here to argue with you.

490
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,920
You...

491
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,500
Coach Lu,

492
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,240
since you suggested we get here,

493
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,580
you must have a training plan, right?

494
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,360
Yes.

495
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,820
It's all written down.

496
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,140
Name: Tian Qing.

497
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,620
Age: 27.

498
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,900
Zodiac Sign: Leo.

499
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,940
Looks aloof on the outside.

500
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,300
Is this your plan?

501
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,940
This is Plan B.

502
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,520
This

503
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,020
is just a side note.

504
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,500
It's okay. Don't worry.

505
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,340
I won't misuse my position.

506
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,860
This training

507
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,400
is crucial

508
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,640
for everyone.

509
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,020
I will give it my all.

510
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,380
Give it your all?

511
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,760
Yes.

512
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,740
We're here for training.

513
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,040
This perfume

514
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,380
has nothing to do with the training.

515
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,720
I just bought it and only used it once.

516
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
If you don't mind,

517
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
I can give it to you.

518
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,560
Thank you.

519
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,520
What about this?

520
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,320
Right.

521
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,940
This bow tie has

522
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,740
nothing to do with the training either.

523
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,900
I must have made a mistake.

524
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,500
A mistake, huh?

525
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,340
(Hair)
What about this?

526
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,180
This hair gel, right there.

527
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,760
Well.

528
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Please leave this.

529
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,340
It's windy here.

530
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,760
No problem.

531
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,360
Take anything

532
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,660
you don't like. I admit it.

533
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,080
I made mistakes

534
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,280
in planning,

535
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,140
but I swear

536
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,300
I'll give my all in training.

537
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,760
Really.

538
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,160
Coach Lu.

539
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,200
I hope you mean it.

540
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,620
If your negligence

541
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,220
affects our training

542
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,740
or exposes yourself,

543
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,200
there will be

544
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,940
consequences.

545
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm not allowed to date, huh?

546
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,940
What about you?

547
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,200
It's just training.

548
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,380
Anyone can do it.

549
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,880
Daxing.

550
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,600
Where are you?

551
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Lu Xiaole!

552
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,620
Keep your voice down.

553
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,080
You know my situation.

554
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,920
I'm just hiding.

555
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,860
Great, you get to hide,

556
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,280
and I'm stuck

557
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,020
at the door every day.

558
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,000
Daxing, calm down. Have some water.

559
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,980
I don't want any.

560
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,580
Once I get the money and transfer it,

561
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,100
I'll head back.

562
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,420
Just hold on a bit.

563
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,160
Fine. Do what you want.

564
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,260
Go wherever you want.

565
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,780
Is there anything else? If not, I'm hanging up.

566
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,820
No, wait. There's something.

567
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,540
Let me ask you.

568
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,760
Well.

569
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,520
Any tips for someone switching

570
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,220
from indoor volleyball to beach volleyball?

571
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,540
Tell me.

572
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,380
Lu Xiaole.

573
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,100
Aren't you not interested in beach volleyball?

574
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,080
What's up? Changed your mind?

575
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,660
Yeah, yeah, I've changed.

576
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,800
Listen then.

577
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,060
Wait, wait.

578
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,380
Let me take notes.

579
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,700
Go on.

580
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,100
Besides the number of players,

581
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,620
beach volleyball

582
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,580
and indoor volleyball

583
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,740
mainly differ in the court.

584
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,000
When we train in the winter,

585
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,620
we usually go to Hainan.

586
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,940
The first phase

587
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,240
focuses on recovery training

588
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,860
and solidifying basic skills.

589
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,260
The second phase

590
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,760
is about building physical fitness,

591
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,420
enhancing the athletes' physical condition.

592
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,180
The third phase involves national training,

593
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,620
compete against other teams

594
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,360
to improve skills

595
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,060
and tactics.

596
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,920
That's it?

597
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,320
Lu Xiaole.

598
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,280
Why are you suddenly interested in this?

599
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,780
- What are you doing?
- Where are you?

600
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,320
Lu Xiaole!

601
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,060
I can't hear you!

602
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,060
Come on.

603
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,570
Here!

604
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,620
I barely slept last night.

605
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,720
Coach Tian.

606
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,180
Coach Tian, hello.

607
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,420
I'm Lu Daxing,

608
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,160
from the National Youth Team,

609
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,220
temporarily coaching at Xingang.

610
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,320
We've met.

611
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,800
Yes, we have.

612
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,260
Didn't expect you to remember me.

613
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,200
What a coincidence meeting you here.

614
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,160
Coach Lu,

615
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,620
your training area is over there.

616
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,220
You're from the National Youth Team,

617
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,620
so what's your plan for the time?

618
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,740
Our training area is over there.

619
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,400
How about this?

620
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,240
Since we're all here,

621
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,720
why don't we combine our teams

622
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,920
and share training insights

623
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,540
and match states?

624
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,160
Coach Lu,

625
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,580
with the league coming up,

626
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,880
I don't think it's appropriate

627
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,120
for our teams to train together.

628
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,420
Let's train separately.

629
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,540
You're right.

630
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,840
How about this?

631
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,200
We won't use our training area.

632
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,050
You can use it.

633
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,280
We're mainly here

634
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,620
for physical training.

635
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,860
Coach,

636
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,040
are we just here

637
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,060
for physical training?

638
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,320
Yes.

639
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,840
But we're at Yuzhou Island,

640
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,960
not at school.

641
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,940
- I...
- Can you do it?

642
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,520
I'm the coach. Listen to me.

643
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,420
No problem.

644
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
Let's go for physical training.

645
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,880
See you later.

646
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
- See you later.
- See you later.

647
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,120
- Let's go.
- Let's go check it out.

648
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,080
Shao Nian,

649
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,120
why is this coach you found

650
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,060
only focusing on physical training?

651
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,000
- Is this reliable?
- Duoduo.

652
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,160
Why don't you

653
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,320
and Shao Nian join us?

654
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,700
Coach Tian wouldn't mind.

655
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,080
Let's go.

656
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,160
Why is a coach

657
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,120
from the National Youth Team

658
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,360
coming here

659
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,880
to physical training?

660
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,180
It's strange.

661
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,220
I think this Coach Lu isn't simple.

662
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,900
He's not using the training area.

663
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,020
No idea what he is up to.

664
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,520
Maybe he's trying

665
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,160
to impress you.

666
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,820
Still in the mood for jokes?

667
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,300
Get back to training.

668
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,950
Long Ya, put more effort in!

669
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,420
What was that hit just now?

670
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,300
Got it.

671
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,760
We're losing time.

672
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,060
I'm heartbroken.

673
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,340
Don't be. Keep going.

674
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,080
Come on. Keep going.

675
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,420
Come on, keep up.

676
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,140
Why is it always physical training?

677
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,180
There's no tactical arrangement.

678
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,760
And he gave our training area

679
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,940
to someone else.

680
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,020
What is he up to?

681
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,380
Maybe it's part of his strategy.

682
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,980
Who knows?

683
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,020
Chen Weilan.

684
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,400
I'm still practicing.

685
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,660
I need to talk to you. Come here.

686
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,400
Let me ask you.

687
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,560
You used to play

688
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,840
indoor volleyball, right?

689
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,680
Yes.

690
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,920
Coach,

691
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,120
she's a volleyball prodigy.

692
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,000
So famous.

693
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,160
You don't know her?

694
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,600
Of course, I know her.

695
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,540
But her problem is serious now.

696
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,000
She hasn't

697
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,300
fully adapted to the sand,

698
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,160
so her indoor volleyball advantages

699
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,420
aren't showing.

700
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,840
You're too tall,

701
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,780
you know?

702
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,880
It's hard to keep your balance on the sand.

703
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,220
It's a big disadvantage.

704
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,260
What should I do?

705
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,660
Stop looking. Keep going!

706
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,540
- Keep going.
- Okay.

707
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,620
Coach.

708
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,580
What now?

709
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,700
Into the sea.

710
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,040
Have you heard

711
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,140
of water balance training?

712
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,400
Get in.

713
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,700
Slowly.

714
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,780
Walk forward.

715
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,060
Keep going forward.

716
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,120
Stop.

717
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,060
Right there.

718
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,300
Be careful.

719
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,460
Feet shoulder-width apart.

720
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,220
Extend your arms.

721
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,700
Squat down, exposing only your head.

722
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,460
Try to keep your balance.

723
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,860
Go slowly.

724
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,500
Be careful.

725
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,700
Can't stand up straight, huh?

726
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,940
Try again.

727
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,220
- It's too dangerous.
- Be careful.

728
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,540
Try it again.

729
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,080
What do you think of Coach Lu?

730
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,300
Is he really professional?

731
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,680
He can't see Chen Weilan's problem

732
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,800
and is talking

733
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,580
about water balance training.

734
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,260
I do have some trouble

735
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,740
adapting to the sand.

736
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,620
Water balance training?

737
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,300
- Morning, Coach.
- Morning.

738
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,940
Drinking soda again?

739
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,960
You should drink less soda.

740
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,000
Don't end up with a stomachache

741
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,020
during training.

742
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,820
Take care of your health.

743
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,800
Got it?

744
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,060
I think

745
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,020
whether it works depends on the results.

746
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,060
Coach Tian.

747
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,160
Coach Lu, can I help you?

748
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,100
Well.

749
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,000
I noticed your training methods

750
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,220
are quite unique.

751
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,180
It seems fine.

752
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,780
My team members say

753
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,320
Coach Tian is very skilled,

754
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,620
so I wanted to ask for some advice.

755
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,180
How about we exchange contact info?

756
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,360
- Sure.
- This is good for discussion.

757
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,080
Yes, we can share insights.

758
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,600
- Coaching insights.
- Yeah. I'll scan your code.

759
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,440
Here.

760
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,460
Okay.

761
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,120
We can also arrange a meal together.

762
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,980
Right?

763
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,080
Coach Lu,

764
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,420
you forgot we're competitors?

765
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,160
I haven't forgotten.

766
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,510
Well.

767
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,630
Friendship comes before competition.

768
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,470
Right?

769
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,330
How about this?

770
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,920
After the training,

771
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,360
let's have a friendly match.

772
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,960
We can learn from each other

773
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,280
and remember our time together

774
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,880
on the island.

775
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,000
Sounds good.

776
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,920
We should have

777
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,860
a friendly match.

778
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,280
Whoever loses treats?

779
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,880
Sure, I'm fine with that.

780
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,720
Alright.

781
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,560
Coach Tian,

782
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,540
remember

783
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,100
to call me.

784
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,280
Everyone,

785
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,540
to visualize our training results

786
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,160
and motivate everyone

787
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,100
to focus on training,

788
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,920
Coach Tian and I have decided

789
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,460
to have a friendly match

790
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,260
after our training.

791
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,600
Yan Xiaojing, Mo Xixi,

792
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,580
prepare for it.

793
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,460
Coach, I have a suggestion.

794
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,620
Could Chen Weilan and I play?

795
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,880
But Xixi and I are the players

796
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,240
for the league.

797
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,280
We're the only pair representing Xingang.

798
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,260
What's the point of you playing?

799
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,080
Xiaojing, don't worry.

800
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,200
I mean

801
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,120
this way, we can keep

802
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,620
our true strength hidden.

803
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,780
- Right?
- Makes sense.

804
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,560
Continue.

805
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,400
Look.

806
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,240
If Chen Weilan and I do it,

807
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,760
we can see what they're capable of

808
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,320
and hide our strength.

809
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,580
Isn't that a win-win?

810
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,880
Alright, Coach.

811
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,100
I think it makes sense.

812
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,880
We'll discuss it later.

813
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,200
Everyone, focus on training.

814
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,640
Today we have two drills.

815
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,840
Shuttle runs

816
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,240
and box jumps.

817
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,180
Split into teams and train.

818
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,720
Let's go.

819
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,040
You just want

820
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,200
to use this opportunity

821
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,540
to compare with Tu Lingling.

822
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,600
You know everything.

823
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,900
Are you afraid of losing?

824
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,220
Of course not.

825
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,140
Duoduo.

826
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,680
Are you okay?

827
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,560
- I'm fine.
- Are you alright?

828
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,400
Did you hurt yourself?

829
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,620
I'm fine.

830
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,600
- I'm okay.
- Duoduo.

831
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,530
Thank you.

832
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,980
- Continue training.
- Okay. Continue.

833
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,920
Tu Lingling!

834
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,340
What are you thinking?

835
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,140
Your performance is so poor.

836
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,920
At this rate,

837
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,180
we might as well forfeit

838
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,620
the friendly match.

839
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,680
Sorry, Coach Tian.

840
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,860
I'll train hard.

841
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,300
Don't make excuses.

842
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,100
After training,

843
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,580
150 forward jumps.

844
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,600
It's already nap time.

845
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,900
Why are you still training?

846
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,480
Of course.

847
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,800
As the captain,

848
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,880
I not only need to complete

849
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,060
the training tasks

850
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,160
but also

851
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,680
defeat Tu Lingling.

852
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,920
She's too arrogant.

853
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,820
Tu Lingling?

854
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,920
Yes.

855
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,660
Why are you here alone?

856
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,480
It's obvious.

857
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,700
She must have been punished.

858
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,940
Are you okay?

859
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,920
You're bleeding. Don't move.

860
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,900
Don't get infected.

861
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,860
Here.

862
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,620
Don't move.

863
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,280
Does it hurt?

864
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,420
Help her bandage it up.

865
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,660
Bear with it.

866
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,580
Why did your coach punish you?

867
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,220
It's because of you guys.

868
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,060
Let me do it.

869
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,720
Is it okay?

870
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,000
Here.

871
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,240
Let me help you.

872
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,080
Here.

873
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,600
No need.

874
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,520
If Coach Tian sees it,

875
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,360
she'll punish me again.

876
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,200
How's your leg?

877
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,340
Much better.

878
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,600
Lu Daxing is acting strangely.

879
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,720
What he's doing now

880
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,200
doesn't match his position

881
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,180
as a National Youth Team coach.

882
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,420
Could it be a trick?

883
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,980
Very likely.

884
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,020
What should we do next?

885
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,740
If he wants to test us,

886
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,340
I'll give him a chance.

887
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,660
Go back and ice your leg.

888
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,580
Rest for 15 minutes.

889
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,400
You scared me.

890
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,360
Why did you hit me?

891
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,400
I came to bring you a drink.

892
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,500
Please be fair.

893
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,180
Thanks.

894
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,120
Shao Nian.

895
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,080
Duoduo.

896
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,140
How's your leg?

897
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Much better.

898
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,640
Thanks.

899
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,420
Duoduo.

900
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,140
Sorry about yesterday.

901
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,880
It's okay.

902
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,720
Coach Tian said

903
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,760
that everyone has worked hard

904
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,080
training on the island these days.

905
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,160
She's planning

906
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,640
a bonfire party tonight

907
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,260
and invited you guys to join.

908
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,280
It's your bonfire party.

909
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,760
We're from Xingang University.

910
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,700
Is it appropriate?

911
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,540
What's inappropriate about it?

912
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,240
We're opponents on the court

913
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,200
but friends off the court.

914
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,040
Right?

915
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,160
Shao Nian?

916
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,040
Isn't that right?

917
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,260
Yes, yes.

918
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
I think

919
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,020
she's absolutely right.

920
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,720
Since we're training

921
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,280
on the same island,

922
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,620
it's fate.

923
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,600
Well.

924
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,280
Tell Coach Tian

925
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,380
we'll be there on time.

926
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,020
That's great.

927
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,020
See you tonight.

928
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,520
Come on. Back to training.

929
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,900
Hurry up. Move.

930
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,960
Here.

931
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,040
Put some on each table.

932
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,880
Alright.

933
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,380
- There's good food.
- Long Ya.

934
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,760
Stealing food again.

935
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,700
You've eaten it all.

936
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,640
Coach.

937
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,160
They're here.

938
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,180
Put some on each table.

939
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,400
Coach Lu.

940
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,880
Coach Tian.

941
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,880
Welcome.

942
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,800
Thank you, Coach Tian.

943
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,260
We didn't know what you liked,

944
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,140
so Lingling just prepared some food.

945
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,720
Sit down.

946
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,240
Lingling, show them to their seats.

947
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,120
Alright. Shao Nian, you sit here.

948
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,340
Coach Lu, this way, please.

949
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,920
- Alright, let's go.
- Everyone, take a seat.

950
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,850
- This way, please.
- Alright.

951
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,280
You sit first. I'll get some food for you.

952
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,400
What do you like, Coach Lu?

953
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,240
I'll get it for you.

954
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,780
I like to drink.

955
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,200
Lingling, bring two cans of beer.

956
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,800
