=Episode 36=

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,240
Let me.

19
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,060
(Go, Li Guoduo)

20
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,160
(Xingang vs Medical)
They're good at defense and long rallies.

21
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,000
If you can't win the first two sets,

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,980
the third set will be very difficult.

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,960
So, you must score as much as possible

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,470
before the Medical University

25
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,240
figures out your habits.

26
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,540
Duoduo, you're my pride.

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,460
- Nice.
- Nice.

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,220
Long Ya, look.

29
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,220
Li Guoduo is different from before.

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,220
What's different?

31
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,800
Her offense

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,120
used to be weak.

33
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,460
Now she can play to her strengths.

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,420
It seems that it will be quite challenging

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,100
for the Medical Uni to win.

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,040
Good.

37
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,400
Go for it. Go for it.

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,780
Go, Xingang!

39
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,520
Go for it. Go for it.

40
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,020
Li Guoduo has really improved.

41
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,740
Xingang! Xingang!

42
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,140
It only means the opponents are too weak.

43
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,040
Xingang! Xingang! Xingang!

44
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,180
I advise you not to be overconfident.

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,000
What right do you have to speak?

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,060
Pray that you don't lose to me.

47
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,740
- You...
- No more watching?

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,120
No need.

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,800
They can't beat me anyway.

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,240
What are you so proud of?

51
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,200
- Aren't you...
- Bye.

52
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,060
- Don't be angry.
- Xingang University won.

53
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,350
- A good start.
- Don't bother.

54
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,600
Xingang Uni won the first match

55
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,450
of the national league

56
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,240
with an overwhelming victory.

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,400
We hope they can maintain this performance

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,020
in the upcoming matches.

59
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,580
Lang Yueting's strength

60
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,380
is indeed a level higher than Tu Lingling's.

61
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,700
She won so easily.

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,080
She used a powerful jump serve at the end.

63
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,780
She didn't take the rival seriously.

64
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
I think

65
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,140
if you beat Tu Lingling,

66
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,580
Lang Yueting won't underestimate you.

67
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,120
You two are the best.

68
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,520
You must be confident.

69
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,360
The priority is

70
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,280
to win the match against Tu Lingling.

71
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,820
We'll talk about other matches later.

72
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,860
I noticed Tu Lingling likes to serve
with those high balls.

73
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,520
So, when you receive the ball,

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,120
don't stand too close to the net.

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,960
Also, pay attention

76
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,640
to the wind speed

77
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,740
and direction on site when deciding

78
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,640
whether to jump and serve.

79
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,240
Long Ya's offensive characteristic

80
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,760
is that she likes to tap the ball.

81
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,860
She rarely spikes.

82
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,200
Weilan,

83
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,060
make sure to move back

84
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,080
and focus on defense.

85
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,260
Don't always move forward.

86
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,440
OK.

87
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,920
If Long Ya

88
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,340
serves tomorrow,

89
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,280
I'll defend the straight line.

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,140
You focus on the cross-court shots, okay?

91
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,620
And pay attention to Tu Lingling too.

92
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Let's review it more

93
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,400
and then analyze it.

94
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,840
Dinner is ready.

95
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,480
Come on. Time to eat.

96
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,320
Time to eat.

97
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,200
- Come on.
- Thanks.

98
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,100
You must be starving.

99
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,400
Come on.

100
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,680
Here you go.

101
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
Thanks, Auntie.

102
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,780
What's this?

103
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,660
Powerful jump and spike!

104
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,240
Oh, my God.

105
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,540
How impressive.

106
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,700
Lang Yueting's move is flawless.

107
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,500
The power is so fierce.

108
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,740
Most athletes can't handle this.

109
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,710
Here, Duo.

110
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,400
Coach, how can you say that?

111
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,220
We're not ordinary athletes.

112
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,920
Mom, what's for dinner today?

113
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,500
- I brought it over.
- Before the match,

114
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,740
don't say discouraging things.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,180
Don't boost others' morale
while weakening your own.

116
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,640
What is it?

117
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,820
Dafu is right.

118
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
You all enjoy.

119
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
Good luck.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,140
I have to go. See you later.

121
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,780
- I'll try a bit of yours.
- How is it?

122
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,420
(I've played many games with Tu Lingling.)

123
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,020
(We were teammates back then.)

124
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,500
(But after becoming rivals,)

125
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,040
(it seems we both play with hostility.)

126
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,680
(We've never enjoyed the game.)

127
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
(But in today's national league,)

128
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
(I'll play with a calm mind.)

129
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,260
(It's to respect)

130
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,800
(the rival and the game.)

131
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Welcome, everyone,

132
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,560
to the China University

133
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,740
Beach Volleyball Association.

134
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,080
(Youth is like fire; Surpass)

135
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,060
- Weilan, go for it.
- Go for it.

136
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,680
Now, welcome Li Guoduo

137
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,140
and Chen Weilan from Xingang University,

138
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,660
and Tu Lingling and Long Ya
from Ocean University.

139
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,220
Go for it. Go for it.

140
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,990
- Go for it.
- Go for it.

141
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,430
Go for it.

142
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,400
Go for it. Go for it. Go for it.

143
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,660
Go for it. Go for it.

144
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,580
Nice! Ocean University scores!

145
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,450
- This is Ocean Uni's
- Go for it.

146
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,060
(Xingang vs Ocean)
second match in this league.

147
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,040
They have to win

148
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,000
to advance

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,140
to the next round.

150
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,680
But Xingang University

151
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,600
hasn't lost once

152
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,620
in this round.

153
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,960
If they win this time,

154
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,780
they'll be a dark horse for the championship.

155
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,120
I'll get it.

156
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,000
Come on.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,110
Go! Go, Xingang!

158
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,240
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

159
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,220
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

160
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,940
Beautiful reception.

161
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,240
- Good.
- But out of bounds.

162
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,800
Xingang University ties the score.

163
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,080
- Beautiful.
- The score is very close in this match.

164
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,880
It can be described as thrilling.

165
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,280
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

166
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,020
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

167
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,740
I'll get it.

168
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,660
- Good shot.
- Beautiful.

169
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,040
Go for it.

170
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,960
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

171
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,140
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

172
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,480
Well done.

173
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,180
Good.

174
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,580
Go, Ocean! Go, Ocean!

175
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
I'll get it.

176
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,720
Come on.

177
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,890
- Good shot.
- Good.

178
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,680
- Amazing. Go for it.
- Go for it.

179
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,500
Go for it. Go for it. Go, Ocean!

180
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,680
Good.

181
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,760
I'll get it.

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,840
Good shot.

183
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,940
Good.

184
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,320
I'll get it.

185
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,400
Pass.

186
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,420
- Good shot.
- That was a beautiful shot.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,280
In the first set,

188
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,960
Xingang won.

189
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:41,300
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

190
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,640
Go, Xingang!

191
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Good job.

192
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,900
That spike was really good and cool.

193
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,120
They played really aggressively today.

194
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,700
Let's just perform normally today.

195
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,520
Drink some water.

196
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,380
Drink some water. Watch her hand.

197
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,980
She's completely different now.

198
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,980
She wasn't like this before.

199
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,020
So, you need to pay attention to her.

200
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,060
Watch her hand when she spikes.

201
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,400
Defend it well.

202
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,640
Watch for the cross-court shots.

203
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,340
They keep hitting cross-court today.

204
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,080
Let's stay steady.

205
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Being steady is enough.

206
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,200
She's completely different.

207
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,480
When are we not steady?

208
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,320
Go for it.

209
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,420
We need to stay steady.

210
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,620
(Xingang vs Ocean,
Score, Possession, Set Score)

211
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,880
In the second match,

212
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,000
Ocean University made adjustments.

213
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,920
It can be seen

214
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,760
- Ocean Uni has better skills
- Go for it.

215
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,100
- and scores a point.
- Good.

216
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,200
Come on.

217
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,400
- Xingang Uni is not giving in.
- Good.

218
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,020
Chen Weilan scores with her strong spikes.

219
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,000
(Tu Lingling's team has a strong offense)

220
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,460
(with impressive overall strength.)

221
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,860
(But Duoduo and Weilan's teamwork is better,)

222
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,460
(controlling the pace.)

223
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,340
(They'll win.)

224
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,120
At this heated stage

225
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,960
of the match,

226
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,040
as long as Li Guoduo

227
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,920
and Chen Weilan from Xingang don't slack off

228
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,640
keep using powerful spikes,

229
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,080
- Go for it.
- they can win the match.

230
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,960
Go for it.

231
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,000
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

232
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,900
- Come on.
- Go, Xingang!

233
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,260
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

234
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,540
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

235
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,160
Go.

236
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,980
Go, Xingang!

237
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,380
Won. Very nice.

238
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,240
This is Xingang University's

239
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,400
best result

240
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,260
in the national league after eight years.

241
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,740
They won. They're the pride of Xingang.

242
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,160
We also heard the cheers from the audience.

243
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,120
Yes, Li Guoduo and Chen Weilan

244
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,360
deserve such cheers.

245
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,840
Warm congratulations to them,

246
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,120
and we hope they can achieve

247
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,400
even more

248
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,460
in the upcoming matches.

249
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,660
Xingang University! Xingang University!

250
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,220
Xingang University! Xingang University!

251
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,680
How is it?

252
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,700
(China League)
Was that misalignment cool today?

253
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,280
Don't get complacent.

254
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,220
Keep going.

255
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,640
You played well.

256
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,020
Of course.

257
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,580
Why do I see you lacking confidence?

258
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,040
This group stage

259
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,180
is no challenge for me.

260
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,120
I'm looking forward

261
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,380
to our next match.

262
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,940
Don't let me down.

263
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,800
Chen Weilan,

264
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,220
don't lose to me a third time.

265
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,100
Why are you so annoying?

266
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,560
Stop it.

267
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,120
Duoduo.

268
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,440
Get up.

269
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,160
What's wrong?

270
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,280
It hurts.

271
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,340
Let me see. Let me see.

272
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,500
How can she do this?

273
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,740
Lang Yueting, you wait.

274
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,620
It hurts. It hurts.

275
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,380
Take it slow. Don't rush.

276
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,040
This...

277
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,500
How can a volleyball cause such an injury?

278
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,200
Auntie,

279
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,540
Lang Yueting used dirty tricks.

280
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,830
Such a person

281
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,200
won't go far in beach volleyball.

282
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,040
No need to say this.

283
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,240
Can you still play?

284
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,080
Of course.

285
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,480
We've come this far.

286
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,640
We'll win the championship.

287
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,060
Why don't we just quit?

288
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,820
I know my injury.

289
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,020
My leg isn't broken anyway.

290
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,460
Believe me. I can win.

291
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,020
Duo, this...

292
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,480
Mom,

293
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,380
I want to be alone for a while.

294
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,200
Can you handle it?

295
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,160
Yes.

296
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,440
I...

297
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,500
It's okay, Auntie. She will be fine.

298
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,740
Why are you here?

299
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,760
Is this how you

300
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,420
look after yourself without me?

301
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,500
How can I not come?

302
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,100
Get injured again?

303
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,380
What should I do with my leg?

304
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,560
The finals are approaching,

305
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,220
and suddenly my knee gets injured.

306
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,500
What should I do?

307
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,280
I must win.

308
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,680
I must win the championship.

309
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,860
Calm down.

310
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,400
Don't cry.

311
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,520
Don't worry.

312
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm here.

313
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,280
Listen.

314
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,420
The bones are fine. Good.

315
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,680
That's good.

316
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,080
It scared me.

317
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,260
That's good? Don't underestimate this injury.

318
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,260
You have to jump constantly during the match,

319
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,140
especially when using powerful spikes.

320
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,180
Your knee will hurt a lot.

321
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,020
I'm not afraid of pain.

322
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,420
I can endure the worst pain.

323
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,780
I've made all the preparations.

324
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,180
What preparations?

325
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,720
To dedicate myself to beach volleyball.

326
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,820
To dedicate everything.

327
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Don't be so dramatic.

328
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,480
I'm here, right?

329
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,440
Tonight,

330
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,100
I'll apply medicine to you every two hours.

331
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,380
You'll be better tomorrow.

332
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,660
But for this injury

333
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,020
to fully recover, you'll need

334
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,700
to wait until the end of the league.

335
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,660
Can you endure it?

336
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,640
Of course.

337
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,700
Thanks, Shao Nian.

338
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,220
You're really nice.

339
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,220
You can do this.

340
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,940
Come on, put it down.

341
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,300
Be careful. Be careful.

342
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,440
Go! Go, Xingang!

343
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,400
Welcome, everyone,

344
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,480
to the finals of the China University

345
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,080
Beach Volleyball Association.

346
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,640
The tense and intense match

347
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,040
is now in full swing.

348
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,680
The two teams in this match

349
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,840
are both very strong.

350
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,920
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

351
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,840
After the intense semifinals,

352
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,040
the teams competing
for the championship this year are

353
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,390
Xingang University and Sports University.

354
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,280
Go for it.

355
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,700
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

356
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,000
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

357
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,180
- Go for it.
- Go for it.

358
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,490
Go for it.

359
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,120
Wearing pink jerseys are

360
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,860
Li Guoduo and Chen Weilan
from Xingang University.

361
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,800
Go for it.

362
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,200
Wearing black and white jerseys are

363
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,940
Lang Yueting and Yang Liyun
from Sports University.

364
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,480
(Back at the NYT selection,)

365
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,400
(my team won,)

366
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,320
(but the MVP was given to Lang Yueting.)

367
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,160
(I must beat her in this match.)

368
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,500
(It's a matter of pride.)

369
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,880
- Go for it.
- Go for it.

370
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,480
(Facing Chen Weilan's old rival,)

371
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,330
(winning)

372
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,220
(is to live up to our effort.)

373
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,600
(We must win.)

374
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,740
(I'll help my best friend earn some pride.)

375
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,280
Go for it.

376
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,740
(I saw it yesterday.)

377
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,740
(Your secret weapon)

378
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,860
(won't work on me.)

379
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,080
Come on.

380
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,040
Beautiful.

381
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,160
Xingang University scores beautifully.

382
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,160
- Defended Lang Yueting's spike.
- Good shot.

383
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,040
Xingang Uni's strength can't be underestimated.

384
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,760
From the last match,

385
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
(Xingang vs Sports)
they

386
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,600
are no longer the obscure team

387
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
it used to be.

388
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,440
Now, they are a new force

389
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,240
with the strength to challenge

390
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,380
for the championship.

391
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,680
Defending champion Lang Yueting

392
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,980
proves again with her strength

393
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,440
that Xingang University's excellent teamwork

394
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,100
can't stop her attacks.

395
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,200
Get up.

396
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,360
(Lang Yueting is a rare player)

397
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,740
(with both strength and skill.)

398
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,180
(Though Guoduo and Weilan have improved,)

399
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,020
(in the face of such a powerful player,)

400
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,020
(it'll be very challenging.)

401
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,780
(Persistent struggle; Surpassing limits)

402
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,120
Duo!

403
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,800
- Good.
- Beautiful.

404
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,320
- Weilan, you're amazing.
- Nice.

405
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,620
Really beautiful.

406
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,820
Beautiful. Good play.

407
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,580
(Xingang University vs Sports University)

408
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,180
Go.

409
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,800
- Beautiful.
- Xingang University's performance

410
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,520
is truly surprising.

411
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,680
- Li Guoduo, despite her leg injury,
- Good.

412
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,340
still played with a significant advantage.

413
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,760
- They might be the strongest
- Duoduo is doing well.

414
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,040
opponent that Sports University

415
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,960
has encountered in the competition.

416
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,600
Go, Xingang!

417
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,480
Is your leg okay?

418
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,060
Go, Xingang!

419
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,480
Xingang University

420
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,780
won the first set.

421
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,020
Go, Xingang!

422
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,220
Go, Xingang!

423
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,440
- Is it okay?
- It's okay.

424
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,080
Go, Xingang!

425
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,320
That was poorly positioned.

426
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,180
Later, try harder.

427
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,080
Just defend well.

428
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
- OK.
- Go, Xingang!

429
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,580
Li Guoduo's right leg is injured.

430
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,240
We need to take advantage of this.

431
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,320
Attack her right side.

432
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,160
Understood.

433
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,300
(Xingang University vs Sports University
Score, Possession, Set Score)

434
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,120
Sports University scored ten points in a row

435
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,040
and won the second set.

436
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,760
This match is very intense.

437
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,660
Li Guoduo's leg condition is poor.

438
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,520
Relying solely on Chen Weilan

439
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,980
might not be enough
to withstand Lang Yueting's attacks.

440
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,370
- It's okay.
- Who will win?

441
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,940
- Don't worry. I'm fine.
- Let me see.

442
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,340
- I'm fine.
- Let me see.

443
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,700
You can't play anymore.

444
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,660
- I...
- Let's give up.

445
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,080
No way. We must win this match.

446
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,380
My leg isn't broken.

447
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,600
What if your injury gets worse?

448
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,960
Don't worry. We must win.

449
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,040
I've made the decision.

450
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,120
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

451
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,980
We must win.

452
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:17,340
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

453
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,860
(In actual combat,)

454
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,600
(Lang Yueting's strength is shown.)

455
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,540
- (It's true.)
- Go!

456
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,620
(Our attacks are being countered by them.)

457
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,260
(In less than a year,)

458
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,500
(we all came from volleyball.)

459
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,960
(But Lang doesn't seem)

460
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,240
- (like a novice.)
- Beautiful.

461
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,060
(Rather, she's as skilled as a veteran.)

462
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,420
(Xingang University vs Sports University
Score, Possession, Set Score)

463
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,220
The referee signals both sides to switch sides.

464
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,600
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

465
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,000
(Show yourself)
Now both teams are ready.

466
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,320
The match is about to begin.

467
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,440
(Go, Li Guoduo)
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

468
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,540
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

469
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,020
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

470
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:30,700
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

471
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:39,340
Go, Xingang! Go, Xingang!

472
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,340
Go, Xingang!

473
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,180
- Go for it.
- Go for it.

474
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,280
Awesome.

475
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,080
Duoduo!

476
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,040
Seems something's wrong.

477
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,700
- Li's leg injury has worsened.
- Duoduo.

478
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,240
- What will
- Go for it.

479
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,720
the Xingang team do?

480
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,520
- Duoduo.
- Will they give up

481
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,720
or keep going?

482
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,920
- Guoduo.
- I have to say.

483
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,960
Seems Lang Yueting

484
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,280
is going to win this match.

485
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,580
It seems the Xingang team...

486
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,160
You can't play anymore.

487
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,120
Let's stop, okay?

488
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,960
- No.
- Let's stop.

489
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
- Timeout.
- Weilan.

490
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,040
- Timeout.
- Chen Weilan.

491
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,420
Don't call a timeout. Keep playing.

492
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,780
I can play. I can.

493
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,120
- Get up.
- Go for it.

494
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,080
We see Li Guoduo standing up

495
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,540
and returning to the court.

496
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,260
This is the spirit of sports.

497
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,580
Unwilling to give up.

498
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,530
Yes.

499
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,960
Li Guoduo has returned to the court.

500
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,060
Go, Xingang. Go for it.

501
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,080
Come on.

502
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,560
Li Guoduo has been playing with an injury.

503
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,400
We can see

504
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,940
the bandage on her leg is soaked with blood.

505
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,040
Her opponents haven't given

506
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,500
any leniency due to her injury.

507
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,840
On the court, you have

508
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,940
to give it your all.

509
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,720
Lang Yueting and Chen Weilan

510
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,280
are facing off in their first
beach volleyball match.

511
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,480
They're not giving any ground.

512
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,620

the national league

578
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,880
of beach volleyball after ten years.

579
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,820
Who would have thought

580
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,400
that Li Guoduo, despite her leg injury,

581
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,120
still completed the match?

582
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,420
The whole arena is cheering for her.

583
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,440
This is Xingang University's glorious moment.

584
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,060
They created a miracle.

585
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,480
You're here.

586
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,680
Aunt Zhou, business is good?

587
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,020
Yes, it's good.

588
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,440
Gao.

589
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,020
Doing well in the NYT.

590
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,300
Our great painter is doing well too.

591
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,680
Not bad.

592
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,900
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

593
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,080
We're going in, Aunt.

594
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,920
OK. Go ahead.

595
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,400
Aunt Zhou, may your business flourish.

596
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,240
Thanks.

597
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,840
You two

598
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,200
aren't enthusiastic about work

599
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,680
but first about eating.

600
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,600
Coming.

601
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,640
- I'll get it.
- Come on.

602
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,000
Scrub these oysters for me.

603
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,360
Gao, clean that stove.

604
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,720
Scrub it well. He's coming soon.

605
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,560
OK.

606
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,980
What are you doing?

607
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,620
I have some things to do.

608
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,280
Gao, take these shrimp over.

609
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,220
Handle them.

610
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,740
Come on, work.

611
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,640
Need help?

612
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,740
No need. Old skill.

613
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,440
Must roast them. I'm telling you.

614
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,640
Today's shrimp are very good.

615
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,960
You need to skewer them to roast.

616
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,560
You have to skewer them yourself.

617
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,800
Yes, I think those shrimp

618
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,360
are really good, bro.

619
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,540
No need to add...

620
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,160
Hello?

621
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,920
OK.

622
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,360
Thanks.

623
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,320
How's it going?

624
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,480
We

625
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,020
were eliminated.

626
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,440
I think being eliminated is okay.

627
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,560
We can try again, right?

628
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
- Next year.
- Yes.

629
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,670
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

630
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,630
- Yes.
- Next year.

631
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,700
Don't be sad, Duoduo.

632
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,160
It's okay.

633
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,360
It's mealtime.

634
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,810
Let's roast all the kebabs.

635
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,630
Yes, we're hurrying.

636
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,810
Just kidding.

637
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,080
We got in.

638
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,770
Weilan, we can participate
in the NYT selection.

639
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,190
- Li Guoduo.
- You little liar.

640
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,550
- Are you crazy?
- I was about...

641
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,870
- I didn't know.
- Why lie to me?

642
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,290
- Come on.
- Come on.

643
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,630
Why can't you

644
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,040
learn something good?

645
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,880
It's okay.

646
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,580
Why did you lie to me?

647
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,620
I'm telling you. You've lost your partner.

648
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Weilan, I was wrong.

649
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,480
Let me go. Get away from me.

650
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,420
Come back.

651
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,780
(Dafu BBQ)

652
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,760
Coming.

653
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,200
- Two kebabs each.
- Here.

654
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,520
- Thanks,.
- Thanks.

655
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,560
- Thanks.
- Chicken wings.

656
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,440
Here, chicken wings.

657
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,360
Two kebabs for you.

658
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,580
Come on.

659
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,180
Come on.

660
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,420
I knew it.

661
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,060
You would definitely succeed.

662
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,120
The application for the NYT has been approved.

663
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,500
From now on,

664
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,720
you must train strictly.

665
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,740
Of course.

666
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,280
This year, we participated

667
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,320
in so many games

668
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,200
just to finally

669
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
join the NYT.

670
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,160
We can definitely do it.

671
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,040
Go for it.

672
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,080
- Come on.
- Go for it.

673
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,100
- Go for it.
- Go for it.

674
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,900
It hasn't been easy all these years.

675
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,280
Li Guoduo.

676
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,840
- Come on. Eat
- OK.

677
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,640
I didn't make it to the NYT
with indoor volleyball.

678
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
If I make it because of beach volleyball,

679
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,000
I really owe it to you.

680
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,480
Thanks to me?

681
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,500
Thanks to you.

682
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,120
You both are gold.

683
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,620
You'll shine wherever you go.

684
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,000
Go for it.

685
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,320
Let's toast again.

686
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,240
Come on.

687
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,360
- Cheers.
- To celebrate.

688
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,360
- Come on.
- Cheers.

689
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,300
- Come on. Cheers.
- Celebrate again.

690
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,020
Look, they're over there.

691
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,740
Lu is here.

692
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,640
What's going on here?

693
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,000
Come on. Sit here.

694
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,480
Come on.

695
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,660
What's going on with you?

696
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,360
Come on.

697
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,460
Add some cutlery.

698
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,820
What's going on?

699
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,820
Coach Tian,

700
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,600
it's fine that you came alone.

701
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,060
But why are you with a little liar?

702
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,480
How can you say that to your coach?

703
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,100
How can you say he's a little liar?

704
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,740
Clearly, he's a big liar.

705
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,240
- What's going on?
- Mom, let me.

706
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,080
Let me tell you.

707
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,560
If you can't clear things up,

708
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,680
three drinks as punishment.

709
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,920
Three drinks each.

710
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,160
What three drinks?

711
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,540
Who are you calling a little liar?

712
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm telling you.

713
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,240
Today, there's something big

714
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,580
to announce.

715
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,100
Should you say it or should I?

716
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,160
You go.

717
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,520
I'll go?

718
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,420
Look carefully.

719
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,980
Engagement ring.

720
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,500
Engagement ring.

721
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,020
Good for you.

722
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,200
Little liar, you're really something.

723
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,260
Good for you.

724
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,180
- Very good.
- So beautiful.

725
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,260
Is it time to change

726
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,120
how we address her?

727
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,100
Change?

728
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,840
What should we call her?

729
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,100
Mrs. Lu.

730
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,980
Yes, yes, yes.

731
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,580
Hello, Mrs. Lu.

732
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,780
Very good. Let me tell you.

733
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,240
Little liar, you're really something.

734
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,080
Came here and even took a wife.

735
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,920
Is that so?

736
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,700
- When will the wedding be?
- Yes.

737
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Don't you know your own coach?

738
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,460
Bought the ring and went bankrupt.

739
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,800
Little liar, this won't do.

740
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,640
What won't do?

741
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,620
What's the big deal? A drop in the bucket.

742
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,860
