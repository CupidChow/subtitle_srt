18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,900
That last ball

19
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,730
wasn't your fault.

20
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,940
But I did make a mistake.

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,240
We're human,

22
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,260
not robots. Mistakes inevitably happen.

23
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,580
Look how many mistakes I've made today.

24
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,180
And you didn't blame me.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,620
I could have received that ball.

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,300
Chen Weilan.

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,640
You're great.

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,860
You did nothing wrong.

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,540
I'm the one who's useless.

30
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,560
You see.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,800
The capacity of a bucket

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,100
depends on its shortest plank.

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,580
I'm that short plank.

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,660
It's my fault.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,220
I'm dragging you down.

36
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,100
Stop trying to comfort me this way.

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,100
Though I'm the shortest plank,

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,900
I'll improve.

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
And look.

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,900
We're only freshmen.

41
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,740
We have plenty of chances and time.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,200
If we work hard together,

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,890
we can make it to the national league.

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,520
Let's give it our all.

45
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,360
Okay?

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,960
We can do this.

47
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,180
Didn't you promise your dad?

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,420
If you didn't make it to the national league,

49
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,400
next year,

50
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,380
you'd quit beach volleyball.

51
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,420
I almost forgot about it.

52
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,700
I think

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,940
when you're focused on something,

54
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,820
you just enjoy the moment.

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm happy

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,780
to play beach volleyball now.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,280
Who cares

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,660
about a year from now?

59
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,000
Don't frown anymore.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,840
Alright, alright.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,380
Come on. Keep going.

62
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,600
We can do this.

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,860
Fine.

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,700
You said it's okay.

66
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,060
Now that we've decided,

67
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,500
let's get started.

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
What are you doing?

69
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,740
Last night,

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,020
we made some plans for you.

71
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,660
I believe you can overcome your mental block.

72
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,220
What's this?

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,100
It's just a reference.

74
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,500
We can discuss the details.

75
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,540
(Training Progress Chart)

76
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,480
Wait.

77
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,020
Do you want me to learn from her?

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,260
Use her as a reference?

79
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,660
Are you serious?

80
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,440
Do you know why you can't beat Lang Yueting?

81
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,780
I can't beat her?

82
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,980
I won that match.

83
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,700
She scored more points than you.

84
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,320
She was the MVP.

85
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,820
I got replaced.

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,480
If I hadn't been replaced,

87
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,840
I would have been the MVP.

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,420
If you hadn't been replaced,

89
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,740
your team would have lost.

90
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,800
How can you say that?

91
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,700
We've watched that match many times.

92
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
If the coach hadn't replaced you,

93
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,820
you would have lost.

94
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,020
But I came back later.

95
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,180
You did.

96
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,480
As a decoy.

97
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
You were there to draw defenders,

98
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,840
so your teammates could score.

99
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,360
Don't you understand that?

100
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,060
How am I a decoy?

101
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,240
Come on.

102
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,500
It's just a fact.

103
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,040
It's not about a decoy.

104
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,260
It's a tactical need.

105
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,400
Weilan,

106
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,500
we've watched your videos many times.

107
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,120
We truly think

108
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,220
your skills are on par

109
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,380
with Lang Yueting's.

110
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,680
So?

111
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Don't worry.

112
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,020
Let me explain.

113
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Lang Yueting can

114
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,860
limit you so much

115
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,860
because she knows you too well.

116
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,480
She can respond

117
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,620
to your jumps and spikes perfectly.

118
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,440
She can predict your next move

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,700
before you jump.

120
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,080
She even studied your hard spikes.

121
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,280
Whenever you move your elbow,

122
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,720
she knows where you'll spike.

123
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,840
What does that

124
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,960
have to do with your plan

125
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,800
for me?

126
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,380
Why can she do all that?

127
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,000
Because she watched

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,950
your videos countless times.

129
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,100
She knows you very well.

130
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
That's why

131
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,100
she was the MVP.

132
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,180
If you want to surpass her

133
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
and overcome your mental block,

134
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,060
you need to know her just as well.

135
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,100
I think Duoduo is right.

136
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,760
In matches like these,

137
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,510
knowing your opponent is crucial.

138
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,820
Enough talk.

139
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,340
Tonight at 8,

140
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,840
training at the beach court.

141
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,760
We'll be waiting for you.

142
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,700
If you're scared,

143
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,000
then forget it.

144
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,640
Bye.

145
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,680
We'll be waiting for you.

146
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
We'll be waiting for you.

147

(Training Plan)

148
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
(Lang Yueting can)

149
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,260
(limit you so much)

150
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,420
(because she knows you too well.)

151
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,800
(She can respond)

152
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,140
(to your jumps and spikes perfectly.)

153
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,760
(She can predict your next move)

154
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,260
(before you jump.)

155
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,260
(She even studied your hard spikes.)

156
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,760
(Whenever you move your elbow,)

157
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,400
(she knows where you'll spike.)

158
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,700
(Why can she do all that?)

159
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,800
(Because she watched)

160
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,750
(your videos countless times.)

161
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,980
(She knows you very well.)

162
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,120
(That's why)

163
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,700
(she was the MVP.)

164
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,620
(If you want to surpass her)

165
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,260
(and overcome your mental block,)

166
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,460
(you need to know her just as well.)

167
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,250
- Good shot.
- Go.

168
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,800
Come on.

169
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,730
Nice.

170
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,310
Put more power into it.

171
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,520
Good shot.

172
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,820
Take a break.

173
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,600
Thanks.

174
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,000
Duoduo.

175
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,840
Your force is lacking.

176
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,130
Adjust your angle a bit.

177
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,920
Got it.

178
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,040
Weilan.

179
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,380
Listen to me.

180
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,880
Your

181
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,220
strong spike

182
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,220
is your strength.

183
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,300
But your movements are stiff.

184
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,500
Based on your hand shape,

185
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,880
if you lower a bit,

186
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,860
your spike will be better.

187
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,380
Just like Duoduo.

188
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,060
With timing and angle.

189
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,960
He only gave me one tip

190
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,720
but so many to Chen Weilan.

191
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,900
It's too obvious.

192
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,560
Gao is not only

193
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,060
good at beach volleyball

194
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,500
but also a pro at favoritism.

195
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,880
I know

196
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,520
you used to play indoors.

197
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,480
It's different on the sand.

198
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,320
It's hard to get used to.

199
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,600
This can really affect

200
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,140
your timing and angles.

201
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,160
You need to adjust quickly

202
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,620
to this court.

(Xingang University)

204
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,100
What's going on?

205
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,020
Who did it in our activity room?

206
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,340
(I'm good at rehydration)

207
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,740
You guys are just in time.

208
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,260
Who broke into our activity room

209
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,100
and made this mess?

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,860
Why, Shao Nian?

211
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,220
Let me explain.

212
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,260
I've noticed your training load

213
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,400
is heavy lately

214
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,740
and worried you can't handle it,

215
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,620
so I set up some aromatherapy.

216
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,420
Shao Nian, impressive.

217
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,000
Alright.

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,220
Let's talk business.

219
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,100
Today.

220
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,320
We're watching videos.

221
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
Didn't we watch them yesterday?

222
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,780
What's different about today?

223
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,180
Today, it's this one.

224
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,000
Next, please welcome our

225

organizing committee director,

226
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Ms. Wang Yun,

227
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,440
to present

228
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,680
the MVP award trophy

229
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,150
- Why are you showing me this?
- to Lang Yueting.

230
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,380
If you can watch this,

231
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,060
you've passed the first stage.

00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,940
(National High School Volleyball Tournament)

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,860
Chen Weilan,

234
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,180
you've passed the first stage.

235
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,180
Now it's time for the second.

236
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,540
Hope you can overcome this.

237
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,680
Come on.

238
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,720
Go for it!

239
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,440
Come on.

240
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,000
Again.

241
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,480
Keep going.

242
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,600
Weilan, you did it! Did you see that?

243
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,440
Weilan.

244
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,840
Keep going.

245
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,980
You closed your eyes.

246
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,380
- Closed her eyes?
- Closed her eyes.

247
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,000
Try again.

248
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,920
Go for it!

249
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,280
Go for it!

250
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,560

What's wrong, Gao?

268
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Sit down.

269
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,360
Let me see.

270
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,440
I'm fine.

271
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,680
Probably just bumped my hand.

272
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,520
Hold on.

273
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,060
How could you be so careless?

274
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,280
I have this.

275
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,500
What's this?

276
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,800
It can fix your bones.

277
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,900
Is it okay?

278
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,160
Come here.

279
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,800
Be gentle.

280
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,680
Okay.

281
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,040
Great.

282
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,680
Good.

283
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,660
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

284
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,220
Done?

285
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,480
Alright.

286
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,340
You did well.

287
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,740
My bandaging skills are good.

288
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,900
Keep your fingers still.

289
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,380
- Thanks, bro.
- No problem.

290
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,560
Still hurts.

291
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,000
Be careful.

292
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,720
You're early.

293
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,860
They haven't arrived yet.

294
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,780
Gao can't come.

295
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,680
Why?

296
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,500
Guess.

297
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,980
It's because of you.

298
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,520
He practiced with you so much yesterday

299
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,580
that his hand got swollen.

300
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,720
Just did a few blocks.

301
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,780
So delicate.

302
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,780
Just did a few blocks?

303
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,260
He's been focused on you for the past few days.

304
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,840
Poor Gao Ge.

305
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,380
Such a thankless job.

306
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,680
There he is.

307
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,880
You're looking for me?

308
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,440
This is for you.

309
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,380
So cheesy.

310
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,720
Thanks.

311
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,080
By the way,

312
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,640
this is for you.

313
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,180
Consider it a reward

314
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,540
for overcoming your mental block.

315
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,160
No need. I'm using this.

316
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,800
- It's nice.
- Take it.

317
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,020
I don't need it.

318
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,020
Then take it back.

319
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,660
Do what you want with it.

320
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,920
Thanks.

321
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,360
Bye-bye.

322
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,500
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

323
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,040
This is your reward.

324
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,880
Take it.

325
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,880
Is it just a reward?

326
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,440
I came to give you medicine.

327
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,140
Can't you see my feelings for you?

328
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,020
Isn't it because I'm injured?

329
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,380
Do you mean...

330
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,930
Oh, come on.

331
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,830
Are you two bored? So annoying.

332
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,670
Oh, come on.

333
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,720
This is all Liqiang's idea.

334
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,040
I'm just playing along.

335
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,440
You acted well just now.

336
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,720
Why did you pin it on me?

337
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,740
You two are so childish.

338
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,800
For pain and swelling?

339
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,260
This medicine is pretty spot-on.

340
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,120
Chen Weilan cares about you, Gao.

341
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,180
Good for you.

342
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,160
What does that mean?

343
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,880
What does that mean?

344
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,320
Even a fool can see it.

345
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,500
She likes you.

346
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,500
- Affirmed.
- You noticed?

347
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,260
(You might have to repeat a year.)

348
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,280
Coach Lu is so weird.

349
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,440
He's been here for so long.

350
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,960
We're close to solving your problem,

351
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,100
yet he hasn't figured it out.

352
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,220
What problem?

353
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,900
What problem do I have?

354
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,600
How are you still...

355
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,840
There's trouble.

356
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,560
Shao Nian

357
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,660
might have to repeat a year.

358
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,980
What?

359
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,500
What's going on?

360
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,820
Where is he now?

361
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,720
He got a message from Prof. Qin.

362
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,300
He's probably with him now.

363
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,960
I'll go find him.

364
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,640
Wait. You...

365
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,740
Why does he have to repeat a year?

366
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,760
How many classes does he attend

367
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,900
because of Duoduo?

368
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,280
If he has to repeat a year,

369
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,620
he'll be your junior.

370
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,860
I don't want a junior like him.

371
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,290
Hope Duoduo can talk some sense into him.

372
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,340
His heart's not in his studies.

373
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,860
No one can help.

374
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,360
The Medical School is hard to get into.

375
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,660
The tuition is expensive, too.

376
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,380
He doesn't appreciate it.

377
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,540
What a rich boy.

378
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,000
Fifteen classes a week,

379
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,360
and you only attended five.

380
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,200
Tell me.

381
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,460
What are you thinking?

382
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,700
Think before you speak.

383
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,620
And don't say you're doing well.

384
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,140
You have to meet the basic attendance.

385
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,760
Fine, I'll repeat then.

386
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,400
That way, I can spend another year

387
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,560
with you.

388
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,540
No, please don't.

389
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,820
I have nothing to teach you.

390
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,700
You should move on

391
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,080
and annoy some other teacher.

392
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,900
Don't say that, Prof. Qin.

393
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,700
No other teacher compares to you.

394
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,160
And besides,

395
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,140
in the third year, we'll start pharmacology.

396
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,580
I'm not ready for that.

397
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,980
Always have a way with words.

398
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,200
Alright, alright.

399
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,860
Come back to class tomorrow,

400
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,260
and don't miss any more classes.

401
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,560
Prof. Qin,

402
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,020
I have something tomorrow.

403
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,200
I might not make it.

404
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,100
How can you be so busy?

405
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,060
You're even busier than me.

406
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,280
I'm telling you.

407
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,500
If you keep this up, no one can't save you.

408
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,600
Yes, yes.

409
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,900
No one can save me.

410
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,700
(Shao Nian often skips classes.)

411
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,340
(He lied to me, saying he had few classes.)

412
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,160
I promise

413
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,480
from now on,

414
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,340
you'll often see me in class.

415
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,440
Alright, Prof. Qin?

416
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,220
Alright. I've said enough.

417
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,060
You're not young anymore.

418
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,420
You should know what to do.

419
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,880
Alright, Prof. Qin.

420
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,320
I won't disturb you then.

421
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,160
Bye-bye.

422
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,160
Bye-bye.

423

Duoduo.

424
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,640
Shao Nian.

425
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,200
We're friends, right?

426
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,250
We share a deep connection, right?

427
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,280
Of course.

428
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,940
Then listen to me.

429
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,020
Don't skip classes or miss attendance anymore.

430
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,300
You came just to say that?

431
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,480
Isn't it serious enough?

432
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,060
You're at risk of not graduating.

433
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,480
Trust me. It's just a minor issue

434
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,500
that can be easily fixed.

435
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,580
But why are you talking like the others?

436
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,880
Shao Nian,

437
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,380
focus on your studies first.

438
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,920
If you miss too many classes,

439
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,000
you won't get your diploma. How can you

440
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,260
pursue your dreams without a diploma?

441
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,120
I heard everything you said

442
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,040
to the professor.

443
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,500
I understand all your thoughts,

444
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,920
but now, you need to prioritize your studies.

445
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,560
Without a diploma, what can you do?

446
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,760
You need to graduate first.

447
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,600
Graduate?

448
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,580
After graduation, there's work.

449
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,300
Without work, it's considered idle.

450
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,560
I can imagine

451
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
the excuses you'll use

452
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,680
to stop me

453
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,080
from doing what I love.

454
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,260
What did I do wrong?

455
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,800
Do you think

456
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,300
not finishing your studies is right?

457
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,260
I don't want to argue about this.

458
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,580
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

459
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,720
Professor.

460
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,640
Professor.

461
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,220
Is Shao Nian really going to repeat a year?

462
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,280
Are you his girlfriend?

463
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,080
- I'm not...
- If you are,

464
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,860
please try to persuade him.

465
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,280

466
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,480

467
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,320
for you to look at.

468
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,560
Right. If possible,

469
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,140
I'd like to study oil painting with you.

470
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,480
Right.

471
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,020
Sure. Thanks.

472

Shao Nian, aren't you the team doctor?

474
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,600
Shouldn't you be studying medicine?

475
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,180
Are you running a side business?

476
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,120
Coach Lu, what are you doing here?

477
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,960
Just wandering around.

478
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,520
Well, keep wandering.

479
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,880
If you need anything, text me.

480
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,480
Please don't tell anyone

00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,460
No problem.

483
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,720
I'm here as a coach,

484

496
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,620
Alright. I won't mention class anymore.

497
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,300

I know why you're upset.

500
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,900
It's because I didn't support you,

right?

502
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,580

You can do it.

573
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,670
♪You let me know♪

574
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
How much longer?

575
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
Almost done.

576
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,240
It's so good.

577
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,260
Do you want the last one?

578
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,000
You eat it.

579
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,840
Try one. Try one.

580
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,100
Eat it, and stop moving. Please.

581
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,300
- Hurry.
- Missing an eye.

582
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,060
You've packed your bags.

583
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,600
Are you planning to leave?

584
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,460
Come on.

585
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,360
What?

586
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,280
Running away?

587
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,800
If you leave,

588
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,900
where will I find you and your cousin?

589
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,060
I'm not running away.

590
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,840
I told you

591
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,380
I'd make sure he repays the money.

592
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,960
I'm the National Youth Team coach.

593
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,220
We're going to training camp.

594
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,980
You can check the info on my phone.

595
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,380
(Ticket issued:
Lu Xiaole, 9:00 am, Capital Airport)

596
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,020
Still have to wait?

597
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,700
Why aren't you keeping your word?

598
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,660
Didn't we agree on a month?

599
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,880
Don't worry. Wait a little longer.

600
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,720
It's almost time.

601
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,960
How much longer

602
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,060
do I have to wait?

603
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,380
Probably another month.

604
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,540
That's quite a long time.

605
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,720
It's progressing smoothly now.

606
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,040
Don't worry.

607
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,880
Alright.

608
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,260
I'll trust you one last time.

609
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,180
One month.

610
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,200
One month.

611
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,180
Oh, my god.

612
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,500
Another month.

613
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,920
I know everyone

614
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,320
is very excited about this news.

615
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,180
It has made you speechless.

616
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,680
Though a month feels long,

617
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,840
rest assured.

618
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,860
I will do everything to guide you.

619
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,620
A month?

620
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,540
A month of physical training

621
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,900
will turn me into dark coal.

622
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,160
Coach,

623
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,940
the Seven-School League is coming.

624
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,560
Besides physical training,

625
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,120
are you sure we don't need

626
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,300
to work on tactics and strategy?

627
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,400
Yeah, Coach.

628
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,320
Gao and I need you

629
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,540
to set up some tactics.

630
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,220
As for tactics,

631
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,160
they shouldn't be revealed too early.

632
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,760
Do you know what the highest level

633
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,060
of martial arts is?

634
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,520
No idea.

635
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,880
No idea?

636
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,480
It's no moves at all.

637
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
Our strategy is the same.

638
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,360
It's no strategy.

639
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,180
It keeps the opponents guessing.

640
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,420
So, you mean

641
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,020
a diversified attack?

642
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,600
Yes, exactly.

643
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,220
Chen Weilan understands me best.

644
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,000
I should have recruited you

645
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,260
to the National Youth Team.

646
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,120
Coach, how can we achieve

647
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,340
diversified attacks?

648
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Good question.

649
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,040
Right on point.

650
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,600
Diversified attacks

651
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,400
rely on your solid physical fitness

652
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,220
to exhaust your opponents.

653
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,880
Physical strength is the foundation.

654
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,160
If you can grit your teeth

655
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,120
and make it to the last minute,

656
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,340
you will win.

657
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,160
Coach,

658
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,740
is this really okay?

659
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,540
With unclear strategies

660
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,340
and no targeted technical guidance,

661
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,040
if we focus only

662
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,980
on physical training,

663
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,380
is that suitable?

664
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,320
The game isn't an endurance test.

665
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,920
If there's a significant skill gap,

666
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,000
we might lose

667
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,260
before the final set.

668
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,260
What do you all think?

669
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,480
As the team captain,

670
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,180
my opinion represents the team's opinion.

671
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,920
Chen Weilan,

672
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,900
what do you think?

673
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,060
I think

674
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,140
we should follow your lead.

675
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,240
Everyone hasn't had

676
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,820
systematic training before,

677
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,400
so I think it could be helpful.

678
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,240
I have no problem with it.

679
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,900
Do you have any other concerns?

680
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,820
No, none.

681
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,520
Alright.

682
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,620
Let me emphasize again.

683
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,160
You all have technical deficiencies,

684
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,320
but the more urgent issue

685
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,620
is your lack of physical fitness. Got it?

686
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,320
Think about it carefully.

687
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,160
I'm leaving now.

688
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,560
Bye.

689
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,020
How can you agree with him?

690
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,280
Chen Weilan.

691
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,720
Why did you back up Coach Lu?

692
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,560
Isn't it strange

693
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,680
that he doesn't set up any tactics?

694
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,980
How did I back him up?

695
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,280
In beach volleyball,

696
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,760
there are only two players,

697
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,460
so physical fitness is crucial,

698
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,120
especially for someone like you

699
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,370
- who doesn't train.
- Come on.

700
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,920
Physical fitness

701
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,060
can't be built overnight.

702
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,540
It's better than not training at all.

703
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,680
Wait, hold on.

704
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,140
Let me serve.

705
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,380
What's this?

706
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,140
You're off today, Xia.

707
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,440
You can't keep up.

708
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,400
I can't do this. No stamina left.

709
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,240
I can't do it.

710
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,940
Because of Coach Lu?

711
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,940
Of course.

712
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,500
He's the National Youth Team coach.

713
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,460
Why is he only focusing on physical fitness?

714
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,640
Honestly, I've never been this tired

715
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,980
from playing beach volleyball.

716
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,680
I feel like my stamina

717
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,940
isn't suited for beach volleyball.

718
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,320
Do you think

719
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,700
he's not seriously coaching us

720
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,740
and using physical training to wear us out?

721
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,880
That can't be.

722
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,120
He's the National Youth Team coach,

723
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,460
but he came to coach amateurs like us.

724
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,860
What are we giving him?

725
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,160
No salary.

726
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,400
Staying in dorms.

727
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,500
Eating in the cafeteria.

728
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,660
Do you think he's here to slack off?

729
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,780
You might be right,

730
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,200
but we wouldn't be getting anything out of it.

731
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,500
We're spending so much time on this.

732
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,720
It may not be true.

733
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,640
Maybe their training

734
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,560
is just like this.

735
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,000
Building physical fitness

736
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,860
before tactical training.

737
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,560
Do you think we can

738
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,260
build our stamina so quickly?

739
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,260
Let's not overthink it.

740
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,480
The National Youth Team

741
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,640
probably just has

742
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,660
a unique training style.

743
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,520
I'm done playing. I can't keep up.

744
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,960
I'm going to buy some water. What do you want?

745
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,060
- Anything.
- Okay.

746
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,940
Welcome to Sports News.

747
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,000
The coach of the National Youth Team

748
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,920
will arrive in Xiamen tomorrow.

749
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,320
They will undergo

750
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,840
a month-long intensive training there.

751
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,800
We look forward

752
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,820
to their exciting performance.

753
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,640
What's wrong, Duoduo?

754
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,740
The Team is training in Xiamen for a month.

755
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,600
So why would the coach

756
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,940
stay here for another month?

757
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,580
Maybe he thinks we need extra practice.

758
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,880
Shao Nian,

759
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,580
don't you find him

760
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,140
a bit odd?

761
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,730
Odd?

762
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,540
I do know a lot of theories,

763
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,680
but besides you all,

764
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,380
I don't know other players.

765
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,630
Wasn't you who invited him?

766
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,500
That's because he was your dad's teammate.

767
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,670
Why not go to the hospital

768
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,700
and ask your dad about it?

769
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,180
Lu Daxing?

770
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,220
He has quite a character back in school.

771
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,430
Very eccentric.

772
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,400
Really?

773
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,810
He was eccentric in school?

774
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,190
No wonder

775
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,440
he's kidding around now,

776
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,810
not like a coach at all.

777
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,220
Lu Daxing kidding around?

778
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,740
Did his change after going abroad?

779
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,620
Did he mention me?

780
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,320
No.

781
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,680
Does he look down on us

782
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,600
because our place is small?

783
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,460
Is he just messing with us?

784
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,140
How does he train you all?

785
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,080
Don't even ask.

786
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,100
He just focuses on physical training.

787
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,940
Physical training?

788
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,320
Lu Daxing is strong in physical fitness,

789
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,860
but it can't be just about that.

790
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,180
Right? You think so too, don't you?

791
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,460
You should train as he instructs.

792
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,900
It will be beneficial.

793
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,180
Once your stamina improves,

794
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,900
you'll get more advantages during matches.

795
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,660
Got it.

796
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,180
Why can't you stop talking while eating?

797
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,520
- You...
- Uncle Li.

798
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,900
Let me say it for you.

799
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,160
Li Guoduo,

800
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,400
you need to train well

801
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,780
and stop overthinking.

802
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,920
Stop talking.

803
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,100
So talkative.

804
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,760
Later,

805
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,860
bring Coach Lu some fruit

806
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,560
to make him train us well

807
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,840
for the Seven-School League.

808
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,720
Otherwise,

809
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,840
I'm really worried.

810
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,920
Take it seriously.

811
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,060
Why aren't you going with me?

812
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,300
I can't enter the boys' dorm.

813
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,320
Do you think I can?

814
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,620
It's not impossible.

815
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,900
No way.

816
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,840
You're with him every day.

817
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,340
Just help me handle it.

818
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,560
Who's there?

819
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,160
Hey, hey.

820
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,880
Calm down. Please.

821
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,560
Calm down.

822
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,920
This is a school. Don't, don't.

823
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,300
Lu Xiaole, good for you.

824
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,040
Hiding here, huh?

825
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,320
You made me search everywhere.

826
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,760
Hold on, we can talk this out.

827
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,120
- No need to get physical.
- Talk? Pay up now.

828
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,640
This is a school. How did you get in here?

829
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,920
It's not your concern.

830
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,660
Do you know how long I've been looking for you?

831
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,220
- Coach Lu?
- Keep your voice down.

832
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,950
Who are you? Let him go.

833
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,190
This is a school, or I'll call the police.

834
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,400
- Let go.
- Who are you?

835
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,760
Are you letting go or not? Fine.

836
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,700
Fine, call the police.

837
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,680
He's calling the police.

838
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,000
You should pay his debt.

839
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,960
He's calling the police.

840
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,800
Let go.

841
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,240
Lu Xiaole.

842
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,400
Let me tell you.

843
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,100
I'm giving you a deadline.

844
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,100
By noon tomorrow,

845
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,320
transfer a million to me.

846
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,380
Or I'll break your leg.

847
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,680
Alright.

848
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,960
Wait and see.

849
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,780
What a jerk.

850
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,340
Thanks a lot.

851
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,940
Shao Nian, why are you here?

852
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,560
Lu Xiaole?

853
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,020
Aren't you Lu Daxing?

854
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,540
You caught me.

855
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Yes, that's right.

856
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,020
I'm Lu Xiaole.

857
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,240
Lu Daxing is my brother.

858
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,380
I'm his cousin.

859
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,780
His cousin.

860
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,840
Lu Daxing is your cousin?

861
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,020
You're also into beach volleyball?

862
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,080
No.

863
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,140
I've never played it.

864
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,600
I am

865
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,300
into windsurfing.

866
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,640
I'm starting a business and hit some bumps.

867
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,940
As you just saw.

868
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,140
Windsurfing?

869
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,690
No wonder you only train physical fitness.

870
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,160
You're not into beach volleyball,

871
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,240
so why did you lie to me?

872
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,260
I didn't lie to you.

873
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,340
Sports are all interconnected.

874
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,200
Basic fitness...

875
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,380
No more explanations.

876
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,420
Pack your things and leave.

877
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,240
I can't let you stay with our team.

878
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,640
Shao Nian, hold on.

879
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,120
Let's talk this over. Have a seat.

880
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,320
There's nothing to discuss between us.

881
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,940
- There is.
- We don't need a liar.

882
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,160
Wait.

883
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,460
There really is.

884
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,460
Listen to me.

885
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,620
One minute.

886
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,600
Think about it.

887
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,360
You were the one

888
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,660
who brought me here.

889
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,740
You told everyone I was Coach Lu Daxing

890
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,220
from the National Youth Team,

891
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,080
especially in front of Li Guoduo.

892
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,140
You made a big deal out of it.

893
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,860
If you expose me

894
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,540
and kick me out now,

895
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,160
what will you do?

896
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,260
Besides,

897
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,560
sports

898
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,900
are interconnected.

899
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,860
I'm into windsurfing,

900
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,180
but it's still relevant.

901
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,800
And

902
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,520
Lu Daxing

903
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,020
really is my cousin.

904
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,460
I can help you with him.

905
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,580
Let's help each other out.

906
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,800
What?

907
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,460
Coach Lu is an impostor?

908
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,880
I knew it.

909
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,620
The National Youth Team is better than this.

910
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,500
I knew it. Lu Xiaole wasn't reliable.

911
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,620
It's delayed your training.

912
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,580
I'll tell everyone tomorrow.

913
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,320
Bro, you've put yourself

914
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,660
in a tough spot.

915
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,140
What if word gets out

916
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,720
that you couldn't get a coach

917
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,280
from the National Youth Team

918
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,980
and brought in a fake on purpose?

919
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,040
That would be disastrous.

920
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,580
But we can't keep it a secret.

921
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,860
Don't worry, bro.

922
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,160
I think

923
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,120
having Lu Xiaole here

924
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,100
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

925
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,240
With all this physical training,

926
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,980
everyone has improved.

927
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,180
Gao is right.

928
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,020
We trust you,

929
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,580
but we can't control

930
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,790
how the other team members feel.

931
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,440
And think about it.

932
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,660
If the school finds out,

933
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,980
our team might get disbanded.

934
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,360
He's supposed to be the coach,

935
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,220
but if he's only focusing

936
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,640
on physical training,

937
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,100
it's wasting our time.

938
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,130
You can't think of it like that.

939
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,100
You had good intentions.

940
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,460
Things just didn't go as planned.

941
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,060
Actually,

942
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,020
as long as the result is good,

943
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,080
no one will care about the process.

944
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,380
Right, the result is what matters.

945
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,620
What do you mean?

946
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,080
Lu Xiaole,

947
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,420
I borrowed all the books

948
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,080
about beach volleyball

949
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,300
from the library for you.

950
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,640
And here's

951
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,580
some material I copied from Gao.

952
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,300
You have a week

953
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,780
to memorize all of it.

954
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,300
If you don't,

955
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,160
I'll tell your debt collector

956
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,140
exactly where you are.

957
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,500
Weren't you going to kick me out?

958
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,940
- You...
- I don't want to hear it.

959
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,400
Memorize it all

960
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,740
and come up with a strategy.

961
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,080
Otherwise...

962
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,980
(Ready)

963
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,820
(Start)

964
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,180
(Coach Lu is fake.)

965
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,900
(I guess I'm not fated)

966
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,620
(with the National Youth Team.)

967
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,100
(I even)

968
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,060
(ran into a fake coach.)

969
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,680
Hey.

970
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,340
Why are you laughing by yourself?

971
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,700
That's not laughing.

972
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,820
It seems like you changed

973
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,400
after finding out

974
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,700
that Coach Lu is fake.

975
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,840
How did it go

976
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,680
with what I asked you to do?

977
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,180
It's done.

978
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,640
Shao Nian and I put those books

979
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,100
outside Coach Lu's door.

980
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,560
Well.

981
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,520
The fake coach.

982
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,660
I was exhausted.

983
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,040
Alright.

984
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,960
Shao Nian must treat us someday

985
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
for the trouble we went through

986
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,940
helping him appease Li Guoduo.

987
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,940
I'd really appreciate it.
