Great!

Cheers, cheers.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,420
During this time,

21
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,760
everyone has trained hard.

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,400
Enjoy the bonfire party tonight

23
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,800
and relax.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,920
Have a good time.

25
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,340
Okay.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,920
Coach Tian, you're usually so serious

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,120
and hardworking during training.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,280
I didn't expect

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,140
you'd organize this bonfire party.

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,520
Just wanted them to relax a bit.

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,100
It's fine. No problem. No need.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,720
Awareness. Do you have some awareness?

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,100
Let's go eat that.

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,800
Cheers!

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,780
Everyone, come on.

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,440
Coach Lu,

37
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,020
do you always dress

38
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,620
so true to yourself?

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,960
- Come on, come on.
- Come on.

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,120
I just wanted to match

41
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,160
the atmosphere.

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,320
Since we're out here, let's have fun.

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,160
Right?

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
Right.

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,200
Coach Tian.

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,660
How about we play a game?

47
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,840
How about Truth or Dare?

48
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,760
- Sure!
- Sure!

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,260
Alright, alright.

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,920
I have cards here. We can split them.

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,440
Coach Tian, I have a lot of truths

52
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,660
I'd like to talk about with you.

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,260
You really love games.

54
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,240
It's good for the mood.

55
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,080
Here.

56
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,220
Thanks.

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,160
The rules of the game are simple.

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,420
Show your cards.

59
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,400
Whoever gets the designated card

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,660
will be our target.

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,660
Take a card.

62
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,880
Everyone, look at your cards.

63
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,100
Who got it?

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,340
I did.

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,820
Truth or Dare?

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,400
Truth.

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,880
Coach Tian got Truth.

68
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,240
Anyone have a question?

69
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,740
Truth.

70
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,300
I do. I do.

71
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,940
What's it to you?

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
Since no one has a question,

73
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,020
let's move on to the next round.

74
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,320
Alright.

75
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,820
I do.

76
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
I do.

77
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,780
Since you all have no questions,

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,240
I'll ask.

79
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,120
Coach Tian,

80
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,900
do you have a boyfriend?

81
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,700
Boyfriend?

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,380
I'm currently single.

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,280
What do you think of me?

84
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,480
Coach Lu, let's move on to the next round.

85
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,560
Next round. Hurry!

86
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,440
Come on.

87
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,520
Let's deal the cards.

88
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,800
Continue, come on.

89
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,640
Come on, come on!

90
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,520
Here.

91
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,720
- Here.
- Take a look

92
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,980
at your cards.

93
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,400
Here.

94
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,460
- Here.
- Here.

95
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,140
Who got it this time?

96
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,720
Everyone check your cards.

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,240
Raise your hand.

98
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,820
I did.

99
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,900
Truth or Dare?

100
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,100
Dare.

101
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,360
Dare.

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,800
Exciting!

103
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,260
Courageous.

104
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,300
Let's start.

105
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,400
Who's got a suggestion?

106
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
Anything is fine.

107
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,980
Anything.

108
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
Alright.

109
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,700
I'll ask for everyone.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Coach Lu,

111
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,040
how about sharing some

112
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,600
of your experiences as a coach

113
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,660
for the National Youth Team?

114
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,540
Tell us, Coach.

115
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,400
Coach.

116
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,780
Well.

117
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
Coach Tian,

118
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,940
I chose Dare,

119
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,420
not Truth.

120
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,280
Since you can't think

121
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,640
of anything,

122
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll drink first.

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,980
I'll drink.

124
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,280
Everyone, cheers.

125
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,300
Cheers.

126
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,400
Come on, come on.

127
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,760
- Alright, fine.
- Come on.

128
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,720
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

129
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,900
Let's have a drink.

130
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,340
Cheers.

131
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,960
Alright then.

132
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,260
I'll be going.

133
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,560
I see you all

134
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,600
are feeling a bit restrained

135
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,440
with me here.

136
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,720
Enjoy yourselves.

137
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,740
Train well tomorrow.

138
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,000
Go back early and be safe.

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,720
- Clean up the trash.
- Got it.

140
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,700
- Okay.
- No worries.

141
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,760
- Understood.
- Okay.

142
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,120
- Bye-bye.
- Have fun.

143
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,100
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, bye-bye.

144
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,960
Well.

145
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,200
As Coach Tian just said.

146
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,040
Well.

147
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,540
Enjoy the food and drinks.

148
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,100
Coach Tian, wait.

149
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,260
Leaving so soon?

150
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,080
I wanted the kids to relax a bit.

151
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,620
They can't relax with me around.

152
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,930
So,

153
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,540
let's have a private chat.

154
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,600
Coach Lu,

155
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,920
if you have something to say,

156
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,860
just say it.

157
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,340
Well,

158
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,820
I'm a bit short on cash lately.

159
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,920
Coach Lu,

160
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,960
are you asking to borrow money?

161
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,240
No, no, no.

162
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,080
Well.

163
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,380
I want to hold your hand.

164
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,500
Coach Lu,

165
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
we're here for training,

166
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,540
not a vacation.

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,840
If you want to challenge me
in beach volleyball,

168
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,680
go ahead.

169
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,080
We're here to relax,

170
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,320
not play more volleyball.

171
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,580
That's so boring.

172
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,480
Then let's wait for the friendly match

173
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,320
to compete.

174
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,720
We can also...

175
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,580
Coach Lu,

176
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,300
just a reminder.

177
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,580
Don't get too close to me.

178
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,860
I hate the smell of alcohol.

179
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,420
Hand over the popcorn.

180
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,900
Who got it this time?

181
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,910
Let me see your card.

182
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,320
Who got it?

183
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,080
Who?

184
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,760
- Who got it?
- Not me.

185
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,300
I got it. Truth.

186
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,360
Shao Nian, let me

187
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,640
ask you something serious.

188
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,320
Liqiang, don't go too far. I'm on your side.

189
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,560
No way. Don't worry.

190
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,580
Shao Nian, can I ask you a question?

191
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,320
Sure.

192
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,900
Do you have someone you like?

193
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,550
Why are you looking at me?

194
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,650
I have Xiaojing.

195
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,740
Already taken. Don't look at him!

196
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,760
- Speak.
- Just drop it.

197
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,080
- Come on, say it.
- Speak up.

198
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,480
- How can we drop it?
- Yeah.

199
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,550
It's only the first round.

200
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,800
How will we play the next rounds?

201
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,840
- You, Xingang guys...
- Wanna forfeit?

202
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,760
Can't handle it?

203
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,440
Who can't handle it?

204
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,400
Shao Nian, speak up.

205
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,520
Don't let them look down on us.

206
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,360
Speak.

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,720
- What's so hard to handle?
- Say it.

208
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,020
The person I like is...

209
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,380
My mom.

210
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,260
That doesn't count.

211
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,840
You have to pick someone from our side.

212
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,400
Whose side are you on? Sit down.

213
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,680
If I get it again, I'll tell you.

214
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,960
OK. I'm looking forward to it.

215
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,440
- You deal.
- I'll deal.

216
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,880
Xia Liqiang, with his promise,

217
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,340
make sure he draws it.

218
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,360
Shao Nian, let's see if you get it this time.

219
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,700
No way. I'm telling you.

220
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,200
No.

221
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,120
I got it.

222
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,280
Truth.

223
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,800
Ask anything.

224
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,080
Let me ask you.

225
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,480
Why did you stop partnering

226
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,780
with Li Guoduo?

227
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,820
Why are you asking that?

228
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,460
Then ask something yourself.

229
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,500
I have nothing to ask.

230
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,900
This isn't hard.

231
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,820
I just felt there was

232
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,820
a rift between us.

233
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,680
Li Guoduo had someone

234
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,860
more important in their heart.

235
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,020
So I got really upset at the time.

236
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,160
Tu Lingling,

237
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,180
that's not what you told me before.

238
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,620
Why exactly was it?

239
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,360
Didn't I just say it?

240
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,680
I was just very angry.

241
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,760
With so many people here,

242
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,800
I'll explain when we go back.

243
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,740
You don't need to explain.

244
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,080
Alright, let's continue!

245
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,560
Come on, let's have a drink.

246
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,080
Come on, have a drink.

247
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,980
Quickly now.

248
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,080
Have a drink.

249
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,220
- Don't be mad.
- Have a drink.

250
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,680
I can't believe it.

251
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,460
I'm telling you. Impossible.

252
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,780
I'm fine.

253
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,180
Who got it this time?

254
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,800
I did.

255
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,680
Dare.

256
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
Alright.

257
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,680
Weilan,

258
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,720
choose one

259
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,100
of the guys here

260
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
and

261
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,460
have a cross-arm drink with him.

262
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,040
Xiaojing, you're quite something.

263
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,540
Look, I have you.

264
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,560
Shao Nian loves his mom.

265
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,260
So, that leaves Gao Ge, right?

266
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
Gao!

267
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,260
- Xia.
- Gao!

268
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,240
Isn't this going too far?

269
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,380
A promise is a promise, right?

270
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,240
- Yan Xiaojing!
- What's the matter?

271
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,200
Choosing a boyfriend over friends, huh?

272
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
You're outnumbered.

273
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,600
Aren't you done yet?

274
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,020
- Cross-arm drink!
- Can you stop it?

275
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,760
- Cross-arm drink!
- Xia.

276
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,480
Can you stop it?

277
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,080
Cross-arm drink.

278
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,920
Wasn't it agreed on?

279
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,360
Cross-arm drink, cross-arm drink!

280
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,200
Hurry up!

281
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,140
Cross-arm drink!

I'll take one.

289
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,380
Drank too much.

290
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,060
Why are you spacing out?

291
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,680
Drink some more.

292
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,380
Let's chat.

293
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,800
Sure.

294
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,120
Let me ask you.

295
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,180
Why am I not as good as Lang Yueting?

296
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,860
If you get it right, I'll drink with you.

297
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,780
These aren't enough.

298
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,160
You go first.

299
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,800
If I think it's right, I'll drink.

300
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,640
Alright.

301
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,680
I'll say it.

302
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,160
Okay.

303
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,000
I'll say it.

304
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,100
She's more well-rounded in skills.

305
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,420
Her blocking and spiking

306
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,940
are decent.

307
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,420
I can do those now too.

308
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,870
Drink.

309
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,560
What else?

310
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,580
And

311
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,860
she's good with her teammates.

312
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,360
Her teammates like to work with her.

313
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,400
That's because my teammates

314
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,000
are useless.

315
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,560
Drink, please.

316
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,760
Drink. If you don't, I won't talk.

317
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,680
This is too slow.

318
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,660
Tell me

319
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,280
all the points

320
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,420
where I'm not as good as her.

321
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,920
Tell me all at once,

322
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,520
and I'll finish this bottle.

323
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,360
Alright.

324
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,640
Deal.

325
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,500
And also,

326
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,700
she's not as pretty as you.

327
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,460
I know I'm not as pretty as her,

328
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,520
but...

329
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,760
Wait.

330
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,780
What did you say?

331
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,340
Being pretty is useless here.

332
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,920
Well.

333
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,080
It's about playing.

334
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,920
Skills are what matters, right?

335
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,760
What good is being pretty?

336
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,180
Come on, let's drink.

337
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,520
Quickly.

338
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,880
Drink.

339
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,160
You can't hold your liquor.

340
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,380
It's just a drink.

341
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,120

Tu Lingling asked you

358
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,500
who the person you like is.

359
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,160
Aren't you afraid

360
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,180
she'll be disappointed by your answer?

00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,900

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,720
why I said

363
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,020
I love my mom the most?

364
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,920
Why?

365
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,100
Say it backward in Chinese,

366
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,340
and it means...

367
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,200
Shao Nian,

368
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,660
there's juice here. Want some?

369
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,400
- Thank you.
- What?

370
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Continue.

371
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,260
What does that mean?

372
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,120
It's nothing.

373
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,880
I can't drink anymore.

374
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,820
No, no.

375
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,280
I've only given you one glass.

376
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,120
Can't drink it?

377
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,700
- Wait a minute.
- Gao!

378
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,180
Did he drink too much?

379
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,340
Who knows?

380
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,700
- Come on.
- No more drinking.

381
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,960
Gao Ge.

382
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,980
Gao Ge, wait a minute.

383
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,740
- You're wasting all the alcohol.
- Slow down!

384
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,820
Come on.

385
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,360
You have to finish this drink today.

386
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,540
Let's go upstairs.

387
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,880
- Wait a minute.
- Wait for me.

388
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,980
- Alright.
- Duoduo.

389
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,440
Do you think you've improved

390
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,280
since joining Xingang?

391
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,560
It's just physical fitness.

392
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,660
How could I have improved?

393
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,340
Why do you ask?

394
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,530
If I hadn't left you then,

395
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,240
it wouldn't be Long Ya training

396
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,860
with me now, but you.

397
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,860
What's the point of saying this now?

398
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,560
If I didn't leave you,

399
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
you wouldn't meet Weilan,

400
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,420
such a good partner.

401
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,260
So, apologies aside,

402
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,080
you still gained something.

403
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,400
So, I should congratulate you.

404
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,420
Congratulate me for what?

405
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,320
For getting into Xingang?

406
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,970
Or for never finding a good coach?

407
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,080
- Not really.
- You're enjoying my misfortune.

408
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,480
Why would I enjoy your misfortune?

409
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,160
Your coach is from the NYT.

410
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,920
You must have some extra lessons.

411
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,660
What extra lessons?

412
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,280
Duo.

413
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,520
Focus on our training.

414
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,680
Don't let others know

415
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,400
about our coach's tricks, right?

416
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,240
Exactly.

417
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,000
Let's go.

418
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,680
This way.

419
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,240
This way.

420
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,220
You've started.

421
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,400
You drank so much,

422
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,820
yet you came early today.

423
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,960
Drank too much?

424
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,260
That phrase doesn't exist in my dictionary.

425
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,960
Still denying it?

426
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,500
You and Gao Ge yesterday...

427
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,260
I almost took a picture as evidence.

428
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,400
Look at you guys.

429
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,560
Took a picture?

430
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,040
I didn't say anything

431
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,300
about you two being so lovey-dovey.

432
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,200
Standing around? Train!

433
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,040
Alright.

434
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,360
When you serve,

435
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,400
it's still like before.

436
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,280
No strength.

437
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,400
A bit floaty.

438
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,450
Tu Lingling,

439
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,580
what are you planning?

440
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,220
I'm here to give you an extra lesson.

441
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,100
I'm going to serve.

442
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,340
Seriously, Lingling.

443
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
Our coordination today was perfect.

444
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,240
If we can do this tomorrow,

445
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,420
we'll definitely get in.

446
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,780
Absolutely.

447
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,660
We'll dominate the court.

448
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,580
Today, my partner is Long Ya.

449
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,220
You're not taking the exam with me?

450
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,880
Today, I must get

451
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,080
into Ocean University.

452
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,960
So, I need

453
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,160
a stronger partner.

454
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,000
You know

455
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,320
your weaknesses very well.

456
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,200
We can't partner up forever.

457
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,520
After we start university,

458
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,340
we'll still need to change partners.

459
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,160
Mom.

460
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,380
I've been busy these days.

461
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,900
I just saw the credit card bill.

462
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,500
You better come back and explain it to me.

463
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,760
Or I'll go to Yuzhou Island

464
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,980
to get you.

465
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,120
Mom, how did you know where I am?

466
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,620
Don't worry about that.

467
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,860
Sweetie,

468
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,740
you can't escape my watch.

469
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,300
You'd better come back.

470
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,420
- If I don't see you,
- Again!

471
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,540
you'll definitely see me on the island.

472
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,800
Mom.

473
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,140
I'm still your mom.

474
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,760
Tell me.

475
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,340
What's Tu Lingling really up to?

476
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,180
She's been overly friendly these days.

477
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,660
When Chen Weilan's not around,

478
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,140
she voluntarily practices with me.

479
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,420
You know.

480
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,660
I kind of felt like we were

481
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,580
back in the old days.

482
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,980
Good thing you realized it.

483
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,860
Have you noticed?

484
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,160
As long as Shao Nian is around,

485
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,720
Tu Lingling will come to you

486
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,220
and use the chance to talk to him.

487
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,240
She's clearly more interested

488
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,340
in Shao Nian than in you.

489
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,600
I guess

490
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,800
if Shao Nian weren't around,

491
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,180
she wouldn't bother with you.

492
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,300
What are you thinking?

493
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,700
Don't be silly.

494
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,080
Don't tell me you want

495
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,740
to be best friends with her again.

496
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,400
How is that possible?

497
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,700
We're rivals now.

498
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,240
Who is it?

499
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,440
Hello.

500
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,440
Xiaojing.

501
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,040
I'm looking for Duo.

502
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,200
Xiaojing.

503
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,860
How did you know I was here?

504
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,240
Not many people have a voice

505
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,700
as distinctive as yours.

506
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,640
Xiaojing.

507
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,780
What do you need?

508
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,700
I'm just here to remind you.

509
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,980
Tu Lingling seems to have ulterior motives.

510
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,560
I'm worried

511
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,940
she's using you

512
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,000
to spy on our training style.

513
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,520
Haven't you noticed

514
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,400
she always asks

515
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,520
about our training methods?

516
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,760
Be careful.

517
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,860
Don't share too much with her.

518
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,120
Right, Xiaojing.

519
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,200
It makes sense.

520
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,820
I was wondering about it.

521
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,400
She keeps asking about the coach

522
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,740
or the training methods.

523
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,180
She's definitely gathering info.

524
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,900
Did Coach Tian put her up to it?

525
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,700
I think

526
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,700
her main target is Shao Nian.

527
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,820
Does she want both?

528
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,920
Shao Nian

529
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,620
and spying on us?

530
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,800
This Tu Lingling

531
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,260
is really something.

532
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,140
We have to be careful around her.

533
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,100
It's possible.

534
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,480
After all, we're rivals.

535
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,060
If that's the case, it's scary.

536
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,720
Anyway,

537
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,120
be cautious around her.

538
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,820
The league is a big deal.

539
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,280
What are you doing?

540
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,380
Don't you want to practice?

541
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,580
I can't anymore.

542
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,560
Practice dribbling.

543
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,600
One hundred times.

544
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,540
Stop looking. Keep practicing.

545
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,160
Coach.

546
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,560
You can't

547
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,280
keep training us like this.

548
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,880
I can barely stand it anymore.

549
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,000
If this keeps up,

550
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,880
we'll all turn into dried fish.

551
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,720
Yeah, Coach, I'm exhausted.

552
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,900
I can't take it anymore.

553
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,570
Oh, my!

554
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,260
What did I see?

555
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,320
This is incredible!

556
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,480
If this happened in a match...

557
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,460
What's incredible?

558
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,520
What match?

559
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,280
You're tired too?

560
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,340
Alright, take a break.

561
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,920
Xia Liqiang.

562
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,740
Come over here.

563
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,960
Are you okay?

564
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,540
I think Coach Lu's training is fine.

565
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,740
With your strength now...

566
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,420
Don't joke around with me.

567
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,720
By the way,

568
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,340
where's my mascot?

569
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,920
At this time,

570
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,500
he should be bouncing around you.

571
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,620
He's gone.

572
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,580
Gone?

573
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,400
You're still here.

574
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,540
How could he be gone?

575
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,920
He's really gone.

576
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,080
He texted me this morning.

577
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,920
I saw it.

578
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,870
Duoduo,

579
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,480
are you distracted during training

580
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,440
because of Shao Nian?

581
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,280
No.

582
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,380
Duoduo, Duoduo.

583
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,620
Just wait and see.

584
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,760
As soon as Shao Nian leaves,

585
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,080
Tu Lingling's attitude towards you

586
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,980
will definitely change completely.

587
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,440
The time has come

588
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,260
to prove my theory about love.

589
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,940
Mom, I'm back.

590
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,680
Mom,

591
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,880
where did you get your hair done?

592
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,020
It looks so good!

593
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,900
That was last month.

594
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,920
Mom, you take good care of yourself.

595
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,840
Your hair still looks great

596
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,860
after a month.

597
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,120
So nice.

598
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,060
Don't sweet-talk me.

599
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,880
How long has it been

600
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,980
since you came home?

601
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,600
My studies have been so busy.

602
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,140
It's your fault for choosing this major.

603
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,420
It's super busy.

604
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,620
Still have the nerve to talk about studies?

605
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,560
Prof. Qin told me

606
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,240
your attendance has been low.

607
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,700
You might have to repeat the year.

608
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,740
Why does Prof. Qin tell you everything?

609
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,260
Are you dating someone

610
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,380
and neglecting your studies?

611
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,140
Did he say that too?

612
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,300
No, he didn't say that.

613
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,180
The credit card bill was sent to me.

614
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,740
Every expense you made on the island

615
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,380
is recorded clearly.

616
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,400
You withdrew 20,000 yuan

617
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,880
and used the card on the island.

618
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,720
Tell me.

619
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,100
How much did you spend?

620
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,600
Mom, I'm just exhausted from studying.

621
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,900
I went out to relax.

622
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,240
Skipping class is tiring.

623
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,080
Right?

624
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,500
No, Mom.

625
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,640
Well.

626
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,360
I bought some things I wanted.

627
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,540
Did some things I wanted to do.

628
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,380
I bought some paints

629
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,740
and went to the island to paint.

630
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,920
Are paints that expensive?

631
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,040
Of course.

632
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,880
The paints I bought are imported,

633
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,080
made from grinding,

634
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,100
very high quality.

635
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,320
How about I paint you something

636
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,280
for your office?

637
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,120
Sweetie,

638
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,680
I don't want to lecture you.

639
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,720
Your third year is coming.

640
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,560
Can you focus

641
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,640
on your studies?

642
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,260
Don't be distracted by those things.

643
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,800
Alright, Mom.

644
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,680
I'll stay at home and think about it.

645
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,740
Don't get angry.

646
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,160
Mom.

647
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,300
I won't stop you from dating,

648
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,360
but you know

649
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,780
our situation.

650
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,600
I'm a single mom.

651
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,440
It's not easy.

652
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,660
This family

653
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,500
relies on you in the future.

654
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,180
I understand, Mom.

655
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,240
Good.

656
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,140
I made some soup for you.

657
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,500
I'll get it.

658
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,600
Thanks, Mom.

659
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,760
Naughty boy.

660
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,300
Scared me.

661
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,060
(Tian Qing: Grab a drink at the bar?)

662
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,790
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

663
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,380
Coach Tian, you look so beautiful.

664
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,820
Did you dress up

665
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,740
just for our date?

666
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,440
I didn't dress up.

667
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,180
But you're wearing perfume, right?

668
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,540
It's a niche and special perfume?

669
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,340
I just took a shower with soap.

670
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,410
Soap?

671
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,380
Then it's your natural scent.

672
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,740
Smells good.

673
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,100
Smells so good.

674
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,600
Coach Lu,

675
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,500
I have something serious to discuss today.

676
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,940
Coincidentally, so do I.

677
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,220
- I want...
- I want...

678
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,240
- You go.
- You first.

679
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,780
- When did you join the NYT?
- Do you like me?

680
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,580
From appearance,

681
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,300
speech,

682
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,820
and personality.

683
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,800
Do you think

684
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,920
I fit the image

685
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,260
of a Prince Charming?

686
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,300
Honestly, Coach Lu,

687
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,740
I don't have an image of a Prince Charming.

688
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
That's good.

689
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,940
With no one in your heart,

690
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,660
I still have a chance.

691
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
I'll be straightforward, Coach Lu.

692
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,760
Alright.

693
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,280
I have many friends

694
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,300
who coach in the National Youth Team.

695
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,180
Their training methods

696
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,860
are different from yours.

697
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,280
You've been with the Team

698
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,120
for quite some time.

699
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,460
Do you have a special training method?

700
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,360
Well.

701
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,760
There's nothing special.

702
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,900
I just follow the principles of sports science

703
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,100
and focus on physical fitness.

704
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,800
Then you must have heard

705
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,260
of the functional training method.

706
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,180
What's your opinion on it?

707
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,280
Yes.

708
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,100
That's a good question.

709
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,340
It involves the muscle cross-bridge mechanism.

710
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,300
This mechanism.

711
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,320
Coach Tian.

712
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,020
I've never heard of it.

713
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,240
You've never heard of it?

714
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,360
(No way!)

715
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,720
(How could he not know?)

716
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,000
(Even I know the answer.)

717
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,480
(The basic muscle node training)

718
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,940
(and functional strength training.)

719
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,760
Coach Lu,

720
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,500
are you looking down on me?

721
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,600
No.

722
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,940
Why aren't you talking with me seriously?

723
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,420
Why would I?

724
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,320
As a coach of the NYT,

725
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
you haven't heard

726
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,460
of such a basic principle?

727
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,380
- I...
- You're sincere at all.

728
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,940
Coach Tian, wait for me to finish...

729
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
(Li)

730
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,620
(Dad, why are you calling now?)

731
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,040
What are you doing?

732
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,680
Coach.

733
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,940
Well.

734
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,120
I'm passing by.

735
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,320
Passing by.

736
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,720
Handsome.

737
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,520
Really?

738
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
The position

739
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,680
wasn't quite right.

740
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,520
- Should've been higher, right?
- It's okay.

741
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,700
- Higher.
- Have some water.

742
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,200
Not bad. You're improving a lot.

743
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,060
Wait, aren't you guys training?

744
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,640
Why do you have time to watch us

745
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,540
and gather info?

746
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,480
Is this Coach Tian's strategy?

747
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,960
What info would I gather?

748
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,240
We're training in the same place.

749
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,540
It's hard not to see.

750
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,360
Aren't you getting close to me

751
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,860
to gather info on our tactics?

752
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,900
You misunderstood me.

753
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,840
I'm indeed interested

754
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,980
in your training

755
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,000
because I've never seen a coach

756
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,460
focus solely on fitness.

757
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,500
But I'm more interested in you.

758
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,600
When Shao Nian isn't around,

759
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,300
you play with great explosiveness.

760
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,420
But when he's around,

761
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,700
you're like a flower needing care.

762
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,440
What do you mean?

763
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,280
I don't understand.

764
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,300
You don't understand?

765
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,180
Then we'll see on the court.

766
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,380
Fine, see you on the court.

767
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,800
I'm telling you.

768
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,140
I really want to beat her.

769
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,100
She's too arrogant.

770
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,920
Honestly, I knew she was coming,

771
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,320
and I thought I must finish

772
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,520
the match from last time

773
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,620
and teach her a lesson.

774
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,000
But in today's training,

775
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
I noticed Yan Xiaojing.

776
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,080
I underestimated her before.

777
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,960
I thought she wasn't that good,

778
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,440
since we were asked

779
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,420
to go easy on her.

780
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,250
Turns out she's got some skills.

781
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
This beef is delicious.

782
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,720
You should try some.

783
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,080
It's good.

784
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,600
Weilan.

785
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,280
Weilan.

786
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,860
Can you

787
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,580
join me...

788
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,190
I'm talking to you.

789
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,040
I'm asking you.

790
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,580
Look at me. Seriously.

791
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,180
Are you asking for my opinion?

792
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,620
Haven't you given me a challenge?

793
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,020
So you agreed?

794
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,020
Did I say that?

795
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,180
Weilan,

796
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,810
you're the best.

797
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,800
You're the best.

798
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,640
Weilan.

799
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,180
Even if I agree,

800
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,460
will the coach agree?

801
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,500
(Volleyball Training Guide)

802
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,100
Coach.

803
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,200
Chen Weilan finally agreed

804
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,400
to me.

805
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,140
Please approve us.

806
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,520
Coach.

807
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,140
The book is upside down.

808
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,440
Duoduo.

809
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,940
You and Weilan

810
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,260
are great.

811
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,680
But Yan Xiaojing and Mo Xixi,

812
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,000
whether in terms of experience

813
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,360
or skill,

814
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,300
have a higher chance of winning.

815
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,440
We can't lose this match.

816
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,280
Coach,

817
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,740
I think

818
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,880
Tu Lingling

819
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,400
wants to use

820
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,880
this match

821
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,800
to probe

822
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,900
our real strength.

823
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,860
To be honest,

824
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,640
Tu Lingling has been

825
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,460
trying to gather info on us.

826
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,040
She's been trying every possible way

827
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,580
to find out our tactics.

828
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,320
If we send

829
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,840
the two seniors out,

830
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,880
we'll just fall

831
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,020
into their trap.

832
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,440
If we send me

833
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,040
and Chen Weilan,

834
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,180
we can achieve two things.

835
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,300
First, we can get great practice.

836
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,680
Second, we can find out

837
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,740
their info.

838
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,000
Coach.

839
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,940
What's our ultimate goal?

840
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,240
The Seven-School League.

841
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,360
Right.

842
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,100
Our goal is the league.

843
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,840
So we should save

844
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,580
these two aces for the final.

845
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,500
Isn't that more meaningful?

846
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,500
And Coach,

847
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,900
Chen Weilan and I won't lose.

848
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,340
You have a point.

849
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,240
You're that confident?

850
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,080
Of course.

851
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,540
Leave it to me.

852
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,140
The coach agreed?

853
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,180
That's for sure.

854
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,640
With me stepping in,

855
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,500
how could he not agree?

856
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,900
What did you say?

857
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,260
I made a bold promise.

858
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,900
We'll definitely win.

859
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,860
I don't think so.

860
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,220
We'll rise to the challenge.

You've been holding your phone all night.

If you want to call him,

876
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,540
just do it.

877
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,180
How did you know I wanted to call Shao Nian?

878
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,720
I never said who you wanted to call.

879
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,580
You just admitted it.

880
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,000
Chen Weilan,

881
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,140
you've turned naughty.

882
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,580
I've been spending too much time with you.

883
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,080
With me?

884
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
How did I turn naughty?

885
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,460
I'm not naughty at all.

886
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,600
Alright, alright.

887
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,060
You're not naughty.

888
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,000
You're just

889
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,280
caught up

890
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,860
in some feelings.

891
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,220
Where's the bold you?

892
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,640
Who's caught up in feelings?

893
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,520
I don't even like him.

894
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,020
Why would I call him?

895
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,280
Besides, I'm the captain.

896
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,880
I have too much to do

897
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,760
to bother with these lovesick feelings.

898
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,120
Yes, yes.

899
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm the captain.

900
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,320
I don't have time to like anyone.

901
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,380
I have too much on my plate.

902
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,960
So dramatic.

903
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,000
Shut up!

904
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,440
How's it going?

905
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,180
Nothing serious, right?

906
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:41,780
(How's it going? Nothing serious, right?)

907
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,380
It's fine. Just train well. Don't worry.

908
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,720
Weilan and I

909
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,660
have a match against Tu Lingling tomorrow.

910
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,020
Do your best!

911
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,140
Do your best!

912
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,300
Now,

913
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,340
let's discuss our tactics.

914
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,660
Mr. Strategist.

915
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,940
Sure. Go on.

916
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,700
(What's your plan for tomorrow?
Let me give you some advice.)

917
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,580
(We'll use the strategy that we trained.)

918
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,540
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

919
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,620
Go for it!

920
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,860
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

921
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,040
Go for it!

922
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,400
Go for it!

924
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,200
Go for it!

925
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,960
- Great!
- Go for it!

926
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,660
Awesome!

927
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,820

Great!

930
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,400
- Great!
- Go for it!

931
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,440
- Tu Lingling, you're the best!
- Go for it!

932
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,080
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

933
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,920
Go for it!

934
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:41,960
It's okay. Stay calm.

935
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,320
- Don't panic.
