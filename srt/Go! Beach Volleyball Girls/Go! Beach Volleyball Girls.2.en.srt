Ms. Wang Yun,

30
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,160
to present the award to them.

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,920
Everyone,

32
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,040
after three months of exciting competition,

33
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,940
our National Middle School

Volleyball Tournament

35
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,760
has finally come to an end.

36
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,100
The Tianjin No.1 Middle School team

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,460
made their way all the way

38
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,300
from the group stage to the national finals.

39
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,240
Throughout the journey,

40
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,940
they fought through many challenges.

41
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,940
Though they did not

42
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,060
win the championship,

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,200
we believe

44
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,000
they are honorable in defeat.

45
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,260
At this moment,

46
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,820
let's give another round of applause

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,720

48
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,000
Congratulations to them.

50
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,020
This moment on the podium

51
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,920
is not only a recognition of their achievements

52
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,620
but also an encouragement

53
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,320
for their future volleyball dreams.

54
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,740
We also wish each of our athletes

55
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,980
a bright future

56
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,220
in volleyball,

57
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,520
reaching greater heights.

58
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,520
Alright, everyone.

59
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,100

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,420
the Beijing No. 8 Middle School team.

63
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,020
Please welcome our female warriors

64
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,200
to the stage to receive their awards.

65
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,780
Next, please welcome

66
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,740
the organizing committee leader, Mr. Wang Ping,

67
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,780
to present the award to them.

68
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,040
A round of applause, please.

69
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,930
Thank you.

70
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,580
Alright, everyone.

71
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,820
After three months of thrilling competition,

72
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,220
our Beijing No. 8 Middle School team,

73
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,620
through their relentless efforts,

74
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,140
left behind much sweat and tears.

75
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,420
I believe at this moment,

76
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,580
their glory is well-deserved.

77
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,940
This stage

78
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,300
is worthy of them.

79
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,140
This stage

80
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,620
belongs to the Beijing
No. 8 Middle School team.

81
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,380
Let's give our warmest applause

82
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,760
to the Beijing No. 8 Middle School team.

83
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,900
Thank you.

84
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,180
Alright, once again, congratulations

85
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,820
to the Beijing No. 8 Middle School team.

86
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,660
Congratulations.

87
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,860
Alright, everyone,

88
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,180
Now, it's time

89
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,220
for the most exciting moment,

90
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,620
the announcement of the MVP

91
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,780
of this National Middle School

92
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,380
Volleyball Tournament.

93
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,040
Who will it be?

94
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,860
We are the champions.

95
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,400
Yes, it's great.

96
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,940
Everyone,

97
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,500
she is the captain
of the Tianjin No.1 Middle School team,

98
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,940
Lang Yueting.

99
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,240
Applause for her!

100
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,400
A warm round of applause for Lang Yueting.

101
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,260
Next, please welcome our

102
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,340
organizing committee director, Ms. Wang Yun,

103
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,620
to present

104
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,940
the MVP award trophy

105
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,360
to Lang Yueting.

106
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,120
With the highest score in the entire event,

107
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,120
she's sure to join the National Youth Team.

108
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,380
Let's hurry and cozy up to her.

109
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,520
Soon, we won't have a chance to play with her.

110
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,660
Great job.

111
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,400
Congratulations!

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,640
- Coach.
- Weilan.

113
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,300
Weilan.

114
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,700
I just asked

115
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,880
the coach of the National Youth Team.

116
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,000
This time,

117
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,080
they only want one

118
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,520
from our beach volleyball team.

119
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,840
It's Yang Liyun.

120
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,400
Why her and not me?

121
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,660
Why?

122
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,580
Also,

123
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm afraid your plan
about the Sports University...

124
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,220
Coach, we just won the match.

125
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,260
We won.

126
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,100
That's true.

127
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,260
- But...
- Then why?

128
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,100
They have their reasons.

129
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,200
Coach! Coach! Coach!

130
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,580
Excuse me, Coach.

131
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,950
You are from the National Youth Team, right?

132
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,900
Chen Weilan, right?

133
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,700
Congratulations, you played well today.

134
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,560
Thank you.

135
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,580
I just want to know

136
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,680
why you didn't choose me.

137
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,860
Why?

138
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,060
Chen Weilan,

139
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,520
I know you have great skills,

140
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,260
and you played well today.

141
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,100
But we have our own criteria

142
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,320
for selecting players.

143
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,580
We don't have

144
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,680
to explain it to you.

145
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,980
- Congratulations.
- No, Coach.

146
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,260
I understand you have standards,

147
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,060
- but I...
- Weilan.

148
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,950
Let's talk about this later.

149
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,140
Will it be clear later?

150
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,100
I just want to know why now.

151
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,200
How can they tell you directly?

152
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,840
Why can't they?

153
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,500
The competition's process and results

154
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,140
are fair, just, and open.

155
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,420
Why can't I know now?

156
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,320
Chen Weilan,

157
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,860
you're very talented,

158
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,840
and you have a lot of potential.

159
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,100
But volleyball is a team sport, remember?

160
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,180
In the indoor six-player match,

161
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,800
you didn't cooperate
with your teammates at all.

162
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,820
When did I not cooperate?

163
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,220
The beach volleyball is a two-player sport.

164
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,500
You're not suitable.

165
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,600
How can they choose you?

166
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,400
Think about it yourself.

167
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,980
Lang Yueting.

168
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,750
The National Youth Team coaches
are waiting for you.

169
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,660
Go and say hello.

170
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,460
This is a rare opportunity.

171
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,400
Make the most of it.

172
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,320
Alright, Coach, I understand.

173
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,500
You're back.

174
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,680
I ordered some takeout for you.

175
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,320
I have an engagement tonight,

176
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,880
I'll probably be back around nine.

177
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,740
What's wrong?

178
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,000
Didn't win the championship?

179
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,280
I'm talking to you.

180
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,480
We won.

181
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,240
You won, and you're still upset?

182
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,480
The National Youth Team didn't select me.

183
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,480
Isn't that a good thing?

184
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,360
I don't want you to volleyball anyway.

185
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,580
You should focus

186
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,100
on preparing for the college entrance exam.

187
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,460
Get into a good university.

188
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,540
If that doesn't work,

189
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,560
I will send you abroad

190
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,380
to study something like finance

191
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,140
or law.

192
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,560
Isn't that better than playing volleyball?

193
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,850
Fine, I won't talk to you.

194
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,830
Remember to have dinner.

195
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,660
(Xiao: Let's hang out.)

196
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,180
Let's go.

197
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,440
Sorry, I'm late.

198
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,420
Such strength.

199
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,640
Did you see that?

200
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,140
You know.

201
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,800
It's rare for us to come to Beijing,

202
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,440
and we are watching volleyball here.

203
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,480
You still have the nerve to talk.

204
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,060
If it weren't for you,

205
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,360
we wouldn't be watching a broadcast.

206
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,120
Sorry, sorry.

207
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,240
- Nice!
- Good shot.

208
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,500
No, I meant

209
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,780
the girl is pretty.

210
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,640
You have good taste.

211
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,380
This one is the captain of the Tianjin team,

212
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,460
Lang Yueting.

213
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,300
You know her?

214
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,640
Let me tell you, Lang Yueting

215
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,400
is skilled in spiking and blocking.

216
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,020
Don't be down, alright?

217
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,340
- Let's have a drink.
- Come on, have a drink.

218
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,060
- It's not a big deal.
- Hello, here's the menu.

219
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,900
Okay, thank you.

220
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,460
Here,

221
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,460
nothing

222
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,700
can't be solved

223
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,920
with a good meal.

224
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,260
What do you want to eat?

225
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,200
It's on me.

226
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,420
You go.

227
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,360
Alright.

228
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,700
Order then.

229
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,560
Such explosive power.

230
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,700
Waiter, the remote.

231
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,540
Alright.

232
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,600
Let's see what to eat.

233
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,140
Geez.

234
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,020
What kind of angle is the director showing?

235
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,940
The National Youth Team didn't select her.

236
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,160
Why focus on her?

237
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,080
It's called sympathizing with the underdog.

238
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,680
Makes sense.

239
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,460
Come on. Why did you turn it off?

240
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,140
What's wrong?

241
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,580
Talking bad about someone behind their back,

242
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,150
aren't you afraid of getting sores
in your mouth?

243
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,960
Watch your mouth.

244
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,080
So you're the only one who can talk?

245
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,680
Who are you talking to?

246
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,240
I'm talking to you.

247
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,680
What's going on?

248
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,040
Aren't you the one from the TV just now?

249
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,160
You're not good.

250
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,160
Careful. Get up.

251
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,340
Are you okay?

252
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,500
Sir, please stop it.

253
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,340
- Come here.
- He's bleeding. Stop fighting.

254
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
Sir.

255
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,520
I've got it all recorded.

256
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,980
- Still fighting, huh?
- What are you recording?

257
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,780
- What are you recording?
- I'll upload it online.

258
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,890
- Give me the phone.
- Stop recording.

259
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,900
Delete it.

260
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,220
- What are you recording?
- Stop recording.

261
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,580
Delete it.

262
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,380
- What are you recording?
- Recording you hitting people.

263
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,300
Don't touch me.

264
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,720
- Sir, please stop.
- You wait and see.

265
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,860
He's bleeding.

266
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,700
You're injured, sir.

267
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,820
- Don't touch me.
- Sir.

268
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,960
Here's my ID card. I'll pay whatever it costs.

269
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,320
- Make sure to come back.
- We will.

270
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,860
How can you fight him?

271
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,940
- Look at you.
- Wait.

272
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,820
What now?

273
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,060
Do you want me to call the police?

274
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,060
What?

275
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,140
Want to hit a girl?

276
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,000
Didn't have enough?

277
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,480
Delete the video.

278
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,100
Video?

279
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,080
This is evidence. Why should I delete it?

280
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,760
My friend is hurt badly.

281
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,720
You apologize first.

282
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,200
Apologize?

283
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,340
Why should I?

284
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,940
Because you hit him first.

285
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,160
What if we don't apologize?

286
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,740
Wait.

287
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,920
Still want to fight?

288
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,060
Fine.

289
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,780
I'll apologize.

290
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,160
I'm sorry.

291
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,480
Say it to him.

292
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm sorry.

293
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,820
What about him?

294
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,980
I'm sorry.

295
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,760
Look at how badly he's hurt.

296
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,240
Let's go to the hospital. After it's done,

297
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,840
I'll delete the video.

298
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,560
Ow.

299
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,260
Can you stop moaning?

300
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,400
You've been moaning all night.

301
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,180
I stood up for you today.

302
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,360
Can't I moan a little?

303
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,860
I've been covering for you in fights
since we were kids.

304
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,700
- Of course, you'd do it for me.
- This isn't covering.

305
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,360
Today was a heroic rescue.

306
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,060
Chen Weilan.

307
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,400
Auntie, hello.

308
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,160
Did you call my mom?

309
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,900
Instead of staying home and studying,

310
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,040
you ran out to cause trouble.

311
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,180
If I hadn't been dining with Liang's mom,

312
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,240
I wouldn't have known anything.

313
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,960
Get in the car, both of you.

314
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,720
Okay, thank you, Auntie.

315
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,200
That girl ran off.

316
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,720
She didn't delete the video, did she?

317
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,640
How are you?

318
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,860
I'm fine.

319
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,320
All for you.

Is this Chen Weilan?

324
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,680
I'm from Xingang University.

325
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,180
We watched your match

326
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,660
and think you are

327
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,560
a very talented volleyball player.

328
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,340
We'd like to invite you

329
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,860
to join us as a special recruit,

330
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,840
without the entrance exam.

331
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,540
Xingang University

332
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,500
has a very strong foundation

333
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,400
in volleyball.

334
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,800
I hope you can join us at Xingang University

335
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,240
and develop well.

Mom, I've made up my mind.

340
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,400
I'm going to Xingang
to continue playing volleyball.

341
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,480
I won't go abroad with you.

342
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,680
I will prove myself to you.

Li Guoduo,

345
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,040
your package.

346
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,580
Coming.

347
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,140
Here I am.

348
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,580
- Hello.
- Your package.

349
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,440
- Please sign here.
- Okay.

350
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,900
- She really got in.
- Come, come.

351
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,280
Come here, quickly.

352
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,380
Okay, thank you.

353
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,220
You're welcome.

354
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,400
Close the door.

355
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,640
Guoduo's admission letter is here.

356
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,080
I think

357
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,920
we'll have to pay the tuition fee.

358
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,440
Maybe we should let Zhang go.

359
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,800
That way, we can save some money.

360
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:38,900
Alright.

361
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,580
We can manage during the day.

362
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,880
Duoduo can help out at night.

363
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,180
After all, her education is the most important.

364
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,420
We should save wherever we can.

365
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,900
I'm just worried about your leg

366
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,260
that it might hurt again.

367
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,040
What can I do about it?

368
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,400

00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,930
Shh.

00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,540
What's up?

371
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,000
I got in.

What a coincidence. Look at this.

with CNY 10,000 for the champion.

380
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,460
- 10,000 Yuan?
- Yes!

381
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,200
(Beach Volleyball League)
Such a great opportunity.

382
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,780
But

383
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,040
I can't participate.

384
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,400
Are you going to turn down the money?

385
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,960
Why can't you participate?

386
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,760
Who would be my partner?

(The Three-Body Problem)

388
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,460
Gao, why are you reading a novel

389
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,990
instead of playing beach volleyball?

390
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
Do you want to play?

391
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,400
Stop it.

392
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,020
Cheer up.

393
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,280
I came today with good news for you.

394
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,820
I heard that Jin Yun Hotel

395
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,290
is hosting a beach volleyball challenge.

396
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,480
Are you interested?

397
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:07,940
By the way,

398
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,140
there's a cash prize for the winner.

399
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,800
Of course, I'm interested.

400
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,560
But Xia seems busy lately.

401
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,660
I don't have a partner.

402
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,720
I've found a partner for you.

403
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,540
You?

404
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,520
Can you bump the ball?

405
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,800
It's not me.

406
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,500
Then who?

407
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,960
Li Guoduo, remember her?

408
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,860
Your junior.

409
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,700
Yeah.

410
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,620
- It's her?
- What about her?

411
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,120
She's been playing beach volleyball for years.

412
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,420
Is that so?

413
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,000
She's good.

414
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,580
To stick with a sport
she doesn't have talent in

415
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,800
for so many years is impressive.

416
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,980
Can you stop saying such hurtful things?

417
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,000
One word, are you in or not?

418
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,660
Duoduo.

419
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,780
Hold on.

420
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,300
Let me introduce you.

421
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,440
My good friend, beach volleyball god, Gao Ge.

422
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,180
Gao Ge.

423
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,300
I know you.

424
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,320
I'm Li Guoduo.

425
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,420
I'll serve three balls.

426
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,360
If you can receive one,

427
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,280
I'll agree to be your partner.

428
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,740
That's just how he is.

429
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,700
Go for it.

430
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,420
Come on.

431
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,340
Are you okay?

432
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,640
I'm fine. Let's go again.

433
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,580
Go for it.

434
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,780
Come on.

435
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,580
Good.

436
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,800
Duoduo, are you okay?

437
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,940
I'm fine.

438
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,020
Come on.

439
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,560
Your defense is quite flexible.

440
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,420
See you in three days

441
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,460
on the court.

442
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,740
Great!

443
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,660
Practice more.

444
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,100
We don't have much time.

445
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,000
Don't worry. I won't let you down.

446
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,760
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

Good.

465

Her bumping isn't very professional.

466
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,820
I mean her bumping

467
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,820
isn't very professional.

That's why not every champion

486

can succeed.

- Weilan.
- is there anyone

- Weilan.
- who wants to challenge?

- then we will announce...
- Wait.

497
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,280
Isn't this Chen Weilan?

498
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,840
Who's Chen Weilan?

499
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,260
Apologize.

500
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,260
Alright.

501
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,120
Beat me if you can.

502
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,820
Do you dare?

503
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,260
I'll do it.

504
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,760
Sorry, what did you say?

505
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,180
I'll challenge.

You want to challenge our champion?

507

Who is your partner?

508
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,060
Him.

509
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,120
You want to partner with him?

510
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,820
With you.

511
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,680
Me?

512
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,540
I've never played beach volleyball.

513
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,380
You want me as a partner?

Yes.

is challenging our champion.

Come on!

521
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,120
They're really good.

522
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,900
I've never played beach volleyball.

523
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,640
I've only watched it. I really can't play.

524
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,260
Have you seen a spike?

525
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,260
I've seen it.

526
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,260
Try it.

527
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,800
Use some strength.

528
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,740
That's about right.

529
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,260
Later,

530
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,580
I'll set the ball for you.

531
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,080
You just spike it.

532
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,020
Don't hold back.

533
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,880
Aim for Shao Nian.

534
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,300
He's never played.

535
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,140
That's not very nice.

536
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,660
This is a competition.

537
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,480
You came to win.

538
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,940
Let's go.

539
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,780
We can definitely win.

540
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,620
Let's go.

541
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,820
(This is the first time)

542
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,320
(Scoreboard)
(I've stood on the same court as Chen Weilan.)

543
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,280
(I never thought)

544
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,740
(I would form)

545
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,840
(such a bond with her.)

546
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,220
(The beach volleyball ball)

547
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,680
(is different from the indoor volleyball one.)

548
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,420
(The surface is softer,)

549
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,480
(and the size is different too.)

550
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,580
(I'm not sure if I can adapt)

551
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,600
(to this ball quickly.)

552
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,820
(Oh, no.)

553
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,080
(The sand is so soft I can't even jump.)

554
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,900
Playing on sand is different from indoors.

555
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,860
You might not have adapted yet.

556
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,240
Especially with spikes,
they're hard to receive.

557
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,320
But keep it up.

558
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,940
Beat me once,

559
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,100
and you win.

560
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,800
Come on, come on.

561
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,680
(I saw how skilled Chen Weilan was.)

562
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,840
(In an unfamiliar setting,)

563
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,100
(she quickly found her rhythm,)

564
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,280
(found her strength,)

565
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,800
(and completed a spike.)

566
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,160
(With such a beautiful curve,)

567
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,360
(Chen Weilan scores.)

568
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,660
Great!

569
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,120
Bravo!

570
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,780
Nice shot.

571
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,540
My granddaughter! My granddaughter!

572
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,740
My granddaughter!

573
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,700
Because earlier,

574
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,040
both teams agreed

575
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,460
- whoever scores this point
- Good, good.

576
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,280
wins the match.

577
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,960
She's amazing.

578
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,360
Still thinking about praising others?

579
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,280
Didn't you see the ball coming right at you?

580
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,900
Why don't you work on your fitness

581
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,740
a bit more?

582
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,840
I know that's my weak spot.

583
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,440
What? You hit me earlier.

584
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,660
We're even now.

585
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,840
You only scored one point.

586
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,060
Don't be smug.

587
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,740
A sore loser?

588
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,240
I didn't even ask you to apologize.

589
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,440
I'm a sore loser?

590
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,240
I'm not like some people

591
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,800
who won the match

592
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,280
but lost the most important thing.

593
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,460
(Beach Volleyball Challenge)

594
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,140
Gao.

595
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,580
Didn't you say you couldn't play?

596
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,420
You played really well.

597
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,600
I really can't play.

598
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,440
Champion and runner-up,
let's go get our awards.

599
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,280
Congratulations, you're the champion.

600
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,260
Hurry and get your award.

601
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,260
Champion! Champion! Come here.

602
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,100
This way, this way.

603
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,340
To the podium.

604
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,820
- Let's go.
- This way.

605
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,840
My granddaughter is here.

606
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,260
Great, great.

607
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,240
Amazing.

608
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,660
Weilan.

609
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,540
You played so well,

610
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,140
especially that last shot.

611
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,660
Smack! It was awesome.

612
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,460
I felt like I couldn't jump

613
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,700
in the sand.

614
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,900
And the wind direction.

615
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,740
I couldn't get it right.

616
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,820
Playing on sand

617
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,900
is definitely different

618
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,000
from playing indoors.

619
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,660
It's okay. Take it slow.

620
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,820
You'll adapt slowly.

621
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,660
Right?

622
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,660
Mainly,

623
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,780
you two coordinated really well today.

624
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,620
You know that?

625
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,660
Grandpa rarely praises me.

626
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,540
My granddaughter is the best.

627
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,640
Of course, I praise you.

(Jin Yun Hotel Opening Ceremony

630
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,140
to the stage

631
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,120

Mr. Wang and Mr. Zhang.

Please present the flowers

and the prize money

637
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,140
to our champions.

638
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,980
A round of applause!

00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,300
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

Here. Congratulations.

641
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,580
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, congratulations.

642
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:49,890
Thank you.

Let's have our award presenters

644
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,560
and our champion take a group photo.

645
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,020
Alright, everyone can take photos now.

646
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,080
At this time,

647
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,740
our journalist

648
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,900
can conduct interviews.

649
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,320
Come forward, come forward.

650
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,240
Did I play poorly today?

651
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,020
I feel like Gao Ge

652
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,560
might be a bit disappointed with me.

653
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,060
No.

654
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,620
Gao is just like that.

655
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,460
Don't take it to heart.

656
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,800
But I really didn't play well.

657
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,320
Even Tu Lingling said my strength isn't enough.

658
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,380
But

659
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,360
playing face-to-face with Chen Weilan today,

660
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,560
I really think she's impressive.

661
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,660
She plays indoor volleyball.

662
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,000
She's never played beach volleyball before.

663
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,660
The court was unfamiliar

664
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,700
to her,

665
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,800
yet she played so well.

666
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,420
I'm really

667
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,580
thousands of miles behind her.

668
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,940
Not thousands of miles behind.

669
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,790
Maybe just three or four miles.

670
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,900
After all,

671
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,780
geniuses are rare.

672
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,980
Don't be discouraged.

673
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,220
With your current effort,

674
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,800
you'll be just as good in the future.

675
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,800
Sure. I rise to the challenge.

676
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,380
Once I enter university,

677
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,280
I'll work even harder.

678
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,380
What's wrong?

679
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,120
I still haven't settled my university tuition.

680
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,720
Did you forget about that?

681
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,380
That's not right.

682
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,540
This is the prize money you won.

683
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,700
How can I take your money?

684
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,620
Why not?

685
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,740
It's the money you and Gao won.

686
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,660
It's rightfully yours.

687
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,580
Absolutely not. It's your money. I...

688
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,420
How about this?

689
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,340
Consider this money a loan from me.

690
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,760
It's also with Chen Weilan's approval.

691
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,920
And you have to write me an IOU.

692
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,140
It's home at last.

693
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,940
How long has it been since you visited me?

694
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,380
The flowers in the yard are blooming.

695
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,220
Yes.

696
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,700
Come on.

697
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,340
- Let me do it.
- It's fine.

698
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,460
- Let me do it.
- I can handle it.

699
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,780
- Really?
- I can handle it.

700
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
I'll help you.

701
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,800
I'm not that old.

702
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,820
I can't let you get tired.

703
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,660
Right?

704
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,020
Then I'll open the door.

705
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,860
Okay.

706
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,040
Alright, we're home.

707
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,640
Come in, come in.

708
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
Weilan, look.

709
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,580
Isn't your room decorated

710
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,800
even more beautifully than before?

711
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,920
Put it here.

712
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,480
So many more photos now.

713
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,600
So cozy.

714
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,720
No way, Grandpa.

715
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,220
You kept these certificates and trophies?

716
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,820
Of course.

717
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,960
They're the most important.

718
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,980
Do you remember this?

719
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,820
Look.

720
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,400
(Certificate)
Chen Weilan.

721
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,580
This was your first honor

722
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,520
in beach volleyball.

723
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,160
It's very precious.

724
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,480
Time flies.

725
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,820
In a blink, it's been over ten years.

726
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,940
Back then,

727
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,460
you were only six years old.

728
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,340
This tall.

729
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,920
My precious granddaughter.

730
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,300
I know

731
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
this time,

732
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,740
you missed out

733
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,680
on the National Youth Team,

734
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,100
and didn't get into the Sports University.

735
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,240
You must be feeling down.

736
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,680
But I'm happy to see

737
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,860
you're still pursuing

738
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,800
your dreams.

739
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,340
That's great.

740
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,620
You're still young.

741
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,320
As long as you persist, there's hope.

742
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,500
Yes.

743
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,140
I'm still persisting.

744
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,380
I must keep playing volleyball.

745
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,240
Of course.

746
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,060
Which one?

747
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,540
- This one.
- Check, please.

748
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,380
- Okay.
- Coming.

749
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,320
Help me with the check.

750
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,760
- How many skewers?
- Eat while it's hot.

751
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,380
Sure.

752
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,200
- How about this?
- Sure.

753
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,540
Alright.

754
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,580
I'm back.

755
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,580
Dad,

756
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,280
you rest. I'll take over.

757
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,120
Alright.

758
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,660
It's 176 in total.

759
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,980
Alright.

760
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,180
Paid.

761
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,210
- Okay.
- Take care.

762
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,460
Dad,

763
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,740
today you and Mom can close up early and rest.

764
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,900
Lately, you can take it easy.

765
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,740
No need to work so hard.

766
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,220
Rest?

767
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,160
Where will the tuition come from?

768
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,400
I've earned my tuition.

769
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,130
So, you and Mom

770
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,440
don't have to work so hard anymore.

771
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,040
Where did you get so much money?

772
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,960
I won it in a beach volleyball match.

773
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,460
So, you both

774
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,300
can take it easy.

775
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,640
No need to work from dawn to dusk.

776
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,820
And this.

777
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,380
They say this ointment works really well.

778
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,960
Try it. You'll be comfortable at night.

779
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,600
Such a good daughter we have.

780
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,260
You are

781
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,780
just like your mom,

782
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,400
spending money recklessly when you have some.

783
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,750
If you really care about me,

784
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,710
study hard and find a good job.

785
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,160
Got it.

786
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,260
Two more beers, please.

787
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,380
- Sure.
- Coming.

788
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,220
Wait a moment.

789
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,400
You put the money away. I'll go.

790
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,540
Coming.

791
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,180
Here are your beers.

792
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,020
Thank you.

(Beach Volleyball Practice Game

794
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,590
- Why don't you sign up?
- I should sign up too.

795
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,740
Yeah.

796
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,040
- Give it a try.
- Go and win the game.

Wait a moment.

798
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,160
Hello?

799
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,060
Hey, Xia.

800
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,900
Where are you?

801
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,520
In the cafeteria. What's up?

802
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,520
The province is organizing
a beach volleyball practice game.

803
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,740
Let's find Coach Wang

804
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,580
to sign us up.

805
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,140
Sure, wait for me.

806
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,100
Wait for me. I'm coming.

807
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,020
Alright, you finish eating first.

808
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,860
Don't forget.

809
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,080
What's the rush?

810
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,860
There's a competition soon.

811
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,700
I'm going to sign up.

812
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,060
You're in your fourth year.

813
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,840
Focus on your future.

814
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,780
Got it.

815
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,080
Xia Liqiang,

816
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,520
Jing,

817
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm off.

818
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,540
Well.

819
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,820
If you need anything, send me a WeChat message.

820
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,960
I promise to reply immediately.

821
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,880
Got it.

822
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,420
Alright.

823
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,540
Goodbye.

824
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,380
(Xingang University)

825
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,840
Coach, about the practice game...

826
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,860
Gao Ge, look.

827
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,280
You've made a lot of progress

828
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,120
this semester training with me.

829
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,300
Coach,

830
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,300
you deserve some credit for that.

831
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,560
But Gao has talent too.

832
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,920
He does have talent.

833
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,140
That's why I think

834
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,180
such practice games

835
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,020
aren't suitable for you.

836
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,220
Coach,

837
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,160
you can't stop us from competing.

838
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,700
You didn't let us participate

839
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,760
in last year's Seven-School League.

840
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,020
I know.

841
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,600
Last year, he was in his first year.

842
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,760
It would have only hurt his confidence.

843
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,620
Coach,

844
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,220
that's water under the bridge.

845
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,060
Forget about it.

846
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,640
But this time, both Xia and I

847
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,220
really want to participate

848
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,530
in this practice game.

849
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,420
Could you please support us?

850
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,900
Sure.

851
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,260
I'm your biggest supporter.

852
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,100
Right?

853
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,120
But still, like I said earlier.

854
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,220
I don't think those competitions

855
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,220
are right for you.

856
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,240
Participating won't benefit you.

857
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,780
But that's okay.

858
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,880
I've arranged something for you.

859
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,040
Go to the club and play some games,

860
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,620
alright?

861
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,480
There are top players there,

862
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,380
which will be very helpful

863
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,440
in improving your skills.

864
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,260
I have a friend

865
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,280
who runs a beach volleyball club.

866
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,600
You can go there, play,
and get some experience.

867
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,400
You can learn how to adapt soon.

868
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,250
You'll even earn some money.

869
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,500
How about that?

870
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,420
But Coach,

871
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,440
I'm starting my fourth year soon.

872
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,740
I have a lot of my own things to handle.

873
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,400
So, I won't go.

874
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,060
Alright.

875
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,980
You're not going.

876
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,140
You're graduating soon.

877
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,860
Gao Ge can go.

878
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,300
Me?

879
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,960
How can I play alone?

880
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,000
Don't worry.

881
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,540
With your skills,

882
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,640
they'll want to play with you.

883
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,130
Coach, I...

884
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,580
Alright.

885
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,540
Stop worrying.

886
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,320
It's settled.

887
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,540
Go back

888
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,960
and wait for my call.

889
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,340
Let's go.

890
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,360
- Alright.
- Okay.

891
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,660
Coach, goodbye.

892
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,620
Goodbye.

893
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,880
Why is Coach Wang so strange?

894
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,720
I heard

895
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,620
that the coaches at Ocean University

896
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,540
take students to participate

897
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,920
in various local tournaments.

898
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,140
But ours...

899
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,420
I don't know what he's thinking.

900
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,160
He insists on sending us to some club.

901
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,180
That's why

902
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,220
Ocean University's beach volleyball team

903
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,060
is thriving,

904
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,240
while ours at Xingang is declining.

905
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,020
Gao,

906
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,640
what are your plans for the summer?

907
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,220
Plans for what?

908
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,060
Resting, of course.

909
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,520
Rest? You're not playing?

910
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,040
It's vacation. Why play?

911
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,600
Since you went to Beijing,

912
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,260
you've stopped playing.

913
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,100
That's not like you.

914
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,620
I heard you had a practice game

915
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,860
planned for the summer.

916
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,700
You're not joining?

917
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,920
He won't let us participate.

918
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,280
Who won't let you participate?

919
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,440
Wang Dong.

920
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,760
Why won't he let you?

921
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,480
He doesn't want us in the practice game.

922
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,400
He insists we join a club competition.

923
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,800
Xia and I didn't agree.

924
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,700
Why should you, as students,

925
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,140
play in clubs?

926
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,120
Exactly.

927
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,980
He insists we participate

928
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,280
in those big competitions.

929
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,900
The real reason he doesn't let us

930
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,000
join the practice game

931
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,640
is because we don't follow his arrangements.

932
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,420
Let me tell you.

933
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,060
When I was a freshman,

934
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,180
two seniors were really good.

935
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,020
They told me

936
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,280
that because they didn't follow
Wang Dong's arrangements

937
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,500
and didn't participate

938
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,960
in those big competitions during vacation,

939
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,520
they were

940
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,800
sidelined in matches.

941
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,520
He just trained them.

942
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,880
They only joined

943
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,260
a Seven-School League match

944
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,120
before they graduated.

945
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,700
Shouldn't you talk to him properly?

946
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,540
Stop.

947
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,020
I have nothing

948
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,140
to say to him.

949
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,460
Come in.

950
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,420
Coach Wang.

951
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,620
Who are you?

952
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,080
I'm Shao Nian, Gao Ge's roommate.

953
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,260
What can I do for you?

954
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,220
I heard

955
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,600
there's a practice game coming up.

956
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,020
Gao mentioned

957
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,160
he really wants to join it.

958
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,940
I thought I'd come and ask

959
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,360
if you could give him a chance.

960
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,680
I've given him a chance.

961
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,620
I've told him before

962
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,220
to go play at the club

963
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,060
to get some experience.

964
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,080
It would improve his skills.

965
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,680
But he refuses.

966
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,960
He doesn't follow my arrangements.

967
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,520
What can I do?

968
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,340
Gao must have his reasons

969
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,780
for not going.

970
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,280
How could he not follow your arrangements?

971
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,820
You're his roommate?

972
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,660
Yes.

973
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:32,900
You know him well?

974
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,300
Of course.

975
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,660
Sometimes, Gao

976
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,300
is a bit hot-tempered,

977
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,520
but he's not the type to disregard
his coach's instructions.

978
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,300
Alright.

979
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,700
How about this?

980
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,320
Go back and talk to him.

981
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,800
Convince him to play at the club.

982
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,220
Alright?

983
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,070
If he can go,

984
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,460
he can play in the practice game.

985
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,460
Alright, thank you, Coach.

986
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,840
I'll go talk to Gao now.

987
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,100
Bro,

988
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,360
did you go see Wang Dong again?

989
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,540
Yeah.

990
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,340
You were upset.

991
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,200
I thought I'd go talk to him
and see if he'd be flexible.

992
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,020
Come on.

993
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,480
Why do you meddle in my business?

994
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,580
How is it meddling?

995
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,860
You were upset, right?

996
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,460
I just wanted to cheer you up.

997
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,560
Anyway, he's quite easy to talk to.

998
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,800
What's going on?

999
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,240
Did he say

1000
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,400
I should go play at some club?

1001
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:27,900
No.

1002
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,220
He said you could play a few games

1003
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,240
when you're free.

1004
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,720
He didn't say you had to play all the time.
