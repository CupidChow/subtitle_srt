18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,660
- Guoduo.
- Coach

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,800
Take a seat.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,640
Guoduo,

21
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,720
you called me here.

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,380
Have you made up your mind?

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,200
Yes, I want to give it a try.

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,040
Great!

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,420
I knew you'd choose this.

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,920
But to go pro,

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,220
(Contract)
you need to sign it.

28
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,480
Here's the contract.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,320
Take a look first.

30
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,260
Contract?

31
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,320
Yes.

32
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,300
If you have any

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,360
questions, ask me.

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,500
(Contract)
Take a look.

35
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,900
(Article 7: Termination of the Contract)

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,860
But there shouldn't be any problems.

37
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,520
All club players

38
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,700
sign this contract.

39
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,400
Sir,

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,660
your cake is ready.

41
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,720
Thank you.

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,180
Please come again.

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,360
Coach,

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,100
what's the matter?

45
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,660
Li Guoduo, I'll be direct.

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,800
Today, with that coach...

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,780
What's his name again?

48
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,320
I heard he used to coach here.

49
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,900
Do you have anything to do with him?

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,940
Coach Wang Dong?

51
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,080
He used to coach here,

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,780
but he left Xingang University.

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,300
He left?

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,940
That's a relief.

55
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,460
Why?

56
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,180
Nothing. I thought I lost my woman,

57
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,660
and now my team members too.

58
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,900
Don't worry, Coach.

59
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,380
We won't leave you.

60
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,940
Your words

61
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,900
touched me.

62
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,980
But

63
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,180
I saw you

64
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,300
sign something with him.

65
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,940
Don't be like Moxixi.

66
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,700
Discuss with me first.

67
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
Don't worry.

68
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,020
We won't get involved

69
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,940
in campus loans.

70
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,860
I need to ask you something.

71
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,380
Do you think

72
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,420
I'm an irresponsible coach?

73
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,340
Or...

74
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,700
Am I...

75
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,580
Well.

76
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,460
Immature and childish?

77
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,060
What's wrong, Coach?

78
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,500
Why are you suddenly so insecure?

79
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,620
Remember what Xiaojing said at the party?

80
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,500
She thanked you

81
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
for leading them to the league finals.

82
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,620
You're not irresponsible.

83
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,500
If you were,

84
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,940
you wouldn't care about me, right?

85
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,100
You're very responsible.

86
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,260
Thanks for saying that.

87
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,260
Just discuss things with me first.

88
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,260
Coach,

89
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,900
I have a question.

90
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,740
Go ahead.

91
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,540
Have you heard about professional matches

92
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,060
in beach volleyball?

93
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,340
Professional matches?

94
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,340
In beach volleyball?

95
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,500
No, I haven't.

96
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
I used to be

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,780
a professional windsurfer.

98
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,620
If you want, I can ask my brother.

99
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,340
Do you think I can go pro?

100
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,180
You?

101
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,140
Li Guoduo, I'm telling you.

102
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,940
You're just a freshman.

103
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,580
You have too many ideas.

104
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,460
You might

105
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,480
change your mind in a few years.

106
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,340
Really?

107
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,220
Yes, you think too much.

108
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,060
(I've made up my mind)

109
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,380
(and signed the contract.)

110
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,380
(Why do I feel so uneasy?)

111
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,820
(Is it because no one supports me?)

112
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,180
Weilan,

113
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,180
are you feeling better?

114
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,980
I'm okay.

115
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,420
I haven't trained for a while,

116
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,860
so it's fine.

117
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,660
What's wrong?

118
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,060
You must be bored

119
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,060
without me.

120
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,420
Don't worry.

121
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,860
When I'm better,

122
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,420
I'll take you to all kinds of matches
next year.

123
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,260
How about that?

124
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,260
Weilan,

125
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,020
you're still so confident.

126
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,700
Have you ever doubted

127
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,780
what you'll do in the future?

128
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,500
Why doubt?

129
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm playing beach volleyball.

130
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,620
My goal is clear.

131
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,500
True.

132
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,380
You're so talented.

133
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,700
Why are you so down?

134
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,620
What's wrong?

135
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,620
Wait for me.

136
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,900
When my hand is healed,

137
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,980
I'll play with you in the club.

138
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,820
Okay?

139
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,540
Do you also think

140
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,620
that is good?

141
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,620
It's okay.

142
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,220
Better than no match.

143
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,580
It's also good practice.

144
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,500
(I'll take it as your support.)

145
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,540
(In the next match,)

146
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,460
(I'll show you)

147
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,540
(a different me.)

148
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,780
Deal.

149
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,500
Guoduo.

150
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,500
Coach.

151
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,060
Let me introduce you.

152
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,260
This is your new partner.

153
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,740
Guoduo, Jingyi.

154
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,940
- Hello.
- Hello.

155
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,940
I'll leave you two.

156
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,780
Coach,

157
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,340
we've never played together before.

158
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,340
Will it work?

159
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,660
Why not?

160
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,020
The challenge lies

161
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,540
in never playing together.

162
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,820
Have confidence in yourself.

163
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,940
Guoduo.

164
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,220
- Okay. Get ready.
- Okay.

165
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,220
Good shot!

166
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,740
Great!

167
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,820
Great job, Jingyi.

168
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,220
- The shots were nice.
- Thank you.

169
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,620
Sometimes,

170
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,900
you need to serve more steadily.

171
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,020
Okay.

172
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,980
Don't eat my meat.

173
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,140
Isn't it for me?

174
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,900
I thought you pitied me

175
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,180
and treated me to dinner.

176
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,460
No, I was...

177
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,220
I was just hungry, so I ordered extra.

178
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,860
Your appetite

179
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,820
has increased a lot.

180
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,140
Are you growing, Guoduo?

181
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,180
I'm just a bit tired lately.

182
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,620
I want to eat more.

183
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,060
Tired?

184
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
But you haven't trained much recently.

185
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
Why are you tired?

186
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,540
Let me tell you a secret.

187
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,500
I've been competing outside.

188
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,340
Competing outside?

189
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,260
Is it legitimate?

190
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,580
Do you remember Coach Wang Dong?

191
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,500
He introduced me.

192
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,580
Wang Dong?

193
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,300
Gao doesn't like him.

194
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,620
What are you doing with him?

195
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,300
So?

196
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,460
Why do you ask?

197
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,300
You don't know him.

198
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,540
What do you ask?

199
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,460
I don't know him,

200
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,340
but Gao trained

201
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,540
with him before.

202
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,580
We know what kind

203
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,620
of person Gao is.

204
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,140
He looks down on everyone.

205
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,700
Gao has a bad temper,

206
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,220
but he wouldn't spread rumors.

207
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,020
I'm not saying Gao spreads rumors.

208
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,860
I'm saying he's not objective.

209
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,500
- But he...
- No buts.

210
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,300
Wang is going to take me
to play professionally.

211
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,220
You're going to play professionally?

212
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,540
You gave up studying medicine to study art.

213
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,020
Why can't I play professionally?

214
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,740
No, Duoduo, it's not the same.

215
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,060
I think you can play professionally,

216
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,300
but I hope you find a more stable,

217
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,180
suitable way

218
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,220
to do it.

219
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,100
Why does everyone say that?

220
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,540
Why can't I play professionally?

221
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,220
Why is my way not stable?

222
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,980
Fine, don't mention it again.

223
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,300
I've made up my mind.

224
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,380
Okay. Have some meat.

225
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,420
It's all yours.

226
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,820
You're my friend. Just support me.

227
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
Okay? Trust me.

228
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,300
You have to trust me and support me.

229
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,500
Eat more.

230
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,500
(How to prevent frequent dislocations?)

231
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,980
Avoid any strenuous exercise?

232
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,100
Love is touching.

233
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,740
It makes people do anything.

234
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,140
What about you?

235
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,620
Xiaojing is staying for grad school.

236
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,700
Do you have any plans?

237
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,180
My larynx is inflamed over it.

238
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,300
I don't believe

239
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,140
your larynx is inflamed over graduation.

240
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,220
Bro,

241
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,380
you know me well.

242
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,180
Let me tell you.

243
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,060
Xiaojing is very ambitious.

244
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,340
She wants to develop in Beijing.

245
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,380
What about you?

246
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,500
What do you think?

247
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,260
You know me.

248
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,740
I just want a stable life,

249
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,780
being a lazy fish is enough.

250
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,060
Being a lazy fish

251
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,140
isn't wrong.

252
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,100
But she wants

253
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,380
a live fish.

254
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,700
Enough, let's drop it.

255
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,100
You all are so ambitious,

256
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,620
making me feel useless.

257
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,780
I'll just hide here for some peace.

258
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,420
Jingyi.

259
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,180
Great game.

260
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,700
Thank you, Coach.

261
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,660
Here, take this.

262
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,940
Count it.

263
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,060
- Any problems?
- No problems.

264
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,900
Thank you, Coach.

265
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,100
Come on.

266
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,620
Sign here.

267
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,140
Okay.

268
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,500
I'll inform you about the next game.

269
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,180
- Okay, Coach.
- Take care, Coach.

270
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,620
Hello, Coach Wang Dong.

271
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,860
Hello.

272
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,820
What do you need?

273
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,820
I just wanted to ask you.

274
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,800
Does Li Guoduo play here?

275
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,640
Come on. Go on.

276
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,380
Guoduo?

277
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,140
She played a few games with us.

278
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,100
She performed well.

279
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,660
Is this your training ground?

280
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,500
Yes.

281
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,660
I'm just wondering

282
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,540
what kind

283
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,900
of games these are.

284
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,340
Are you Guoduo's boyfriend,

285
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,500
here to check on her?

286
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,980
We play professional games here.

287
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,060
Guoduo plays for us,

288
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,020
and she gets paid.

289
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,180
She's not a full-time player,

290
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,060
but I will protect her interests.

291
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,900
Money isn't important.

292
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,780
I'm more concerned about her safety.

293
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,580
Her previous partner got injured.

294
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,660
I understand.

295
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,820
I know about that.

296
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,660
Well.

297
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,980
Weilan

298
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,460
had an old injury.

299
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,900
It flared up

300
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,060
during a game here.

301
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,860
Look

302
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,780
at all our players.

303
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,900
They're fine.

304
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,900
No need to worry.

305
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,740
Alright, I just wanted to check.

306
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,580
I'll be going now.

307
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,700
Thanks for your time.

308
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,020
Mr. Yang, I've finished everything.

309
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,860
Don't worry.

310
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,220
Okay.

311
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,260
Thank you.

312
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,980
Are these your notes?

313
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,180
No.

314
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,620
They're Dafu's.

315
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,660
The middle part is mine.

316
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,300
What's this?

317
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,740
Golden ratio and pi.

318
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,100
Something like that.

319
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,700
Golden ratio?

320
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,380
I've been thinking.

321
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,860
These days I'm studying

322
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,700
if there's a mathematical way

323
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,660
to make tricky attacks,

324
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,420
blocks, and spikes.

325
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,020
Tricky attacks?

326
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,660
That should be useful.

327
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,820
Who?

328
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,580
Wang Dong.

329
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,740
Wang Dong?

330
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,180
He's gone.

331
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,580
Why do you keep thinking about him?

332
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,980
Who else besides me?

333
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,220
Li Guoduo.

334
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Do you know she's

335
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,940
playing for him?

336
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,020
Li Guoduo went

337
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,980
to play for him?

338
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,100
That's it.

339
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,780
My players are all taken by him.

340
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,540
Is it reliable for Duoduo

341
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,380
to play for him?

342
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,700
Of course not!

343
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,260
Let me tell you.

344
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,220
I was a professional windsurfer.

345
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,940
Their club should recruit

346
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,540
from university teams

347
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,060
or competitions.

348
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,820
Li Guoduo hasn't competed in the league.

349
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,940
Why would they choose her?

350
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,380
Why is the club interested in her?

351
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,060
True.

352
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,260
I need to warn her,

353
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,540
but I'm afraid she won't listen.

354
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,620
I'll go.

355
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,020
I'm her coach.

356
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,220
I should talk to my player.

357
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,940
Should we call Chen Weilan?

358
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,100
Of course.

359
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,460
You three

360
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,980
just don't want me to go pro.

361
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,820
We don't mind you going pro.

362
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,900
We just think it's fishy.

363
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,340
I think

364
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,820
Wang Dong isn't reliable.

365
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,020
Weilan,

366
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,780
you've interacted with Wang Dong.

367
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,980
Do you think so too?

368
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,460
I didn't think so before.

369
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,900
The last time we played a match

370
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,140
and I got injured,

371
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,420
he just

372
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,380
told us

373
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,460
to play casually.

374
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,340
Have you ever seen that?

375
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,540
I think it was because

376
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,660
our opponents were really strong,

377
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,340
so he was preparing us mentally.

378
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,340
But have you seen a coach

379
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,700
who doesn't set a strategy

380
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,140
and just says "Play casually"

381
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,540
and "Losing is fine"?

382
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,620
That's because

383
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
he might lack skills,

384
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,660
but that doesn't mean

385
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,020
he's unreliable.

386
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,900
Think about it.

387
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,260
Normally,

388
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,140
coaches recruit from leagues,

389
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,380
not arrange private meetings.

390
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,580
We met by chance,

391
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,220
and Xiaojing is also with them.

392
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,120
You all saw her

393
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,500
in the Seven-School League.

394
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,780
You mean

395
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,900
he's not just recruiting you?

396
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,940
He's poaching our team?

397
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,260
No way, no way.

398
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,660
Gao told me

399
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,060
Liqiang went to our dorm

400
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,140
and complained that she

401
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,140
wanted to go to Beijing

402
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,100
and change majors.

403
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,660
How could she be playing for a club?

404
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,660
You should ask her.

405
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,740
But honestly,

406
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,380
playing professionally

407
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,180
isn't easy.

408
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,220
I still think

409
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,460
Wang Dong is unreliable.

410
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,940
Maybe you should

411
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,100
think twice about it.

412
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,020
Enough.

413
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,900
You three

414
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,940
will never agree

415
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,020
to me going pro.

416
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,220
But I'm telling you.

417
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,940
I've signed the contract.

418
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,220
I'm determined to do this.

419
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,380
You all can chase your dreams

420
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,300
and do things you like.

421
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,500
Why can't I?

422
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,100
Why is she so stubborn?

423
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,940
So stubborn?

424
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,780
Is this the first day you met her?

425
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,780
I think

426
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,500
if it's just normal matches,

427
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,020
playing is fine.

428
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,140
I'm just afraid she'll be deceived.

429
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,460
Xiaojing is playing there too.

430
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,380
She hasn't said anything is wrong.

431
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,500
Maybe I should ask her.

432
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,980
You stay out of it.

433
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,500
Let the girls talk.

434
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,860
You go.

435
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,220
Alright.

436
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,860
I'll go ask Xiaojing.

437
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,740
Xiaojing.

438
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,260
Weilan.

439
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,220
I want to ask about Coach Wang Dong.

440
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,580
I knew you'd come to ask me.

441
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,060
So you're

442
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,300
going pro?

443
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,300
No.

444
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,220
I'm not pursuing a professional career.

445
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,740
I'm just helping Wang Dong out

446
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,260
by playing a few matches.

447
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,660
I don't know why you're looking for him,

448
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,860
but I really advise you

449
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,340
not to get involved with him.

450
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,060
Then why are you playing for him?

451
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,500
I...

452
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,580
I have to write my thesis.

453
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,460
I need to go.

454
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,340
(Scandal: Seven-Schools League Bribery)

455
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,020
Scandal! Scandal!

456
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,300
Seven-School League's bribery.

457
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,420
Referees were bought.

458
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,700
It involves multiple schools,

459
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
like Xingang Uni
and the University of Sci-tech.

460
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,180
Duoduo, something's wrong.

461
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,300
What?

462
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,380
I'm coming back right now.

463
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,060
- Coach Wang.
- What's wrong?

464
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,260
Coach, you carry on.

465
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,420
Something's wrong.

466
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,660
I have to go back.

467
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,620
That's impossible, Guoduo.

468
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,980
The match is about to start.

469
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,780
We've scheduled your match today.

470
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,900
If you don't play,

471
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,460
the club will lose a lot of money.

472
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,580
Coach, can you

473
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,500
deduct it from my previous bonuses?

474
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,780
I can return the previous money.

475
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,740
I really can't play today.

476
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,740
It's not just about money, Guoduo.

477
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,900
I'm really sorry.

478
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
I'm very sorry.

479
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,060
Guoduo.

480
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,860
Where can I find a replacement now?

481
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,260
Hello, Xiaojing?

482
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,380
There's a match now. Hurry over.

483
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,940
I promise

484
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,300
this will be the last one,

485
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,020
and I'll double

486
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,020
your pay today.

487
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,420
Hurry over.

488
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,860
Bribing referees?

489
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,940
Impossible, Secretary Zhou.

490
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,380
We wouldn't do such a thing.

491
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,540
Why not?

492
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,700
Do you think I'm joking?

493
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,820
The school is investigating this matter.

494
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,780
Be honest with me.

495
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,700
Don't think you can get away with it.

496
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,740
Secretary Zhou,

497
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,940
I really don't know about this.

498
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,620
You're the team captain.

499
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,060
If you don't know, who does?

500
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,620
Secretary,

501
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,100
maybe there's a misunderstanding.

502
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,860
I know my team.

503
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
They wouldn't

504
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,180
do such a thing.

505
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,140
We train hard every day,

506
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,420
not to mention Xiaojing and Xixi.

507
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,540
Before the league,

508
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,460
Xiaojing had diarrhea,

509
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,700
and she was worried about missing the match.

510
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,020
We all take it very seriously.

511
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,580
How could we cheat?

512
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,940
That's why you're more likely

513
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,300
to cheat.

514
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,020
Do you know where Yan Xiaojing is?

515
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,580
Xiaojing?

516
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,860
She's going to graduate.

517
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,620
After the league,

518
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,180
she must've been busy with graduation.

519
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,500
Alright.

520
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,700
You can go back now.

521
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,180
But let me tell you again.

522
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,460
If you know something,

523
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,340
you must inform the school.

524
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
If we find out,

525
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,820
you'll be responsible.

526
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,180
Duoduo, what should we do?

527
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,940
Where did Xiaojing go?

528
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,620
I can't find her.

529
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,860
Why does everyone say

530
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,460
our Super Cup is fake?

531
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,740
Why was it canceled?

532
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,300
- I don't know.
- Don't overthink it.

533
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,940
- It might not be true.
- I know nothing.

534
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,260
Don't panic.

535
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,100
Calm down.

536
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,780
She's back.

537
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,020
Xiaojing.

538
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Where did you go?

539
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,460
What happened?

540
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,260
Why are they saying our results are fake?

541
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,220
Tell us what's going on.

542
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,820
Explain it yourself.

543
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,860
Xiaojing,

544
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
don't feel pressured

545
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,060
or worried.

546
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,420
If you're innocent,

547
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,340
we'll go to the school and clarify.

548
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,340
Even if I can't be the captain,

549
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,260
I'll defend you.

550
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,700
I won't let you be wrongly accused.

551
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,740
I'm the one who bribed the referees.

552
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,220
Xiaojing, don't be stubborn.

553
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,060
Just tell us.

554
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
We'll believe you.

555
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:49,940
We'll help you.

556
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,930
Say it again.

557
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:52,020
It's not true, right?

558
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,140
It's true.

559
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,860
I did it.

560
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,100
Yan Xiaojing, why?

561
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,380
Why did you do it?

562
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,220
Was it for the guaranteed

563
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,060
grad slot?

564
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,820
Just for that?

565
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,940
So you did this?

566
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,420
Yes.

567
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,020
It was just for the grad slot.

568
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,260
Xia Liqiang,

569
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,180
do you know why I did it?

570
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,500
We're in our senior year,

571
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
getting ready to work.

572
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,340
But you neither apply

573
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,100
for grad school nor look for internships.

574
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
You just laze around,

575
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,220
with no sense of urgency.

576
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
What should I do?

577
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,780
I know you're pressured,

578
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,860
and I understand you,

579
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,860
but you can't do this.

580
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,660
You could've won the match

581
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,500
on your own.

582
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,900
You shouldn't have done it.

583
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,340
Bribing referees goes against sportsmanship.

584
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,580
It's illegal.

585
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,420
Do you know that?

586
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,220
You understand me?

587
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,300
What do you understand?

588
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,220
You don't understand me at all.

589
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,460
You're a freshman.

590
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,380
You have plenty of time to waste.

591
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,420
But what about me?

592
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,540
Chen Weilan,

593
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,180
you're good at it.

594
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,420
You achieve your goals effortlessly.

595
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,740
But I have to fight.

596
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,900
And you, Shao Nian.

597
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,620
Do you think everyone has

598
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,580
a wealthy family?

599
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,460
You're not afraid of losing.

600
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,020
You can always be the heir.

601
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,380
What's there to fear, right?

602
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,740
You all.

603
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,940
Don't act noble here.

604
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,940
I am a selfish person.

605
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,780
So what?

606
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,940
Getting into the top three of the league

607
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,420
was my only chance for a grad slot.

608
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,820
I had to ensure there were no mistakes.

609
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,860
Sportsmanship?

610
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,980
Don't talk to me about sportsmanship.

611
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,620
It's laughable!

612
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,180
(Yan Xiaojing's degree is canceled)

613
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,220
Yeah, look.

614
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,660
How could Yan Xiaojing do this?

615
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,940
She bribed referees.

616
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,260
(Disciplinary Notice)

617
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,740
Can you believe this?

618
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,380
Why would you do something so stupid?

619
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,620
Don't you know?

620
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,540
I wanted a grad slot

621
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,940
to work in Beijing after graduation

622
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,740
to live a better life.

623
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,100
Why can't we just

624
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,100
live a simple life together?

625
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,500
Isn't that good?

626
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,220
No, it's not.

627
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,220
I'm only twenty.

628
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,180
I don't want a life

629
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,820
where I can see the end from here.

630
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,060
Even though I was wrong,

631
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,140
at least

632
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,540
I tried for my goal.

633
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,220
I don't regret it.

634
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,900
But do you want this kind of life?

635
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,740
Alright.

636
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,140
I'll say it

637
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,060
first then.

638
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,380
Let's

639
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,620
end this here.

640
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,740
Coach,

641
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,220
will this affect you?

642
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,260
Though it's not related to me,

643
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,100
I should've noticed Yan Xiaojing's

644
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,500
unusual behavior.

645
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,540
It's my negligence.

646
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,100
It's not your fault.

647
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,620
You can't get into more trouble.

648
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,140
What trouble can I get into? Don't worry.

649
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,380
- Wang Dong...
- Hello.

650
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,580
Excuse me. Which one is Li Guoduo?

651
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,260
I am Li Guoduo.

652
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,420
We need you to come with us

653
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,620
to assist in an investigation.

654
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,860
What's going on?

655
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,500
Don't worry.

656
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,460
Here's the thing.

657
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,780
She's suspected

658
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
of being involved in underground gambling.

659
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,820
We need her to assist

660
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,460
in our investigation.

661
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,180
Underground gambling?

662
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,700
I'll go with you.

663
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,660
I'm her coach.

664
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,500
Sure.

665
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,900
Let's go.

666
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,860
This...

667
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:22,660
(Case Processing Center)

668
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,740
The message was unclear.

669
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,900
What underground gambling?

670
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,860
What's going on?

671
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,500
Was your game a gambling match?

672
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,220
I don't know,

673
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,380
but we did receive some money.

674
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,420
Why would you

675
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,380
take dubious money?

676
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,900
We thought it was a challenge,

677
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,140
where the winner gets the money.

678
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,860
Who knew it was gambling?

679
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,580
Why didn't you ask about it?

680
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,980
Why did they arrest Duoduo?

681
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,220
They should arrest Wang Dong!

682
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,580
Calm down.

683
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,540
She's not under arrest.

684
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,660
She's being investigated.

685
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,860
Calm down.

686
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,220
I can't. I need to find Wang Dong.

687
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,180
- Bro.
- Wait.

688
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,020
Oh, my god.

689
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,620
Thank you.

690
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,260
Everyone will get it.

691
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,660
Why did you frame Li Guoduo?

692
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,860
Frame her? Let go.

693
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,620
You framed her. Let's go to the police.

694
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,140
The police? Are you crazy?

695
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,540
- Who's crazy?
- Let go.

696
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,300
Let go.

697
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,140
Don't run.

698
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,380
Police! Stop!

699
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,220
Don't move.

700
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,340
Officer, I didn't do anything.

701
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,380
- What's going on?
- Take him away.

702
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,140
Officer, I didn't do anything.

703
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,300
Tell me what I did.

704
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,260
Why are you taking me?

706
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,700
When will they be released?

707
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,860
- How is it?
- Duoduo.

708
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,220
- You okay?
- Are you hurt?

709
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,780
Are you okay?

710
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,140
Where's Wang Dong?

711
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,420
He's inside.

712
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,860
I used to think

713
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,020
Wang Dong was just greedy,

714
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,220
but I never imagined

715
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,140
he'd dare do anything.

716
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,100
Who could've known?

717
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,460
Alright, the paperwork is done.

718
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,540
It's over now.

719
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,780
But

720
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,100
is everything cleared up?

721
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,740
What will happen to Duoduo?

722
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,980
Basically cleared up.

723
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,580
But she might face

724
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,780
disciplinary actions.

725
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,820
That's for later.

726
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,380
Let her go home first.

727
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,260
But why is there still punishment?

728
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,100
Man, she was involved.

729
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,260
Wang Dong, that jerk.

730
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,420
Screwed over his own students.

731
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,860
A man without limits

732
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,140
won't choose who to harm.

733
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
Alright, let's go.

734
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,820
It's fine. Let's go.

735
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,820
Let's go.

736
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,980
You'll catch a cold dressed like that.

737
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:16,940
I'm sorry.

738
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,340
I shouldn't have ignored your advice.

739
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,260
You don't need to apologize.

740
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,460
You're a victim too.

741
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,460
Blame

742
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,700
Wang Dong.

743
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,220
He took advantage of your youth.

744
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,260
But I'm an adult.

745
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,780
I should be responsible for my actions.

746
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,300
What adult?

747
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,340
You're only a freshman.

748
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,660
It's normal not

749
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,900
to know everything.

750
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,940
Don't blame yourself.

751
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,820
Wang Dong told me

752
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,140
I could play professionally.

753
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,100
I was so tempted.

754
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,980
I wanted to prove myself

755
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
and to show

756
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,340
I could succeed

757
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,020
without Chen Weilan.

758
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,700
It's alright.

759
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,740
You're always great in my eyes.

760
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,380
Besides,

761
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,900
everyone makes mistakes.

762
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,180
It's not all your fault.

763
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,220
It will get better.

765
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,720
Yan Xiaojing confessed

766
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,860
that the bribe money

767
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,020
came from Wang Dong.

768
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,900
Later, to repay Wang Dong,

769
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,260
she was dragged into matches.

770
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,020
Wang Dong manipulated

771
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,180
outcomes

772
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,660
to run gambling operations and profit.

773
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,660
Then he used Li Guoduo.

774
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,300
The police were investigating.

775
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,780
They noticed Wang Dong

776
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,540
contacting Li Guoduo,

777
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,620
so they brought her in for questioning.

778
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,500
I knew

779
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,540
something was off

780
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,540
during our match.

781
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,100
Wang Dong told us

782
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,140
to play freely

783
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,580
and that losing was fine.

784
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,900
But after I got injured,

785
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,420
I stopped going.

786
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,140
So the police approached Guoduo.

787
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,740
But

788
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,700
Li Guoduo did sign a contract.

789
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,660
There are two copies.

790
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,660
She doesn't have hers,

791
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,660
so she can't prove it.

792
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,380
Wang Dong has always

793
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,620
favored those who obey him.

794
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,140
Xia told me recently

795
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,980
that

796
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,100
after Xiaojing's incident,

797
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,460
Wang Dong

798
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,220
became even worse.

799
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,700
Anyway,

800
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,700
we can't hide it from the school.

801
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,660
Not sure what they'd do.

802
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,540
I'll try to communicate.

803
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,300
Li Guoduo.

804
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,860
Look at what you've done.

805
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,180
The impact is terrible.

806
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,780
The school's punishment

807
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,460
will be announced next week.

808
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,060
I think

809
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,060
you might get expelled.

810
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,540
Expelled?

811
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,860
You have a week.

812
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,020
I'm informing you early,

813
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,180
so you can

814
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
plan carefully

815
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,420
for your future.

816
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,580
(Dafu BBQ)

817
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,780
What are you doing here?

818
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,980
Dad,

819
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,220
I...

820
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,180
What's wrong?

821
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,140
Duoduo,

822
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,380
no matter what happens,

823
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,020
remember

824
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,300
this will always be your home.

825
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,500
I'm here.

826
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,220
Nothing is a problem.

827
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,420
Why standing there?

828
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,740
Let's go home.

829
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,340
Beach volleyball is my passion.

830
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,860
I believe one day

831
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,300
I can win the championship.

832
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,980
Even if it costs me everything,

833
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,500
I won't regret it.

834
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,740
I will strive to be the best.

835
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,060
I believe in you.

836
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,820
You will win the championship.

837
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,660
I can do this.

838
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,060
I think

839
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,900
you're far behind Chen Weilan.

840
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,620
Your skills haven't improved,

841
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,940
but your confidence

842
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,300
has skyrocketed.

843
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,220
Your weaknesses are too obvious.

844
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,020
No matter how high you jump to spike,

845
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,980
your timing

846
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,100
and speed

847
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,500
will still limit you.

848
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,060
You can't see it in practice,

849
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,140
but in matches,

850
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,660
every flaw is magnified.

851
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,420
You always criticize me.

852
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,180
Have you ever considered my feelings?

853
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,100
A bit of success

854
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,380
will make you smug.

855
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,420
Setbacks will make you fall apart.

856
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,340
You're not suited for competitive sports.

857
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,300
What's wrong with beach volleyball?

858
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,980
Why can't I play beach volleyball?

859
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,820
You just can't.

860
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,540
I'll give you a year.

861
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,940
If you can make it to the college league,

862
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,060
you can play for the next four years.

863
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,940
I'll support you.

864
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,700
If you can't make it,

865
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,100
don't touch beach volleyball again.

866
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,540
Does that mean I can go pro?

867
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,620
But you're still

868
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,180
too dependent on Chen Weilan in your attacks.

869
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,020
Understand?

870
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,860
Beach volleyball relies

871
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,460
on both partners having

872
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,980
comparable skills.

873
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,540
I think you can play professionally,

874
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,020
but I hope you find

875
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,460
a more stable, suitable way

876
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,460
to do it.

877
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,380
Don't mention it again.

878
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,540
I've made up my mind.

879
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,660
But have you seen a coach

880
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,020
who doesn't set a strategy

881
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,460
and just says "Play casually"

882
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,740
and "Losing is fine"?

883
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,940
That's because he might lack skills,

884
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,340
but that doesn't mean he's unreliable.

885
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,900
Think about it.

886
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,500
Normally,

887
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,940
coaches recruit from leagues,

888
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,180
not arrange private meetings.

889
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,980
Duoduo, no matter what happens,

890
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,340
remember

891
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,780
this will always be your home.

892
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,940
I'm here.

893
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,380
Nothing is a problem.

895
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,980
Where is it?

896
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,780
Bro.

897
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,020
What are you doing?

898
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,340
I'm looking for a form.

899
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,980
I saw it

900
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,860
at Wang Dong's place.

901
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,980
It was full of numbers.

902
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,140
It looked suspicious.

903
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,620
It definitely wasn't a training plan.

904
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,420
I think finding it

905
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,580
will definitely help Guoduo.

906
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,060
- All numbers?
- A form?

907
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,260
Could it be in his office?

(Case Processing Center)

Li Guoduo,

912
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,540
don't be nervous.

These two police officers

914
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,980
are here to clarify for you.

915
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,620
Clarify?

916
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,740
Yes.

917
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,020
According to the evidence,

918
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,580
though you signed a contract,

919
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,020
the content differed

920
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,220
from other players,

921
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,940
and there was no profit-sharing involved.

922
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,530
You also provided

923
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,580
many clues

924
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,940
that helped us

00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,340
capture Wang Dong.

926
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,900
Thank you.

00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,420
Li Guoduo,

928
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,780
considering this, the school

929
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,380
has decided to cancel

930
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,220
your expulsion.

931
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,100
You'll receive public

932
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
criticism and a demerit.

933
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,500
Really?

934
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,060
I won't be expelled?

935
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,900
Yes.

936
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,380
You should thank Shao Nian.

937
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,620
He provided the police

938
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,860
with their financial records.

939
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,100
No, Weilan and Gao helped too.

940
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,220
We found it together.

00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,700

- Hello.
- Hello.

963
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,260
Duoduo, why are you here?

964
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,260
You work so hard.

965
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,060
I made you something to eat.

966
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,140
And last time,

967
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,100
it was thanks to you.

968
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,940
Come, sit down.

969
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,460
Try it.

970
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,940
You must be hungry. Try it.

971
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,180
What happened?

972
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,260
Got hurt while playing.

973
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,380
- Try it.
- Careful. Let me see.

974
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,940
You're impressive.

975
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,180
Try this fish before it

976
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,180
gets cold and fishy.

977
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,220
It won't be tasty then.

978
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,900
It's a bit fishy.

979
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,780
No, I meant I wanted to try it.

980
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,700
Is it good?

981
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,860
Really good.

982
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,180
You should try some too.

983
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,340
- Let me try.
- Really tasty.

984
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,180
You try it.

985
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,980
- How is it?
- I think

986
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,140
I might've mixed up the sugar and salt.

987
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,700
No worries.

988
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,620
I've done that too.

989
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,020
- We're alike.
- This.

990
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,660

This is good, right?

993
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,060
You didn't mix up the sugar and salt for this.

994
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,780
It just has no taste.

995
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,620
No.

998
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,780
Try some.
