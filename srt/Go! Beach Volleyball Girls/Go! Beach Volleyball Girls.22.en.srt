I'm asking you.

49
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,120
Did Chen Weilan

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,580
go to training today?

51
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,800
Yes.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
But

53
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,280
Coach Zhang from the NYT came.

54
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,820
She practiced a few plays with me.

55
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,220
So she really has that intention.

56
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,500
What do you mean?

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,660
What happened to her?

58
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,480
Why didn't you stop her?

59
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,060
Why did you help her?

60
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,880
The team will disband sooner or later.

61
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,340
- Come again.
- Thanks.

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,260
Coming.

63
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,480
Eat up.

64
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,540
Here's the beer.

65
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,560
Two more beers, please.

66
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,920
We're out of beer.

68
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,760
Ask Shao Nian

69
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,380
- to bring some back.
- Dafu, busy?

70
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,180
Yeah.

71
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,460
Forget it. I'll go myself.

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,560
Alright.

73
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,760
Stay here.

74
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,060
- Is this it?
- Yes.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,220
I'd like to ask.

76
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,800
Is the Dafu BBQ restaurant here?

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,900
Yes, it's right here.

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,880
I'm looking for a young man

79
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,720
named Shao Nian.

80
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,220
Does he work here?

81
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
Yes, that young man.

82
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,480
He's really nice.

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,860
He's been working here for a while.

84
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,480
He works hard,

85
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,680
and he's good to Duo.

86
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,000
The two of them

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,700
make a great match.

88
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,820
You shouldn't speak so casually about that.

89
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,000
Hello.

90
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,720
Hello, it'll be ready soon.

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,960
Please have a seat.

92
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,800
I'll be right there.

93
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,040
Yes, here.

94
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,880
And there.

95
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,180
This, this, this.

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
Here, Zhao.

97
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,520
Young man.

98
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,060
I've already cleaned this.

99
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,600
Here's our menu.

100
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,820
Please have a look.

101
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,720
You're

102
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,980
Dr. Sun, right?

103
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,200
My husband was

104
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,340
in your care recently.

105
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,190
The one with gout.

106
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,530
Are you a family member

107
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,790
of the gout patient?

108
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
Yes, that's right.

109
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,320
So this restaurant is your family's?

110
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,640
Yes, it's our restaurant.

111
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,340
Please sit down.

112
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,060
It's your restaurant.

113
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,220
It's quite big.

114
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,540
Sit down.

115
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,640
Sing.

116
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,720
I don't want to sing. You sing.

117
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,500
Just sing one.

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,900
I'm going then.

119
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,240
Sit.

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,220
Look at this.

121
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,280
Cheers.

122
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,140
Let's do it together.

123
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,890
- Come on.
- Lingling.

124
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,520
Why are you alone here?

125
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,680
Let's sing together.

126
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,760
Wait, add me in.

127
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
Come on.

128
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,480
Let's go sing together.

129
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,120
- You all sing.
- Hurry up.

130
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,760
I want to hear you sing. Go.

131
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,640
Then we're going.

132
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,820
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

133
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,110
Lost. Drink, drink.

134
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,820
What should we guess?

135
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,140
You go.

136
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,080
Forget about them. Let's play.

137
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,740
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

138
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,700
It's a celebration party.

139
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,620
Go sing.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,040
You sing.

141
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,260
I don't want to sing.

142
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,280
Go. They're waiting for you.

143
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,220
She's coming. It's fine. Hurry up.

144
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,660
Come on. Guess again.

145
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,550
Come on, come on.

146
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,700
(Duoduo)

147
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,100
(Lide Building)

148
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,240
- Hello.
- Hello, Duoduo.

149
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,220
What's up?

150
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,870
Our school is having

151
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,320
a celebration party.

152
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,540
You should come too.

153
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,880
Li Guoduo,

154
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,940
we're at the karaoke next to the school.

155
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,920
I...

156
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,680
What's wrong?

157
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,620
Tu Lingling.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,020
She contacted you again?

159
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
She said they're having a celebration party

160
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,520
to celebrate winning the league.

161
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,700
She asked if I was going.

162
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,740
I'm torn about whether to go or not.

163
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,540
What do you think?

164
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,730
I watched an interview video of her.

165
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,340
What she said

166
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,940
really

167
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,140
moved me.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Then just go.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,460
We can seem more magnanimous.

170
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,420
- Okay.
- Let's go.

171
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,680
Dr. Sun,

172
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,200
you said you don't like greasy food.

173
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Try this.

174
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,520
It's our signature dish.

175
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,460
It's very delicious too.

176
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,320
I appreciate what you did for my husband

177
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,440
when he was in the hospital.

178
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,180
I've always wanted to treat you to a meal.

179
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,980
But the restaurant's been busy.

180
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,500
Today, order whatever you like.

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
It's on me.

182
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,960
Wait a minute.

183
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,960
I never

184
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,340
eat this stuff.

185
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,040
Look at this chili. It's black.

186
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,100
What is it?

187
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,940
That's how it looks after being grilled.

188
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,080
Grilled?

189
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
Grilling is not good

190
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,340
for health at all.

191
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,700
And this potato.

192
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,140
What are these powders?

193
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,340
Look at this leek.

194
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,500
There's even a piece of grass on it.

195
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,560
Isn't there a bug

196
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,760
on this enoki mushroom?

197
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,200
- No, Dr. Sun.
- This is terrifying.

198
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,400
- No.
- How can this be?

199
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,480
Please lower your voice. No, this...

200
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,880
This is

201
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,240
chili powder.

202
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,920
And this is cumin.

203
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,680
I added some green onions

204
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,640
to make it taste better.

205
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,620
Please try it.

206
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,380
I know all that.

207
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,200
This stuff is so dirty.

208
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,740
Is it meant for people to eat?

209
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,960
- Oh, my.
- No.

210
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,720
- Stop saying that.
- How can this be food?

211
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,440
I prepared it for you.

212
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,780
Of course, it's food.

213
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,040
Dr. Sun, even if you've helped my family,

214
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,480
you can't look down on us.

215
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,560
If you don't want it, leave.

216
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,400
I won't see you off.

217
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,220
Wait.

218
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,980
What are you doing?

219
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,680
Why acting like this?

220
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,760
If you don't want it, leave.

221
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,200
Why are you smashing things?

222
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,660
- Smashed it?
- I didn't.

223
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,680
- Oh, my.
- I didn't.

224
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,880
You dropped it yourself.

225
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,160
Did you throw it?

226
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,720
I'm telling you.

227
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,600
If you keep this up,

228
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,840
I'll call the police.

229
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,380
Are you here to cause trouble?

230
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,040
Call the police.

231
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,200
- Listen.
- Call the police.

232
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,500
I'm not here to argue with you.

233
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,100
I'm here to find my son.

234
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,820
You let my son come home,

235
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
or I'll file a complaint.

236
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,580
Your store will be shut down.

237
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,460
Are you being unreasonable?

238
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,960
Who's your son?

239
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,230
Where are your manners?

240
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,280
If you have the guts, stay.

241
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,260
How ridiculous.

242
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,140
- Is everything okay?
- It's fine.

243
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,560
What kind of person is this?

244
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,380
I haven't met anyone like her.

245
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,860
Xia.

246
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,760
Xia.

247
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,220
Stop playing basketball.

248
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,900
How can you be so carefree?

249
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,060
What's going on with you?

250
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
What's wrong with you?

251
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,660
Are you on edge?

252
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,980
Our beach volleyball team

253
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,500
is disbanding.

254
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,540
Disbanding?

255
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,700
Who agreed to this, Li Guoduo?

256
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,100
It seems so.

257
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,980
Chen Weilan is leaving.

258
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,580
Li Guoduo can't play either.

259
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,840
Do they have any respect for me

260
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,820
as the former captain?

261
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,240
Does Shao Nian know about this?

262
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,040
Asking if Shao Nian knows

263
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,140
doesn't help.

264
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,720
Even if he knows, what can he do about it?

265
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,260
At least he could persuade Li Guoduo.

266
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,960
Come on,

267
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,160
I've already told you.

268
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,660
It's Chen Weilan leaving.

269
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,480
There's no use in persuading Duoduo?

270
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,320
Who told you

271
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,420
that Chen Weilan is leaving?

272
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,380
They don't have to tell me.

273
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,000
Let me ask you. If you had to choose

274
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,920
between the NYT

275
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,800
and our team,

276
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,820
which would you choose?

277
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,120
Of course, the NYT.

278
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,820
Exactly, you'd choose it too.

279
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,620
Someone's poaching our players?

280
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,060
Those from the NYT.

281
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
How dare they

282
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,980
come here to poach players!

283
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,100
If you think about it,

284
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,120
if an NYT player comes

285
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,580
from our team,

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,040
it's like a phoenix coming

287
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,220
out of a chicken coop.

288
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,380
I can't do anything about this.

289
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,800
Bro,

290
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,780
Chen Weilan's situation

291
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,140
is beyond anyone's help.

292
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,460
Only you can stop this.

293
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,060
Why didn't you change before practice?

294
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,900
You're happy now?

295
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,420
Before making any decisions,

296
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,220
shouldn't you inform the team?

297
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,500
What decision have I made?

298
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,180
Don't act confused with me.

299
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,420
I also have friends on the NYT.

300
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,560
I can see their posts on the Moments.

301
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,400
Yes.

302
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,100
Beach volleyball requires teamwork.

303
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,700
If you like to show off,

304
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,420
try indoor volleyball.

305
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,700
It suits you.

306
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
Is what you saw

307
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,900
always the truth?

308
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,420
Yes, I've seen it.

309
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,120
I also saw you, Coach Zhang

310
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,580
and the team members

311
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,620
chatting happily in the cafeteria.

312
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,380
So just continue being happy.

313
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,840
Duo's mom, don't be angry.

314
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,320
That person is just crazy.

315
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,440
- Have some water.
- I've seen many like her.

316
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,280
- Take your med.
- No need to be angry.

317
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,480
Calm down.

318
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,060
What's wrong?

319
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,160
Why are you taking medicine now?

320
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,180
You came at the right time. Help me judge this.

321
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,160
The doctor

322
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,260
who treated your father

323
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,360
came here today

324
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,100
and said our food is unclean

325
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,380
and carcinogenic.

326
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,280
I treated her well.

327
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,720
I invited her to a meal,

328
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,480
but in the end, she threw dishes at me.

329
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,800
What did I do to deserve this?

330
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,220
She's a troublemaker. Ignore her.

331
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,660
Who's that?

332
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,880
With a clear conscience,

333
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,280
I'm not afraid of anything.

334
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,840
It's easy for you to say.

335
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,560
Our business was ruined today.

336
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,920
Water and electricity cost money.

337
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,600
And she came here saying she's

338
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,560
looking for her son?

339
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,060
Who here looks like her son?

340
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,860
Just treat her as a lunatic.

341
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,960
Duo...

342
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,000
What? Why would she come?

343
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,360
I invited her,

344
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,640
but she hasn't arrived yet.

345
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,700
Did you see her?

346
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,280
No.

347
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,460
- Yes.
- You have a new order.

348
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,800
- Ignore her.
- Please check it.

349
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,040
- Don't let her get you.
- Yes.

350
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,360
- Calm down.
- Don't be angry.

351
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,400
- It's okay.
- Calm.

352
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,440
Just treat her as a lunatic. It's okay.

353
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,720
- Dad.
- Take your medicine.

354
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,000
Help my mom back to rest.

355
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,460
Shao Nian and I can do this.

356
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Yes. Duo's mom, go rest.

357
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,680
- Yes.
- Ignore her.

358
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,420
- Rest well.
- Go home and rest.

359
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,560
Thank you.

360
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,200
- Watch your blood pressure.
- Thank you.

361
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,080
Hurry back.

362
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,980
Don't take it to heart. Rest well.

363
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,620
Thank you all.

364
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,000
- We'll leave.
- Bye.

365
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,920
- Duoduo.
- Call us.

366
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,940
- Anytime.
- Thanks.

367
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,080
- Bye-bye.
- Bye. Thank you.

368
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,920
Bye-bye.

369
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,280
Order songs. Why's no one singing?

370
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,360
Am I the only one singing?

371
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
Hello, your takeaway has arrived.

372
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,520
- Who's takeaway?
- The takeaway.

373
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,540
Take a look. It's here.

374
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,400
- Li Guoduo.
- Why is it her?

375
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,480
Why are you here?

376
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,740
Why are you delivering takeaway?

377
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,920
Our family owns a barbecue restaurant.

378
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,140
Is that true?

379
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,780
You should have told us.

380
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,760
We would support your family's business.

381
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,600
Yes.

382
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,760
That's great.

383
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,350
We often support your business.

384
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,680
Give us a discount next time.

385
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,520
Exactly.

386
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,000
- Come on.
- Alright.

387
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,920
Go sing.

388
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,930
Go now.

389
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,740
- Go sing.
- Go now.

390
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,630
Duoduo.

391
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,720
Sit down.

392
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,720
I didn't expect

393
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,640
your party to be here.

394
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,500
What a coincidence.

395
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,300
Yes. Pour a drink.

396
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,360
- Are you thirsty?
- Thanks.

397
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,880
Duoduo,

398
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,780
actually,

399
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,820
I've been wanting to apologize to you.

400
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,000
I changed partners at the last exam.

401
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,100
It was my fault.

402
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,460
I'm sorry.

403
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,160
I hope you can forgive me.

404
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,460
Actually, I also saw that interview today.

405
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,000
I heard

406
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,340
what you said.

407
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,100
What you said was what I wanted to say.

408
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,460
Really?

409
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,220
Then let's hug.

410
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,500
Thank you.

411
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,780
By the way, there's also good news.

412
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,180
Our coach invited you to join us.

413
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,640
We'll be able to fight

414
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,700
side by side again.

415
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,140
How about it? Aren't you excited?

416
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
Ocean University is your dream school.

417
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,200
So you won't refuse, right?

418
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,720
Wait. I'll notify you

419
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,180
- when training starts.
- I...

420
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,740
Let's celebrate.

421
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,040
Duoduo.

422
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,520
Look.

423
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,380
You left it again.

424
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,080
Thank you.

425
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,480
Tu Lingling.

426
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,740
Shao Nian.

427
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
Lingling,

428
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,360
about the boy you mentioned

429
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,640
in the last interview,

430
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,980
could it be him?

431
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,260
It's this boy, right?

432
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,380
No wonder he looks so familiar.

433
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,280
When did you two get together?

434
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,940
- Yes.
- Amazing.

435
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,560
We didn't know.

436
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,640
Tell us. Tell us.

437
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,160
Such a good match. Right.

438
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,020
You're holding hands.

439
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,860
What a good match.

440
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,780
I guessed it long ago.

441
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,780
So sweet.

442
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,740
I have to go.

443
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,540
Duoduo, don't go.

444
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,800
- Duoduo.
- Shao Nian.

445
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,640
Don't go.

446
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,670
- Duoduo.
- Why leave?

447
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,260
Duoduo.

448
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,180
Duoduo, wait up.

449
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,520
Duoduo, wait for me.

450
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,260
I need to hurry back to help my parents.

451
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,360
No, Duo, what they said...

452
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,780
I heard what they said just now.

453
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,680
Tu Lingling

454
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,720
is excellent,

455
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,760
good-looking,

456
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,940
and a very nice girl.

457
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,180
That has nothing to do with me.

458
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,260
Duoduo.

459
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,120
- I...
- Shao Nian.

460
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,440
Mom,

461
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,380
what are you doing here?

462
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,380
Look at how you are now,

463
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,060
always messing around.

464
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,440
You lied to me,

465
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,840
saying you were doing part-time work

466
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,180
to gain social experience.

467
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,060
Turns out you were working at a BBQ restaurant.

468
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,940
Is that where you should be?

469
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,440
The troublemaker

470
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,700
at our restaurant is you, right?

471
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,860
You must be Li Guoduo, right?

472
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,400
I can see it now.

473
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,880
You really have no manners.

474
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,560
You caused trouble at our restaurant

475
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,480
and slandered us. Is that having manners?

476
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,440
- Duoduo.
- Sweetie.

477
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,520
Did you hear that?

478
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,940
What kind of friends are you making?

479
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,720
Take off these clothes.

480
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,360
Mom, can you stop interfering in my life?

481
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,280
Are you blind or just dense?

482
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,880
Girls like her

483
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,980
are after the money in your pocket.

484
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,880
Stay away from her, okay?

485
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,900
Stop talking.

486
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,240
Your Shao Nian

487
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,340
has nothing to do with me.

488
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,320
- Duoduo.
- Sweetie.

489
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,520
Stop right there.

490
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,840
If you dare to chase her today,

491
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,260
I'll disown you.

492
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,320
Mom.

493
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,240
Duoduo.

494
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,200
Duoduo.

495
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,140
Duoduo, wait a moment.

496
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,740
I heard what his mom said.

497
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,100
You must find it very harsh.

498
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,280
That's because you don't understand

499
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,500
their family situation.

500
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,500
What do you mean?

501
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,560
Come with me.

502
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,400
Come on.

504
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,380
Why did you bring me here?

505
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,020
Look for yourself.

506
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,320
Ms. Sun, good evening.

507
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,220
Mom.

508

Why did you bring me to here?

509
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,500
Your grandfather is waiting for you inside.

510
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,020
Why is Shao Nian here?

511
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,280
This hospital

512
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,460
is owned by his family.

513
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,840
How is that possible?

514
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,460
He's working part-time at our restaurant.

515
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,340
Still don't believe it?

516
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,400
Come with me.

517
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,240
Let's go.

He's said to be a highly skilled doctor.

523
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,400
He's treated many

524
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,460
celebrities' illnesses.

525
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,520
His family has been doctors
for several generations,

526
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,680
and each generation

527
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,340
has well-known doctors.

many events every year.

Are you here for a consultation?

No, we're friends of Shao Nian.

Oh, you're friends with Mr. Shao.

541
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,800
But he's in the chairman's office now,

542
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,700
so he may not be able to meet with you.

543
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,680
It's okay. No problem.

544
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,800
We'll just look around.

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,580
I heard Mr. Shao is here.

566
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,320
Yes, he usually doesn't come.

567
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,200
I've never seen him.

568
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,760
He likes painting, doesn't he?

569
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,080
Did he fail so he came back

570
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,820
to inherit the family business?

571
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,560
I'd love

572
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,920
to experience that kind of life.

573
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,880
Stop dreaming.

574
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,140
Go back to work.

575
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,380
What you're seeing today

576
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,220
is the real Shao Nian.

577
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,140
You must think

578
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,180
I like him

579
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,540
because he's wealthy.

580
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,980
When I started liking him,

581
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,940
I didn't know anything about his family.

582
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,020
It was later

583
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,860
that I found

584
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,940
I liked him more and more,

585
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,020
and I wanted to know everything about him.

586
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,700
Duoduo,

587
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,940
do you know?

588
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,320
When you really

589
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,380
like someone,

590
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,760
you want to know

591
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,020
all about them.

592
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
So when did you

593
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,220
start liking him?

594
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,120
Did you like him

595
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,900
before you told me for the first time?

596
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,560
It's always been a little secret in my heart.

597
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,100
I haven't told anyone.

598
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,080
Do you remember

599
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,580
when we first met Shao Nian?

600
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,460
Duoduo, put me down.

601
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,360
You're too tired.

602
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,440
It's okay. It's okay.

603
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,560
Hold on a bit longer.

604
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,400
We're almost

605
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,260
at the hospital.

606
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,800
Why can't we get a cab?

607
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,900
Hold on.

608
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,980
Slow down.

609
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,280
Wait.

610
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,280
What's with her leg?

611
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,860
She fell on the rocks.

612
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,960
I'm a medical student. Let me look.

613
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,800
Really?

614
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,840
- Thank you.
- We'll go over there.

615
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,680
Help her down.

616
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,280
Slowly, slowly.

617
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,120
Slowly.

618
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,720
Let's go over there.

619
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,700
Careful, careful.

620
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,060
It was during that injury, right?

621
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,460
I remember

622
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,900
it was this spot.

623
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,860
He was crouching there,

624
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,140
and

625
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,500
he carefully,

626
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,500
gently,

627
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,260
and attentively bandaged my wound.

628
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,400
Bear with it. Let me check

629
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,760
if your bone is injured, okay?

630
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,340
Bear with it.

631
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,380
Bear with it.

632
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,620
Are you in pain from the wound or the bone?

633
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,480
- The outside hurts.
- The outside?

634
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,960
That's good. The bone isn't injured.

635
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,980
I'll disinfect it for you.

636
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,900
It might hurt. Bear with it.

637
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,720
Bear with it.

638
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,220
It's okay. It'll be fine soon.

639
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,900
But your scarf is getting dirty.

640
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,560
It's okay. It's for my mom anyway.

641
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,960
She has so many scarves.

642
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,220
This one is worth it.

643
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,020
Bear with it.

644
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,560
Is it okay now?

645
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,280
You should leave a contact

646
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,400
so I can transfer the money for the scarf.

647
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,700
No need. It's fine.

648
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,180
Thank you.

649
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,140
You're welcome. Let's go to the hospital.

650
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,260
It's said

651
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,780
that serious men are the most charming.

652
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,700
It was at that moment

653
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,300
that I was deeply captivated by him.

654
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,200
Duoduo,

655
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,280
the three of us

656
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,820
are the best of friends.

657
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,580
You will still bless us

658
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,420
like before, right?

659
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,660
It's getting late.

660
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,360
You should go back first.

661
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,820
It's not safe to be out so late.

662
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,280
Thank you for sending me back.

663
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,700
I'll leave now.

664
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,240
Duoduo,

665
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,280
will you go to Ocean University for training?

666
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,660
Should I come to pick you up then?

667
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,880
No need. Actually...

668
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,180
Duoduo,

669
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,080
don't you think

670
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,620
the current relationship among us is awkward?

671
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,740
How is it awkward?

672
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,920
We are the best of friends.

673
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,360
If you can come to Ocean University

674
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,660
for training,

675
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,220
we can play beach volleyball like before,

676
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,480
and I'll also have the courage

677
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,100
to pursue Shao Nian.

678
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,660
About going to Ocean University,

679
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,080
I'll think about it.

680
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,140
I'll think about it.

681
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,040
Coach Tian Qing

682
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,220
likes you a lot.

683
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,880
She hopes you can come.

684
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,200
If you can come,

685
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,740
you can invite Chen Weilan along.

686
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,260
Chen Weilan?

687
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,560
I can ask her,

688
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,020
but I don't know if she'll agree.

689
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,640
Well,

690
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,160
whether she comes doesn't matter.

691
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,240
What's important is you.

692
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,080
Because Coach Tian

693
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,100
likes you a lot.

694
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,920
I'll wait for you

695
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,340
at Ocean University then.

696
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,620
I'll head back now.

697
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,840
Bye-bye.

698
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,340
Stop right there.

699
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,760
You have a talent for medicine.

700
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,320
You'll be a doctor.

701
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,280
Why can't you be an intern at the hospital?

702
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,840
Are you ignoring my words?

703
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,180
Have you heard my true feelings?

704
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,940
Do you know what I like?

705
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,480
I want to do what I love

706
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,240
and be with the person I love.

707
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,520
Is the girl you like

708
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,200
the ill-mannered Li Guoduo?

709
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,280
Yes, that's her.

710
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,120
You...

711
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,200
You...

712
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,660
No, Mom.

713
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,880
- Madam.
- Mom, what's wrong?

714
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,300
- My head hurts.
- Mom, slow down.

715
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,020
Mom, are you okay?

716
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,720
Slow down.

717
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,080
Mom, are you alright?

718
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,760
Madam's blood pressure has been high.

719
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,260
Don't let her get too agitated.

720
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,740
My son's grown up and refuses to listen to me.

721
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,960
Give me

722
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,820
- the medicine.
- OK.

723
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,320
Mom,

724
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,180
please rest well first.

725
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,660
We'll talk about it

726
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,420
later.

727
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,780
I'm too tired to argue.

728
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,080
Since you value her so much,

729
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,340
why don't you tell me

730
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,300
what kind of person she is?

731
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,820
Duoduo is

732
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,420
strong and brave.

733
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,540
She loves playing beach volleyball.

734
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,820
She's willing to do anything for her dreams.

735
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,700
Although she seems careless,

736
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,260
she's very kind.

737
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,240
Give her some time,

738
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,740
and you'll definitely like her.

739
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,700
Does her family depend
on the restaurant for a living?

740
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,140
Yes, so what?

741
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,840
Her family's restaurant

742
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
is quite famous here.

743
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,240
You can try it out someday

744
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,140
if you have time.

745
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
No need to tell me

746
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,500
about it anymore.

747
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,140
I have just two words:

748
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,020
I disagree.

749
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,440
Mom,

750
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,700
I have three words:

751
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,920
I don't care.

752
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,920
You...

753
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,520
You...

754
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,680
Madam, calm down.

755
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Take your medicine first.

756
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,900
He's going to make me mad.

757
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,620
He really makes me mad.

758
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,580
Calm down.

759
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,820
He really makes me mad.

760
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,500

777
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,860
Well, Jingxuan,

778
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,480
what I wanted to say to you

779
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,810
is all in the lyrics I just sang.

780
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,770
Will you be my girlfriend?

781
00:34:52,910 --> 00:35:02,150
Say yes, say yes, say yes.

782
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,520
What do I lack compared to Lang Yueting?

783
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,380
She's more well-rounded in skills.

784
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,100
Her blocking and spiking

785
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,100
are decent.

786
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,980
She's good with her teammates.

787
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,420
Her teammates like to work with her.

788
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
And she's not as pretty as you.

789
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,600
I know I'm not as pretty as her,

790
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,440
but...

791
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,460
What did you say?

792
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,920
- Say yes.
- Say yes.

793
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,280
So romantic.

794
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,240
- Say yes, say yes.
- How nice.

795
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,160
I'm sorry.

796
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,260
I don't want to date right now.

797
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
That's okay.

798
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,660
We can start as friends.

799
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,820
I can wait,

800
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,980
but at least you should accept the flowers.

801
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,920
Yeah, take your time.

802
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,360
- Yes, accept them.
- Accept them.

803
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,240
Accept the flowers.

804
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,400
- It's a gesture.
- Do it.

805
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,520
- Do it.
- Accept them.

806
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,040
The flowers are beautiful. Thank you.

807
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
But I can't accept them.

808
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,240
I still have homework.

809
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,280
I have to go. Bye-bye.

810
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,420
No, Jingxuan.

811
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
Why are you leaving?

812
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,940
I can help you with the homework.

813
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,440
- It's okay.
- It's alright, bro.

814
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,480
Don't be discouraged.

815
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,320
Keep it up.

816
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,660
You'll make it next time.

(Li Guoduo)

819
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:21,920
Shao Nian,

820
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,460
I want to ask you something.

821
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,220
What do you think of Ocean Uni?

822
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,300
If I were you,

823
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,060
I wouldn't consider such things.

824
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,920
I heard you used to be

825
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,020
partners with Tu Lingling.

826
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,620
You two played together,

827
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,840
but Tu Lingling

828
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,480
not only got into Ocean University

829
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,620
but also won the Seven-School League.

830
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,960
And you?

831
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,100
You have nothing.

832
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,140
You only badger men

833
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,100
and ask such trivial questions.

834
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,700
I don't know what method you used

835
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,620
to deceive Shao Nian,

836
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,120
but you should find out

837
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,260
who his mother is.

838
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,080
If you want

839
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,460
to date Shao Nian,

840
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,080
you'd better

841
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,620
weigh yourself first.

842
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,960
Auntie,

843
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,900
are you done speaking?

844
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,860
You can't say that about me.

845
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,240
I hope that before you

846
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,200
judge someone,

847
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,740
you can understand the situation.

848
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,260
Do you even know him?

849
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,160
Even though

850
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,220
I'm in Xingang now,

851
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,520
I've been invited

852
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,360
by Ocean University

853
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,660
to play volleyball.

854
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,800
I think pursuing my dream

855
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,900
isn't wrong.

856
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,040
I don't think I'm weak.

857
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,200
I will become a great player

858
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
in the future.

859
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,740
You have no right to say that about me.

860
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,060
I don't need to prove anything to anyone.

861
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,340
I only need to prove it to myself.

(Xingang University Beach Volleyball Team)

866
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,000
You want to leave the team

867
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,340
to join the NYT, right?

868
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,260
I'm still thinking about it.

869
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,200
Before making any decisions,

870
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,220
shouldn't you inform the team?

871
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,220
I also have friends on the NYT.

872
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,180
I can see their posts on the Moments.

873
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,800
I also saw you, Coach Zhang

874
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,060
and the team members

875
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,900
chatting happily in the cafeteria.

876
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,660
Beach volleyball requires teamwork.

877
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,060
If you like to show off,

878
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,860
try indoor volleyball.

879
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,080
It suits you.

880
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,480
If you get hurt,

881
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,940
I'm afraid we will lack a player.

Is there only me on the team?

but you're the best spiker.

you weren't in your best form.

when she saw your diagnosis?

910
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,440
She was terrified you'd have to stop playing

911
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,740
because of your injury.

912
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,620
She knows you're like her.

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,500
Though I'm the shortest plank,

914
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,100
I'll improve.

915

00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,360
We're only freshmen.

917
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,980
We have plenty of chances and time.

918
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,360
If we work hard together,

919
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,880
we can make it to the national league.

920
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,720
We can do this.

921
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,140
Did you notice it?

922
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,160
Today, Jingxuan's movements

923
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,580
were very similar to Lang Yueting's.

924
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,460
We actually did that on purpose.

925
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,040
When you're facing an opponent

926
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,600
with a similar build to Lang Yueting,

927
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,220
you can't execute a perfect spike.

928
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,100
It's not because the opponent is skilled.

929
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,880
It's because their stance

930
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,380
throws you off balance.

931
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,260
You have to face your problems

932
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,820
to have a chance at winning.

933
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,480

935
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,320
I've been practicing

936
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,540
nonstop this week.

937
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,580
And you praised me for my progress.

00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,940
when facing my weaknesses,

940
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,560
I have to bravely overcome them.

941
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,460
I have to face them,

942
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,820
so I can change

943
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,500
and become stronger.

944
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,120
We're partners.

945
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,700
We'll win many championships together.

946
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,260
I'm worried about you.

947
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,400
Weilan's

948
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,820
skills and physical fitness aren't perfect.

949
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,820
You don't have any other options.

950
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,640
You have to accept it.

951
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,280
You will work

952
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,740
on your mental issues.

953
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,000
Let's work hard.

954
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,600
I've switched to beach volleyball now,

955
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,800
not indoor volleyball.

956
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,900
But your strengths

957
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,540
are in indoor volleyball.

958
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,220
But after playing beach volleyball for months,

959
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,660
I've realized my shortcomings.

960
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,260
And I now have a new partner

961
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,300
that I work very well with.

962
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,680
So, I want

963
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,420
to continue playing beach volleyball.

964
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,900
Thank you for the invitation.

965
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,480
Weilan, you're amazing!

966
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,960
You did it! Do you know that?

967
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,140
You did it!
