The taste is great. It's really fresh.

20

Come here anytime.

21
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,320
Okay.

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
Dafu,

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,840
I heard

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,760
Duoduo can't join

25
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,700
the national league.

26
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,300
These kids are too far behind.

27
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,730
They can't always aim too high.

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,380
They'll keep working.

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,900
Maybe next year.

30
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,840
Remember when we were freshmen,

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,620
we won first place in the national league?

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,860
We were so glorious back to school.

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,360
Back then, playing

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,660
was like fighting for our lives.

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,860
Our mindset was different from today's kids.

36
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,180
I remember back then

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,940
we were always thinking about making a name

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,660
with endless energy.

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,640
Come on.

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,180
I remember you were

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,020
the most diligent.

42
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,300
The coach always said

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,020
we weren't as good as you.

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,280
It's all in the past.

45
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,180
I've seen Duoduo play.

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
Well.

47
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,900
Xiaole took me when she was training.

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,300
I think Duoduo's condition

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,020
is quite good.

50
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,220
She reminds me of the young me.

51
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,620
Weilan is like you.

52
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,620
Not talkative, but very talented.

53
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
It's indeed a pity that they can't

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,980
join the league.

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,220
I've checked.

56
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,420
Though the new league isn't very influential,

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,980
everyone is

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,040
following the champions

59
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,880
of the league.

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,980
So I wrote a recommendation letter

61
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,540
to express my hope for Duoduo and Weilan.

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,180
The committee has agreed.

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,800
This

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,660
isn't for compensation.

65
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,380
I'm giving you this letter,

66
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,640
hoping you

67
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,900
can decide whether they go or not.

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,620
By the way, I also have this.

69
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,820
A few days ago,

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
I found this

71
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,220
in my old textbooks.

72
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,580
We were quite young back then.

73
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,180
Does it seem a bit spicy?

74
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,600
Not spicy at all.

75
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,440
Just right.

76
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
Thank you.

77
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,460
- Bottom-up.
- Bottom-up.

78
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,870
Hurry up.

79
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,180
Thanks for taking me back.

80
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,860
It's nothing.

81
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,500
Then I'll go in.

82
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,920
Coach Tian,

83
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,640
I want to ask you something.

84
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,960
Well.

85
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,060
Which do you think is better,

86
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,920
me or my cousin?

87
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,360
What do you mean?

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,040
Well, in the past,

89
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,240
everyone thought my cousin was better than me.

90
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,080
My family thought

91
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,480
if I had half of his abilities,

92
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,800
it would be great.

93
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,160
I don't care what others say.

94
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,220
I'm used to it.

95
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,180
But you're different from others.

96
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,580
I don't want you

97
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,020
to think that way too.

98
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,360
I talked to your cousin a lot today

99
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,760
because I had technical questions

100
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,260
about beach volleyball to ask him.

101
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,240
I don't think you're worse than him.

102
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,940
On the contrary,
you have many qualities he doesn't.

103
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,720
Really?

104
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,360
For example?

105
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,760
You're very humorous.

106
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,080
That's all?

107
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,000
You care about others.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
You're considerate.

109
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Go on.

110
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,040
Go on?

111
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,440
You cook well.

112
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,960
You love your family.

113
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,360
You're a bit childish

114
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,340
and not very mature.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,520
You're quite impulsive.

116
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,120
You want everyone to revolve

117
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,060
around you.

118
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,160
Coach Tian,

119
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,560
do you still think I'm childish now?

120
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,540
But I think you're a good person.

121
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,820
How good?

122
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,580
Good enough to entrust your life to?

123
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,820
Good enough to want to punch you.

124
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,080
Alright. Enough talk.

125
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,120
My students are waiting.

126
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,140
Okay, okay, okay.

127
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,260
Coach Tian.

128
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,140
Remember what you just said.

129
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,900
When you see my cousin again,

130
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,580
think of how good I am as well.

131
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,080
Dad.

132
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm here to help.

133
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,520
You're back.

134
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,120
Let me do it.

135
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,440
Dad, why did you hurry me back?

136
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,280
What's the matter?

137
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,480
Duoduo.

138
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,600
This...

139
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,920
From now on,

140
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,580
don't say I don't support you anymore.

141
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,460
Lu Daxing recommended you and Chen Weilan

142
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,740
(Recommendation)
to join the national league.

143
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,640
Is it true?

144
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,220
Can we participate in the league now?

145
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,820
The organizing committee has approved it.

146
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,820
Thank you, Dad.

147
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,900
You're so great. Thank you, Dad.

148
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
I'll tell Chen Weilan

149
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,820
and share the good news.

150
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,280
Bye.

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,840
See?

152
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,180
See what? Basketball?

153
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,060
And this.

154
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,620
What does basketball
have to do with volleyball?

155
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,640
Of course, it does.

156
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,360
In basketball, there's a technique

157
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
called hang-time,

158
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,040
which means a brief stay

159
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,740
in the air after jumping

160
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,740
before landing normally.

161
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,240
Some top volleyball players

162
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,160
can also achieve this.

163
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,260
There are two benefits.

164
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,520
First, it allows you
to avoid the block in the air.

165
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,360
Second,

166
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,680
it provides a more stable point

167
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,340
for attacking in the air.

168
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,360
I see.

169
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,480
Similar to the fake moves

170
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,180
Coach Tian taught me?

171
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,920
That's true,

172
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,840
but fake moves are common.

173
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,620
Hang-time is more advanced.

174
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,280
Do we have any special techniques?

175
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,120
Yes.

176
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,420
I've arranged it long ago.

177
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,080
This is called the misalignment strategy.

178
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,680
It's the most advanced technique

179
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,860
in beach volleyball.

180
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,080
It demands a lot from the setter

181
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,920
and

182
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,100
even more

183
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,340
from the attackers.

184
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,260
Both your dad and I think

185
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,620
as long as one of you

186
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,320
masters hang-time

187
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
and combines it with misalignment strategy

188
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,260
and the previous quick attacks,

189
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,640
your combination

190
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,660
will be unbeatable.

191
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,900
Are you sure?

192
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,780
It's also about quick attacks.

193
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,780
We're playing beach volleyball, not indoors.

194
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,560
The requirements for jumping ability

195
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,780
and speed are very high.

196
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,020
Can she do it?

197
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,080
Whether it's hard doesn't matter.

198
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,960
If others can do it,

199
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,000
so can you.

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,840
What do you think?

201
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,280
Your dad and I

202
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,040
spent five or six days

203
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,460
finding this technique.

204
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,040
It's challenging,

205
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,920
but

206
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,980
we believe

207
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,100
it fits your technical characteristics.

208
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,340
I think it's doable.

209
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,100
You'll need to work hard.

210
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,190
♪You are my first choice♪

211
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,330

♪Give it all♪

217
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,760
Your training was completely wrong.

218
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,700
Not high enough, not fast enough.

219
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,120
Weilan, what you did

220
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,480
wasn't hang-time at all.

221
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,600
You didn't hang.

222
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,660
Let me say it again.

223
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,200
Hang-time

224
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,480
isn't just about staying

225
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,400
in the air.

226
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,980
It's about control.

227
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,600
The longer you control in the air

228
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,560
the center of gravity,

229
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,800
the better your hang-time.

230
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,640
Hang-time requires

231
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,600
body coordination, balance,

232
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,520
and core strength in your waist and abdomen.

233
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,120
Do you remember what are the two steps

234
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,740
on the powerful jump serve?

235
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,180
Toss the ball, and then jump and spike.

236
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,960
That's right. Now, it seems

237
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,620
our powerful serve and hang-time

238
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,900
are actually the same.

239
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,560
It's just whether there's a net

240
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,400
or blocking.

241
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,820
The better your hang-time,

242
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,540
the stronger your spike.

243
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,320
So, practicing hang-time

244
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,580
is like perfecting

245
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,680
a powerful spike, right?

246
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,520
Exactly.

247
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,360
Now, let's analyze

248
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,500
the cross-play.

249
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,640
Li Guoduo is the receiver.

250
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,800
After receiving it, pass it to the setter.

251
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,620
At this moment,

252
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,000
you move to the outside,

253
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,940
making others think you'll attack from there.

254
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,380
The setter is crucial at this point.

255
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,100
Your timing and the force on the ball

256
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,020
should create a high arc ball
to spread the play.

257
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,560
Li Guoduo quickly

258
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,280
cuts to this position

259
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,260
to spike and score.

260
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,360
This also requires your hang-time

261
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,620
and core strength.

262
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,240
I understand now.

263
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
So, this puts a high demand

264
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,080
on our coordination.

265
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,900
Glad you get it.

266
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,080
I'm not worried about your skills

267
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,140
and understanding,

268
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,020
but

269
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,340
core strength cannot

270
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,680
be taken lightly.

271
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,200
- Hello.
- I heard

272
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,860
you've learned a new move recently.

273
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,680
That's taught by Duoduo's dad.

274
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,520
How does it feel?

275
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,660
It feels

276
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,460
okay.

277
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,920
We're just starting,

278
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,060
so it's not perfect yet.

279
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,060
You seem reluctant to talk.

280
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,980
Is it not going well?

281
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,420
It's fine.

282
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,480
Tell me about it.

283
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,020
The biggest difficulty

284
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,540
is missing you.

285
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,240
I miss you too.

286
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,420
Every day,

287
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,300
I motivate myself by thinking

288
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,260
that the harder I train,

289
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,660
the sooner I'll become a full-time player,

290
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,300
and then I can take a break.

291
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,420
By then,

292
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,700
I'll have more time to see you.

293
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,980
When will that be?

294
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
But don't worry.

295
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,420
When you become a full-time player,

296
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,660
I'll also be there.

297
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,780
So confident?

298
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,400
Of course.

299
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,180
You know my level, don't you?

300
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,400
Weilan,

301
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,820
I have night training tonight.

302
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,000
So,

303
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,200
I'll hang up now.

304
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,240
Well.

305
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,060
I miss you too.

306
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,340
Go ahead.

307
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,540
Be safe.

308
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,320
Bye-bye.

309
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,920
Bye-bye.

310
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,200
Okay.

311
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,540
Come here.

312
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,360
Play it back.

313
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,940
Coach, I'd like to ask for leave.

314
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,320
I want to accompany Weilan

315
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,820
through the national league.

316
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,200
I hope you'll approve.

317
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,140
Have you decided?

318
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
The ball is thrown too far.

319
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,240
- Come on.
- Okay.

320
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,180
Watch the height.

321
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,540
Spike it into the line.

322
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,360
Got it.

323
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,220
Harder. Harder.

324
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,100
- Another one.
- Again.

325
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,740
Weilan.

326
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,780
- Coming.
- Duoduo.

327
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,040
Coach.

328
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,620
Let's finish for today.

329
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,440
Bye.

330
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,300
Good coat.

331
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,380
Why does this outfit suit you so poorly?

332
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,300
What? Envious?

333
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,220
Why are you back?

334
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,340
For the national league.

335
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,760
Without me here,

336
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,860
you'd be nervous, right?

337
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,000
I...

338
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,560
Let's go. Practice with me.

339
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,400
Come on.

340
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,160
I really can't eat anymore.

341
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,320
I took too much.

342
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
You're wasting the food.

343
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,460
Then I'll eat it.

344
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,560
Can you eat all this?

345
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,880
I'm training a lot now.

346
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,720
I'm too tired.

347
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,870
I'm hungry.

348
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,380
Eat more.

349
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,140
The national league is coming.

350
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,110
Are you two

351
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,900
a bit nervous?

352
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,720
I'm not nervous.

353
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,380
Why should I be nervous?

354
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,260
We've trained for a year.

355
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,340
It's time for the exam.

356
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,060
Our goal this time is the championship.

357
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
We won't accept

358
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,700
any result but the championship.

359
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,420
You've trained hard for a year.

360
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,460
Can we relax a bit?

361
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,160
I agree.

362
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,560
Indeed. We haven't

363
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,160
had any fun this year.

364
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,580
The amusement park

365
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,400
is great. Let's go.

366
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,280
Sounds good.

367
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Let's go then.

368
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,120
The amusement park.

369
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,620
The amusement park?

370
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,220
I don't want to go to a place for kids.

371
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,720
Weilan, let's go without him.

372
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,740
He has no taste nor loyalty.

373
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,500
Really not going?

374
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,440
- I...
- I'll go anyway.

375
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,280
I'll go.

376
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,560
You don't have to go.

377
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,440
It's not like mahjong.

378
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,740
We don't have to all be there.

379
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,780
Eat slowly.

380
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,420
It's really good.

381
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,180
Eat more to replenish Vitamin C.

382
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,820
Stop playing. Gao.

383
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,020
I have something to tell you.

384
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,140
Go to the amusement park with me.

385
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,320
No.

386
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,960
I'm not going for fun.

387
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,340
I have an important task for you.

388
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,300
What task?

389
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,780
I plan to confess

390
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,620
to Duoduo tomorrow.

391
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,760
Really?

392
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes.

393
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,700
She's about to play in the league.

394
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,140
What if she's distracted?

395
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,260
Of course, I'm afraid.

396
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,420
But Duoduo told me that she wanted

397
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,320
to get good results in the league

398
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,220
before being with me.

399
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,860
I thought

400
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,370
if she knew my feelings

401
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,580
before the match,

402
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,020
she'd be more relaxed.

403
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,480
Tell me.

404
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,640
What should I do?

405
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,620
Still a good buddy.

406
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,660
Let's prepare a surprise for her tomorrow.

407
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,040
No problem.

408
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,580
There's Mario ahead.

409
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,820
- Look, I told you. Look at that.
- Look at that.

410
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,060
Pikachu.

411
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,680
- Hello.
- Are you hot?

412
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,200
Are you hot inside?

413
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,540
Let him shake my hand.

414
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,180
- I want to go from here.
- You're not bad.

415
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,440
You can interact with boys.

416
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,720
- Only the girls, huh?
- Look.

417
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,920
After shaking, they can

418
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,100
make a lot of bubbles.

419
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
- So beautiful.
- Yes.

420
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,920
Let's take a photo. Come on.

421
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,560
Let's take a selfie.

422
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,580
Come on, come on.

423
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,380
One, two.

424
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,980
Come on. One, two, three.

425
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,310
You two.

426
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,600
There's ice cream over there. I'll buy some.

427
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,680
Wait for me here.

428
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,620
- Okay.
- Okay.

429
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,700
Whether we succeed today

430
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,980
depends on you.

431
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,660
Don't worry. It'll definitely work.

432
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,760
It must succeed. It has to succeed.

433
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,740
Listen to me.

434
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,620
What are you saying?

435
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,980
Nothing.

436
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,300
Let's

437
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,660
separate today.

438
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,120
Why?

439
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,920
We rarely get a chance

440
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
to be alone together.

441
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,200
Why bring those two?

442
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,640
- Are you embarrassed?
- Yes.

443
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,500
Exactly.

444
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,400
He's embarrassed. Let's go.

445
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,700
Let's buy some bubble solution.

446
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,020
Where are they?

447
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,720
Don't mention those two.

448
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,120
They think we're a bit superfluous,

449
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,640
so they went off to have fun.

450
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,480
Well.

451
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
What about the ice cream? It's going to melt.

452
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,080
Don't worry. I'm here.

453
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,580
- Can you finish it?
- Let's go.

454
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,440
- Look at this.
- It's so high.

455
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,960
It must be 90 degrees.

456
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,460
It's okay. They'll come down
directly from the top.

457
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,380
Oh, my God.

458
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,720
Oh, my God. This is so thrilling.

459
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,980
Did you hear their screams?

460
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,880
- Really?
- It's so high.

461
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,960
It's so scary.

462
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,940
Are you afraid of this?

463
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,860
I'm not afraid.

464
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,600
I just think it's safer

465
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,680
if we don't play it.

466
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,640
We have a match coming.

467
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,480
Let's go.

468
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,340
It's very safe.

469
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,480
I swear.

470
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,860
Once you try it, you'll love it.

471
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,620
And I'm here with you.

472
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,520
Maybe from there.

473
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,000
Look, they'll go down from that bend.

474
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,840
Almost at the top.

475
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,680
Look.

476
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,280
Oh, my God.

477
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,640
This is so thrilling.

478
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,680
Look at them shouting.

479
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,580
So loudly. It must be scary.

480
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,520
♪Countless memories of you and me♪

481
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,880
♪Like building blocks stacking up♪

482
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,960
♪Unable to escape or leave♪

483
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,110
♪Don't worry about the trouble behind♪

484
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:12,190
♪Because I'm here♪

485
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,160
♪To help you smooth things out♪

486
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,280
♪I just want to be by your side♪

487
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,720
♪Whether you feel my love or not♪

488
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,620
♪I just wanna be by your side♪

489
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,280
This is so much fun.

490
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,340
Let's play again.

491
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,480
I think the most

492
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,080
thrilling part was that 90-degree drop.

493
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,540
The rest wasn't so exciting.

494
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,460
What's wrong? Are you okay?

495
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,960
You wanted to ride the roller coaster.

496
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,020
Why are you throwing up?

497
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,220
Ice cream. I ate too much ice cream.

498
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,340
Keep putting on a brave face here.

499
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,040
Wait here. I'll get you some water.

500
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,500
- Sit on the bench and rest.
- OK.

501
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,980
Hurry up. Hurry up.

502
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,320
What happened?

503
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,280
Too much ice cream.

504
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,680
Why eat so much ice cream

505
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,140
before the roller coaster?

506
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,260
Bro, everything's fine.

507
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,040
Yeah.

508
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,500
But we need to play more games.

509
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,240
- Good luck.
- Looks fun.

510
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,140
It will be worth it.

511
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,340
What are you saying?

512
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,120
Nothing. My mascot threw up.

513
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,520
He's too uncomfortable.

514
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,000
- It's fine.
- He threw up.

515
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,160
- It's okay.
- What to do?

516
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,100
I'll get you some water?

517
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,280
You two came.

518
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,360
What were you doing?

519
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,620
We tried the Fireball.

520
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,880
The Fireball.

521
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,040
Let me tell you.

522
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,120
It was so much fun.

523
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,980
The feeling was

524
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,600
like soaring freely in the sky.

525
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,800
It was so thrilling. You have to try it.

526
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,680
The one that swings in the air?

527
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,520
Yes, that's the best one here.

528
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,280
The others are just okay.

529
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,920
Sounds like fun.

530
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,000
Go ahead. It's very close.

531
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,960
Hurry and get in line.

532
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,860
I won't say more. We're going to line up.

533
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,880
- Go on.
- Okay.

534
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,090
- We'll try this.
- Bye.

535
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,440
- Bye-bye.
- See you later.

536
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,900
Sky.

537
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,400
Soaring.

538
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,020
Buckle up.

539
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,540
What were you two talking about?

540
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,300
Nothing.

541
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,800
Nothing?

542
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,160
Hiding something from me?

543
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,400
Afraid I'd find out?

544
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,700
Why do we have to leave them?

545
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,100
Leaving them is

546
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,500
to be with you alone.

547
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,700
Not gonna tell me?

548
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,100
- I'll go find them.
- Don't.

549
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,200
I'll tell you.

550
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,580
Shao's gonna confess.

551
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,360
That's it?

552
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,160
Why didn't you tell me?

553
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,000
Buckle up.

554
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,120
Would I have ruined it?

555
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm afraid you might ruin it.

556
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,140
I'd like them to be together.

557
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,640
Freedom.

558
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,500
Soaring.

559
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,480
Shao Nian.

560
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,140
Shao Nian, what's wrong?

561
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,540
I'm fine.

562
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,400
I'm telling you.

563
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,320
I think your advice

564
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,240
was very effective.

565
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,780
I'm not afraid at all now.

566
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,920
I can handle all

567
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,220
the most thrilling rides here.

568
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,760
That's great.

569
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,380
- You can do this.
- Yeah.

570
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,540
Do you think

571
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,540
this one will go very high?

572
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,600
I think it's okay.

573
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,780
I haven't tried it before.

574
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,880
But I saw a lot of people below.

575
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,960
Their reactions tell me

576
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,140
it might be more thrilling
than the roller coaster.

577
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,680
Really?

578
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,260
That's awesome.

579
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,340
Are you okay?

580
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,400
Really?

581
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,280
- Is it fun?
- Fun.

582
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,220
Fun, right?

583
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,600
How was it?

584
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,120
You came down, but your soul

585
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,460
seems still flying up there.

586
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,740
How is that possible?

587
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,700
Bro, your face doesn't look too good.

588
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,260
Are you afraid of heights?

589
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,500
Of course not.

590
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,240
I just ate too much ice cream today,

591
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,620
so my stomach is a bit unwell.

592
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,340
I see.

593
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,280
Then let's ride again.

594
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,860
Yes, go again.

595
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,340
You should go alone.

596
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,560
Okay, then I'll go again.

597
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,140
- You stay here with him.
- Go ahead.

598
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,860
Your strategy isn't working.

599
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,640
What do you mean?

600
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,100
He told me all about it.

601
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,560
You should use your brain.

602
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,160
You thought you could take her here,

603
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,200
scare her,

604
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,580
show her how macho you are,

605
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,340
and confess to her. That won't work.

606
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,260
It's counterproductive.

607
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,880
Especially with Li Guoduo.

608
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,640
She's so outgoing and brave.

609
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,840
Do you think

610
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,240
she's afraid of this?

611
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,880
It was Gao's idea.

612
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,960
Not mine.

613
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,680
I have a psychological basis for this.

614
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,760
Didn't we see?

615
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,640
But look at it now.

616
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,760
- It's useless.
- Fine.

617
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,980
Stop, stop, stop.

618
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,520
Do you guys even know

619
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,820
what girls actually like?

620
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,960
What do you like?

621
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,480
We like romance.

622
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,960
Romance. I understand now.

623
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,020
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

624
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,640
You need to create a romantic atmosphere

625
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
before your confession.

626
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,000
Then you'll succeed.

627
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,380
What girl wouldn't be moved?

628
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,580
That makes some sense.

629
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,860
So, what should I do?

630
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,680
Let me think.

631
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,620
He'll need your help.

632
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,840
He?

633
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,640
- Can you finish all this?
- It's tasty.

634
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,560
Try some.

635
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,100
Yes, I'll try.

636
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,400
You threw up so badly today.

637
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,280
Eat more

638
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,740
to make up for it, okay?

639
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,360
But

640
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,000
the roller coaster wasn't very high.

641
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,820
And you got so scared.

642
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,980
I didn't expect it to be like this.

643
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,020
Eat more. Eat more.

644
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,660
Cut him some slack.

645
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,520
When we were on the roller coaster today,

646
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,720
Gao was screaming the whole time.

647
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,280
His screams were even louder than mine.

648
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,760
My ears were going to go deaf.

649
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,920
Don't exaggerate it.

650
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,860
It's true.

651
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,620
Yes, yes.

652
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,340
I didn't even dare open my eyes.

653
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,940
He kept his eyes closed the whole time.

654
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,940
Here, here.

655
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,740
You eat.

656
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,340
No chicken wings left.

657
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,560
There are.

658
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,380
Is it enough?

659
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,740
Then I'll go buy more.

660
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,000
Go ahead.

661
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,840
I'm going.

662
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,960
Why are you spacing out?

663
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,060
Keep me company. Come on.

664
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,880
What's wrong with Shao Nian today?

665
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,980
Why do I feel like something's off?

666
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,980
You really can't see it?

667
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,040
He's messed up

668
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,340
the whole day's plan.

669
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,640
Take a photo of me.

670
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,400
- Right here.
- Okay.

671
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,500
Take a photo of the castle.

672
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,740
I'll change my pose.

673
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,260
Let me see.

674
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,160
Great.

675
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,780
You captured my beauty perfectly.

676
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,540
No wonder your drawings are so good.

677
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,800
Give me flowers for this.

678
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,900
You don't need flowers.

679
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,720
Why not?

680
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,420
Because you're prettier.

681
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,880
Where did you learn that line?

682
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,720
It's so cheesy.

683
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,100
From Xia Liqiang?

684
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,000
Yes.

685
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,800
It looks nice there too.

686
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,780
Let's go check it out.

687
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,320
Shao Nian.

688
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,100
Anything to say to me?

689
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,860
Today's arrangement

690
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,720
was great.

691
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,340
Thank you.

692
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,580
I know you must have something to say.

693
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,300
I hope you'll say it.

694
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,880
Shao Nian,

695
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,380
I hope you'll say it.

696
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,980
I'm standing right here.

697
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,840
Li Guoduo,

698
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,620
I've never met anyone like you.

699
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,140
No matter what difficulties you face

700
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,420
or what slanders you encounter,

701
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,380
you always accept them

702
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,900
with optimism

703
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,180
and kindness.

704
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,980
Before meeting you,

705
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,460
I thought everyone

706
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,250
harbored their secrets.

707
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,980
I did too.

708
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,810
But I found you're different.

709
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,730
You're especially pure

710
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,330

(Dafu BBQ)

765
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,680
Come on.

766
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,380
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

767
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,620
I'm really happy today.

768
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,940
Since Li Guoduo started to play,

769
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,380
I've been looking forward

770
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,700
to this day.

771
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,220
Now, this day has really come,

772
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,240
but I feel like

773
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,460
it's not real.

774
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,020
Playing beach volleyball is very hard.

775
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,380
My daughter

776
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,140
not only persevered

777
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,660
but made it to the national league.

778
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,060
Duoduo, I'm proud of you.

779
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,920
Thank you, Dad.

780
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,480
So, let's all make a toast

781
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,800
for Chen Weilan

782
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,260
and Li Guoduo

783
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,180
for making it to the national league,

784
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,280
- Sure.
- Cheers.

785
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,280
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

786
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,220
Congratulations.

787
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,740
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

788
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,140
As the coach, I have

789
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,120
something to say.

790
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,180
First,

791
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,340
I'm not a qualified coach.

792
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,300
I lied from the beginning,

793
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,300
impersonating my cousin

794
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,260
and causing trouble

795
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,820
for everyone here.

796
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,500
Lu,

797
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,380
you are our best coach.

798
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,580
I'm definitely not the best coach,

799
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,020
but I am the coach
who is most willing to help everyone.

800
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,520
During the time we've spent together,

801
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,740
I've truly been very happy.

802
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,160
Seeing each of you

803
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,180
strive

804
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,920
for your dreams

805
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,620
and work tirelessly

806
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,660
makes me feel

807
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,180
like I'm back in my school days.

808
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,500
The national league is about to start.

809
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,260
Our two strong players,

810
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,840
Chen Weilan

811
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,760
and Li Guoduo,

812
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,700
will represent us against the top

813
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,900
national competitors.

814
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,980
Here, I wish both of you

815
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,240
victory in advance.

816
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,640
Come on.

817
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,720
Thank you.

818
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,760
We can do this.

819
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,420
- Come on.
- Go for it.

820
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,220
- Come on.
- Of course.

821
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,420
To the coach.

822
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,280
Cheers!

823
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,200
- Coach.
- Cheers.

824
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,040
- To Lu.
- Cheers.

825
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,900
- Go for it.
- Go.

826
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,240
Gao, that's not enough.

827
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,560
I'll add more.

828
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,240
You two can't keep reminiscing.

829
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,360
The kids are hungry.

830
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,280
Hurry up. Start eating.

831
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,160
It's all cold now.

832
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,440
- Hurry up and eat.
- Eat more.

833
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,780
Come on, eat.

834
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,920
You eat.

835
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,460
Hurry up. Come on.

836
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,380
Come on, eat this.

837
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,880
Eat more.

838
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,360
Have a chicken wing.

839
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,200
Coach Lu.

840
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,160
- The match is not far off.
- Eat more.

841
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,540
Have you arranged everything?

842
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,040
Everything's set.

843
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,600
Rest assured this time.

844
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,680
Daxing knew I'd lead you

845
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,120
so he went over the schedule

846
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,240
with me in detail.

847
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,180
There shouldn't be any problems this time.

848
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,580
I trust you to handle things.

849
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,120
Our Duo is going on a long trip
for the first time.

850
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,860
Let me see if I can help you.

851
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,440
Nothing for you to do.

852
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,780
- Everything's set.
- Let me.

853
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,680
You'll need

854
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,140
to book a car

855
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,000
and a hotel, right?

856
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,780
You'll need to eat well.

857
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,780
I can do all that.

858
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,520
Well, Mrs. Li.

859
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,740
The organizing committee

860
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,880
has arranged everything.

861
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,600
We just need to find a car

862
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,080
and take everyone there.

863
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,420
I can handle the car.

864
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,940
I'll also get a driver for you

865
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,660
to make sure you arrive safely.

866
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,960
Let her help us.

867
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,020
Alright, then I'll leave this to you.

868
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,000
My pleasure.

869
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,420
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

870
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,080
(Mr. Qian)
Your mom is as excellent as ever.

871
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,920
Come on.

872
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,480
Come on. Come on.

873
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,520
I'm your logistical support.

874
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,380
- Come on, Auntie.
- Eat more, Duo.

875
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,440
- How is it?
- Eat.

876
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,380
How does it taste?

877
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,460
I haven't had time. Talk to you later.

878
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,840
Bye-bye.

879
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,440
What's wrong?

880
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,640
I'll bring the soup over.

881
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,980
- OK. Go ahead.
- OK.

882
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,220
I'll bring it over.

883
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,280
Be careful. It's hot.

884
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,360
