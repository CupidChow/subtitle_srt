Friends

19
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,500
can help us grow,

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,460
and so

21
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,140
can rivals.

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,320
So don't mind

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,360
which side of the net

24
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,900
we're on,

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,180
as long as we can progress together.

26
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,140
Do you want me to go in with you?

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,020
Tu Lingling must be there too.

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,300
She might mess things up again.

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,280
It's fine.

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,660
So worried about me?

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,280
Coach Tian takes good care of me.

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,000
I want to say a proper goodbye to her.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
I can't care about the others.

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,220
Are you sure?

35
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,520
Then I'll wait for you outside.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,540
Okay, don't worry.

40
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,400
Use strength.

Wrist, wrist!

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,500
Coach Tian.

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,320
Guoduo.

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,300
Take a 10-minute break.

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,620
Why haven't you come recently?

48
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,360
I heard from Lingling

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,180
that something's wrong with your school.

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
Yes.

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,420
But the school is investigating.

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,960
Coach Tian.

53
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,260
I came to tell you.

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,760
Thank you for your help

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,220
during this time.

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,380
I've thought it over.

57
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,540
I still want to go back to Xingang to play.

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,260
I guessed you were going to tell me this.

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,900
But I still hope you will reconsider.

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,080
Though I haven't been your coach

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,160
for long,

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,680
you can feel your improvement,

63
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,660
right?

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,620
No matter where you train,

65
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,780
I hope you'll set standards for yourself

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,460
in terms of time and quality.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,780
I will train hard.

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,680
But I've already decided.

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,420
I want to play with Chen Weilan.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,700
You can ask her to come play here too.

71
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,140
Thank you for your kindness, Coach.

72
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,520
After all, I study in Xingang.

73
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,360
My teammates and I built

74
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,220
the Xingang beach volleyball team.

75
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,940
I still want to be with them.

76
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,720
Since you've made up your mind,

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,020
I respect your decision.

78
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,740
Thank you for your understanding.

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,480
Then I'll go now.

80
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
I won't disturb you anymore.

81
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,440
Go ahead.

82
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,280
Duoduo.

83
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,960
Coach.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,340
Are you really planning to leave?

85
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,140
Not staying to train with us?

86
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,260
It's okay.

87
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,880
We're not in the same school,

88
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,220
but we can still play together.

89
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,680
Wait a moment.

90
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,200
Coach.

91
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,080
Can I have a word with Duoduo?

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,920
Ten minutes.

93
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,060
Okay, thank you.

94
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,140
Let's talk over there.

95
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,040
Duoduo.

96
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,620
Why are you still thinking
of partnering with Chen?

97
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,560
The two of you are

98
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,820
on different levels.

99
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,320
When you're with her,

100
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,760
others can't see your strengths.

101
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,460
They'll only say you're holding her back.

102
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,760
Stay and train with us.

103
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,600
Isn't that good?

104
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,960
I can't abandon her

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,940
and come here to escape

106
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,180
from my problem

107
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,620
just because she and I

108
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,180
have a big skill gap.

109
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,900
It's precisely because of the gap

110
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,180
that makes me see more clearly

111
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,880
how far I am

112
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,340
from becoming an excellent athlete.

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,840
So, I'm more motivated

114
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,060
to work hard to catch up.

115
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,540
That's what I should do now.

116
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,880
(Ocean University)

117
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,380
Stop being stubborn.

118
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,820
You've partnered with her for so long.

119
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
Her playing style

120
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,740
doesn't suit you at all.

121
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,320
And she's going to Beijing soon.

122
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,240
Are you going to chase her to Beijing?

123
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,540
No one's going to Beijing.

124
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,500
I'm staying in Xingang

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,440
and continuing to partner with her.

126
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,460
It's because you didn't make it into the NYT

127
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,860
so you're staying here, right?

128
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,120
If you had the chance,

129
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,260
you would've left long ago.

130
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,520
I'm not like some people,

131
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,560
who gave up their partner

132
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,100
for their own sake.

133
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,760
You're keeping Li Guoduo at Ocean Uni

134
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,480
because of Shao Nian, right?

135
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,020
How many times do I have to say it?

136
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,230
I like Shao Nian, so what?

137
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,600
Everyone knows

138
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,060
I like Shao Nian.

139
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,840
I want to keep Duoduo

140
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,160
training at Ocean Uni.

141
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,980
These two things aren't contradictory.

142
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,620
Besides, Duoduo just said

143
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,400
since coming to Ocean Uni,

144
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,620
her progress has been great.

145
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,040
Everything I've done

146
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,080
is for her good.

147
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,940
Enough.

148
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,360
Lingling.

149
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
I just told Coach Tian

150
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,940
very clearly.

151
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,280
I want to go back

152
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,500
and play with them.

153
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,220
I'll continue playing with Chen Weilan.

154
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,440
- Let's go.
- You're not helping me

155
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,280
with Shao Nian?

156
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
Tu Lingling.

157
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,140
Liking Shao Nian is your business.

158
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,260
It has nothing to do with me.

159
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,680
You mentioned it,

160
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,860
so I'll make it clear.

161
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,280
If Shao Nian tells me himself

162
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,300
that he likes you.

163
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,720
Then I bless you

164
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,780
and congratulate you.

165
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,360
I hope you can compete

166
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,780
for him fairly and justly with me.

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
If you keep scheming

168
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,340
behind my back,

169
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,700
I won't accept it.

170
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,560
You finally admit you like him.

171
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,400
Yes.

172
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,900
I like him.

173
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,800
There's nothing wrong with that.

174
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,500
Alright, stop talking. You can go now.

175
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,100
As for whom he chooses,

176
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,300
that's not for us to decide.

177
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,260
(Yuanxiong)

178
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,640
Jingxuan, thanks for this computer.

179
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,130
- It helped me a lot.
- My pleasure.

180
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,420
It's nothing.

181
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,640
But why did you suddenly want to watch

182
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,860
the video of Xiaojing's match
against Ocean Uni?

183
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,030
Gao Ge insisted that I go

184
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,600
to the library with him this afternoon

185
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,840
to look up some materials

186
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,060
and review the game.

187
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,180
Weilan, look. How does this dress look on me?

188
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,720
It looks good.

189
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,900
You didn't even look.

190
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,380
It is good.

191
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,020
How about this one?

192
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,020
What's the difference?

193
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,860
Completely different.

194
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
They're both white.

195
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,220
The styles are different.

196
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,100
You look good in both.

197
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,980
You have quite a lot of dresses.

198
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,800
Not really.

199
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,240
I'm always worried about not having

200
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,380
enough clothes.

201
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,720
You change clothes every day.

202
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,100
And you're worried about that?

203
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,100
Weilan.

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,280
I don't think I've ever seen you

205
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,620
wearing a dress.

206
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,440
You're always wearing

207
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,980
the same thing.

208
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,980
I think you could change it.

209
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,020
I won't change. This is convenient.

210
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,580
Look at this one. How about it?

211
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,100
I think it should suit you.

212
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,920
Here's this one back.

213
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,860
Okay.

214
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,620
What are you photographing?

215
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,960
Gao Ge.

216
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,200
What's up? Let's go.

217
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,080
You...

218
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,880
Why are you dressed like that?

219
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,780
What took you so long? Hurry up.

220
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,780
Wait a moment.

221
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,980
The air conditioning is strong.

222
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,960
- No need.
- Put this on.

223
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,880
No need.

224
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,140
Put it on.

225
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,620
Chen Weilan.

226
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,620
Chen Weilan.

227
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,820
Yesterday,

228
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,860
I watched Xue Chen's match video.

229
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,020
I found she is a bit like you.

230
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,240
So today I came here to see

231
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,740
if there are any of her materials.

232
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,960
Okay.

233
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,260
Her shoulder joint was also injured.

234
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,120
Very similar to yours.

235
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,400
But it didn't stop her

236
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
from becoming the top

237
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,540
beach volleyball player.

238
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,220
So?

239
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,760
So...

240
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,140
So, as long as

241
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,600
you can overcome difficulties,

242
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,160
injuries don't matter,

243
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,300
You can still play well.

244
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,760
Thank you.

245
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,580
I have one more thing.

246
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,580
You look good

247
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,660
in this outfit today.

248
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,060
But

249
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,280
when I'm not around,

250
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,900
can you not wear this one?

251
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,140
Why?

252
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,780
I'm a bit worried.

253
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,240
What's there to worry about?

254
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,940
I can take care of myself.

255
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,000
Come in.

256
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,620
Jingxuan.

257
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,080
I'm returning your dress.

258
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,020
Did you wear it?

259
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,180
I did.

260
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,880
Did Gao Ge see it?

261
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,940
What did he say?

262
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,520
He said your dress looks good.

263
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,920
He can't just say the dress looks good.

264
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,800
He meant

265
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,640
you're beautiful, making the dress look good.

266
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,740
But today, wearing this dress outside,

267
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,440
I was secretly photographed.

268
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,460
Secretly photographed?

269
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,160
Maybe someone who studies photography?

270
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,500
Thought you were a model.

271
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,120
Doesn't seem like it.

272
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,980
Gao Ge even shouted at him.

273
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,140
I'll head back now.

274
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,320
Bye-bye.

275
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,280
Bye-bye.

276
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,560
Does her family depend

277
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,140
on the restaurant for a living?

278
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,260
Yes, so what?

279
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,480
Their restaurant

280
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,980
is quite famous here.

281
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,880
Did I raise you

282
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,160
and send you to college

283
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,480
so you could do these

284
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,420
tiring jobs for them?

285
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,280
What's wrong

286
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,240
with being

287
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,460
with the person I like?

288
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,480
The person you like

289
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,800
may not want to be with you.

290
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,780
Impossible.

291
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,280
No need to tell me

292
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,640
about it anymore.

293
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,900
I have just two words:

294
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,080
I disagree.

295
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,400
I have three words:

296
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,320
I don't care.

297
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,780
Lingling is a very outstanding girl.

298
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,700
You should get to know her better.

299
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,000
Do you really want

300
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,180
me to get to know her?

301
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,020
Yes.

302
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,360
She's beautiful

303
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,480
and a good player.

304
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,160
So, I'm also going to Ocean University

305
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,340
as a non-roster player.

306
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,180
Professor.

307
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,260
It's you.

308
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,540
Here to see Shao Nian?

309
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,260
You remember me?

310
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,620
Is Shao Nian here?

311
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,820
No. He doesn't have class today.

312
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,220
Has he been very busy lately?

313
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,400
Yes.

314
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,420
His mother arranged for him to intern,

315
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,120
so it's hard to see him.

316
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,020
He's

317
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,160
very smart,

318
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,460
very suitable to be a doctor.

319
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,680
But

320
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,900
I think

321
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,400
as his girlfriend,

322
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,780
you should advise him well.

323
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,680
Doing all sorts of things now

324
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,980
is a waste of time.

325
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,020
I understand.

326
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,260
Thank you, Professor.

327
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,860
Mom,

328
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,860
can you try to understand me?

329
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,980
You want me to understand you.

330
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,020
Why don't you try to understand me?

331
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,220
You are our only heir.

332
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,780
The company's future

333
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,260
will be in your hands.

334
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,500
You have to inherit it.

335
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,780
Can I go back to the BBQ shop one more time?

336
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,980
Why?

337
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,220
Sweetie,

338
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,020
can you promise me

339
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,220
to intern at the hospital?

340
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,460
I promise you,

341
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,020
but I want to get my luggage back.

342
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,640
Alright.

343
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,060
Come back early.

344
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,080
(Dafu BBQ)
Miss, look at this one.

345
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,440
It suits you perfectly.

346
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,460
Uncle Li.

347
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Sorry.

348
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,680
There's a family issue.

349
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,300
I can't continue working here.

350
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,900
Shao Nian,

351
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,220
thank you

352
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,140
for helping us all this time.

353
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,340
I think you're great in many aspects.

354
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
I like you a lot.

355
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,860
You're too kind, Uncle Li.

356
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,900
I really like the atmosphere here.

357
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,020
If it weren't for my issues,

358
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,700
I would want to earn more money here.

359
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,220
Don't say that.

360
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,540
You're overqualified

361
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,180
for this job.

362
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,060
Uncle Li,

363
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,580
I'll be going now.

364
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,740
We'll meet again.

365
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,060
I'll transfer

366
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,220
your salary for this month.

367
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,420
You're too kind, Uncle Li.

368
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,180
I'll be going now. Bye-bye.

369
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,100
Bye-bye.

370
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,300
Did you tidy up your room?

371
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,260
Yes.

372
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,420
It's clean and tidy.

373
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,260
Don't worry.

374
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,340
Good that you're responsible.

375
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,780
Don't be lazy,

376
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,260
Help your mom more.

377
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,300
You're so lazy.

378
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,660
I know. Stop nagging.

379
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,540
You should go now.

380
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

381
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,540
Bye-bye.

382
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,740
It's suitable, see?

383
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,420
And there's a bargain today.

384
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,140
Uncle Liu, I'm leaving.

385
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,220
Bye.

386
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,580
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

387
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,500
Come check out the new swimsuits.

388
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,540
Let me see this one.

389
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,580
This is a new style.

390
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,940
It suits you perfectly.

391
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,220
Have a look.

392
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,500
There's a bargain now.

393
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,380
You really don't want to go to class, huh?

394
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,820
Did you see my face

395
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,700
when you mentioned it?

396
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,660
Alright. I won't mention it anymore.

397
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
I'm not angry

398
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,980
about you mentioning it.

399
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,940
I know why you're upset.

400
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,500
It's because I didn't support you.

401
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,660
You figured that out, huh?

402
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,460
I've deeply reflected on my actions.

403
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,140
As your good friend and mentor,

404
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,300
I feel it's my duty to help
and support your dreams.

405
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,980
- Sweetie.
- I'm back.

406
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,180
You're back.

407
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,700
Put your things down

408
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,140
and come eat.

409
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,270
There are sweet and sour ribs, your favorite.

410
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,380
I know, Mom.

411
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,380
(Outpatient)

412
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,700
Nurse.

413
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,860
Hello.

414
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,980
May I ask

415
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,340
where Dr. Shao is?

416
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,220
Dr. Shao is doing rounds over there.

417
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,380
Alright, I'll go find him.

418
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,620
- Thank you.
- No problem.

419
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,780
Mom.

420
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,620
Dr. Shao.

421
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,060
Though you're an intern,

422
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,380
the doctors at the hospital

423
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,740
have high praise for you.

424
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,140
(Nurse's Station)
Hello, may I ask if Dr. Shao is here?

425
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,740
Dr. Shao is doing rounds over there.

426
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,940
- Duoduo.
- Stop.

427
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,980
When will he finish?

428
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,140
Hurry and do the rounds.

429
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,500
I'm not sure.

430
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,300
How about you wait here for a while?

431
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,700
Alright.

432
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,900
Auntie.

433
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,020
How did you find this place?

434
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,020
I saw

435
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,540
Shao Nian throw away some paintings.

436
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,100
I thought it was a pity

437
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,780
because they're really good.

438
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,020
Look, he paints so well,

439
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,100
right?

440
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,140
It's really a waste to throw them away.

441
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,700
He was just doodling out of boredom.

442
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,740
He didn't take it seriously,

443
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,460
and you picked them up.

444
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,900
I just think

445
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,740
he's really talented

446
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,740
and passionate about painting.

447
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,780
You think it's good.

448
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,100
Does everyone else agree?

449
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,460
He can't make a living from it.

450
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,380
Young lady,

451
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,540
my son becoming a doctor

452
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,260
is his destiny.

453
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,500
Don't waste his time.

454
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,640
Take these paintings and leave.

455
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,980
(Nurse's Station)

456
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,620
Auntie,

457
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,620
I didn't bring them here

458
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,460
for any other reason.

459
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,500
I just think

460
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,220
Shao Nian is passionate about painting

461
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,740
and has been bravely

462
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,820
pursuing his dream.

463
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,340
I hope you can support him.

464
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,180
I believe

465
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,420
he will achieve great success

466
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,380
in painting.

467
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,060
Young lady, you're too naive

468
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,620
and idealistic.

469
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,220
People can't fight reality.

470
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,540
My son is busy working.

471
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,500
Don't interfere with his work.

472
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,700
Leave now.

473
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,780
Alright, Auntie.

474
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,300
Sorry.

475
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,860
Careful.

476
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,220
- Put it here.
- That one higher.

477
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,860
Where should I put this?

478
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,860
It's fine. Put it there.

479
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,820
I'll put it here first.

480
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,700
Come, come.

481
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,780
- Is this okay?
- Careful.

482
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,860
Put it here.

483
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,740
Be careful going up the stairs.

484
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,580
It's fine.

485
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,860

- Check it out.
- Hello.

549
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,980
May I ask how to contact

550
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,300
the artist of this painting?

551
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,860
Why do you want

552
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,940
to contact the artist?

553
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,420
I love this painting

00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,780

555
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,620
I want to buy it.

556
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,060
Buy it?

557
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,180
Yes.

558
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,380
I think you look

559
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,420
a lot like the person in the painting,

560
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,460
so I wanted to ask.

561
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,700
You must have a special

562
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,780
relationship with the artist, right?

563
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,540
We're very good friends.

564
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,940
But if you want to buy it,

565
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,420
you'll need to ask for his opinion.

566
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,900
I see.

567
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,180
Sorry, but our paintings are not for sale.

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,140
How could I not come?

571
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,260
You're the artist, right?

572
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,020
- Yes.
- Great.

573
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,980
I can pay a high price

574
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,100
for this painting.

575
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,900
Thank you very much for liking my painting,

576
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,180
but sorry,

577
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,980
none of the paintings here are for sale.

578
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,020
Shao Nian.

579
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,340
That's a pity.

580
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,900
I hope

581
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,220
you'll reconsider.

582
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,700
Thank you.

583
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,020
Bye-bye.

584
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,980
Shao Nian,

585
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,500
I think this is a great opportunity.

586
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,260
You shouldn't decide so quickly.

587
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,380
Look at your paintings.

588
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,020
I really think

589
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,060
they're great

590
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,260
and you have a lot of talent.

591
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,700
It's a pity to throw them away.

592
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,620
Look at me.

593
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,100
I'm not a talented player,

594
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,620
but I've persisted until now.

595
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,780
You're so talented.

596
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,300
You must keep going.

597
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,260
Got it?

598
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,800
You're right.

599
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,460
I should reconsider.

600
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,980
The paintings in this gallery

601
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,220
are all about our beach volleyball team.

602
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,340
They're our shared memories.

603
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,580
Especially this one.

604
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,460
It's very precious

605
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,100
to me.

606
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,300
Actually, I heard what you said

607
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,140
at the hospital.

608
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
Thank you, Duoduo.

609
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,900
Hey, everyone's gone.

610
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,460
Why are you still so serious?

611
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,300
What's wrong?

612
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,100
Let me show you something.

613
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,300
What is it?

614
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,820
Look.

615
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,620
The person with the camera in this photo

616
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,980
is probably the stalker

617
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,460
who followed Jingxuan a while ago.

618
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,980
Recently, I was in the library

619
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,260
wearing Jingxuan's dress

620
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,540
and he took secret photos of me.

621
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,140
Luckily, Gao Ge came quickly.

622
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,140
Though he ran very fast and we

623
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,980
didn't see clearly,

624
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,220
we can be sure

625
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,060
it's the same person.

626
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,140
So, he entered

627
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,980
the art exhibition with the camera

628
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,740
just to photograph Jingxuan?

629
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,540
What should we do?

630
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,900
Cancel the exhibition tomorrow?

631
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,460
No need.

632
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,060
We have thought of a solution.

633
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,860
But

634
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,500
we need your cooperation.

635
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,180
Me?

636
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,140
(Beach Volleyball Activity Room)

637
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,580
We've called the police.

638
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,700
Chen Weilan.

639
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,860
What's wrong with you?

640
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,100
How can you train before you

641
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,100
get the test results?

642
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,180
It might get worse.

643
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
I know

644
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,020
if my hand hurts, okay?

645
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,900
Alright.

646
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,260
You know best,

647
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,900
but does the ball know?

648
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,700
Will it avoid you because you're hurt?

649
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,740
It doesn't have eyes,

650
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,860
but I do.

651
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,500
See?

652
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,820
Can you always be ready?

653
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,780
I wasn't ready just now, but you

654
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,100
shouldn't grab it like that.

655
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,620
Come, I'll let you grab one.

656
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,020
You're being unfair.

657
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,700
Careful with your hand. Is it okay?

658
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,900
Enough, your hand is injured.

659
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,060
- Stop it.
- So childish.

660
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,060
Weilan.

661
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,620
Weilan.

662
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,100
Don't spike it.

663
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,380
My hand is fine.

664
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,380
Is your hand okay?

665
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,380
(Orthopedics)

666
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,340
Doctor.

667
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,740
How are the test results?

668
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,460
This time you're lucky.

669
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,020
You see, the impact didn't damage the bone.

670
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,980
The old dislocation injury from a year ago

671
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,300
hasn't recurred.

672
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,180
The swelling and pain

673
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,660
are just superficial injuries.

674
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,700
See? I told you.

675
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,540
I know my own body best.

676
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,140
So, there's no problem at all?

677
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,660
Not exactly.

678
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,780
A year ago,

679
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
she had an arthroscopic

680
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,820
surgery in Beijing.

681
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,580
The surgery results

682
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,860
are good so far

683
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,100
based on current X-rays,

684
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,260
but if you continue

685
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,180
with intense exercise

686
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,860
like this,

687
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,740
there's a risk of recurrence.

688
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,620
If it happens again, it could be dangerous.

689
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,020
So, in the coming days,

690
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,820
you must ensure plenty of rest

691
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,500
and stop exercising immediately

692
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,340
if your wrist feels uncomfortable.

693
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,940
Does beach volleyball

694
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,540
count as intense?

695
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,900
Of course.

696
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,900
It's very demanding.

697
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,700
But there's always a balance.

698
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,180
Just find the balance.

699
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,180
How precise

700
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,780
should the balance

701
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,700
be in terms of exercise?

702
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,900
Exercise tolerance

703
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,100
varies for each individual.

704
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,740
Everyone has a different constitution.

705
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,100
It depends on the person.

706
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,300
It varies for each individual.

707
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,260
However,

708
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,540
you must avoid

709
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,180
forward wrist movements

710
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,620
for now.

711
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,740
Isn't

712
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,260
that spiking?

713
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,940
So, no spiking?

714
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,900
It's best not to.

715
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,380
Dr. Wu,

716
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,180
here's the thing.

717
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,740
I mainly spike

718
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,540
in beach volleyball.

719
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,260
If I can't spike,

720
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,420
how can I compete in future matches?

721
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,820
Is there any way

722
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,300
to speed up

723
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,860
my wrist recovery?

724
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,740
Don't be too pessimistic.

725
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,020
It's not that you can never play again,

726
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,340
but you must wait until your wrist

727
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,740
is fully healed.

728
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,260
But remember,

729
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,580
no intense exercise

730
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,220
in the short term.

731
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,420
Focused on the stalker,

732
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,660
I left my stuff behind.

733
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,420
Mom, you're here.

734
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:54,980
Hello, Auntie.

735
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,500
These paintings

736
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,260
are quite interesting.

737
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,700
But this is a volleyball gym,

738
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,020
not a gallery.

739
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,140
It's inappropriate

740
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,660
and careless.

741
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,460
Auntie,

742
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,860
this place

743
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,140
may not compare to outside galleries,

744
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,260
but every part of it

745
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,940
has been thoughtfully arranged,

746
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,340
just like how Shao Nian

747
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,820
treats his paintings.

748
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,140
Why are you interrupting

749
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,340
when I'm talking to my son?

750
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,420
Mom, can you respect my friend?

751
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,140
Friend?

752
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,220
Just a friend?

753
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,180
Sweetie,

754
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,180
I've told you since you were young.

755
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,900
Birds of a feather flock together.

756
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,460
Choose your friends wisely.

757
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,620
Look at you now,

758
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,260
holding an art exhibition

759
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,100
in this shabby place.

760
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,340
You're a medical student,

761
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,980
destined to be a doctor.

762
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,420
Mom, stop. Let's go home.

763
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,460
Alright?

764
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,180
Auntie,

765
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,620
Shao Nian really loves painting

766
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,700
and has great talent.

767
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,060
It's his dream.

768
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,020
This exhibition has been very successful.

769
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,460
Someone wants to buy his paintings.

770
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,740
This is a huge recognition for him.

771
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,180
As someone closest to him,

772
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,060
can't you support him

773
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,420
instead of discouraging him?

774
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,420
I discourage him

775
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,540
so he can face reality.

776
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,460
You're his friend, right?

777
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,220
If he ends up penniless

778
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,420
on the streets,

779
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,900
will you still be his friend?

780
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,180
What if his art career

781
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,020
fails?

782
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,540
Will you be responsible?

783
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,540
You might support him now,

784
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,980
but I'm his discouraging mother,

785
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
who ensures

786
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,060
his livelihood and future

787
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,420
without any worries.

788
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,260
Auntie,

789
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,460
have you ever thought

790
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,940
that this might not be what he wants?

791
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,260
Ask him what he wants.

792
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,610
He doesn't even know.

793
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,940
I know what I want.

794
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,900
Leave me alone.

795
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,900
I am your mother.

796
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,500
I care about your future.

797
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,420
You choose your so-called friends

798
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,660
over me, your mother, right?

799
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,500
Mom,

800
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,580
I know both you and Duoduo care about me.

801
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,580
Let me put it this way.

802
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,420
No matter what happens,

803
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,540
I'll face the consequences.

804
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,580
Is that okay?

805
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,900
Shao Nian,

806
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,940
young people need

807
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,500
to think carefully

808
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,180
before making decisions.

809
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,980
Cut off his credit card.

810
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,820
Okay.

811
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,500
Sorry.

812
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,340
Should I not have talked back to your mom?

813
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,260
I didn't expect it to be serious.

814
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,660
You don't need to apologize to me.

815
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,500
The decision was mine.

816
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,980
I'll face the consequences.

817
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,740
But let me tell you.

818
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,580
I'm out on the streets now.

819
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,540
The room in your barbecue place

820
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,420
can't be taken away.

821
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
The rent can't go up.

822
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,340
Are you reliable or not?

823
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,900
We've circled the beach.

824
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,060
It should be just ahead.

825
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,460
They said it's nearby.

826
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,380
Let's go. We'll be there soon.

827
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,620
I think it's just ahead.

828
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,980
Is it there?

829
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,660
It seems to be there.

830
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,140
Let's go. It seems like it.

831
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,980
Hurry up.

832
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,540
That last spike...

833
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,500
Xiaojing?

834
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,340
Is she this strong now?

835
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,980
Everyone's improving secretly.

836
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,180
The previous shot was good.

837
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,900
Keep it up, and we'll see results.

838
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,020
We agreed before.

839
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,460
After these two matches, I'm done.

840
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,780
Black and white, written clearly.

841
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,900
Don't worry.

842
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,140
I won't bother you.

843
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,660
I know this coach.

844
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,220
Yan Xiaojing.

845
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,660
Come on.

846
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,940
How can you join the competition

847
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,100
without telling us?

848
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,340
Coach Wang.

849
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,420
Weilan.

850
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,420
Do you want to play here too?

851
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,900
Why aren't you

852
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,220
training at school?

853
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,060
Stop causing trouble.

854
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,940
Hurry up and leave.

855
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,500
We just wanted to come

856
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,860
and participate.

857
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,380
This isn't for you.

858
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,220
Hurry up and go.

859
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,140
Coach Wang, about the two matches,

860
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,140
I need to talk to you.

861
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,980
Let's go.

862
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,940
Wait for me.

863
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,780
Okay.

864
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,180
Yan Xiaojing actually

865
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,940
came to practice secretly.

866
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,820
What's wrong with Xiaojing?

867
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,580
She seems off.

868
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,980
Weilan.

869
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,020
Weilan.

870
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,300
- Coach Wang.
- Wait.

871
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,220
Hello.

872
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,060
Long time no see.

873
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,100
Long time no see.

874
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,620
What a coincidence.

875
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,460
We heard there was a competition here.

876
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,220
Didn't expect you'd be here.

877
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,460
I don't teach at Xingang University anymore.

878
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,380
I'm now coaching

879
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,420
at a professional club.

880
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,700
Professional club?

881
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,100
So, you've been promoted.

882
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,140
No, no.

883
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,140
There are too many restrictions
at the university.

884
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,380
In a professional club,

885
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,540
the pay is better.

886
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,060
I see you're interested in the matches.

887
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,800
Do you want to play in professional matches?

888
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,200
Sure.

889
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,940
We just need more matches.

890
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,820
Other things don't matter.

891
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,100
- Right.
- Okay.

892
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,220
We have

893
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,420
three matches a week here.

894
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,060
If you want to join,

895
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,780
I can arrange it for you.

896
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,940
Really?

897
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,140
Here's my business card. Take it.

898
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,220
- Thank you
- Thanks.

899
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,220
Think about it.

900
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,300
(Wang Dong)
If you decide,

901
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,700
- just call me.
- Okay.

902
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,820
- Alright?
- No problem.

903
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,820
- Good. Bye.
- Bye. Thanks.

904
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,220
- Okay, thanks.
- Thanks, Coach.

905
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,340
- Stay in touch.
- Okay.

906
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,180
Do you want to go?

907
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,380
Yes.

908
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,540
So decisive.

909
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,220
What's there to hesitate about?

910
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,140
The national team

911
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,060
sometimes picks players from such clubs.

912
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,460
If we go,

913
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,740
we might be selected.

914
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,300
Looks like you haven't given up

915
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,460
on the NYT dream.

916
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,070
If we can't make the NYT,

917
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,780
let's try for the national team.

918
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,020
It's also a way forward.

919
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,220
But I couldn't find anything online

920
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,140
about this Xinbo Club.

921
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,420
It should be fine, right?

922
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,200
It should be fine.

923
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,780
Playing more matches is good.

924
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,900
Consider it as training.

925
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,660
We must not lose to others.

926
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,500
Let's go.

927
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,180
Good shot.

928
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,460
(Baichuan One vs Xinbo One)

929
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,460
They have enough power but are too slow.

930
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,340
We should play fast.

931
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,580
Nice.

932
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,520
Again.

933
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,580
Good.

934
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,220
Go, go, go.

935
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,260
- Again.
- Come on.

936
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,140
- This shot's good.
- Okay.

937
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,140
Here it comes. Go.

938
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,340
Duoduo, Weilan, good play.

939
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,380
Thank you, Coach.
