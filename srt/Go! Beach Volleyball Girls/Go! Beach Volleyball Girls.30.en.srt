18
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,720
Listen.

19
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,140
I got too emotional today.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,500
Your cooking is pretty good.

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,940
Just verbal apologies?

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,260
Don't push your luck.

23
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,160
Then how about

24
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,480
you're punished

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,380
by eating my cooking for a month?

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
Actually,

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,320
I didn't mean it like that today.

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,260
I meant

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,740
you were different from other women.

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,420
I like unique women.

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,340
How am I different from other women?

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,980
Why can't you say one nice thing?

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,680
I'll cook for you.

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,140
I take that as a yes.

35
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,980
You're respected here.

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,820
You'll keep your word, right?

37
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,100
(Outpatient)

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,420
Doctor, how is it?

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,780
Nothing serious.

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,500
See? I told you.

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,640
They insisted on bringing me here,

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,000
troubling you.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,480
Doctor, can you prescribe

44
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,520
some preventive medicine for her?

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,860
She has an old wrist injury.

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,800
No, no, no need.

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
Dr. Wu gave me plenty last time.

48
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,840
Ignore her. Listen to me.

49
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,220
I'll give you some topical medicine

50
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,960
to promote blood circulation.

51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,900
- Okay.
- Sure.

52
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,920
Done. Go pay the fee.

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,940
Thank you, doctor.

54
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,340
I'll go.

55
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,460
I didn't realize

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,860
Gao Ge could be so caring.

57
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,740
You didn't realize it because you're blind.

58
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,320
Whether I'm blind or not doesn't matter,

59
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,420
as long as you're not.

60
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,590
Hello?

61
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,340
Weilan, your grandfather is hospitalized.

62
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,780
Alright, I'm coming.

63
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,880
What's wrong?

64
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,140
- Shao Nian.
- Weilan.

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,080
What happened to my grandpa?

66
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,560
He had a sudden heart attack.

67
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,080
- He needs surgery now.
- Surgery?

68
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,100
- Yes.
- Then.

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Please save my grandfather.

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,200
The head of brain surgery is operating.

71
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,160
He'll be fine.

72
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,240
Tell the doctor.

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,800
- Okay, calm down.
- Grandpa.

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,740
Grandpa.

75
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,720
- Calm down.
- What happened?

76
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,060
How did this happen?

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,800
Slowly, slowly.

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,100
Slowly, slowly, slowly

80
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,820

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,560
Don't worry.

83
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,500
It'll be okay. Don't worry.

84
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,500
It'll be okay.

85
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,780
It's going to be okay.

86
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,360
It'll be okay. Don't worry.

87
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,200
It'll be okay.

88
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,080
It's gonna be okay.

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,160

Grandpa will be fine.

(Operation Room, Anesthesia,
Extracorporeal Circulation, Blood Transfusion)

91
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,280
Eat something.

92
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,680
It's okay.

93
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
No need.

94
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,780
How much longer will it be?

95
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,180
Don't be anxious.

96
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,600
Weilan.

97
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,880
Mom.

98
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,620
Grandpa isn't awake yet.

99
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,440
It'll be fine.

100
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,000
Grandpa will be fine.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,120
He's been inside a long time

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,320
and hasn't come out yet.

103
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,180
Don't worry.

104
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,800
What if something happens to Grandpa?

105
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,180
Nothing will happen. He'll be fine.

106
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,040
He'll be fine.

107
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,940
Don't worry.

108
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,360
I was so scared.

109
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,600
You're finally here.

110
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,580
- Over.
- It's over.

111
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,120
- Doctor, how is it?
- Doctor.

112
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,200
- It's timely.
- How's he?

113
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,300
The surgery was successful.

114
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,020
The patient needs plenty of rest.

115
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,480
- Thanks, doctor.
- Thanks.

116
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,380
Thanks, doctor.

117
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,860
It's alright. Don't worry.

118
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,520
Don't cry.

119
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,860
It's alright now.

120
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,620
Don't cry.

121
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,900
Grandpa is fine.

122
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,120

(Activity Room)
- Here. - Out.

124
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,720
- Let's not.
- Quickly.

125
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
Can this work?

126
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,680
- It'll work.
- Definitely.

127
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,720
We've studied this.

128
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,040
- Come.
- Sit.

129
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,880
Sit down.

130
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,760
- Put this on.
- Okay.

131
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,580
Is this method scientific?

132
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,920
- Yes.
- We've

133
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,480
studied it thoroughly.

134
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,340
One.

135
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,720
Alright, slowly.

136
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,020
- Move your hand.
- Two.

137
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
Tape.

138
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,140
We've studied it for a long time.

139
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,700
Be careful with the tape.

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,260
Don't pull out my hair.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,840
I won't.

142
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,740
Gently, gently, gently.

143
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,180
- It hurts. Gently.
- Here we go.

144
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,520
Look.

145
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,760
Perfect.

146
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,500
Can I play with this?

147
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,680
No problem.

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,840
Let's go.

149
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,140
Three, two, one, go!

150
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,200
Great shot!

151
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,100
I told you it would work.

152
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,540
I told you.

153
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,360
- How is it?
- This is good.

154
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,200
- Isn't it?
- Good.

155
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,100
I think it's great.

156
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,240
Wait. Come back.

157
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,270
- I told you.
- Why?

158
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,110
Go there.

159
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,540
Again?

160
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,700
- Come on.
- Come on.

161
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,800
Grandpa.

162
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,320
Grandpa.

163
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,520
Dad, you're awake.

164
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,360
Grandpa.

165
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,700
You're finally awake.

166
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,820
You're here.

167
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,320
Grandpa Chen,

168
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,720
you're finally awake.

169
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,940
Weilan was so worried.

170
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,350
Weilan,

171
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,640
you and Duoduo

172
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,000
stayed up all night.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,360
Go rest.

174
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,080
Grandpa is awake now. Don't worry.

175
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,020
No, I want to stay with Grandpa.

176
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
Weilan.

177
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,140
Go rest.

178
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,080
Go.

179
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,740
I'm fine now.

180
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,600
No.

181
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,400
Go back.

182
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,380
You're not tired, but Duoduo is.

183
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,060
I'm fine.

184
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,100
Go rest. Listen.

185
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,220
Listen.

186
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,640
Go back.

187
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,800
Listen to Grandpa.

188
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,760
I'm here.

189
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,260
I'll tell you if anything happens.

190
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,380
I'll come see you this afternoon.

191
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,360
Go back.

192
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,620
Don't. Don't move.

193
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,180
Get some sleep.

194
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,560
I'm leaving now, Mom.

195
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,680
Call me if there's anything.

196
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,000
Grandpa, we're leaving now.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,860
- Rest.
- Thanks.

198
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,920
It's okay.

199
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,220
Dad, are you thirsty?

200
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
Hungry?

201
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,860
Then rest a bit more.

202
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,160
Come in.

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,020
You're back.

204
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,240
Go check the training ground.

205
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,780
Gao Ge's driving Xia crazy.

206
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,240
How is it? How is it?

207
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,080
- Good.
- How is it?

208
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,080
- How is it?
- How's it?

209
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,920
- Good.
- Useful?

210
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,760
I...

211
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,460
I just spiked.

212
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,100
Then my suffering wasn't in vain.

213
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,320
This device is primarily to make your wrist

214
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,200
feel protected

215
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,120
so you can spike.

216
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,020
You'll be able to perform at your true level.

217
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,320
It's like a psychological shift.

218
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,620
- Yes.
- Anyway,

219
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,000
she'll forget about her injury.

220
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,040
Once you're used to it,

221
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,000
you can remove it

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,840
before the match.

223
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,140
So sweet.

224
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,520
Thank you.

225
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,520
It's nothing.

226
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,020
No problem.

227
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,280
Who is she?

228
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,120
My mom.

229
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,980
(Medical Diagnosis)

230
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,920
Weilan, you know more

231
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,420
about beach volleyball than I do.

232
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,900
As a professional athlete,

233
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,660
you should know better than anyone

234
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,980
whether there's a future

235
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,740
with such an injury.

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,580
I know you love playing beach volleyball.

237
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,540
You can always play,

238
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,460
but not professionally.

239
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,340
Look at your grandfather.

240
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,620
He's not in good health

241
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,860
and getting older.

242
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,460
He needs someone to take care of him.

243
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,820
I've discussed it with him.

244
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,540
We're taking him to Beijing

245
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,040
for treatment.

246
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,340
He'll live with us from now on.

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,380
I've bought tickets for tomorrow.

248
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,420
Pack your things.

249
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,660
You're coming with us.

250
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm not studying anymore?

251
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
Study?

252
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,640
Did you come here

253
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,860
to study?

254
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,060
Can you really abandon me

255
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,420
and Grandpa

256
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,820
to stay here

257
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,900
for your so-called dream?

258
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,860
I'm not asking.

259
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,260
I've decided.

260
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,740
You've wasted over half a year here.

261
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,620
Pack your things.

262
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,940
Meet you at the airport tomorrow.

263
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,500
Careful, careful.

264
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,400
Dad,

265
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,920
how about you come

266
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,860
to Beijing with me?

267
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,220
I can find better doctors there.

268
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,360
Xiaohong,

269
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,380
I appreciate your concern.

270
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,460
I know my condition.

271
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,740
Don't waste more money.

272
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,660
Besides,

273
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,940
I've lived here all my life.

274
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,580
I might not adapt well

275
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,940
to Beijing.

276
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,660
Dad, don't overthink.

277
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,440
I'll be there for you.

278
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,820
I'll take good care of you.

279
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,200
How about this?

280
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,400
Well.

281
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,540
Take your time

282
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,740
to think about my suggestion.

283
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,220
I'm not going.

284
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,900
I won't go anywhere.

285
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,560
I'm old,

286
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,000

287
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,840
Dad,

288
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,940
don't be stubborn.

289
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,000
Let's just visit Beijing.

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,340

291

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,760
so will I.

295
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,200
I won't go anywhere. Right?

296
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,820
- Right.
- Stop joking.

297

Mom, I'm serious.

298
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,460

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,320

385
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,440

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,680
with a dream,

387
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,760

388
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,960
to sweat

389
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,500
and perform their best

390
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,460
on our court.

391
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
So, athletes, let's

392
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,880

393
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,460

00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,960
Welcome

397
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,680
to our live broadcast.

398
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,040
Let me show you around.

399
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,100
These are our cheerleaders.

400
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,640
This year's teams aren't

401
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,560
very threatening.

402
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,060
Just play normally.

403
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,520
Don't be nervous.

404
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,860
- Don't be nervous.
- Right.

405
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,360
Come on.

406
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,900
- Look here.
- Don't worry.

407
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,520
Let's greet the players.

408
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,360
Let's see

409
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,620
today's players.

410
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,040
Hello.

411
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Welcome to the New Seven-School League.

412
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,360
Wow, now you're a host too?

413
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,200
Of course.

414
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,520
Captain, I'm multitasking here.

415
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,740
Shouldn't I get a raise?

416
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,880
Sure, no problem.

417
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,320
If we win, you get a raise.

418
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,700
- Deal.
- Give me a raise too.

419
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,100
- Stop joking.
- Stop it.

420
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,180
Where are they?

421
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,000
Weilan.

422
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,260
Your mom and grandpa are here.

423
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,900
Slow down, Dad. Sit down first.

424
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,680
I'll go over there.

425
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,520
Okay.

426
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,020
Weilan doesn't seem in a good mood.

427
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,620
Hope it doesn't affect her.

428
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
- Grandpa.
- My granddaughter.

429
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,680
- Slow down, Dad.
- Why did you come?

430
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,160
You're not fully recovered yet.

431
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,840
Of course, I had to come.

432
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,040
Not only did I come,

433
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,240
but I also want to film your whole

434
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,300
championship process.

435
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,520
I've been in the hospital for over a month.

436
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,360
I was bored to death.

437
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,920
I needed to get out for a walk, right?

438
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,000
Alright, sit down, Dad.

439
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,140
Help Grandpa sit down.

440
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,400
What kind of venue is this?

441
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,440
So simple.

442
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,680
Like it's a joke.

443
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,420
How is this a joke?

444
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,440
We put a lot of effort

445
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,700
into building

446
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,040
this proper venue.

447
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,460
We even have sponsors.

448
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,040
Looks like a small-time

449
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,060
competition to me.

450
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,340
Can you say something nice?

451
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,140
Don't underestimate them.

452
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,280
They might

453
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,560
achieve something big here,

454
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,400
right?

455
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,800
Sit down.

456
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,640
Fine.

457
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,040
I'm here today

458
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,300
just to remind her

459
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,700
of our agreement.

460
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,700
Do your best.

461
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,960
- We'll see.
- Go, Xingang!

462
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,280

465
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,980
How's it going?

466
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,820
We have to win

467
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,580
this match.

468
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,440
Absolutely.

469
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,500
Let's change.

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,620
- Go, go!
- Go!

472
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,360
They look in good form.

473
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,480
Go!

474
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,660
Seems to be exciting.

475
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,320
Both teams are ready.

476
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
Welcome to the 1st match

477
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,280

Our host Xingang University

479
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,060

- Alright.

481
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,960

Nice shot. Keep it up.

490
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,300
Great angle on that shot. Well done.

- Don't get it.
- Don't.

494
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,000
- I didn't.
- Mine.

495
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,200
It was right here.

496
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,480
- It was mine.
- No, it wasn't.

497
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,340
I was supposed to receive it.

498
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,260
Work together.

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,140
(Xingang vs City)

500
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,880
Didn't they practice

501
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,340
coordination during training?

502

Great job!

505
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,600
How nice!

506
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,040
My granddaughter is playing so well.

507
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,880
Nice!

508
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,740
You should've spiked diagonally.

509
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,160
You should've...

510
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,180
I know, but we won the point. Okay?

511
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,740
The blocking scores. Good job.

512
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,800
Great spike.

513
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,320
Great!

514
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,880

Congrats

515
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,360
to them for advancing to the second match.

516
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,300
Won!

517
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,740

519
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,980
- Good job.
- Good job.

520
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,200
Li Guoduo, that last point was risky.

521
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,240
With a better angle,

522
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,500
I'd have spiked it.

523
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,320
We won,

524
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,480
didn't we?

525
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,560
We got the point.

526
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,700
It was too risky.

527
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,860
- What if we had lost?
- Well.

528
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,780
Can you focus?

529
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,840
I...

530
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,920
Adjust your angle accordingly, okay?

531
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,820
I can't lose this match.

532
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,640

00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,340
In such matches, who doesn't make mistakes?

573
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,320
Defending Li Guoduo is fine,

574
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,620
but there's a limit.

575
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,780
In beach volleyball,

576
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,060
communication and coordination are key.

577
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,960
Is that what Chen Weilan is doing?

578
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,260
She's just scolding her.

579
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,340
Alright. Stop arguing.

580
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,220
Winning the match is what matters.

581
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,320
You did win.

582
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,620
But look at your injury.

583
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,720
What about my injury?

584
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,760
It's just a surface wound.

585
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,120
All players get injured.

586
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,180
I'm fine.

587
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,320
Come with me to the infirmary.

588
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,160
No need.

589
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,640
Weilan,

590
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,140
Duoduo is also hurt.

591
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,540
Understand her.

592
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,880
We won this match.

593
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,100
Focus on the next one.

594
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,220
Don't bother me. Leave me alone.

595
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,320
Okay.

596
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,480
Weilan.

597
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,080
Grandpa.

598
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,180
- Dad, slow down.
- Okay.

599
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,300
You and Duoduo coordinated well.

600
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,740
Great performance.

601
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,160
Many people in the stands were saying

602
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,020
they've never seen such teamwork.

603
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,980
That quick attack

604
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,080
was amazing.

605
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,220
Dad, stop flattering her.

606
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,000
What's the point of winning?

607
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,980
Was that really teamwork?

608
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,280
How is that not teamwork?

609
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,860
It was beautiful teamwork.

610
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,260
Ask her yourself.

611
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,440
I will. It was great.

612
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,380
Right?

613
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,800
Your mom said

614
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,640
she'd cook something nice tonight.

615
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,700
We'll go to the shop.

616
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,340
Let's go.

617
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,960
Nice job.

618
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,580
- Slow down.
- Slow down.

619
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,400
Slow down, Dad.

620
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,700
Grandpa, slow down.

621
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,920
Come on.

622
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,200
First, let's congratulate

623
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,420
Weilan on another victory.

624
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,740
Today's match

625
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,980
was thrilling.

626
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,780
It's a hard-fought win

627
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,180
worth celebrating.

628
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,100
Let's toast.

629
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,940
It's rare for our family to be together.

630
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,060
Your mom traveled a long way to see us

631
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,380
and took care of me for many days.

632
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Shouldn't you

633
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,740
toast to her for me?

634
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,140
Here, Mom.

635
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,660
Thank you for taking care of Grandpa

636
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,340
and for taking the time

637
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,180
to watch my match.

638
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,620
It's a good thing I came.

639
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,720
Weilan,

640
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,440
I have to say

641
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,340
staying here is a waste of time and life.

642
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,100
Here we go again.

643
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,160
Xiaohong,

644
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,020
we're happy today.

645
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,300
Enough about this.

646
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,800
Dad,

647
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,900
you watched the match.

648
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,660
With Weilan's high school level,

649
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,100
she shouldn't have lost the first set today.

650
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,880
By the second set,

651
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,460
she should've won 2-0.

652
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,800
But today was really tough.

653
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,760
I know

654
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,800
how I played.

655
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,660
You don't.

656
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,600
Your beach volleyball level

657
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,660
is on the decline.

658
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,960
Look at your old rival,

659
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,800
Lang Yueting.

660
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,740
She's now a key player on the NYT.

661
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,520
- And you?
- Why mention her?

662
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,500
Why can't I?

663
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,700
Why can't you face reality?

664
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,900
There's indeed a gap between you.

665
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,340
It seems to me

666
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,900
that your level has dropped,

667
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,540
and you've lost your spirit.

668
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,100
And you're clinging to your little pride.

669
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,220
Did I ever have pride in your eyes?

670
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,200
Sorry, Dad.

671
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,840
Move over a bit.

672
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,180
Let me sit down for a while.

673
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,020
Swinging on this little swing.

674
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,440
Weilan,

675
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,100
do you remember?

676
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,180
When you were little,

677
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,600
every summer vacation,

678
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,940
you'd come here to play.

679
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,780
I used

680
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,180
to take you to the beach,

681
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,680
and you loved

682
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,160
chasing the waves,

683
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,100
running around.

684
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,660
The whole beach

685
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,290
was filled with your happy laughter.

686
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,100
That was great.

687
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,480
Later on,

688
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,540
you grew up,

689
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,420
started playing volleyball,

690
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,400
and rarely came

691
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,810
to see me.

692
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,470
But

693
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,770
your happy little figure

694
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,900
has always stayed in my mind.

695
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,900
It was unforgettable.

696
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,510
Do you know?

697
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,940
You coming here for college

698
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,700
was the happiest thing for me.

699
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,360
But

700
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,660
I found

701
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,140
that the happy little Weilan

702
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,220
had disappeared.

703
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,680
She's gone.

704
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,320
Child,

705
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,780
life is short.

706
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,340
It passes quickly.

707
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,540
Doing one thing well isn't easy,

708
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,960
let alone

709
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,780
being the best.

710
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,860
Child,

711
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,180
I think the issue between you and your mom

712
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,060
is a lack of communication.

713
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,220
You need to tell her what you want.

714
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,800
You need to let her know

715
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,500
what you really want.

716
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,620
Grandpa, how should I communicate with her?

717
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,840
I've already told her

718
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,120
I just want to play volleyball.

719
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,920
I just want to play it well.

720
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,200
She just won't let me.

721
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,640
I don't understand why.

722
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,920
She insists I become a successful person.

723
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,420
But everyone defines success differently.

724
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,740
If I perform well in every match

725
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,320
and win first place

726
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,240
and championships,

727
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,120
isn't that okay?

728
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,720
Isn't that success?

729
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,680
Why does she see it

730
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,100
as a waste of time?

731
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,840
The more she does it,

732
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,420
the more I want to prove it to her.

733
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,660
Every match, I want to win first place.

734
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,460
She wants everything to go
according to her plans.

735
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,340
Go! Go!

736
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,700
Go! Go!

737
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:46,420
Go! Go!

738
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,080
Pass this. Go.

739
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,160
Go! Go!

740
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,700
(Xingang Uni vs Medical Uni)
Good.

741
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,720
Well played.

742
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,980
That shot was beautiful.

743
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,840
- Good.
- Beautiful.

744
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,930
- Beautiful.
- Good.

745
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,730
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful.

746
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,440
Congrats to Xingang Uni

747
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,800
- The finals.
- for advancing

748
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,640
to the finals of the league.

749
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,550
- Good.
- Good.

750
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,440
Did you see it?

751
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,980
We're in the finals!

752
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,930
- Amazing!
- Amazing!

753
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,560
- Great!
- Amazing!

754
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,600
- Nice!
- Well played!

755
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,820
Congratulations on making it to the finals.

756
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,000
Congratulations!

757
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
How about we go out for dinner tonight?

758
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,520
- To celebrate.
- Must do.

759
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,720
Find a place. My treat.

760
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,640
I'll find a place now.

761
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,480
Hurry up.

762
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,660
You all hang out tonight.

763
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,800
I have to train.

764
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
You just finished the match. Are you tired?

765
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,100
Do you need a rest?

766
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,240
Yeah.

767
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,720
No need.

768
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,120
See you at eight tonight

769
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,960
at the court.

770
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
I just remembered

771
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,920
I had something to do tonight.

772
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,960
Not everyone's here today.

773
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,200
How about we gather another day?

774
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,500
No, we said we'd celebrate together.

775
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,840
Are you planning to secretly meet Wenjie?

776
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,400
Have him come along.

777
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,300
No.

778
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,440
It's too tiring.

779
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,720
We still need to train tonight.

780
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,060
We don't have to do it.

781
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,040
There's plenty of time. Let's eat first.

782
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,080
I can train after dinner.

783
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,100
Let's go.

784
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,990
- Let's go.
- Go.

785
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,260
Duoduo's family's food is really delicious.

786
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,360
It's really good.

787
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,880
- Let's have a drink.
- Come on.

788
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,440
Here it comes. Barbecue's here.

789
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,280
Quick, quick!

790
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,280
Eat as much as you want.

791
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,400
My treat. Dig in.

792
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,560
- Smells good.
- Smells good.

793
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,600
Stop working.

794
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,720
Come sit and eat.

795
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,840
It's fine. I have more.

796
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,880
I'll join you soon.

797
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,980
You go first.

798
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,670
- What?
- Why?

799
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,510
What's wrong?

800
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,600
What's wrong?

801
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,100
- Come here.
- It's nothing.

802
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,580
What's wrong? Let me see.

803
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,060
- It's okay.
- Kebabs.

804
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,400
What's the matter?

805
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,080
Duoduo, what happened to your arm?

806
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,440
- Let me see.
- It's nothing.

807
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,460
Don't overreact.

808
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,900
- Let me see.
- It's okay.

809
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,400
It's a serious injury.

810
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,240
You didn't tell me.

811
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,140
We need the hospital.

812
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,120
- It's fine.
- Let's go.

813
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,760
- You should go.
- Go.

814
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,600
It's okay.

815
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,440
It's dripping.

816
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,940
When will it stop?

817
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,660
Just wait.

818
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,860
Can I not have this?

819
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,700
Can you not use your arm?

820
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,840
I've been telling you

821
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,920
not to get it wet,

822
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,880
but you didn't listen.

823
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,280
I'm in training every day.

824
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,860
I can't be that careful.

825
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,120
I feel like my eyelids are heavy.

826
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,140
I want to sleep.

827
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,380
Alright, sleep.

828
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,360
I still need to train.

829
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,200
Wake me up later.

830
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,620
Okay. Don't worry.

831
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,900
Why aren't you eating BBQ?

832
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,220
I see

833
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,620
you're stressed.

834
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,840
Let's talk.

835
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,580
Which eye sees me stressed?

836
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,600
Why didn't you

837
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,780
eat with the team today?

838
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,380
It's a waste of time.

839
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,080
Look at this.

840
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,280
What is it?

841
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,520
Strategy chart.

842
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,520
See?

843
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,260
These black dots represent

844
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,360
each player's

845
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,620
position.

846
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,140
Different diagrams of strategy

847
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,420
for different positions.

848
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,120
Did you draw this?

849
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,860
This is the experience I've gathered from years

850
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,980
of playing and watching beach volleyball.

851
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,320
With this,

852
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,860
winning a championship

853
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,100
should be no problem.

854
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,540
Is it only my duty?

855
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,020
Are you done?

856
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,700
Go eat with them.

857
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,760
I'll practice more.
