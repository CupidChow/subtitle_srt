18
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,780
Gao.

19
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,700
Gao Ge.

20
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,140
Long time no see. What are you doing here?

21
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,420
Is the registration
for the beach volleyball team here?

22
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,380
He is in charge.

23
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,020
Gao.

24
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,700
Let's go.

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,900
He is always like this. Let's go.

26
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,180
Qiang.

27
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,660
Bro.

28
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,500
You're here.

29
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,740
She is here to register.

30
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,180
Do you guys know each other?

31
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,340
Yes, we do.

32
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,780
It's my good friend, Xia Liqiang.

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,340
He is the captain of the beach volleyball team

34
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,500
of Xingang University.

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,820
Qiang.

36
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,300
Captain Xia.

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,620
Nice to meet you. I am Li Guoduo.

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,300
I want to join the beach volleyball team.

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,780
You play beach volleyball?

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,300
Let me give you a piece of advice.

41
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,220
You might not even be able

42
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,060
to reach that net.

43
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,660
You're underestimating me.

44
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,180
I have been playing beach volleyball
for many years.

45
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,460
I played pretty well.

46
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
How come

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
you're also interested in beach volleyball now?

48
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,180
No, it's me. He doesn't know how to play.

49
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,620
Just because I don't know how to play doesn't
mean I can't join the beach volleyball team.

50
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,020
I can also be an assistant

51
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,460
or medical staff.

52
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,220
I've been advising you for so long.

53
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,060
And you don't even come.

54
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,740
Does this freshman girl

55
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,780
succeed in persuading you?

56
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,260
What nonsense are you talking about?

57
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,460
It's because this beach volleyball team

58
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,420
has no members at all.

59
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,500
I think you're pitiful.

60
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,460
So I come over and help you out.

61
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,980
Li Guoduo, right?

62
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,820
Yes.

63
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,740
So that's the situation.

64
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,700
In Xingang University,

65
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,300
we only have a men's beach volleyball team.

66
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,860
There is no women's beach volleyball team yet.

67
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,980
No women's beach volleyball team?

68
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,740
Captain Xia, as the saying goes,

69
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,290
women can hold up half the sky.

70
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,140
If the Xingang University

71
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,420
doesn't have a women's beach volleyball team,

72
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,380
it's like a person

73
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,500
missing a hand.

74
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,820
Yes, Qiang.

75
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,180
If one person loses a hand,

76
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,140
- that's really not good.
- But there's nothing I can do about it.

77
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,300
I'm about to graduate soon.

78
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,340
Are you about to graduate?

79
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,180
Well, that works out perfectly.

80
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,700
In this limited time,

81
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,460
you must want to do something meaningful.

82
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,020
You must want the school to remember you,

83
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,180
and your classmates be grateful to you.

84
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,300
Then you can establish
a women's beach volleyball team.

85
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,620
It is a very meaningful thing.

86
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,660
- Yes.
- But...

87
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,500
No "but".

88
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,240
You set up a women's beach volleyball team.

89
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,940
There would be prizes in competition.

90
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,180
If you get the prize money,

91
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,380
the school will pay more attention to us

92
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,860
and allocate more funds in the future

93
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,740
to our beach volleyball team.

94
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,220
This activity room

95
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,820
can be expanded several times in the future.

96
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,540
You are making contributions to others.

97
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,340
Yes, Captain Xia, think it this way.

98
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,700
If you form a beach volleyball team,

99
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,340
younger students

100
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,460
should be very grateful to you.

101
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,700
You will be remembered in history forever.

102
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,020
Then...

103
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,220
Okay.

104
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,420
But now we don't have any team members.

105
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,660
It's okay. I'm here, right?

106
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,180
I may be able to

107
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,980
be captain or something like that.

108
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,260
Then where are your teammates, Captain Li?

109
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,340
It's simple.
Isn't today the day of recruitment?

110
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,300
Let's choose carefully.

111
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,860
There will definitely be several good members.

112
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,580
I think so too.

113
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,940
Hello, everyone.

114
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,980

Get up and shout.

I'm the team captain.

152
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,260
It's not good for me to shout.

153
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,380
It's all because you're the captain.

154
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,540
You need to take your responsibility.

155
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,380

170
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,860
Do you wear a bikini to play beach volleyball?

171
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,140
Yeah, a sports bikini.

172
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,820
Great!

173
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,300
Finally I can

174
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,060
show off my good figure.

175
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,940
Is playing indoors?

176
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,940
- Or outdoors?
- Outdoors.

177
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,340
Beach volleyball is played on the beach.

178
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,900
So I will get tanned
from being in the sun for so long.

179
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,980
Yes.

180
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,740
In the games aired on TV,

181
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,820
those female players are all tanned.

182
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,740
Really?

183
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,940
Forget it.

184
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,060
It's okay.

185
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,380
Isn't that Gao Ge?

186
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,340
Please help me take a photo.

187
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,210
Really.

188
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,500
- Is he also in the beach volleyball club?
- What's going on?

189
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,340
What's going on?

190
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,540
Yes, he is.

191
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,420
Take another one, take another one.

192
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,100
Is it done? Is it done?

193
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,180
Please take a photo of me quickly.

194
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,700
Hello, I want
to join the beach volleyball club.

195
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,980
That's great.

196
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,940
Then register quickly.

197
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,460
But I have never played
beach volleyball before.

198
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,820
Why do you want to join us?

199
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,020
Join the beach volleyball club,

200
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,620
and I can see him every day.

201
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,980
That one.

202
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,380
Everyone, pay attention.

203
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,220
Hold on, don't take photos now.

204
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,860
Follow me and you will see him.

205
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,220
- Really?
- Really?

206
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,060
Can I see him?

207
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,940
- Of course.
- That's great.

208
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,980
(Beach volleyball room)

209
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,740
Gather.

210
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,260
First of all,

211
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,860
thank you all for participating.

212
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,700
Today's selection is over.

213
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,860
You can go back and rest now.

214
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,460
If there are any arrangements,

215
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,340
I will inform you.

216
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,340
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

217
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,500
Yang Jingxuan.

218
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,700
Please stay here for a moment.

219
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,700
Did you play beach volleyball
in high school before?

220
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,460
No, I only watched Gao Ge play it.

221
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,100
But I just saw you spike the ball

222
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
pretty hard.

223
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,420
Really?

224
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,340
So, am I selected?

225
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,180
Starting from today,

226
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,060
you are a member of us.

227
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,900
Really?

228
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,100
Now I can play with Gao Ge.

229
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,940
Right?

230
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,100
Go back and rest quickly.

231
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,060
- Okay, thank you.
- Goodbye.

232
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,420
Don't forget to come to training tomorrow.

233
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,260
Okay.

234
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,300
See you tomorrow.

235
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,220
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

236
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,580
She plays pretty well.

237
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,900
Let's have lunch together at noon.

238
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,460
I won't eat with you guys.

239
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,620
Xiaojing is looking for me.

240
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,700
You're really henpecked, aren't you?

241
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,340
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

242
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,460
How was the recruitment today?

243
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,540
It's okay.

244
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,900
Among so many girls,

245
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
we just pick one out.

246
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,580
One?

247
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,100
That's also a good start, right?

248
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,220
- Yeah.
- Let's have lunch.

249
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,060
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

250
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,700
Xiaojing.

251
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,100
What's the rush?

252
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,820
The Academic Affairs Office
asked me to go over.

253
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,180
They said I didn't have enough credits.

254
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,660
But the elective courses have already ended.

255
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,740
What should I do?

256
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,340
This is so unfair.
How many credits do you need?

257
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
Just four points.

258
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,660
Actually, just one elective course is enough.

259
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,020
How about this?

260
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,100
Join our beach volleyball team.

261
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,940
You are not focusing on your work.

262
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,220
Can you not bring me along?

263
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,980
Did you forget that

264
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,140
participating in society events

265
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,180
can bring extra credits?

266
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,220
I'll arrange a title of captain for you.

267
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,580
Then won't you have enough credits?

268
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,580
Is it true?

269
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,100
Playing beach volleyball is so much fun!

270
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,580
Then I'll invite my dorm mate Xixi as well.

271
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,700
She didn't earn enough credits either.

272
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,140
She has delicate skin and tender flesh.

273
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,260
The one who is coquettish.

274
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
Can she do it?

275
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,660
She can also play it well.

276
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,740
Don't forget her ex-boyfriend
also played beach volleyball.

277
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,540
What? Ex-boyfriend?

278
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,540
When did they break up?

279
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,860
Do you care a lot?

280
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,740
When did they break up?

281
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,900
No, I don't care.

282
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,100
What about tomorrow,

283
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,740
we meet at the beach volleyball club?

284
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,020
Okay.

285
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,340
Duoduo.

286
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,260
Does Gao Ge usually come to training?

287
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,220
Just rest assured.

288
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,380
As long as you train well,

289
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,500
I think it's going to get Gao Ge's attention.

290
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,820
Well, tonight,

291
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,340
can I meet you in your dormitory?

292
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,700
Can you teach me the basic knowledge
of beach volleyball?

293
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,580
Sure, you can come to me directly.

294
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,220
But it may not be possible tonight.

295
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,020
I need to go home to help my family.

296
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,380
I envy that you can go home.

297
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,780
You know what?

298
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,140
Our dormitory

299
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,740
is haunted.

300
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,620
Haunted?

301
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,180
In the bathroom on the east side,

302
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,220
I always hear a thumping sound.

303
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,420
It's quite scary.

304
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,100
Is it true?

305
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,940
Really.

306
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,220
Could it be an auditory hallucination?

307
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,700
I don't know either.

308
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,660
Anyway, it's very scary.

309
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Oh my goodness.

310
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,980
(Dafu BBQ)

311
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,820
Dad, Mom, I'm back.

312
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,820
Why did you come back
without attending the class?

313
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,820
I came back to help you with the work.

314
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,580
Good.

315
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,460
(Dafu BBQ)
Can you post this recruitment ad

316
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,300
at the door?

317
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,580
Recruitment advertisement?

318
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,140
Didn't we lay off staff?

319
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,300
Why are we still recruiting?

320
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,660
You went to school.

321
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,900
Just the two of us left.

322
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,140
Do they want us to work hard to death?

323
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,700
Don't listen to your dad's nonsense.

324
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,020
A few days ago,

325
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,100
the police station came to us.

326
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,020
They said the scammer had been found.

327
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,140
But,

328
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,780
we can only get a small proportion
of our money back.

329
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,700
So we think

330
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,300
we can hire a temporary worker.

331
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,340
The second floor is empty, isn't it?

332
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,300
If we provide meals and accommodation,
we can save some money.

333
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,340
It's okay.

334
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,460
I'll also

335
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,340
send some messages in my university.

336
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,780
I think there are quite a few college students
who want to do part-time jobs.

337
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,620
Okay.

338
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,020
I'll post this then.

339
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,140
Didn't I ask you to tie the apron on?

340
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,300
Come here.

341
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,540
Put your legs down.

342
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,020
What's wrong?

343
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,140
Can you see if this photo is clear or not?

344
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,700
Isn't this Duoduo's BBQ restaurant?

345
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,620
Are they looking for part-time students?

346
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,340
How about it?

347
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
Send me this later.

348
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,220
You must repay me.

349
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,220
Repay you? I will beat you up.

350
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,620
Stop messing around.

351
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Let's talk about something serious.

352
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,140
Do you want to go or not?

353
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,340
Of course I want to go.

354
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,940
I'm telling you.
This part-time job is definitely mine.

355
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,620
Have you ever worked as a waiter?

356
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,140
No.

357
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,900
So where does your confidence come from?

358
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,900
Isn't it a barbecue restaurant?

359
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,300
I think the waiter at the barbecue restaurant

360
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,820
should not be difficult to do.

361
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,620
Should not be difficult to do?

362
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,820
Where is your confidence?

363
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,460
Hasn't Qiang encountered setbacks

364
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,900
in recent job search career?

365
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,300
I'm a bit nervous too.

366
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,500
It's nothing.

367
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,500
It's just a barbecue restaurant.

368
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,740
After all, it's not a five-star hotel.

369
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,740
But you have to be careful.

370
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Never serve the wrong dish to the customers.

371
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,380
How could I serve the wrong dish?

372
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,780
Don't underestimate it.

373
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,260
You have to remember

374
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,100
what they ordered for each table.

375
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,500
Sometimes they order a lot.

376
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
If you get it wrong,

377
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,340
they will scold you.

378
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,740
You have to compensate them.

379
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,460
Gao.

380
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,060
Did you forget my major?

381
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,580
I can remember the names of the medicines.

382
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,740
How could the dishes be served wrong?

383
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,580
Okay.

384
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,260
You won't.

385
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
The power of love.

386
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,740
Help me bring a meal.

387
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,860
Shao Nian.

388
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,140
Why did you come to me?

389
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,980
What are you messing around for?

390
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,340
Go back to school.

391
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,940
I'm not here to cause trouble, Uncle Li.

392
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,780
That's not what he meant.

393
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,780
Don't take it seriously.

394
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,820
These days,

395
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,060
we are worrying about this.

396
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,900
Your timing is perfect.

397
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,740
Ask your classmate.

398
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,180
If someone is willing to do a part-time job,

399
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,500
let him or her come over and help us out here.

400
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,380
Auntie, I'm really here to apply for the job.

401
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,020
You are a medical student.

402
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,580
You don't carry a scalpel.

403
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,060
You come to me for a kitchen knife.

404
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,340
Are you serious?

405
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,740
Uncle Li.

406
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,820
It is because I have wielded a scalpel before,

407
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,180
that I know

408
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,060
cattle and sheep are to be cut horizontally
while pigs are to be sliced vertically.

409
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,900
With the lift knife in hand,
I can remove tendons and fascia.

410
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,740
You are good at talking.

411
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,900
Help me solicit customers later.

412
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Don't worry, Auntie.

413
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,820
I can also sing.

414
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,620
Singing at the entrance of the store,
I can also attract customers.

415
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,340
Forget about singing.

416
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,100
Cut the meat.

417
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,220
Let me see how you put the meat on sticks.

418
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,660
Okay.

419
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,300
Tie on the apron.

420
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,740
Don't get your pretty clothes

421
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,660
dirty.

422
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,500
Thank you, auntie.

423
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,420
- Wear gloves.
- Okay.

424
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,060
This meat, right?

425
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,900
Cut that one.

426
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,860
Shao Nian.

427
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,220
Aren't you afraid of fire and smoke?

428
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,700
I just love this aura.

429
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,700
Be careful.

430
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,860
The piece with the tip.

431
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,580
At our restaurant,

432
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,260
you need to work four days a week.

433
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,940
Wages are calculated by the hour.

434
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,900
You will be busy at night.

435
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,380
Five to twelve o'clock.

436
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,180
You don't mind it, do you?

437
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,580
No, I don't.

438
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,620
And scientific evidence shows

439
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,180
staying up late happily

440
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,620
is beneficial for physical health.

441
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,300
What do you think, Uncle Li?

442
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,140
Can I work here?

443
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,700
Okay.

444
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,900
Then you can work here.

445
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,300
If you do well,

446
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,340
I'll give you a raise.

447
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,100
Thank you.

448
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,780
But I have a small request.

449
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,380
Our restaurant

450
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,460
will be open

451
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,620
till twelve o'clock at night.

452
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,700
There is no problem at all weekends.

453
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,580
But from Monday to Friday,

454
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,580
our dormitory will be closed at this time.

455
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,780
It's okay, no problem.

456
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,460
The second floor is available.

457
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,460
I will arrange a room for you later.

458
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,700
Really?

459
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,260
You go ahead and work.

460
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,140
- Go ahead.
- OK.

461
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,820
What's the rush?

462
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,660
His request is reasonable.

463
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,140
Reasonable?

464
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,260
Duoduo lives on the third floor.

465
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,420
We live on the first floor.

466
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,500
He stays on the second floor.

467
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,780
Are you worried about our Duoduo?

468
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,900
But I think this kid

469
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,020
is quite talented.

470
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,540
I heard

471
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,580
those who study medicine
can earn a lot in the future.

472
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,220
What are you talking about?

473
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,620
I think you're just overthinking it.

474
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,420
Maybe he just wants to practice himself.

475
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,660
We're also living here, aren't we?

476
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,500
I'll keep an eye on him.

477
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,900
Shao Nian, let's go.

478
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,500
Let me take you around
to get familiar with the place.

479
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,060
- Okay.
- Take off your gloves.

480
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
- OK.
- Let's go.

481
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,100
Everyone, relax.

482
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,460
Let me say a few words.

483
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,420
I've seen

484
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,260
your training today.

485
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,420
Everyone's performance was excellent.

486
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,690
You were very positive.

487
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,740
The actions were relatively standardized.

488
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,060
I hope everyone will continue.

489
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,260
But today,

490
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,230
I want to give special praise to a classmate.

491
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,540
It's Chen Weilan.

492
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,980
I don't know if you have observed

493
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,940
her training status.

494
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,250
When she plays ball,

495
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,540
she is focused and unstoppable.

496
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,710
Playing volleyball

497
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,060
requires this determination and drive.

498
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,100
Chen Weilan

499
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,300
starts from a relatively high level.

500
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,140
But in training,

501
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,580
she never lowers her standards.

502
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,060
I think

503
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,940
all of you should learn from her.

504
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,020
Understand.

505
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,380
Yes.

506
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,140
There is one more thing.

507
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,580
Our key

508
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,580
to the volleyball court

509
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,540
should be taken care of by Chen Weilan.

510
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,940
- What's going on?
- Because that's the only way.

511
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,900
Isn't Captain the only one who can take it?

512
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,300
Except during sleeping at night,

513
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,460
- at other times,
- It's okay. It's for the team.

514
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,340
you can all flexibly

515
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,300
arrange your own training.

516
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,900
If other classmates

517
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,420
want to practice more
at non-training time,

518
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,740
you can also ask her to get the key.

519
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,340
Is that OK?

520
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,900
- OK.
- Okay, got it.

521
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,500
Xuewei.

522
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,140
You performed very well as Captain.

523
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,820
But in this assessment,

524
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,820
your score is lower than Chen Weilan's.

525
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,140
Just a little bit lower.

526
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,460
And Wen Xin.

527
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,860
Your performance

528
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,740
is similar to Xuewei's.

529
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,060
I hope both of you

530
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,020
can keep up the good work.

531
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,860
Keep making effort

532
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,180
and catch up. Alright?

533
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,620
- Okay, coach.
- Got it, coach.

534
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,540
Okay.

535
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,380
That's all I have to say today.

536
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,940
You can all take a break now.

537
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,060
Disband.

538
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,140
Congratulations, Weilan, on getting the key.

539
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,100
In the future, you can practice with us more
when you have time.

540
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,180
And Wen Xin.

541
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,380
- I will.
- Weilan, can you come here for a moment?

542
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,020
What does that mean?

543
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,660
(Physical Education Department Office)

544
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,500
Weilan.

545
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,900
I see you often train alone.

546
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,620
Why don't you train with other team members?

547
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,140
Is it because

548
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,100
you are still not familiar with others?

549
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,860
Or do you have any other thoughts?

550
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,700
Tell me about it.

551
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,740
I am...

552
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,980
I'm used to training alone most of the time.

553
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,620
I'm not very comfortable training with others.

554
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,140
I've seen your training videos
at No. 8 Middle School.

555
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,100
You are quite talented in volleyball.

556
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,620
Your training is also very rigorous.

557
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,220
But there is a point, Weilan.

558
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,500
You are too independent.

559
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,900
Volleyball is a team sport.

560
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,980
If you can work with other team members,

561
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,140
help each other,

562
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,340
train together,

563
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,420
and improve together,

564
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,820
I think you have a bright future.

565
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,180
You may even make it
to the National Youth Team.

566
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,620
I'll do my best.

567
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,020
Think about what I said, Weilan.

568
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,140
Thank you, Coach Wang.

569
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,420
- Go back.
- Thank you.

570
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,860
Mom, Dad, I'm back.

571
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,140
I have something to do at school tonight.

572
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,260
I won't come back to help.

573
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,140
Give it to me.

574
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,860
Don't worry about it. You don't need to do it.

575
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,100
We have already hired a man.

576
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,780
Hired a man?

577
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,900
Where is he?

578
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,180
Auntie, I brought it back for you.

579
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,580
Duoduo, you're back.

580
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,660
Why is it you?

581
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,860
Uncle Li, can you help me get that brush?

582
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,380
I'm here for a part-time job.

583
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,420
What's so strange about this?

584
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,980
Thank you, uncle.

585
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,580
Don't you have many courses?

586
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,180
Can you handle all this busyness?

587
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,900
This is nothing.

588
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,740
What's nothing?

589
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,860
I'm telling you. You might fail the courses.

590
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,740
Don't blame me by then.

591
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,340
Li Guoduo.

592
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,820
If one person between you and me

593
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,660
is bound to fail the courses,

594
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,500
then this person

595
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,860
will definitely not be me.

596
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,820
Auntie, look at this one
that hasn't opened yet.

597
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,860
I'll just brush along this edge.

598
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,620
- Is that Okay?
- That's fine.

599
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,460
Okay.

600
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,500
Dad.

601
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,900
Is he working like that?

602
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,500
He can't do this job.

603
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,180
He does the job well.

604
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,300
He can also help me massage my legs.

605
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,780
He is much better than you.

606
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,300
- Dad.
- Uncle.

607
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,580
Is today's leg massage OK?

608
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,980
Comfortable.

609
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,620
Then I'll give you a shoulder massage later.

610
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,380
No need. Leg massage is fine.

611
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,740
Mom, just as you said,

612
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,380
the man you hired is Shao Nian, right?

613
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,580
Both your dad and I think

614
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,860
he is much better than Zhang.

615
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,540
The key is not to let others get the benefit.

616
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
Right, Shao Nian?

617
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,420
Uncle.

618
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,380
It has a hole in it.

619
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,340
I can't swipe inside.

620
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,900
- Rinse it again.
- With water, right?

621
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,740
Okay.

622
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,700
How long will he be suspended for?

623
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,540
Half a year.

624
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,220
No, Duoduo.

625
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,460
Is it because I came to work here

626
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,580
that you get angry?

627
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,220
How could I be angry?

628
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,620
I just feel like

629
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,660
a bit uncomfortable.

630
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,860
What's wrong with that?

631
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,900
Don't I still owe you money?

632
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,700
I already owe you money, to begin with.

633
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,900
And you are so busy.

634
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,020
You even come over to work.

635
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,660
I just feel uneasy

636
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,020
and a bit guilty.

637
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,380
I work at your restaurant.

638
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,620
I can train myself,

639
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,740
and earn some money.

640
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,180
What are you feeling guilty about?

641
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,460
Yes.

642
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,900
It's not like you're not making money.

643
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,860
You also earn money.

644
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,540
And you're eating and living here.

645
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,500
Why do I feel like

646
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,100
I'm getting deeper in debt?

647
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,940
You mean,

648
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,460
you won't pay the salary?

649
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,100
Let me tell you. There are rules to follow.

650
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,020
How could we not pay your salary?

651
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,140
We will not only pay your salary,

652
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:17,980
and,

653
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
I will definitely pay you back
the money as soon as possible.

654
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,300
I'm really not in a hurry for that money.

655
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,020
Besides,

656
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,620
I'm on the same side with your Mom and Dad.

657
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,100
I'm not afraid you won't return me the money.

658
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,940
Shao Nian.

659
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,300
Bring that oyster over and brush it off.

660
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,900
Okay, I'll get a brush.

661
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
See? Your mom didn't ask for your help.

662
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,460
Here I am.

663
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,900
(Women's locker room)

664
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,180
Just throw whatever you want in there.

665
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,140
You're welcome.

666
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,580
I won't need it anymore anyway.

667
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,500
Chen Weilan.

668
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,060
No. Why are you

669
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,420
playing beach volleyball here?

670
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,220
Are you looking
to join our beach volleyball team?

671
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,060
No.

672
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,900
I...

673
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,140
Can I practice here for a bit?

674
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,100
Can I borrow your court for a while?

675
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,900
Sure, feel free to practice
as much as you want.

676
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,340
Are you not sleeping at night?

677
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,780
You train so hard.

678
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,540
I train every night.

679
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,900
I practiced downstairs
of the dormitory every night.

680
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,100
So I got complained.

681
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,940
They said I was noisy.

682
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,420
So I just changed the place.

683
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,340
Downstairs of the dormitory?

684
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,540
Our dormitory

685
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,300
is haunted.

686
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,100
Haunted?

687
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,580
In the bathroom on the east side,

688
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,740
I always hear

689
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,940
a thumping sound.

690
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,180
It's quite scary.

691
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,500
So that thumping sound,

692
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,860
comes from you!

693
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,220
Yang Jingxuan told me
that the dormitory was haunted.

694
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,820
It turns out you are the ghost!

695
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,860
No no, that's not what I meant.

696
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,420
So, you were practicing there.

697
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,860
I don't know

698
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,460
where the sound came from.

699
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,700
Anyway, I practiced every day.

700
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,500
What are you doing?

701
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,180
I think your moves are really good.

702
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,340
I can learn from them.

703
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,660
Sorry to interrupt your practice.

704
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,500
Please keep practicing.

705
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,220
I think Chen Weilan is a genius girl.

706
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,500
There is a reason.

707
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,460
She is still training here late at night.

708
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,180
Gao.

709
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,420
Duoduo sent me a WeChat message,

710
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,700
saying that Chen Weilan is practicing
volleyball every day now.

711
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,540
Is it true?

712
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,220
I'm not lying to you, why would I?

713
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,300
See?

714
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,380
Chen Weilan tells her

715
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,020
that she practices for twelve hours every day.

716
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,020
The genius girl

717
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,060
is really different.

718
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
I remember

719
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,740
the coach gave the key to the gym

720
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,580
to her.

721
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,500
Why didn't she go to the gym to practice?

722
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,420
How would I know?

723
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,660
You went for a run?

724
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,340
You trained so hard yesterday.

725
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,740
And you went for a run this morning.

726
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,340
Truly gifted.

727
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,020
There's no such thing as being gifted.

728
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,100
It all depends on how hard you work.

729
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,180
I'm also here reviewing, okay?

730
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,660
Look at this.

731
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,940
Come here.

732
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,220
What?

733
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,180
My dad said

734
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,180
whether when we're competing,

735
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,060
or training,

736
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,300
it's best to record a video.

737
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,940
It's easier to identify
your own problems this way.

738
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,300
Did I use my left hand
to spike the ball that day?

739
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,300
I usually spike the ball with my right hand.

740
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,380
I use a forehand grip.

741
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,020
Isn't it a mirror image?

742
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,860
It's the opposite.

743
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,940
I think

744
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,140
my leg strength is what helps me jump,

745
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,700
but my arm strength is still weak.

746
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,620
You can do it, keep going!

747
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,820
Where are you going?

748
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,660
I'm going out for a while.

749
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,700
(Introduction of new team members
at the beach volleyball court)

750
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,460
(Beach volleyball room)

751
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,300
Who could she be?

752
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,740
You are too obvious.

753
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,420
- You are all here.
- Senior.

754
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,980
Let me introduce her to everyone.

755
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,220
This is my girlfriend Yan Xiaojing.

756
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,260
And this is her best friend Mo Xixi.

757
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,100
- Hello.
- Starting from today,

758
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,980
they will be in our beach volleyball team.

759
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,340
Welcome.

760
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,900
Good. Xia.

761
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,580
You work so hard for the beach volleyball team.

762
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,860
- This one...
- Gao Ge.

763
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,740
Beach volleyball idol.

764
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,420
Okay, okay, stop teasing me.

765
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,500
- Hurry, take a seat.
- Please have a seat first.

766
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,340
- Sit down.
- Sit here, Xixi.

767
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,820
By the way,

768
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,740
let me introduce them to you.

769
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,780
This is Li Guoduo.

770
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,620
This is Yang Jingxuan.

771
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,580
They are our new team members.

772
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,780
Hello, senior sisters.

773
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,780
I am Li Guoduo, a freshman

774
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,340
majoring in Sports Rehabilitation.

775
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,740
I have loved playing beach volleyball
since I was a child.

776
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,380
Hello, senior sisters.

777
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,100
I am a freshman majoring in Chinese.

778
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,340
I have never played beach volleyball before.

779
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,180
I just joined.

780
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,220
Pretty good.

781
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,300
Please have a seat.

782
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,380
There is no need
to introduce the person over there, right?

783
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,700
Skip him.

784
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,540
- That's right.
- Skip that mascot.

785
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,540
Mascot?

786
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,140
Okay, the introduction is done now.

787
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,260
Let's just

788
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,380
have a game.

789
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,220
Okay.

790
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,780
Captain, who will I partner with?

791
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,220
You just

792
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,420
record our scores.

793
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,460
I? Record scores?

794
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,740
No. Captain.

795
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,900
I also want to play beach volleyball.

796
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,860
Can I also play a few rounds on the court?

797
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,820
Little girl,

798
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,300
let's just observe and learn today.

799
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,180
You just stay by the side

800
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,220
and watch and learn.

801
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,780
Gao Ge.

802
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,620
Both of you boys belong to the power type.

803
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,700
You have the advantage.

804
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,620
I think this kid really wants to play.

805
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,500
How about we fight her?

806
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,900
I have no opinion.

807
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,740
It's up to Xia.

808
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,140
OK.

809
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,140
Great!

810
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,620
However,

811
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,060
there will be punishment if you lose.

812
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,860
What kind of punishment?

813
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,540
I happen to be writing a paper.

814
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
I need some materials.

815
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,980
If you lose,

816
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,380
I'll give you a book list.

817
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,180
Please help me get them from the library.

818
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,820
No problem.

819
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,820
Senior sisters.

820
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,660
But if you two lose...

821
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,300
Kid, you're quite confident.

822
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,260
Yes.

823
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,260
Okay.

824
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,260
If we lose...

825
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,540
I'll give you the position of the captain
of the women's volleyball team.

826
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,380
How about it?

827
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,260
Thank you in advance, senior sisters.

828
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,860
Okay, let's get ready.

829
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,860
- Let's go
- No problem. Let's go.

830
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,260
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

831
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,700
Lan.

832
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,940
I'm at the entrance of the store now.

833
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,100
- How about that?
- I've checked the surveillance cameras.

834
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,420
They said the surveillance camera
was broken that day.

835
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,380
Then...

836
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,300
That's okay.

837
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,740
I have two videos here now.

838
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,660
I happen to be at my grandfather's house.

839
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,780
I'll send them to you.

840
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,620
Okay, I'll wait for you.

841
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,540
That video

842
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,340
is not much different from those online.

843
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,620
It's just

844
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,820
slightly more complete.

845
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,060
Have you seen that video online?

846
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,220
Is the watch on the left hand or right hand?

847
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,900
That's not right.

848
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,740
My watch should always be on my right hand.

849
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,780
Did you have a great game today?

850
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,700
Am I kind enough?

851
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,340
I didn't cheat.

852
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,700
We agreed on three pieces of clothing.

853
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,580
This is too harsh.

854
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,100
I still have to do the laundry for Xiaojing.

855
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,340
Isn't that what you should do?

856
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,220
Why should I?

857
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,420
Gao Ge.

858
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,180
I'll show you something.

859
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,060
Last night,

860
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,540
I took it with my phone.

861
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,740
Take a look at the ones online again.

862
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,500
- Is there a problem?
- What's wrong?

863
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,340
Hold them up for comparison.

864
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,020
It's really different.

865
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,780
This is the opposite one.

866
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,580
So I'm telling you.

867
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,740
I didn't do it.

868
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,940
It wasn't me who spread it.

869
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,500
Yes, yes, yes.

870
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,460
It's true that you didn't spread it.

871
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,100
Then who could it be?

872
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,180
I also want to know who did.

873
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,620
Anyway, this has nothing to do with me.

874
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,700
This matter

875
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,620
is related to me.

876
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,740
But it also affects you.

877
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,060
how can it have nothing to do with you?

878
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,260
So, I'm also looking for

879
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,820
an answer.

880
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,820
But please, in the future,

881
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,340
stop bothering me, okay?

882
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,300
What kind of books are these?

883
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,900
So many books for writing a paper.

884
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,700
Let Jingxuan help me.

885
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,780
After all...

886
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,860
Chen Weilan.

887
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,100
What a coincidence!

888
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,740
I'll return the books.

889
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,420
What are these? Do you have a second major?

890
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,340
Don't tease me.

891
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,780
I'm taking Xiaojing's books.

892
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,460
Why are you taking Xiaojing's books?

893
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,220
I lost in the internal competition.

894
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,220
This is the punishment.

895
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,220
You lost, huh?

896
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,580
Normal.

897
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,420
Chen Weilan.

898
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,940
Don't I have dignity?

899
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,740
I just wanted to

900
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,220
practice myself.

901
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,260
So I agreed.

902
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,940
Does taking books exercise your brain?

903
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,020
Taking books can build my arm strength.

904
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,860
You see.

905
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,060
Isn't it just

906
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,500
a good exercise?

907
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,020
Didn't you tell me yesterday

908
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,060
that my strength is not enough?

909
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,540
I'm following your advice

910
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,540
to exercise a bit.

911
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,460
Let me tell you.

912
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,620
You need to exercise regularly.

913
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,620
You have so few books.

914
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,820
It is not enough.

915
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,260
Let me add some more for you.

916
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,100
How about it?

917
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,020
So easy.

918
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,380
Miss Chen.

919
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,460
You are an experienced athlete.

920
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,460
You have so much experience.

921
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,660
Can you spare some time to guide me?

922
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,540
Our beach volleyball team

923
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,860
happens to need a coach.

924
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,180
I have never played beach volleyball before.

925
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,420
I am too busy playing indoor matches every day.

926
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,740
And even beach volleyball?

927
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,660
Come on, keep training!

928
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,340
- Chen Weilan.
- Practice well.

929
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,660
- Chen Weilan.
- Help me to collect them all, okay?

930
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,820
I'm exhausted over there.

931
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,540
You are carefree and at ease here.

932
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,940
- Why is it so unfair like this?
- Here.

933
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,100
It's exhausting.

934
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,020
I was watching

935
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,220
the video you sent to me.

936
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,140
We lost the previous game due to me.

937
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,660
I'd like to brush up on my knowledge
of beach volleyball.

938
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,940
I think

939
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,780
theoretical knowledge is easy.

940
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,340
Basic actions are also easy.

941
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,620
What's most important now is that

942
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,900
we lack a professional coach to guide us.

943
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,220
We won't go astray at least.

944
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,860
Coach?

945
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,460
I heard

946
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,220
now the volleyball team's coach is Wang Dong.

947
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,740
He used to be a coach
for the beach volleyball team.

948
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,340
Why don't we go ask him for advice?

949
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,140
Great idea.

950
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,100
Let me tell you guys.

951
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,380
This Chen Weilan

952
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,780
is definitely not that simple.

953
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,740
Don't be fooled by her quiet demeanor.

954
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,780
She is more canny than anyone else.

955
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,180
I think so too.

956
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,020
She has only been here for less than a month.

957
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,540
Coach Wang and the principal

958
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,700
like her so much.

959
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,780
And,

960
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,700
your favorite male idol,

961
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,540
Gao Ge,

962
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,140
is always around her.

963
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,740
Gao Ge. Do they know each other?

964
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,620
Yes.

965
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,540
If this continues,

966
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,180
in the next few years,

967
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,260
I'm afraid it will be hard
to even have a chance to perform.

968
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,140
Then we will practice for nothing.

969
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,980
That's right.

970
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,540
Captain.

971
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,980
What should we do?

972
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,180
Like this.

973
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,860
When we are training,

974
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,020
I deliberately let her spike a ball.

975
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,500
(Women's locker room)
Then I will fall down.

976
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,620
Throwing the ball is fundamental.

977
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,260
Get stable.

978
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,380
- Use some force.
- Mine.

979
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,660
Use a little more force.

980
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,100
Sister Xuewei.

981
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,940
Are you okay?

982
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,180
Xuewei, what's wrong?

983
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,980
It's okay, coach.

984
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,220
Just now,

985
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,140
Chen Weilan's spike is too powerful.

986
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,220
I sprained my foot when I dodged.

987
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,740
Try to see if you can stand up.

988
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,580
Okay.

989
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,540
- Slow down.
- Slow down.

990
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,420
Be careful.

991
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,860
Don't move, don't move.

992
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,380
Chen Weilan.

993
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,900
I think you did it on purpose.

994
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,580
Last time when we were in a group,
it was like this.

995
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,540
This is an internal training for the team.

996
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,020
Do you have to be this serious?

997
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,220
You guys are not concentrating.

998
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,500
And you blame me?

999
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,620
You hurt others.

1000
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,740
Are you trying to justify yourself?

1001
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,700
- Apologize.
- Apologize.

1002
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,780
Stop talking.

1003
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,540
Chen Weilan.

1004
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,740
Volleyball is a team sport.

1005
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,540
You just joined the team not long ago.

1006
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,820
What you should do first

1007
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,340
is to get along with team members.

1008
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,980
- Be careful.
- Song Xuewei got injured.

1009
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,940
You should apologize to her.

1010
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,500
If the ball just now

1011
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,620
was really my mistake,

1012
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,220
Then I will definitely apologize to her.

1013
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,660
Coach.

1014
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,660
It's okay.

1015
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,980
Maybe Chen Weilan didn't do it on purpose.

1016
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,060
Coach.

1017
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,180
Weilan just made a normal spike just now.

1018
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,220
It's true that she didn't pay attention.

1019
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,580
Wen Xin.

1020
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

1021
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,180
- We all saw it.
- I'm not talking nonsense.

1022
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,660
Wen Xin, tell me.

1023
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,220
Did you really

1024
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,740
see I was distracted?

1025
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,060
Why are you speaking up for her?

1026
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,140
I'm telling the truth.

1027
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,780
Stop. Chen Weilan.

1028
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,620
She's already injured.

1029
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
You should apologize to her.

1030
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,100
Apologize quickly.

1031
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,620
Apologize quickly.

1032
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,460
Apologize.

1033
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,100
Chen Weilan.

1034
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,780
That's your attitude.

1035
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,380
I won't be able to arrange
for you to play in the next game.

1036
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,620
With their training attitude like that,

1037
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,380
even if you want me to play in the next game,

1038
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,420
I don't care.

1039
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,780
What are you talking about?

1040
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,940
- Chen Weilan.
- Chen Weilan.

1041
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,900
What does she mean?

1042
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,180
What kind of attitude is this?

1043
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,620
Send Xuewei to take a break on the sidelines.

1044
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,300
- Slow down.
- Be careful.

1045
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,900
Walk slowly.

1046
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,740
Slow down.

1047
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,860
- Weilan.
- Weilan.

1048
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,900
Why aren't you training anymore?

1049
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,020
This volleyball team
is not a place for training at all.

1050
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,180
What's wrong?

1051
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,660
Xuewei.

1052
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,220
You should go back and take a rest.

1053
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,460
No training for you today.

1054
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,780
If your injury is still not healed,

1055
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,180
I'll ask Zhang Xi to take you
to the school hospital for a check-up.

1056
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,020
Okay.

1057
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,660
Don't worry, coach.

1058
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,820
That's it for today.

1059
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,660
Disband.

1060
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,340
Thank you, coach.

1061
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,620
Captain, are you okay?

1062
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,020
- Captain. Are you okay?
- Xuewei.

1063
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,540
Captain.

1064
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,260
You hit the ball so accurately!

1065
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,220
What are you doing?

1066
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,020
It's all thanks to you.

1067
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,260
In the morning, afternoon, and evening,

1068
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,980
even during the summer vacation,
we need to practice.

1069
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,300
I asked everyone to train hard.

1070
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,620
What's wrong with that?

1071
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,060
Weren't you just acting like a hero?

1072
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,300
Trying to stand out, huh?

1073
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,180
What?

1074
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,220
Now you're a little scared.

1075
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,980
What I just said are all facts.

1076
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,100
Do you think what she just said is true?

1077
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,940
No.

1078
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,180
You never treat me as Captain.

1079
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,020
You never respect me.

1080
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,980
You always claim to be Captain.

1081
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,980
Have you ever taken responsibility
for this team?

1082
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,740
Your serve is unstable.

1083
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,620
I asked the coach to give you extra training.

1084
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,020
It's also for you and for the team.

1085
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,460
It's to improve our overall level.

1086
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,340
Who do you think is not responsible?

1087
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,860
Why do you treat me like this?

1088
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,380
You said I didn't train, right?

1089
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,660
Okay.

1090
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,820
Come on, I'll show you my training right now.

1091
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,620
What are you guys doing?

1092
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,460
Let me go.

1093
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,460
Let go of me.

1094
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,020
You haven't learned your lesson
from last time, have you?

1095
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,220
What do you want to do?

1096
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,260
What am I doing?

1097
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,740
You go too far.

1098
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,380
Report to the teacher, huh?

1099
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,460
Too far!

1100
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,540
Does it hurt?

1101
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,020
Let me go.

1102
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,860
Jingxuan, you go find the coach.

1103
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,700
I'll go check.

1104
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,580
And you?

1105
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,340
Don't worry, I'm here. You go quickly.

1106
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,680
- Be careful.
- Let me go!

1107
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,900
You don't know what pain is.

1108
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,980
Stop it.

1109
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,700
What are you doing? Let her go.

1110
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,580
What are you doing, you guys?

1111
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,740
Mind your own business.

1112
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,500
You are

1113
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,820
Chen Weilan's roommate, right?

1114
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,980
I'm telling you.

1115
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,060
We are training here.

1116
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,380
Yes, we're training.

1117
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,220
Training?

1118
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,060
Who are you trying to fool?

1119
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,140
You guys are going too far.

1120
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,180
This is clearly bullying.

1121
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,540
I am Captain of this volleyball team.

1122
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,380
Right now, we are bullying the weak.

1123
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,220
What's wrong?

1124
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,380
It's a shame that you are Captain.

1125
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,460
I always thought the volleyball team

1126
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,380
is one of the best.

1127
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,660
I didn't expect you guys

1128
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,660
didn't spend time on training.

1129
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,900
You're trying to show off here, aren't you?

1130
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,260
Kid,

1131
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,460
I'm warning you again.

1132
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,500
This is none of your business.

1133
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,540
You guys are not even worthy
of playing volleyball.

1134
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,100
Let's go.

1135
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,900
It seems like you

1136
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,180
are also very interested in it.

1137
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,300
Okay, then.

1138
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,300
The two of you can practice with us.

1139
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,460
How about it?

1140
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,580
Duoduo, you go first.

1141
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,420
Don't mind me.

1142
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,300
I won't leave.

1143
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,940
Let's see what they can do.

1144
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,420
Teacher.

1145
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,020
(Physical Education Department Office)

1146
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,500
Weilan.

1147
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,220
Chen Weilan.

1148
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,820
Hurry to save Duoduo.

1149
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,940
She and Wen Xin are on the volleyball court.

1150
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,420
