Come on. You two.

A captain and a team doctor.

21
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,540
It's natural to care for teammates.

22
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,860
But why drag me into this?

23
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,620
Aren't you part of our team?

24
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,080
I'm not the only one on the team.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,370
Because Lang Yueting has caused

26
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,860
a psychological shadow for Weilan.

27
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,020
You and Lang Yueting are...

28
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,080
We don't want to know

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,180
about your relationship with her.

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,090
But you're the best in our team.

31
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,200
We need you to solve this problem.

32
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,180
Yeah.

33
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,820
You're the star player.

34
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,680
You're better than anyone.

35
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,680
You guys are just kidding around.

36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,280
Gao, we can't do this without you.

37
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,920
Coming, coming.

38

- Grandpa, hello!

39
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,540
And you are?

40
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,300
I recognize this young lady.

41
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,280
Aren't you Weilan's roommate?

42
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,700
Yes, Grandpa.

43
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,580
What's your name again?

44
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,820
I'm Li Guoduo.

45
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,440
Yes, yes, Li Guoduo.

46
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,980
- Here to see Weilan?
- Yes, we're here to see her.

47
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,240
- Is Weilan home?
- Yes, yes.

48
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Come in.

49
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,780
- Grandpa, I'm Shao Nian.
- Hello, hello.

- Grandpa, I'm Gao Ge.
- Hello, hello, hello.

51
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,220
Alright.

52
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,040
Please sit.

53
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,520
You all sit here for a bit.

54
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,780
I'll go call her.

55
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,640
She's still asleep.

56
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,920
She's always sleeping these days.

57
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,940
Sit for a while.

58
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,780
- Thank you, Grandpa.
- Sure.

59
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,980
Weilan,

60
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,820
wake up.

61
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,220
Get up.

62
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,840
Friends are here to see you.

63
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,940
Get up.

64
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,820
Weilan's grandpa's house is so beautiful.

65
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,800
The environment is so nice.

66
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,240
It's quite lovely.

67
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,560
But the house

68
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,680
seems quite old.

69
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,860
Weilan.

70
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,560
Get up.

71
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,280
- Let's go check.
- Stop sleeping. Get up.

72
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,860
Weilan.

73
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,920
Duoduo and the others are here to see you.

74
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,480
Grandpa, let me take a look.

75
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,180
Weilan.

76
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,600
Grandpa, she's not here.

77
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,780
She was just sleeping here.

78
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,120
But now she's gone.

79
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,380
Weilan?

80
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,700
Weilan?

81
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,180
Grandpa.

82
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,700
Are these all Weilan's awards?

83
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,540
Yes.

84
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,480
These are all hers.

85
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,680
(Advanced Award, Certificate of Honor)
- Weilan has been

86
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,240
very independent since she was little.

87
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,120
She's very proud and competitive.

88
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,320
(Certificate of Award, First Place)
Her mind is also very simple.

89
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,620
Anything she sets her mind on,

90
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,200
she has to do it perfectly.

91
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,600
She didn't have many friends growing up.

92
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,280
People who don't understand her

93
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,840
think she's arrogant.

94
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,010
But really,

95
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,110
she needs understanding and companionship.

96
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,880
We all understand that.

97
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,590
(National High School Volleyball Tournament)
She won this trophy

98
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,200
(MVP)
in her first year of high school.

99
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,180
She's rarely lost on the court

100
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,800
since she was young.

101
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,680
Especially her powerful spikes.

102
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,500
They're impressive, right?

103
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,540
She won this trophy

104
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,600
with that move.

105
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,580
Truly impressive.

106
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,480
Okay, you all wait here.

107
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,460
I'll go find her. She won't have gone far.

108
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,300
- Alright.
- Sure.

109
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,620
Weilan?

110
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,220
Weilan?

111
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,380
Bro.

112
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,160
I shouldn't have come.

113
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,280
She must've heard my voice.

114
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,680
Chen Weilan isn't that sensitive.

115
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,340
Don't overthink it.

119

Don't worry.

120
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,320
So, you are here.

121
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,320
Do you know how long we looked for you?

122
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,040
Why were you looking for me?

123
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,160
After your training that day,

124
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,960
you came to your grandpa's house,

125
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,720
and disappeared.

126
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,880
Do you know that I...

127
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,120
we were very worried about you?

128
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,620
I'm an adult now.

129
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,720
What could possibly happen?

130
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,680
We were just concerned about you.

131
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,400
What's there to worry about?

132
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,240
I just got tired from practice,

133
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,820
so I wanted some rest.

134
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,440
I came here to have a meal with my grandpa.

135
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,780
Do I need to report everything to you?

136
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,180
Chen Weilan,

137
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,880
people are worried about you. Please cooperate.

138
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,040
How long has it been since you trained?

139
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,940
Come back and continue training with us.

140
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,340
Do I need to report

141
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,980
whether I train or not?

142
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,200
I'm practicing every day.

143
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,300
Don't take what Li Guoduo said

144
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,300
on the beach volleyball court

145
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,360
too seriously.

146
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,560
She really wants to help you.

147
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,560
You know how she is.

148
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,500
She's impulsive

149
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,600
and thoughtless.

150
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,060
But I have to say.

151
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,640
She's right.

152
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,880
Your problem is because of Lang Yueting.

153
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,920
What does this have to do with her?

154
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,260
In the National Youth Team tryout,

155
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,860
Lang Yueting won the MVP.

156
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,740
This has always been

157
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,160
a knot in your heart, right?

158
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,700
Bro, you're obsessed with her,

159
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,000
but please be rational.

160
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,480
She won the MVP in that match,

161
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,940
but the one who won was me.

162
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,440
I won that match.

163
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,240
We watched the video of your match.

164
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,620
I reviewed

165
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,640
every detail carefully.

166
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,040
Every time Lang Yueting blocked,

167
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,640
you weren't in your best form.

168
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,160
You couldn't spike the ball successfully.

169
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,740
And this was just like

170
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,400
your performance the other day.

171
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,780
- So?
- Chen Weilan.

172
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,060
Volleyball

173
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,900
is about winning.

174
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,640
But before you beat others,

175
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,280
you have to beat yourself first.

176
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,740
Finished?

177
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,140
Here we are.

178
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,460
- Grandpa, Grandpa.
- Grandpa.

179
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,140
Come on, everyone. Sit at the table.

180
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:17,980
Let me serve, Grandpa.

181
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,460
- No problem.
- Let me do it.

182
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,080
- Thank you so much.
- Be careful. It's hot.

183
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,640
- Thank you, Grandpa.
- Careful with your hand.

184
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,000
- Careful.
- Well.

185
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,860
Let's not wait for them.

186
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,940
Let's start eating, okay?

187
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,580
It's alright, Grandpa. He found Weilan,
and they are coming back.

188
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,680
- Found her?
- Yes.

189
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,760
Speak of the devil, here they are.

190
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,120
Where did you go?

191
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,950
Everyone's been looking for you.

192
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,900
I just went for a walk.

193
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,120
Who knew they would come?

194
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,950
Alright, take a seat.

195
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,020
- Okay.
- Well.

196
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,720
I've prepared many dishes today.

197
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,180
Duoduo.

198
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,260
This is the steamed crab

199
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,380
you smelled earlier.

200
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,330
- Thank you, Grandpa.
- It's fresh.

201
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,700
- Try some.
- It smells amazing.

202
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,740
I wanted to eat it earlier.

203
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,380
You have some too. It's definitely delicious.

204
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,540
- Here.
- Look at that.

205
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,320
Look how easygoing Duoduo is.

206
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,380
Learn from her.

207
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,800
No, Grandpa, she's more easygoing than me.

208
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,840
Come on. Eat up.

209
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,340
Young man,

210
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,580
you're too thin.

211
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,220
Eat more. Get some nutrition.

212
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,300
- Okay, Grandpa.
- Eat more.

213
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,140
Grandpa, join us.

214
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,420
No worries. I have two more dishes.

215
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,260
They'll be ready soon.

216
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,960
Make sure everyone eats well.

217
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,380
You all eat first.

218
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,780
- Grandpa, thank you.
- Thank you, Grandpa.

219
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,620
Thank you.

220
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,740
Start eating.

221
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,380
You handled

222
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,380
that crab very well.

223
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,220
So meticulous.

224
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,840
No wonder you're in the arts.

225
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,580
Let me tell you.

226
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,120
That's called professional ethics.

227
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,460
If you gave me a needle and thread now,

228
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,420
I could sew it back together

229
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,540
and send it swimming.

230
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,920
- Really?
- No way.

231
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,500
Not eating anymore?

232
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,720
Finally, something I'm better at than you.

233
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,180
Come on.

234
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,000
I find it bothersome to handle.

235
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,620
Thank you.

236
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,980
It's pretty good.

237
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,720
Gao, I want to eat a crab from you.

238
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,120
From me?

239
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,460
Alright.

240
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,580
Then sew one for me.

241
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,420
Sure.

242
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,280
Take a break.

243
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,820
Take a break.

244
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,880
Rest for a while.

245
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,320
- Come on.
- Good for you.

246
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,360
You've improved your skills.

247
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,840
You know how to block now.

248
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,860
It was just luck.

249
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,560
Getting it right once is good enough for me.

250
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,300
But you should

251
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,220
improve your own skills.

252
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,320
Why learn from others?

253
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,900
Actually,

254
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,380
we already know

255
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,880
about you and Lang Yueting.

256
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,220
And

257
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,580
that your hand injury has healed.

258
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,560
We all know.

259
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,740
So,

260
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,240
tell us about your past.

261
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,080
So we can help you.

262
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,980
Weilan,

263
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,800
sharing isn't scary, nor is it shameful.

264
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,140
Look.

265
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,180
You have to face your problems

266
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,800
to have a chance at winning.

267
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,220
Look at me.

268
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,920
To play this match against you,

269
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
I've been practicing for a week,

270
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,520
from morning till night.

271
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,520
And you praised me for my progress.

272
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,700
I'm not like you.

273
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,100
I don't know so much about theories

274
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,640
and strategic tactics.

275
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,700
I just know

276
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,360
when facing my weaknesses,

277
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,020
I have to bravely overcome them.

278
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,100
I have to face them,

279
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,460
so I can change

280
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,640
and become stronger.

281
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,740
Weilan,

282
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,740
Guoduo has really done a lot

283
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,960
to help you.

284
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,560
I think you should trust her

285
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,240
and trust us.

286
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,480
Why do you love meddling in my business?

287
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,160
This isn't meddling.

288
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,740
We're partners.

289
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,440
We'll win many championships together.

290
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,160
Your business is my business.

291
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,840
Actually, my wrist

292
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,940
got injured

293
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,360
during a match with Lang Yueting.

294
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,140
It was the first time

295
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,520
my powerful spike got blocked.

296
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,440
I couldn't accept it

297
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,200
at the time.

298
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,340
So, every time I spiked after that,

299
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,480
I would use

300
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,440
more and more force.

301
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,440
So, my wrist got dislocated.

302
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,340
Lang Yueting seemed

303
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,600
to notice my problem,

304
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,400
and blocked me firmly.

305
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,380
So every time I was about to spike,

306
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,440
when I saw her,

307
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,340
I would instinctively

308
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,600
avoid her and get scared.

309
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,880
That's my biggest problem.

310
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,920
You need to learn from me.

311
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,620
Get blocked a few more times
and you won't be scared.

312
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,600
You're so good.

313
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,400
With your skills,

314
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,380
it takes some effort

315
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,400
to not block you.

316
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,700
Okay, okay.

317
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,020
From now on,

318
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,280
I'll focus on improving my skills,

319
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,340
and you

320
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,280
will work on your mental issues.

321
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,060
Let's work hard together.

322
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,900
Okay?

323
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,480
Actually, in psychology,

324
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,520
there's a method to treat psychological issues

325
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,360
called systematic desensitization.

326
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,040
If you want,

327
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,240
we can try it.

328
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,660
Weilan's

329
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,960
skills and physical fitness aren't perfect.

330
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,320
You don't have any other options.

331
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,880
You just have to accept it.

332
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,660
You're back.

333
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,460
You're back.

334
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,520
Duoduo, Duoduo, Duoduo!

335
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,480
Before your dad was hospitalized,

336
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,700
he used to stand beside me

337
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,800
and give pointers.

338
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,920
I learned a lot every time.

339
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,900
Ever since he was hospitalized,

340
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,240
my training efficiency has plummeted.

341
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,420
Don't worry.

342
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,260
If you have any questions, just ask us.

343
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,980
We're all here to help you.

344
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,000
Come on.

345
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,340
You and Weilan

346
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,840
are always together, coming up with big plans.

347
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,360
Wen Xin and Xiaojing

348
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,880
don't even bother with me.

349
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,180
Jingxuan,

350
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,120
be fair with your words.

351
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
Haven't I been helping you?

352
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,640
Haven't I been correcting you?

353
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,620
Yes, you have.

354
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,360
I'm just anxious.

355
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,640
The Seven-School League is coming.

356
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,220
Gao Ge is competing.

357
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,600
I want to compete too.

358
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,040
Let's hope

359
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,720
you can compete in your senior year.

360
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,820
Only by competing in the Seven-School League

361
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,640
can we qualify for the national competition.

362
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,600
So each school can only have one team.

363
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,180
I want to compete.

364
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,040
I must compete.

365
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,060
Let's find a coach first.

366
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,100
Without a coach,

367
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,240
how can we register?

368
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,120
A coach...

369
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,440
Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

370
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,580
Leave it to me.

371
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,480
Duoduo, let me tell you something.

372
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,940
Go ahead.

373
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,260
Today, during practice,

374
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,240
I noticed...

375
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,560
Gao Ge.

376
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,700
Coach Gao.

377
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,740
Can you

378
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,980
find some time to teach me

379
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,200
about the one pass attack?

380
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,320
Sure. I'll teach you when I have time.

381
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,300
About this wristband.

382
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,220
How about

383
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,400
I buy you a new one?

384
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,620
Why?

385
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,500
Why waste money?

386
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,520
This one's fine.

387
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,620
Alright.

388
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,040
If you like it, keep it.

389
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,360
Weilan, did he give you

390
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,040
that wristband?

391
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,340
- No, I...
- Well.

392
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,460
It's okay.

393
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,400
No need to feel awkward.

394
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,940
It's fine. Really.

395
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,440
He can give it to anyone he wants.

396
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,520
This

397
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,680
quite suits you.

398
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,100
What?

399
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,440
Slow down. No one's taking your food.

400
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,100
I can't.

401
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,990
I have something important to do after eating.

402
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,780
Are you firing your dad?

403
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,150
You're posting an online ad for a coach?

404
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,480
The Seven-School League is about to start.

405
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,480
The beach volleyball team is in chaos.

406
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,210
Morale is down,

407
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,630
and so is the training efficiency.

408
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,770
I'm worried sick.

409
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,760
My hair's falling out.

410
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,770
Your hair's falling out?
I'll get you some anti-hair loss shampoo.

411
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,580
Relax. Tomorrow, I'll go to the hospital

412
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,000
and ask Uncle if there's anything we can do.

413
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,620
That's all we can do.

414
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,720
Hope someone sees the job posting

415
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,840
and contacts me soon.

416
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,440
This food is really good.

417
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,780
Did you make it?

418
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,940
Uncle and Auntie aren't here.

419
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,160
Who else would make it?

420
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,120
You're quite the talented one.

421
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,400
Making great progress.

422
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,120
When facing my weaknesses,

423
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,860
I have to bravely overcome them.

424
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,760
I have to face them,

425
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,220
so I can change

426
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,440
and become stronger.

427
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,100
Chen Weilan.

428
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,240
Volleyball is about winning.

429
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,760
But before you beat others,

430
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,080
you have to beat yourself first.

431
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,500
Dad.

432
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,340
Uncle Li.

433
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,620
- Uncle Li.
- What are you doing?

434
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,660
- Slow down, slow down.
- Slow down.

435
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,440
Why are you getting up? Stay in bed.

436
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,280
Lie down.

437
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,780
Slow down. Take it easy.

438
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,620
Slow down.

439
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,220
- It's okay.
- Are you okay?

440
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,060
I'll be fine after a rest.

441
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,520
It's okay.

442
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,860
Where's Mom?

443
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,660
The rent for the shop hasn't been paid yet,

444
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,920
so she's gone to sort out the bills.

445
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,680
Your mom's right.

446
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,820
I'm lying here

447
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,120
like a useless person.

448
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,340
The business is suffering,

449
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,080
and your training is being delayed.

450
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,080
It's really causing trouble.

451
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,160
Don't worry about it.

452
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,340
Since you're lying here,

453
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,460
just rest well.

454
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,360
Think of it as taking a vacation.

455
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,920
I've got things under control with the team.

456
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,820
I'm the captain.

457
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,660
Rest assured.

458
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,080
I'm not worried about others.

459
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,280
I'm worried about you, the captain.

460
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,140
You're always

461
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,680
so headstrong.

462
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,860
You'd be better off
helping your mom skewer meat.

463
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,220
Dad, didn't we agree?

464
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,620
During this year,

465
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,540
you do your coaching.

466
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,620
I play my beach volleyball.

467
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,760
We don't interfere with each other.

468
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,080
Of course, I remember.

469
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,560
But I'm telling you.

470
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,920
This six months is almost up.

471
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
I came today

472
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,240
to ask you about the coach situation.

473
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,560
Without you around,

474
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,020
we waste more time

475
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,440
every day.

476
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,320
The Seven-School League is coming.

477
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,380
We're in a hurry.

478
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,880
Look. Wait a minute.

479
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,700
Former renowned beach volleyball player

480
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,380
is returning from abroad.

481
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,440
He accepted the invitation
from the National Youth Team

482
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,940
to become their head coach.

483
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,660
Coach Lu is low-key by nature

484
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,740
and declined all interviews,

485
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,990
saying he wants to leave the spotlight

486
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,040
to the young players with more potential.

487
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,720
It's really him.

488
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,840
Uncle Li, do you know Coach Lu?

489
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,660
How could he?

490
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,480
He's the National Youth Team coach.

491
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,440
Twenty years ago, we were partners.

492
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,920
We were evenly matched,

493
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,000
but I got injured later.

494
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,820
Really?

495
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,360
I've never heard you mention this before.

496
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,200
It's nothing to talk about.

497
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,860
We were old partners

498
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,880
and played together for a long time.

499
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,980
I don't dwell on past glories.

500
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,820
Don't you know that?

501
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,720
You were the one who brought it up.

502
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,540
Uncle Li,

503
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,820
do you think Coach Lu

504
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,700
could coach

505
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,720
our beach volleyball team?

506
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,540
How could that happen?

507
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,640
Just wishful thinking.

508
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,540
(Turn Off, Turning Off)

509
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,640
I'm tired. I want to sleep for a bit.

510
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,840
Then take a nap.

511
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,780
Slow down. Don't move.

512
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,620
Slow down.

513
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,740
Let's go.

514
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,420
Let's go.

515
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,460
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

516
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,360
We're leaving, Uncle Li.

517
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,300
Uncle Zhao, it's Shao Nian.

518
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,800
I know you have a lot of connections.

519
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,120
Can you help me find someone?

520
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,960
Yes, Lu Daxing.

521
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,200
Yes, yes. The National Youth Team coach.

522
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,360
I'd like his contact information.

523
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,920
Only a landline?

524
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,880
That'll do. Thank you, Uncle Zhao.

525
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,480
If you need anything, let me know.

526
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,380
Got it.

527
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,220
Paying back the money?

528
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,360
I will.

529
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,520
I'll pay you back when I have the money.

530
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,000
We've been friends for so many years.

531
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,790
I'll transfer the money when I have it.

532
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,960
Alright, alright. Stop talking.

533
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,300
I know.

534
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,660
I told you...

535
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,520
P2P lending?

536
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,440
I'll pay you back.

537
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,480
No need to threaten me.

538
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,180
Come on.

539
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,180
You see.

540
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,680
I invested

541
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,240
in a robotic vacuum company,

542
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,640
and now the company

543
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,560
is about to distribute dividends.

544
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,320
A million a month.

545
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,080
A month.

546
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,680
Okay, got it.

547
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,740
Just a month.

548
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,280
How much debt do you have?

549
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,280
Every call is about debt.

550
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,640
Clean it up.

551
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,560
You were doing well in the sailing team,

552
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,100
with good results.

553
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,120
Why did you quit

554
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,680
to do some unreliable business?

555
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,490
Alright, alright. Daxing.

556
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,160
You're right.

557
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,520
The sailing team

558
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,960
was my dream,

559
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,180
but now I want to start my own business.

560
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,620
I'm pursuing

561
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,880
a career

562
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,020
and taking high risks.

563
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,120
It won't go smoothly.

564
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,460
It's destined

565
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,780
to be dark

566
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,680
and unnoticed.

567
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,030
I've already thought it through.

568
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,160
It's destined to be a lonely journey.

569
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,660
Give me a break.

570
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,840
You've learned nothing in the past two years,

571
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,440
except how to talk your way out of things.

572
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,940
Who is it?

573
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,880
Hello, property management.

574
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,220
Don't open it.

575
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,620
You...

576
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Which one of you is Lu Xiaole?

577
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,460
Lu Xiaole?

578
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,660
It's you, right?

579
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,680
It's so late,

580
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,480
and you're still sleeping on the sofa?

581
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,780
Lu Xiaole,

582
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,420
you owe Mr. Bao a million yuan,

583
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,360
and it's due.

584
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,900
Pay up.

585
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,280
Get up, get up.

586
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,540
Nice to meet you.

587
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,040
How about a drink?

588
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,340
No drinks.

589
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,260
Stop it.

590
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,520
- Just pay up.
- No money.

591
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,700
No money?

592
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,820
Come on.

593
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,660
Well. Rest assured.

594
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,100
I'm his cousin.

595
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,040
I'll make sure he pays up.

596
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,960
We're professionals at collecting debts.

597
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,440
We have countless ways to deal

598
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,280
with people like you who don't pay.

599
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,480
I know.

600
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,480
I've seen your methods.

601
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,960
Let me explain again.

602
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,140
Well.

603
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,760
A few years ago,

604
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,620
I invested

605
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,570
in a robotic vacuum startup.

606
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,840
The company

607
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,400
has been acquired by a large corporation.

608
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,300
In a month,

609
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,000
they'll distribute a million yuan in dividends.

610
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,580
Your money isn't a problem.

611
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,160
Enough talk.

612
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,740
All this talk

613
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,080
just means

614
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,780
you don't want to pay, right?

615
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,100
No, no, no.

616
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,480
No? Then pay up.

617
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,840
This is our first visit,

618
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,400
so we're being nice.

619
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,740
Three days.

620
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,980
If we don't see the money in three days...

621
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,920
Okay, three days.

622
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,540
Three days.

623
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,380
No problem.

624
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,160
It's settled then.

625
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,400
Well.

626
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,500
You two

627
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,480
can go now.

628
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,880
Go to the next place.

629
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,060
Three days.

630
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,940
Three days.

631
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,820
- Three days.
- Okay.

632
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,680
Thank you.

633
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,300
Modern people complain

634
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,420
that life moves fast.

635
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,260
Can't we slow down?

636
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,020
It's just a month. Is it long?

637
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,320
They said three days.

638
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,200
Think about it.

639
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,140
Daxing.

640
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,420
Stop nagging.

641
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,100
I'll handle it.

642
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,940
Go do your thing.

643
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,560
They're chasing debt to our home.

644
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,900
My home.

645
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,320
Yes, it's your home.

646
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,680
It'll be okay.

647
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,420
- Where's my clothes?
- What clothes?

648
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,260
My coat.

649
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,420
Clean it up.

650
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,680
Be careful on the road.

651
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,280
No money.

652
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,700
Hello.

653
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,120
We're looking for Coach Lu Daxing.

654
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,460
Coach Lu isn't here.

655
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,420
We're from the Xingang Beach Volleyball Team.

656
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,980
Please let him know

657
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,060
we want to hire him

658
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,120
as our head coach.

659
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,380
Okay, got it.

660
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,700
(The Big Player)

661
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,180
You can't do this.

662
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,400
Not bad.

663
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,140
- Come on.
- Join us.

664
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,400
Liqiang.

665
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,630
Come here. I need to tell you something.

666
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,380
What's wrong?

667
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,080
- What's wrong?
- Today,

668
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,740
I got good news

669
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,080
about our beach volleyball team.

670
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,490
- Good news?
- What's wrong?

671
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,600
You're Duoduo's boyfriend now?

672
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,640
Can you be serious?

673
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,300
Remember Coach Lu

674
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,250
from the National Youth Team?

675
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,060
He agreed

676
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,920
to coach us.

677
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,140
What?

678
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,740
National Youth Team coach?

679
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,980
- Yeah.
- Coming to Xingang University

680
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,020
to guide us?

681
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,860
You heard right.

682
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,260
Not bad, Shao Nian.

683
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,740
Didn't think I'd get lucky

684
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,920
in my senior year.

685
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,940
Shao Nian.

686
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,120
How do you know people

687
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,440
from the National Youth Team?

688
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,200
I don't, actually.

689
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,340
But Uncle Li said

690
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,520
he and Coach Lu were partners.

691
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,340
So,

692
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,180
I connected them.

693
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,540
So, it's Duoduo's connections.

694
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,900
You just ran errands.

695
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,020
Without me running around,

696
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,280
he wouldn't agree.

697
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,460
Alright, alright.

698
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,400
You get the credit.

699
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,340
Now it's great.

700
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,020
With the National Youth Team coach,

701
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,000
Yan Xiaojing will win the league for sure.

702
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,760
The recommendation quota
for graduates is settled.

703
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,660
How about this?

704
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,340
I'll get a membership card

705
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,300
at Duoduo's BBQ place

706
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,440
and eat there every day.

707
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,300
You're not getting a card.

708
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,900
You're just looking for a bargain.

709
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,860
I'm boosting

710
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,780
their business.

711
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,740
Right. Stop joking.

712
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,660
Go tell the teacher

713
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,960
to arrange a dorm for Coach Lu.

714
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,120
He can't have nowhere to stay.

715
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,860
Dorm might not be good.

716
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,360
He's the National Youth Team coach.

717
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,520
He might not like it

718
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,080
and not coach us well.

719
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,380
We don't have extra funds

720
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,560
for lodging.

721
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,120
I don't think a coach like him

722
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,400
would mind.

723
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,700
What do you suggest?

724
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,220
Gao.

725
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,720
Think of a solution.

726
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:03,860
Fine.

727
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,540
The National Youth Team coach coming

728
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,380
is good.

729
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,420
I'll go to the restroom.

730
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,260
You guys talk.

731
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,320
What's up with Gao?

732
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,660
Upset about it?

733
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,280
He seemed fine just now.

734
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,820
I think

735
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,620
he's upset the coach is coming.

736
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,220
His thunder will be stolen.

737
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,300
You're being ridiculous.

738
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,400
Gao isn't like that.

739
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,080
When is Lu Daxing arriving?

740
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,740
Bought the ticket this afternoon.

741
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,580
He'll arrive tomorrow.

742
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,760
That's quick.

743
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,180
He must be short on time,

744
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,360
so he wants it to be quick.

745
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,160
Let's pick him up tomorrow afternoon.

746
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,380
Sure.

747
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,620
The dorm manager was helpful today.

748
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,460
Right.

749
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,160
Thanks to my face.

750
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,300
Oh, please.

751
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,020
Don't forget to buy some fruit

752
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,420
- for the help.
- Got it.

753
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,580
I'll leave it to the current captain's

754
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,960
future boyfriend.

755
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,680
No problem. I'll handle it now.

756
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,740
Come on, Liqiang.

757
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,380
Clean up.

758
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,220
Bye-bye.

759
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,140
That kid.

760
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,160
(Everyone thought I could
join the National Youth Team,)

761
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,560
(including myself.)

762
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,780
(But reality)

763
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,160
(often hits you hardest)

764
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,480
(when you're most confident.)

765
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,560
(That's when I realized)

766
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,040
(I was too naive.)

767
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,680
(National Youth Team Information,
Bulletin Board)

768
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,760
Mom, I made it.

769
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,160
Yes, I made it.

770
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,620
How about you two?

771
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,620
- As expected.
- Not a chance.

772
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,700
Another year wasted.

773
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,560
Try again next year.

774
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,860
Let's see it for you.

775
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,740
Look.

776
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,540
How could he fail?

777
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,420
Impossible.

778
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,880
I saw the teacher nodding.

779
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,480
You're still young.

780
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,300
If you don't make it this time,

781
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,440
there's next time.

782
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,040
I think

783
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,740
you should

784
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,800
go to college first.

785
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,520
After that,

786
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,400
you can switch to sports, right?

787
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,620
Actually,

788
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,280
life has many paths.

789
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,120
If this one doesn't work,

790
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,040
you can take another.

791
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,240
A thousand-mile journey
begins with the first step.

792
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,640
Let's take our time

793
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,680
and live well now.

794
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,620
(Beach Volleyball Activity Room)

795
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,060
Xia.

796
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,100
- No training?
- No.

797
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,740
The new coach is coming.

798
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,200
I'm organizing training plans.

799
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,560
The National Youth Team coach?

800
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,600
Gao told you?

801
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,320
How's that? Exciting, isn't it?

802
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,840
I'm okay.

803
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,720
But Gao Ge

804
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,320
didn't seem excited.

805
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,760
No way.

806
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,060
The National Youth Team coach is coming.

807
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,920
How can he not be excited?

808
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,800
Is something wrong with him?

809
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,080
You know your buddy best.

810
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,860
Xia Liqiang.

811
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,540
Did you ask the teacher for leave?

812
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,920
Yes. What did you do?

813
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,700
What else?

814
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,520
Writing my thesis and training.

815
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,940
The team

816
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,200
isn't training, right?

817
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,300
Can't I train extra?

818
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,060
The Seven-School League

819
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,900
is important to me.

820
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,460
I'm dedicated. Okay?

821
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,300
Fine.

822
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,360
Listen.

823
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,780
Do you know Coach Lu Daxing

824
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,300
from the National Youth Team

825
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,660
is coming to guide us?

826
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,240
The National Youth Team coach?

827
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,900
You're joking.

828
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,400
Why would he come to Xingang?

829
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,660
Why not?

830
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,640
Xingang is a hidden gem.

831
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,480
Our players have huge potential for their team.

832
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,040
Just Chen Weilan. Who else?

833
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,480
Me and Gao.

834
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,940
Who and Gao? I didn't hear it.

835
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,540
Me and Gao.

836
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:53,200
Stop teasing.

837
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,140
A National Youth Team coach coming

838
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,100
isn't exciting?

839
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,380
It's exciting.

840
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,800
It's the National Youth Team coach.

841
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
How long is he staying?

842
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,680
Just sightseeing?

843
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,940
You

844
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,500
are overthinking.

845
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,300
He's the National Youth Team coach.

846
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,420
Even a day's guidance

847
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,440
helps with our skills.

848
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,700
I envy your optimism.

849
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,640
Always happy.

850
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,220
Do all women

851
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,710
like to tell people off like this?

852
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,980
All women?

853
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,700
Besides me and your mom,

854
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,800
what other women do you have?

855
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,700
No, don't be so suspicious,

856
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,540
okay?

857
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,420
Are you going to tell me or not?

858
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,700
Which woman told you off?

859
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,820
Tell me. Tell me.

860
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,670
Chen Weilan.

861
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,180
Chen Weilan?

862
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,670
She said I don't care about Gao.

863
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,860
But actually, Gao

864
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,260
seems to have tried out

865
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,480
for the National Youth Team before.

866
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:42,930
Really?

867
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,080
I don't think Gao Ge

868
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,220
looks like someone with ambitions.

869
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,380
True.

870
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,270
He doesn't seem keen on things

871
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,710
that require drive.

872
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,160
He almost got suspended
because he didn't get along

873
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,670
with Coach Wang Dong.

874
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,580
Anyway,

875
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,100
the National Youth Team coach is coming.

876
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,960
That's a good thing.

877
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,520
Who invited him?

878
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,840
Shao Nian did.

879
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,520
He put in a lot of effort.

880
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,780
Make sure to keep this a secret

881
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,980
from Mo Xixi.

882
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,920
He wants to surprise Li Guoduo.

883
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,600
Look at him,

884
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,640
and then look at you.

885
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,820
What's wrong with me?

886
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,220
What surprises do we need?

887
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,740
We've been together for so long.

888
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,180
Stability is what's important now.

889
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,480
Oh, forget it.

890
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,480
What are you doing?

891
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,040
I just topped up my meal card,

892
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,350
and I also got one for Coach Lu.

893
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,780
So he can eat at the cafeteria when he arrives.

894
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,800
Is everything set?

895
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,380
Liqiang is cleaning the dorm right now,

896
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,860
so I came over to top up the meal card.

897
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,880
It'll be ready when he arrives.

898
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,980
Do you think

899
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,920
a National Youth Team coach

900
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,420
can live in a dorm

901
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,520
and eat at the cafeteria?

902
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,920
Honestly,

903
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,820
I'm a bit worried about that too.

904
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,200
They're used to better living conditions.

905
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,580
But with limited funds,

906
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,420
there's nothing we can do.

907
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,840
I'm curious to see

908
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,440
what changes he'll bring to our team.

909
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,680
There will definitely be changes.

910
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,080
But seven days of training seems too short.

911
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,640
Still, it's good that he's coming.

912
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,020
Let me check these two meal cards,

913
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,400
so they don't get mixed up.

914
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,800
I've already checked.

915
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,540
(Balance)

916
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,320
Didn't you say there was no budget?

917
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,460
This card is my meal card.

918
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,580
I was going to top it up with 300

919
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,860
but accidentally added an extra zero

920
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,880
and ended up topping it up

921
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,050
with my whole 3,000 living allowance.

922
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,020
I wanted to top up another card

923
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,460
with 1,000 for the coach,

924
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,300
but I'm afraid

925
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,900
I'll mix up the 3,000 and 1,000 cards.

926
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,820
- So I...
- Wait.

927
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,560
So, everything's okay, right?

928
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,240
Yes. Everything's fine.

929
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,080
Alright then. Let's eat.

930
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,480
Have you heard?

931
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,880
Heard what?

932
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,060
About the National Youth Team coach coming?

933
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,120
I heard it a long time ago.

934
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,360
Oh, so you already knew.

935
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,060
Is he handsome?

936
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,540
Can I get an autograph or a photo?

937
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,780
Xiaojing told us this morning.

938
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,360
You're behind on the news.

939
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,520
So, I'm the last to know.

940
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,700
Let me tell you.

941
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,160
Ever since being with Xia Liqiang,

942
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,090
I haven't needed to follow

943
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:29,980
hot topics or trending news.

944
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,720
Are we all going to pick up Coach Lu?

945
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,780
- Of course not.
- Why not?

946
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,900
Shao Nian invited Coach Lu

947
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,020
without telling Duoduo.

948
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,700
He wants to surprise her.

949
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,090
We can't spoil the surprise.

950
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,120
Got it.

951
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,160
Shao Nian is really sweet to Duoduo.

952
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,620
The three of them will pick up Coach Lu.

953
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,400
We'll stay here and wait for Duoduo.

954
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,460
Alright then.

955
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,400
Back to training.

956
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,380
Hey, bro.

957
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,540
How did you get

958
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
such an expensive car?

959
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,100
Do you have a secret way to make money?

960
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,960
Tell me.

961
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,620
Liqiang,

962
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,820
if you want to rent a car,

963
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,320
I can introduce you to this rental place.

964
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,440
You're so handsome.
They might give you a discount.

965
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,640
A rental?

966
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,740
Mascot,

967
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,800
you're spoiling him.

968
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,880
Who's not spoiling him?

969
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,960
What's Yan Xiaojing up to these days?

970
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,860
No, no. Put your phone away.

971
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,860
Why?

972
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,700
We're a team.

973
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,880
No infighting.

974
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,640
Seriously though,

975
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,020
how did you find

976
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,990
the National Youth Team coach?

977
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,740
Uncle Li mentioned before

978
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,380
he had a teammate in the National Youth Team

979
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,000
named Lu Daxing.

980
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,520
Uncle Li is hospitalized,

981
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,240
so I thought of reaching out to him.

982
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Don't worry.

983
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,580
I've arranged the accommodation

984
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,680
and topped up the meal card.

985
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,580
Do you think he'll find

986
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,840
our arrangements too shabby?

987
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,320
He won't.

988
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,800
If Coach Lu was Uncle Li's teammate,

989
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,500
he must have been a student

990
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,900
at Xingang University too.

991
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,900
So,

992
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,120
he's our senior.

993
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,500
Got it.

994
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,640
Thanks, bro.

995
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,100
Your contributions to the team

996
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,960
will never be forgotten.

997
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,960
Don't flatter yourself.

998
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,740
He's not doing it for you.

999
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,880
He's doing it for the captain.

1000
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,460
What are you doing?

1001
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,140
Don't distract the driver

1002
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,280
while driving.

1003
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,060
Hello?

1004
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,040
This is Lu Daxing.

1005
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,340
Coach Lu.

1006
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,500
We're on our way

1007
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,440
to pick you up at the airport.

1008
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,540
Go ahead.

1009
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,580
There's no need to pick me up.

1010
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,880
I'm already at your school's entrance.

1011
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,960
You're already there?

1012
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,300
Yes.

1013
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,520
Just come to the school entrance

1014
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,260
to pick me up.

1015
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,600
Alright then.

1016
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,440
He's arrived at the school?

1017
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,760
Let's head back to the school.

1018
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,600
We came all this way for nothing.

1019
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,400
Didn't he say he was at the school entrance?

1020
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,160
I'll call and ask.

1021
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,280
Can't tell who it is.

1022
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,620
Well.

1023
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,390
Hello?

1024
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,960
Are you Coach Lu?

1025
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,980
Hello, hello. I'm Lu Daxing.

1026
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,420
Hello, hello.

1027
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,300
I'm Xia Liqiang,

1028
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,140
the former captain
of the beach volleyball team.

1029
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,650
This is my teammate, Gao Ge.

1030
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,500
Coach, hello.

1031
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,180
- This is our doctor and assistant coach.
- Hello, hello.

1032
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,020
Shao Nian.

1033
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,480
Hello, Coach Lu, I'm Shao Nian.

1034
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,440
You said you were the former captain, right?

1035
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,140
Where's the current captain?

1036
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,940
Our current captain is Li Guoduo.

1037
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,440
She's waiting for you at the court.

1038
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:11,980
Alright.

1039
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,440
Let's head to the dorms.

1040
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,700
Coach.

1041
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,940
We have limited funds,

1042
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,180
so you might have to rough it out

1043
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,840
with us in the dorms for a bit.

1044
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,220
Staying in the dorms, huh?

1045
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,060
Yeah.

1046
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,860
Well.

1047
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,300
Staying on campus is nice too.

1048
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,020
A bit nostalgic. I like it.

1049
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,900
Sorry about that, Coach.

1050
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,560
How about we head to the dorms now?

1051
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,940
No need.

1052
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,180
Since I'm here to work

1053
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,500
with the beach volleyball team,

1054
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,940
I should go

1055
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,060
to see the team first.

1056
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,300
- Alright.
- Okay.

1057
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,700
- Let's go.
- Off we go.

1058
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,140
- Let's get in the car.
- The luggage.

1059
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,100
I'll take care of it.

1060
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,380
Nice car you've got there.

1061
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,080
It's okay. It's rented.

1062
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,120
When do you think the new coach will arrive?

1063
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,920
Not sure.

1064
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,120
They went to pick him up. They'll be here soon.

1065
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,900
I'm really curious

1066
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,560
what kind of person he is.

1067
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,320
If he's a strict coach,

1068
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,360
I'll put on more sunscreen.

1069
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,540
But

1070
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,500
if he's handsome,

1071
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,520
I'll make a good impression.

1072
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,160
What about your Longlong?

1073
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,220
We've been training

1074
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,920
on our own all this time.

1075
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,780
I think we need a professional coach.

1076
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,620
What do you think?

1077
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,420
I'm not counting on a coach.

1078
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,860
We'll just keep going on our own.

1079
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,320
Keep pushing forward.

1080
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,860
Everyone,

1081
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,900
I have some good news.

1082
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,440
Come on, Duoduo, Weilan, have a seat.

1083
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,880
What's the good news?

1084
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,960
You'll know in a moment.

1085
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,340
Such a mystery.

1086
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,240
Here they come.

1087
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,140
Come on.

1088
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,480
Let me introduce everyone.

1089
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,020
This is

1090
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,500
the coach from the National Youth Team.

1091
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,760
Lu Daxing.

1092
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,940
Lu Daxing.

1093
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,000
Everyone, let's welcome him.

1094
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,900
- Welcome, Coach.
- Welcome, Coach.

1095
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,840
Welcome.

1096
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,900
Welcome, Coach.

1097
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,740
