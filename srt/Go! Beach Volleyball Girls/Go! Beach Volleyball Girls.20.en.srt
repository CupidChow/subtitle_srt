Duoduo, Duoduo.

19
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,360
Come here.

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,420
Check this out.

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,720
This looks great. It's so cool.

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,640
This is good.

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,480
Right?

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,000
This...

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,840
Shao...

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,900
Xixi, look.

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,660
I told you it was cool, right?

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,780
(Shao: Monster attacks.)

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,780
(Gotta save the world.)

30
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,660
(Don't worry.)

31
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,700
Mom, what are you doing here?

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,520
Why? Can't I be here?

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,460
How else can I pick you up?

34
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,440
I didn't mean it like that, Mom.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,060
Do you still remember I'm your mom?

36
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,780
You just gave ice cream to a girl.

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,620
Is she your girlfriend?

38
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,760
She's not.

39
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,900
She's just a friend.

40
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,280
I don't think your relationship

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,300
is just friendship.

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
Wasn't the money spent

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,280
on your credit card for her?

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,740
No, it wasn't spent on her.

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,300
Then where did the money go?

46
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,120
I...

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,800
I spent it elsewhere.

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,860
Really, it wasn't for her.

49
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,980
Not for her?

50
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,040
Why are you staying

51
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,420
at her family's barbecue place?

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,860
Mom, are you spying on me?

53
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,240
Sweetie,

54
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not worried about the money.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,020
I'm worried you'll be deceived.

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,080
There are many girls

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
who are vain

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,720
and manipulative these days.

59
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,600
They say

60
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,400
they don't want boys to spend money

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,680
on them to enhance their appeal.

62
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,780
Sweetie, don't get tricked.

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,960
She stays close to you

64
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,440
and lets you stay at her place.

65
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,220
Isn't that manipulative?

66
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,440
Mom, please stop

67
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,040
making baseless accusations.

68
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,600
Duoduo is not like that.

69
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,200
Fine, I won't say more.

70
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,360
You're coming home with me.

71
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,540
I'm not going.

72
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,180
Alright, then.

73
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,200
Should I go to your school

74
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,800
or her barbecue place?

75
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,920
You choose.

76
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,860
Mom...

77
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,620
This looks great.

78
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,960
Looks good.

79
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,340
- This one.
- You've improved.

80
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,960
Yeah.

81
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,320
What's going on?

82
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,520
- Who's that?
- Who is it?

83
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,840
Isn't that Du Weilong's car?

84
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,100
- Check it out.
- Let's go.

85
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, my.

86
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,520
What are you doing?

87
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,820
Driving like that?

88
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,120
Exactly.

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,260
Seriously, who is this?

90
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,600
What are you doing?

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,680
Can you actually drive?

92
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,720
That's too dangerous.

93
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,140
I'm really sorry. I apologize.

94
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,320
Good thing nothing happened,

95
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,490
or who would be responsible?

96
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,300
Xixi,

97
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,200
I apologize

98
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,460
for my previous behavior,

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,000
and I also apologize

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,300
to all your teammates.

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,300
I acted rashly.

102
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,100
Can you forgive me?

103
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,780
Are you done?

104
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,120
If so, leave.

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,540
Can't you see you're not welcome?

106
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,180
Hey,

107
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,100
I'm really here to apologize.

108
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,900
Won't you give me a chance?

109
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,600
I even brought gifts.

110
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
Don't you want to see them?

111
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,780
Please consider it.

112
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,620
Let's talk privately,

113
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,320
okay?

114
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,520
Why are you so persistent?

115
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,360
I'll call the police.

116
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,200
It's okay, Duoduo.

117
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,120
Alright.

118
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,460
I'll talk to you privately.

119
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,760
- Xixi.
- Xixi.

120
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,640
It's okay.

121
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,820
What's going on between you two?

122
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,560
If you don't want to go,

123
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,900
we won't let you.

124
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,460
It's fine. Don't worry.

125
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,760
Let's go.

126
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,820
Let's talk privately.

127
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,340
Okay. Don't be mad.

128
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,400
I'm here to apologize.

129
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,620
I'll treat everyone to dinner.

130
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Please forgive me.

131
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,720
No way.

132
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,620
This guy really has thick skin.

133
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,020
They're...

134
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,650
reconciled already?

135
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,020
That was fast.

136
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,620
All good now.

137
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,140
Let's go over there.

138
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,700
Weilong said he wanted

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,060
to join us for the celebration.

140
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,620
He genuinely apologizes to everyone.

141
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,700
Maybe

142
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,820
we should let him join us for dinner.

143
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,980
He's treating us.

144
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah.

145
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,100
Don't get me wrong.

146
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,020
We've come to know each other.

147
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,120
Duoduo.

148
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,920
Weilan.

149
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,760
Fine.

150
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,140
We can pretend he's invisible.

151
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,660
Think it over.

152
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,300
There are a few seats left in Weilong's car.

153
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,940
- Who's coming with me?
- Not me.

154
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,640
How about we go with Xixi?

155
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,680
We'll go with you, Xixi.

156
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,640
Alright, let's go.

157
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,840
- Drive safely.
- Let's go.

158
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,880
Xiaojing? Why?

159
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,720
Don't worry.

160
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,880
I need to accompany her.

161
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,900
Let him drive slowly.

162
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,880
Let's go have something good to eat.

163
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,720
Let's go.

164
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,180
They're back!

165
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,080
(Congrats to Xingang's
Beach Volleyball Team)

166
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,420
Welcome, welcome!

167
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,460
Welcome!

168
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,560
Congratulations.

169
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,960
Congrats, great performance!

170
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,520
Great performance! Hurry.

171
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,040
Let's set the table.

172
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,200
- Time to eat.
- Let's go.

173
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,220
- Let's eat!
- Let's go.

174
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,220
Great, fantastic!

175
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,740
- Congrats!
- Come on in!

176
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,020
Xia Liqiang.

177
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,840
Let's celebrate properly today.

178
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,740
Come on in.

179
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,240
Dafu, you should restock later.

180
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,180
The back room doesn't have much left.

181
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,400
Okay.

182
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,480
Mrs. Li,

183
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,760
I think our promotion

184
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,960
was really effective this time.

185
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,660
We have a lot of customers coming,

186
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
and many investors are impressed with us.

187
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,340
Next time, I'll increase our efforts.

188
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,160
I haven't thanked you yet.

189
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,640
You're good at doing business.

190
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,480
Right?

191
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,240
The business has really picked up.

192
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,080
Thank you.

193
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,260
No problem.

194
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,440
It looks

195
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,260
like the beach volleyball team is on track now.

196
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,080
Coach Lu,

197
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,700
keep an eye on the girls

198
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
and make sure they train well.

199
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,380
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,220
Bring a plate over.

201
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,640
Coming.

202
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,970
- Alright, good.
- Here.

203
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,960
- Eat.
- Leave it to me.

204
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,800
Okay.

205
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,880
Welcome, everyone!

206
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,790
Eat more.

207
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,000
- Enjoy!
- Coming.

208
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,250
Definitely. We'll dig in.

209
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,740
Kebabs are here.

210
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,130
Eat up, everyone.

211
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,720
Plenty to go around today.

212
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,540
Thank you, Uncle.

213
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,540
Li, just in time.

214
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,640
The first drink

215
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,040
is to thank Dafu

216
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,080
for the training plan.

217
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,180
Without his meticulous plan,

218
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,420
we might not have made it today.

219
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,060
- Come on!
- Thanks, Coach.

220
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,580
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

221
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,720
Well.

222
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,820
I just talked.

223
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,540
The real credit goes

224
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,780
to your talent and hard work.

225
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,220
This drink is for you.

226
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,200
- Thank you, Dafu.
- Thank you.

227
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,460
- Thanks, Coach.
- Thanks, Uncle.

228
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,580
That's enough, Dad.

229
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,920
Good drinkers!

230
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,640
- Duoduo, get everything ready.
- Okay.

231
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,480
- You go.
- Enjoy.

232
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,460
I'll handle it.

233
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,110
Eat up while it's hot.

234
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,320
Come on, eat, eat!

235
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,760
- Try this.
- This.

236
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,820
- This is good.
- Coach.

237
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,660
Sure.

238
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,820
Coach, you eat too.

239
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,000
You two are so sweet.

240
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,080
Please stop.

241
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,980
Let me tell you.

242
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,640
We're mostly single here.

243
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,360
If you don't treat us well,

244
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
we'll outdrink you.

245
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm so scared.

246
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
Let's bow to the power.

247
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,540
How about we punish ourselves with a drink?

248
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,820
Go on.

249
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,940
Fill it up.

250
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,380
We'll drink on our own.

251
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,220
- Not with us.
- Cheers!

252
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,720
- Just us then.
- Coach!

253
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,660
We'll drink.

254
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,580
- Coach, come on.
- Sure.

255
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,000
- Well.
- Eat up.

256
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,300
I was wrong last time.

257
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,180
I'm apologizing again today.

258
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,100
Can I refuse?

259
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,520
Of course.

260
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,590
It's your choice.

261
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,780
Well said.

262
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,760
Apologizing is your choice.

263
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,300
Forgiving is mine.

264
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,700
And who had the right to smash the shop?

265
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,380
I was impulsive.

266
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,320
You won't hold grudges, right?

267
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,160
Stop.

268
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,120
I'm petty.

269
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,360
I can't let it go.

270
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,060
I'm the type to seek revenge.

271
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,720
So, what do you

272
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,020
want me to do?

273
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,080
What do I want?

274
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,140
It's simple.

275
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,520
Open a shop,

276
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
and I'll smash it

277
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,360
to vent my anger.

278
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,460
How's that?

279
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,880
Alright, alright.

280
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
What's with all this?

281
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,460
We're here to celebrate, right?

282
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,980
Let's raise a glass to wish

283
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,320
Xiaojing and Xixi success

284
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,800
in their match the day after tomorrow.

285
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,520
Yes, to Xiaojing and Xixi!

286
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,680
You can do it!

287
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,360
- Go for it!
- Thanks, everyone.

288
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
You can do it.

289
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,040
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

290
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,980
You have to win.

291
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,720
Seems we got

292
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,120
to know each other because of it.

293
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,220
We didn't actually fight,

294
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,860
but we still got acquainted.

295
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,220
Xixi, Xiaojing, come here.

296
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,040
Make sure to perform well

297
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,880
in the next match.

298
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,580
You're quite strong.

299
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,720
- Don't slip up.
- OK. Thanks.

300
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,880
- Go for it.
- Do your best.

301
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,320
- We'll do our best.
- Cheers.

302
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,160
Won't let you down.

303
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,440
Ladies,

304
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,680
give us some face.

305
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,180
Xixi's still here.

306
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,800
Though what Du did before

307
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,200
was pretty scummy,

308
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,280
he did apologize.

309
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,120
Right?

310
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,000
Let's all calm down.

311
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,160
Calm down.

312
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,080
Just endure it

313
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,840
for Xixi's sake.

314
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,780
Alright?

315
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,600
Fine, fine.

316
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,440
I'll just ignore him.

317
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,080
But I won't change my attitude

318
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,920
towards him.

319
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,660
I'll try to be a bit more natural,

320
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,780
but talking to him depends

321
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,640
on my mood.

322
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,420
I'm really scared of you two.

323
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,180
Here come the kebabs!

324
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,440
Xixi, why aren't you inside

325
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,280
eating with everyone?

326
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,740
- What would you like?
- Take this.

327
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,520
Sorry, Uncle and Auntie.

328
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,600
I came out to apologize

329
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,740
for what happened last time

330
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,760
when my boyfriend caused trouble.

331
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,280
It was our fault.

332
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,320
He's here today

333
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,660
and will come out to apologize.

334
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,040
The one who smashed our shop

335
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,900
was your boyfriend?

336
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,320
He is here?

337
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,560
It's packed. I didn't see him.

338
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,520
I need to talk with him.

339
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,920
Auntie, don't be angry.

340
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,760
He came today

341
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,160
to celebrate

342
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,740
with Duoduo for Xiaojing and me.

343
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,380
What happened was our fault.

344
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,680
I didn't ask him to apologize right away

345
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,640
because I was worried

346
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,580
you wouldn't accept it.

347
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,180
If you want,

348
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,700
I'll call him out to apologize.

349
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,880
I'll go now.

350
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,980
- Xixi, Xixi.
- I...

351
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,540
No need.

352
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,600
Let your auntie calm down first.

353
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
You go back inside.

354
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,940
Go.

355
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,480
Sorry, Uncle.

356
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,620
Sorry, Auntie.

357
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,080
It's alright. Go on.

358
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,780
Okay, I'll head back now.

359
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,220
Sorry, sorry.

360
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,400
It's fine. No problem.

361
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,960
I keep my word.

362
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,900
- Duoduo.
- I'll drink.

363
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,420
Listen to me, Duoduo.

364
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,420
Duoduo,

365
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,760
last time, I was impulsive

366
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,820
and said the wrong things.

367
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,720
I'm sorry. This is to you.

368
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,020
Xixi, you don't have to do this.

369
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,680
Xixi.

370
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,000
Xixi, don't drink so much.

371
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,280
Just a sip. No need for so much.

372
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,480
- Don't drink anymore.
- Xixi.

373
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,200
You've had too much.

374
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,900
It's okay. I'll drink with her.

375
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,820
If you don't forgive us today,

376
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,200
we'll keep drinking

377
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,320
until you do.

378
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,680
- Come on.
- Come on.

379
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,000
You can't do this.

380
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,880
Pour her less, please.

381
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,720
Don't stir things up.

382
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,140
It's all my fault.

383
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,960
- Stop drinking.
- Xixi.

384
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,000
What are you doing?

385
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,980
Stop drinking.

386
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
Give it to me.

387
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,200
You've had too much.

388
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,140
What's wrong with you?

389
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
What's wrong?

390
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,940
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

391
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,680
I'm sorry.

392
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,760
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

393
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,880
I'm sorry.

394
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,480
It's alright. It's not your fault.

395
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,920
No one's blaming you. Not your fault.

396
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,880
- Okay?
- I'm sorry.

397
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
No one's blaming you.

398
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,840
Stop blaming yourself.

399
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,100
- Don't cry.
- I'm sorry.

400
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,140
Duoduo, I'm sorry.

401
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,920
- I'm not blaming you. No one is blaming you.
- Sorry.

402
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,220
Stop blaming yourself.

403
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,980
It's all my fault.

404
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,480
No.

405
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,740
No one is blaming you, right?

406
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,520
No one.

407
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,420
Not your fault.

408
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,680
You've had too much.

409
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,720
I'm sorry.

410
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,480
It's okay. It's really okay.

411
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,600
Sit down.

412
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,480
Stop drinking.

413
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,500
You've had too much.

414
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,740
What do you mean by this?

415
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,040
Did you not see how badly the shop

416
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,000
was trashed last time?

417
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,400
I even hurt my back.

418
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,080
And now he has the nerve to eat here?

419
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,620
I have to go say something to him.

420
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,540
Alright, alright.

421
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,560
Young people

422
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
can be impulsive sometimes

423
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,120
and make mistakes.

424
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,960
It's normal, right?

425
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,120
It's understandable.

426
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,960
Right?

427
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,380
Besides,

428
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,180
with so many customers here,

429
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,180
causing a scene

430
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,700
would affect business.

431
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,540
Think about it.

432
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,980
He's Duoduo's classmate's boyfriend.

433
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,740
If we fall out,

434
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,560
how will Duoduo handle it

435
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,740
at school?

436
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,700
I think

437
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,440
we should let it go.

438
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,040
Why do I always do this?

439
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,080
It's all my fault.

440
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,680
- Stop blaming yourself.
- Okay, got it.

441
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,940
- We trust you.
- We're coming.

442
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,900
Okay. Alright.

443
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,810
It's okay. There, there.

444
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,450
- Sorry.
- Don't cry.

445
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,400
I think

446
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,420
let's end here.

447
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,740
Let's go.

448
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,900
My friend has a room.

449
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,760
Let's go sing.

450
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,920
- My treat!
- Yeah.

451
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,680
Let's go sing.

452
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,860
Let's go have some fun.

453
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,340
So you're suggesting

454
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,580
the girls go drinking with you?

455
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,120
That's not appropriate.

456
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,380
You can go on your own.

457
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,020
No one here wants to go with you.

458
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,160
Take care.

459
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,020
You're not going anywhere.

460
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,280
I'm not.

461
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,100
It's fine.

462
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,980
If you want to go, call me anytime.

463
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,460
My friend runs a place.

464
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,420
I'll get you a discount.

465
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,540
Xixi, we're leaving.

466
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,030
- Let's go.
- I...

467
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,940
- Xixi.
- Xixi.

468
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,860
Everyone, I'm off to have some fun. Bye.

469
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,460
Xixi, no...

470
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,740
- What?
- She's had too much to drink.

471
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,000
I need to check on her.

472
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,660
Xixi, Xixi.

473
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,600
This is...

474
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,620
Xixi.

(Dafu BBQ)

476
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,450
Xixi.

477
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,500
Duoduo.

478
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,760
You're drunk. You can't go anywhere.

479
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,500
She's had too much. I'll take her back.

480
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,520
We have a room here. She can stay with us.

481
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,640
You're not reliable to me.

482
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,880
I'm her boyfriend. Don't worry.

483
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,720
Let go.

484
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,780
Let go.

485
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,760
Fine.

486
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,100
Since you're drunk,

487
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,660
you should stay here.

488
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,060
Call me if you need anything.

489
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,400
Goodnight.

490
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,580
Take good care of her.

491
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,680
Let's go.

492
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,340
(I must save the world. Urgent.)

493
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,140
You need to tell me if you're safe.

494
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,420
What if aliens abducted you?

495
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,660
(Don't worry. Wait for my safe return.)

496
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,740
You've been silent

497
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,420
since you came home.

498
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,620
What?

499
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,760
Giving me the silent treatment?

500
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,600
Right?

501
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,940
If you don't speak, I will.

502
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,040
Work and relationships

503
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,580
are major life events.

504
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,460
You need to think carefully.

505
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,860
This girl is not suitable for you.

506
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,620
Even if you're together now,

507
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,820
you'll eventually break up.

508
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,380
When you're more mature,

509
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,780
you'll look back

510
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,900
and regret

511
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,880
wasting this time.

512
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,140
Why would I regret it?

513
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,200
Why would we definitely break up?

514
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,300
We have true love.

515
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,840
True love?

516
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,460
You finally admit you're in love.

517
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,960
Let me tell you.

518
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,540
There's no such thing as true love.

519
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,400
Everyone is selfish

520
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,760
and has their own agenda.

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,140

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,880
She's not here?

567
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,720
She's not.

568
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,280
Li Guoduo.

569
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,800
Yan Xiaojing. Warm up.

570
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,140
- We'll start practice.
- Got it.

571
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,920
Maybe she drank too much last night

572
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,140
and hasn't gotten up yet.

573
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,060
I'll check on her after practice.

574
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,380
Where's Chen Weilan?

575
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,180
She's on sick leave.

576
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,620
She's on sick leave?

577
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,860
What are you doing, Gao? Keep going.

578
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,960
Sure.

579
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Your wrist used

580
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,360
to dislocate habitually.

581
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,640
From this X-ray,

582
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,860
it's healing well.

583
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,560
But you need to be careful,

584
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,020
or it might recur.

585
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,960
But recently,

586
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,000
whenever I exert too much force,

587
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,480
it hurts a lot here.

588
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,340
Is it a bone problem, or...?

589
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,400
No.

590
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,760
It's not a bone issue.

591
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,600
It's

592
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,920
neural pain

593
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,460
caused by hitting.

594
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,380
It didn't damage the bone.

595
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,880
Rest for a few days,

596
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,960
and the pain

597
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,320
should ease.

598
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,240
But be careful in the future,

599
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,320
or you won't be as lucky

600
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,500
next time.

601
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,000
- Okay.
- Get some medicine.

602
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,200
Thank you.

603
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,940
(Room 6)

604
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,760
Hello, Coach Zhang?

605
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,600
Weilan,

606
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,900
how have you been?

607
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,640
Keeping up with training?

608
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,060
I'm training every day.

609
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,960
It's a pity you didn't

610
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,060
make the NYT last time.

611
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,320
Though there's nothing

612
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,440
wrong with your skills,

613
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,120
your playing style is too solo-focused.

614
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,040
I believe

615
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,720
you've noticed this issue yourself.

616
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,880
Coach, are you calling

617
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,020
to mock me?

618
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,740
You silly girl.

619
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Of course not.

620
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
By the way, I have good news.

621
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,040
The NYT

622
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,480
is coming to your university

623
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,620
to scout players soon.

624
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,360
This is a great chance to prove yourself again.

625
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,600
Perform well

626
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,440
and aim

627
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,940
to rejoin the team.

628
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,480
The NYT is coming to our school?

629
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,320
Yes.

630
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,160
How's that?

631
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,640
I...

632
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,360
What? Is there a problem?

633
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,820
I'll think about it.

634
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,060
What's there to consider?

635
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,400
Coach Zhang,

636
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,380
I have something to do. I'll talk to you later.

637
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,460
Why are you here?

638
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,640
Is your hand

639
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,940
okay?

640
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,500
It's fine.

641
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,380
I overheard you considering

642
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,480
leaving the beach volleyball team

643
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,640
for the NYT.

644
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,540
Is that true?

645
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,620
I haven't decided yet.

646
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,760
Why?

647
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,660
Why what?

648
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,760
The is just getting on track.

649
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,720
Leaving now seems

650
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,480
irresponsible.

651
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,360
Irresponsible?

652
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,920
I'm an indoor volleyball player,

653
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,340
now playing beach volleyball.

654
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,980
Who's responsible for my future?

655
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,640
So, you still have that idea, don't you?

656
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,860
I don't.

657
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,820
If you leave,

658
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,260
what about

659
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,260
Li Guoduo

660
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,180
and me?

661
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,780
You don't care, do you?

662
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,560
Fine.

663
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,220
I get it.

664
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,400
Li Guoduo,

665
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,880
can you

666
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,340
hit the ball harder?

667
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,400
That's easy for the opponents to and score.

668
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,260
Do you understand?

669
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,280
And you, Yan Xiaojing.

670
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,300
Are you still half-asleep?

671
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,280
I... I...

672
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,720
Are you still half-asleep?

673
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,740
Lu!

674
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,560
Xiaole!

675
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,540
Long time no see!

676
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,560
What?

677
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,240
Not going to greet

678
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,200
- an old friend?
- Yeah.

679
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,040
You're free today?

680
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,760
Yeah. Just passing by.

681
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,080
Thought we'd drop in

682
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,920
to visit you.

683
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,980
Should we discuss

684
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,680
our matter

685
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
here

686
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,660
or elsewhere?

687
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,960
Definitely not here. Let's go over there.

688
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,820
Let's go.

689
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,180
Coach,

690
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,720
is everything okay?

691
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,180
These two are my brothers.

692
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,100
- Brothers.
- Let's go.

693
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,340
Good brothers.

694
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,380
The wind is giving me a headache.

695
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,720
Excuse me. Which one of you is Coach Lu?

696
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,640
Coach Lu just left.

697
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,560
What do you need?

698
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,520
The administration is having a meeting.

699
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,400
It's urgent.

700
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,600
Maybe one of you could go instead?

701
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,740
- Okay.
- Sure.

702
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,780
What are you doing?

703
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,920
Mr. Lu, we'll take these two with us.

704
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,840
Please cooperate and come with us

705
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,100
to make a statement.

706
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,620
Explain to the police.

707
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,340
Debts should be repaid.

708
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,530
You need to explain this.

709
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,720
- Let's go.
- Coach Tian...

710
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,920
You should come with us.

711
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,820
Get in that car.

712
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,420
Secretary, you asked for me?

713
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,220
Li Guoduo, come in and sit.

714
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,240
I heard your beach volleyball team

715
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,500
is doing well.

716
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,540
Making it to the finals in the league

717
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,560
is quite an achievement

718
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,700
for our university.

719
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,160
We have some strengths.

720
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,480
We also owe it

721
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,700
to the school's support.

722
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,720
Actually, I called you here

723
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,060
not for something important.

724
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,240
I heard that your team

725
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,500
was criticized by other schools

726
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,380
for accepting sponsorships

727
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
and promoting ads

728
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,180
during matches.

729
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
This shows

730
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,220
our school's influence.

731
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,640
They knew we had limited resources,

732
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,920
so they donated supplies out of goodwill.

733
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,360
We, in return,

734
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,440
upheld the virtue

735
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,000
of gratitude and helped

736
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,620
spread their goodwill.

737
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,320
You are

738
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,700
a good speaker.

739
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,740
It's not that your actions were wrong.

740
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,000
After all,

741
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,040
getting sponsorship

742
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,260
is a legitimate commercial activity.

743
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,220
But don't forget.

744
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,000
You represent the school

745
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,660
and the beach volleyball team.

746
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,060
It's about the school's reputation.

747
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,120
So, the administration

748
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,260
has decided to supervise

749
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,620
the sponsorship funds

750
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,920
to prevent

751
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,940
any controversy

752
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,840
and ensure everything

753
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,980
is in order.

754
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,960
Don't be surprised.

755
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,600
The supervision

756
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,100
isn't to take over

757
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,600
but to verify your accounts.

758
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,980
This way,

759
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,680
if any issues arise,

760
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,600
the school can step in

761
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,940
to resolve them.

762
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,700
This is crucial

763
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,980
and also a form

764
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,740
of protection for you.

765
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,440
Understood, Secretary.

766
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,420
I'll bring the financial details right away.

767
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,400
Liqiang,

768
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,640
the school wants us to inventory

769
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,760
the sponsored items.

770
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,720
I'll go home and check,

771
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,320
and you guys check the stuff

772
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,580
in the activity room.

773
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,180
Where did it go?

774
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,200
Twenty-six.

775
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,060
There are five of these.

776
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,400
Okay, five.

777
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,580
Oh, my.

778
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,140
What's going on here?

779
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,380
Don't ask.

780
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,640
Someone was jealous

781
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,980
of our sponsorship

782
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,020
and reported us to the school.

783
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,500
Now we have to inventory.

784
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,190
Why are only you guys here?

785
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,100
Where are the others?

786
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,980
- Duoduo went home.
- 18 red flags.

787
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,520
Lu Xiaole

788
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,720
went to find

789
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,100
business partners.

790
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,200
I haven't seen Chen Weilan all day.

791
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,780
Yan Xiaojing went to find Mo Xixi.

792
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,480
- So it's just
- Pack this up.

793
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,420
the three of us left.

794
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,640
Alright, stop dawdling.

795
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,380
Hurry up and help out. Hurry.

796
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,320
- Ten.
- Okay.

797
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,240
Can you check that for me?

798
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,750
- Sure.
- Alright, thanks.

799
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,500
This one has ten.

800
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,720
Hello, Duoduo, what's wrong?

801
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,520
Liqiang, the ledger is missing.

802
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,360
What?

803
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,400
Duoduo, are you sure

804
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,840
you've checked everywhere?

805
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,160
I've checked everywhere.

806
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,320
I even asked my parents.

807
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,280
They said they

808
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,480
didn't touch it at all.

809
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,720
But only our team

810
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,160
and your parents knew

811
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,360
about this ledger.

812
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,200
Yes.

813
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,640
Who would take the book?

814
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,760
What's the use of it?

815
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,860
I'm back.

816
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,120
What's going on? What happened?

817
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,220
The ledger is missing.

818
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,720
What?

819
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,740
Where's Coach Lu?

820
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,940
He left with business partners.

821
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,700
Business partners?

822
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,250
He said they were partners,

823
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,560
but it didn't

824
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,240
seem like it.

825
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,780
Those people were pretty intimidating.

826
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,980
Who's in charge of the funds?

827
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,120
Coach Lu.

828
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,720
He said we need money for meals,

829
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,300
transportation, and other expenses.

830
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,180
You suspect Coach Lu?

831
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,840
No way.

832
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,920
Coach Lu doesn't seem like the type to do this.

833
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,600
We trusted him so much.

834
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
Yes. Besides,

835
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,320
he only took a ledger.

836
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,420
What could he do with it?

837
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,840
Come in.

838
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,500
Weilan, have you seen Xixi?

839
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,000
No.

840
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,120
Ledger?

841
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,320
What ledger?

842
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,180
The sponsorship ledger?

843
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,160
Are you suspecting

844
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,420
that I took it?

845
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,320
You suspect me?

846
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,600
I understand.

847
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,740
Though I'm a loser

848
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,960
and my life is a mess, I have principles.

849
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,480
I would never steal.

850
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,460
Do you think I would?

851
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,940
I wouldn't.

852
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,240
Besides,

853
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,300
if I took the money...

854
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,960
If I took the money,

855
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,980
would I be so miserable?

856
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,900
Would I be heartbroken?

857
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,860
Coach, calm down.

858
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,300
We believe you.

859
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,380
Just a few days.

860
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,700
Just a few days.

861
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,100
Can't you wait?

862
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,080
Can't you give me a chance?

863
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,180
Just a few days.

864
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,900
You doubted me.

865
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,360
Where did Coach Lu go?

866
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,200
He got upset.

867
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,780
How could the ledger disappear?

868
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,460
Did a thief break into our shop?

869
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,800
But if a thief broke in,

870
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,840
why just take the ledger?

871
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,900
What's the use of that?

872
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,340
Yeah.

873
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,540
I have a plan.

874
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,380
(Kitchen)

875
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,810
What's this?

876
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,980
- Mo Xixi.
- Mo Xixi.

877
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,150
Wasn't she drunk yesterday?

878
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,080
How could she...

879
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,920
This...

880
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,770
Why did she do this?

881
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,190
It's quite obvious.

882
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,900
She's trying to destroy evidence.

883
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
That can't be.

884
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,110
Xixi isn't like that.

885
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,520
Duoduo,

886
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,330
I know you don't want to doubt your teammate,

887
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,920
but the evidence is clear.

888
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,730
The school is investigating our accounts.

889
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,100
You're the captain.

890
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,400
If you don't have it,

891
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,620
do you know what it means?

892
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,470
Xiaojing.

893
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,900
Something's wrong.

894
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,740
What happened? Take your time.

895
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,000
I can't find Mo Xixi.

896
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,860
What?

897
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,540
We're here. This is the place.

898
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,960
I heard from Xiaojing

899
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,680
that Xixi used to come here

900
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,700
with Du Weilong.

901
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,000
Let's split up

902
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,280
once we go inside.

903
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,780
- Alright, let's go.
- Let's go.

904
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,020
Welcome. Please come in.

905
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,400
Let's check over there.

906
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,240
Let's go.

907
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,740
Xixi.

908
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,440
Why are you here?

909
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,860
Yao Xiaojing told us about you

910
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,760
and Du Weilong.

911
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,120
He's threatening you, isn't he?

912
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,460
Don't be afraid. We're here now.

913
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,380
Let's go. What are you scared of?

914
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,100
It sounds scary.

915
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,280
Is this your first time?

916
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,880
What do you want to drink? It's on me.

917
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,200
Did you drink too much?

918
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,400
Let's go home.

919
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,480
Don't touch me.

920
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,620
I'll go home by myself.

921
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,760
What's wrong?

922
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,020
Black is waiting for us.

923
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,600
Let's go.

924
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,300
Didn't we have a BBQ with her yesterday?

925
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,660
Come on, join us.

926
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,400
She's not here for fun.

927
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,500
She's about to leave.

928
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,240
Don't make Black wait. Let's go.

929
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,560
I'll give you a discount. Find me.

930
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,780
Wait, wait.

931
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,120
I came here to have fun.

932
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,660
What else would I do here if not drink?

933
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,560
Let's go. Come on.

934
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,400
Let's go.

935
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,680
Black,

936
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,760
this is Xixi's teammate,

937
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,820
Chen Weilan.

938
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,520
She came to our bar.

939
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,840
I brought her over

940
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,900
to have a drink with you.

941
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,160
Alright, come. Xixi.

942
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,000
Come over and sit.

943
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,340
Come here.

944
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,680
Long time no see.

945
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,660
You've lost weight.

946
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,780
Really?

947
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,920
You've lost a lot

948
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,800
since I last saw you.

949
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,640
Really?

950
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,060
You're flattering me.

951
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,280
It's true.

952
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,200
You're so thin now.

953
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,080
- This figure is so attractive.
- Really.

954
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,390
- Black, let me toast you.
- Cheers, cheers.

955
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,540
Why is your friend so quiet?

956
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,760
That's

957
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,640
just her nature.

958
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,480
She's not talkative.

959
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,720
Chen...

960
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,300
Chen Weilan, Chen Weilan.

961
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,200
Weilan. Come on.

962
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,280
Let's all have fun.

963
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,940
- Have a drink.
- Alright.

964
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,120
Alright.

965
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,240
- Drink less.
- Come on.

966
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,080
Come on.

967
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,940
Black, don't get drunk.

968
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,040
Cheers!

969
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,520
Great.

970
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,860
Weilan's a good drinker.

971
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,520
Weilan can hold the liquor.

972
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,700
Today, you must drink more

973
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,720
- with Black.
- Okay.

974
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,460
Black, I'll drink with you.

975
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,980
Black, let me.

976
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,300
This drink is for getting to know you.

977
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,460
For the next round, let's change the game.

978
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,700
Change the game?

979
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,860
OK. Sounds interesting.

980
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,620
Sure.

981
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,540
- Come on.
- Stop drinking.

982
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,680
Come on, come on.

983
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,240
Anyone else? Wanna play?

984
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,440
- Come on. I'll go.
- Come on.

985
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,720
- Go on.
- Come on.

986
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,660
I'll go.

987
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,180
Come on.

988
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
I lost.

989
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,460
I'll drink.

990
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,640
- Drink.
- Great.

991
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,060
Black, good for you.

992
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,240
Again.

993
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,180
Come on.

994
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,680
Roll.

995
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,840
- Let's see.
- Come on.

996
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,280
Xixi lost.

997
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,120
Drink!

998
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,460
- Lost.
- My fault.

999
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,920
Can you handle it?

1000
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,860
Bottom up.

1001
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,400
- I'll go.
- Come on.

1002
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,520
- I'll play.
- Go on.

1003
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,640
- What game?
- One dice.

1004
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,180
Let's compare the number. Come on.

1005
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,200
Roll.

1006
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,860
- Same, same. Roll again.
- Drink, drink.

1007
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,860
You lost. Make her drink.

1008
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,840
Don't come over.

1009
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,940
I'll drink. I'll drink.

1010
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,380
I'll drink.

1011
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,660
Great drinker.

1012
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,920
I'm fine.

1013
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,140
- Fill it up.
- Black.

1014
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,240
The investment I mentioned earlier

1015
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,660
is a sure thing.

1016
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,680
If you don't invest, you'll miss out.

1017
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,900
Have a look.

1018
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,980
Weilong.

1019
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,360
Not today.

1020
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,640
Let's discuss this later.

1021
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Let's focus on drinking

1022
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,800
and having fun.

1023
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,040
Black, listen to me.

1024
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,880
Come on.

1025
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,860
- Drink.
- Black.

1026
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,180
Black.

1027
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,700
What's the matter?

1028
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,900
She's going to puke.
I'll take care of her.

1029
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,580
Hurry back. I'm waiting for you.

1030
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,640
- Be back soon.
- Come on.

1031
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,800
Come over. Come, drink.

1032
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,820
Come here.

1033
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,740
Let's drink.

1034
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,000
Slowly, slowly.

1035
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,880
Oh, my god.

1036
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,520
Xixi, how is she?

1037
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,600
Look at her.

1038
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,520
I'm fine. I'm okay.

1039
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,420
Let me tell you.

1040
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,160
She and Du Weilong have debts.

1041
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,920
He's dragging her into drinking

1042
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,220
with investors.

1043
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,800
Weilan, Duoduo.

1044
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,180
Don't worry about me.

1045
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,080
You should leave first.

1046
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
Mo Xixi,

1047
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,120
do you think we can

1048
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,100
leave you here alone?

1049
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,040
It's just a few drinks.

1050
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,200
It's not a big deal.

1051
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,520
Don't worry about me.

1052
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,580
Mo Xixi,

1053
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,200
do you know who those people outside are?

1054
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,600
Are you crazy?

1055
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,800
Do you think

1056
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,100
a few drinks can solve this?

1057
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,460
You still want to drink?

1058
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,200
Fine, we'll leave.

1059
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,440
Go drink outside.

1060
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,620
We'll leave you here.

1061
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,340
It's not like that.

1062
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,420
I didn't write those IOUs.

1063
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,260
I didn't.

1064
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,340
So many.

1065
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,000
So many IOUs.

1066
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,800
- Get up.
- I didn't.

1067
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,250
- I didn't write them.
- Get up.

1068
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,460
- I never wrote them.
- There's a seat. Let's go.

1069
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,360
From what we understand,

1070
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,400
this campus loan

1071
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,240
involves serious fraud.

1072
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,080
This group is skilled

1073
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,740
at forging identities

1074
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,340
and deceiving women.

1075
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,000
When they succeed,

1076
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,360
they'll use victims' info to lend

1077
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,420
high-interest loans.

1078
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,000
They then transfer the debts

1079
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,400
to these women

1080
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,410
and use threats to force them

1081
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,610
into borrowing more.

1082
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:16,820
Officer,

1083
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,260
do you know their identities?

1084
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,720
We only recently

1085
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,640
caught two thugs near the school,

1086
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,860
which led us to some clues.

1087
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,080
According to our current information,

1088
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,340
their leader is someone named Du Weilong.

1089
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,140
- Du Weilong?
- Du Weilong?

1090
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,420
Do you recognize this person?

1091
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,840
I didn't.

1092
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,300
It's not me.

1093
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,040
I didn't.

1094
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,660
I didn't write those IOUs.

1095
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,860
Was it Du Weilong using your identity?

1096
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,560
I wanted to report it,

1097
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,720
but he threatened me.

1098
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,840
He said he'd kill me

1099
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,420
if I went to the police.

1100
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,740
What should I do?

1101
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,760
I'm scared.

1102
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,800
I'm so scared.

1103
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,940
It's all because of Du Weilong.

1104
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,400
He's got something on me.

1105
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,960
I don't want my life to end like this.

1106
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,900
What does he have?

1107
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,300
Take this.

1108
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,820
All good now.

1109
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,380
Let's go.

1110
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,600
Let's go.

1111
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,100
