1
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,066
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:29,200
You begged me to bring you here yesterday, didn't you?

3
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:32,633
Bullshit! How's that possible?

4
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,466
You smell good

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,766
Take off your glasses

6
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,433
You remembered, right?

7
00:00:57,433 --> 00:00:59,233
Nothing happened last night

8
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,366
Don't tell anyone about this

9
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:05,533
Maybe something happened between us last night

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,633
You don't get to question me

11
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:17,566
Hey, mom

12
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:20,300
Got it. I'll be right back

13
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,266
Hello, sister-in-law

14
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,366
Hey. Yi

15
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:44,866
You have been abroad for so many years

16
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,833
why can't you visit your home when you come back?

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,466
Come home for dinner tonight

18
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,166
and meet your nephew

19
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,166
Ok. I got it

20
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:52,566
Alright

21
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,333
Such a big meal today, mom

22
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:09,400
Yeah, your little uncle hasn't been here for a long time

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm surely gonna make it a big one

24
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,933
Come on, go wash up

25
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,166
Alright.

26
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:47,900
sister-in-law

27
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,166
Sorry I'm late

28
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,433
Why are you bringing so many gifts? Come in.

29
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:00,400
Ran. Your little uncle is here, come down quickly

30
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,200
who?

31
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Hey, Lin Xia

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,966
Hey bro

33
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:17,200
What happened yesterday?

34
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,566
Why did you leave without a word?

35
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,500
It's alright

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,033
I've got the guy from yesterday for you

37
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:23,866
He's just back in the country. He's rich

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,433
You've got a good taste

39
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:27,233
You've been looking at him since he first showed up

40
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:29,333
Are you still going tonight?I will wait for you

41
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,933
My little uncle is coming today

42
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:32,433
I'll be there after dinner

43
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:33,466
I got it

44
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,200
You go ahead. I'll be right there

45
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:36,733
Okay

46
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:39,533
Sister-in-law...

47
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,766
It's okay, Yi

48
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,233
Go ahead if you're busy

49
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,733
This meal can be eaten at any time

50
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:46,166
There's plenty of time for families

51
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,133
It's okay, go ahead

52
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,966
Thank you, sister-in-law. I will come for dinner next time

53
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
Mom

54
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,266
Mom, where's the little uncle?

55
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:58,000
He left beforehand

56
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,600
Come on.Let's go to dinner first

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,400
Okay

58
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:11,533
Have some more

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,333
What did you do last night?

60
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,000
I came back and you weren't home

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,466
I went for Lin Xia last night

62
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,200
Well

63
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,433
Your little uncle is back in China now

64
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:23,800
learn more from him

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,233
Okay

66
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,333
He's doing big business abroad

67
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,000
The future business of the Lu family depends on you

68
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:29,166
Got it

69
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:32,933
Eat some more

70
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:42,000
Mr. Zhang will inherit the Zhang family after graduation, right?

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,200
Don't forget us

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,333
Don't worry, I will never forget you

73
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,933
Definitely. Mr. Zhang's business

74
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,166
must be spread across all walks of life

75
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,666
Who can compete with Mr. Zhang?

76
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,933
That's right. Besides Mr. Zhang, it's Mr. Lu

77
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,033
Mr. Lu?

78
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,066
Who are you gonna kick?

79
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,366
Kick whoever gets in the way

80
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:11,866
A good dog can't get in the way

81
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm too good-natured, aren't I?

82
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,633
What do you wanna do?

83
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,966
Alright. Mr. Lu.Just have a seat

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,400
I'll go

85
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,866
Well, we'll be off then, Mr. Lu

86
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:10,433
Mr. Lu

87
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:12,600
It was my fault just now

88
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:14,933
I'm here to apologize

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,800
Come

90
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:20,800
After all, we still have business dealings

91
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,333
I'd like to see a clear distinction between public and private life,

92
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,700
don't you think?

93
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,933
As long as you don't give me any more trouble

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,166
we will have a clear distinction between public and private life

95
00:06:29,966 --> 00:06:32,066
You are right. I'll drink to that

96
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,033
This glass of wine looks so good

97
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,466
There may be a lot of ingredients in it
