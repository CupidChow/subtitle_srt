1
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:42,166
[Here's your uncle's number, Ran.]
[Call him sometime to say hello. Be polite.]

2
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:45,700
[I'll send you a photo.]

3
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,666
Why does this house look so...

4
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,400
Come over for breakfast.

5
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,933
Is your head still hurting?

6
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
It has nothing to do with you.

7
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,900
The decoration of your house looks...

8
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,200
Same as before.

9
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,700
It's the same decor as the house we lived in before.

10
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,733
Why?

11
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:40,333
We've already broken up.

12
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:41,266
What's the point of decorating the house like this?

13
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:44,566
Breaking up means that both parties know what's going on, right?

14
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:45,900
I had no idea.

15
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:46,800
So it doesn't really count.

16
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,500
What do you mean?

17
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:49,666
So you can break up

18
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:50,700
and make up with me as long as you want.

19
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,766
What do you take me for?

20
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:54,133
A pet that comes when you want it to?

21
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,500
I didn't want to break up with you.

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,966
Something happened to me after you left.

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,766
I was unconscious in the hospital for a few days.

24
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:02,800
And I had an operation.

25
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:05,000
I lost my cell phone when I woke up.

26
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:08,500
When I texted you,you had already blocked me.

27
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:10,900
Look.

28
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:11,933
The scar is still here.

29
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,466
Who knows when that started...

30
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,966
Surely you know if I had a scar or not.

31
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,600
Nobody would notice that.

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,433
You stubborn boy!

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,466
How about my explanation?

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,866
Can you forgive me now?

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,300
It's okay.

36
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,100
I still have time.

37
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:38,933
I can wait for you.

38
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,800
Shall we go to the beach tomorrow?

39
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:44,300
At least give our relationship a chance.

40
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:00,566
Why did I say yes?

41
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,700
let's have fun!

42
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:21,366
What?

43
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,533
Spray sunscreen.

44
00:03:23,566 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh my God, that's so sweet.

45
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:28,366
And this.

46
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,466
You've got mosquito-repellent bracelets.

47
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:32,800
Is there one for me?

48
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:34,200
I just bought two.

49
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,366
It's okay. I brought my own.

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,733
You don't have one either.

51
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,566
Here's for you.

52
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:46,766
Come on.

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,200
Hey

54
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:57,666
You two have made up?

55
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,066
Not really.

56
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:00,466
Then what you guys...

57
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,400
I just got myself

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,500
a chance to start over.

59
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:07,500
Qi Yi

60
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,933
Don't you dare to come down

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,333
Come on, brother Cheng Xi. It's fun.

62
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:12,166
Come on.

63
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:12,733
Come on.

64
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:14,733
Come down.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,133
Learn to swim. Come on.

66
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,133
Drink something cold.

67
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,566
Let's shoot a vlog.

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,300
Okay.

69
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,900
Hi.

70
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,333
Hello.

71
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:04,166
Oh, you handsome boy.

72
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:08,133
So beautiful here.

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,633
Look, there are seagulls.

74
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:14,600
Where are they?

75
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:15,866
Over there.

76
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,900
There really is.

77
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,466
Let's go to feed the seagulls.

78
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,100
Good idea.

79
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,800
Let's go.

80
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,466
Seagulls.

81
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:44,466
Seagulls.

82
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,066
Are there any seagulls?

83
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,300
Seagulls, come here.
