1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,400
Traveling alone in the south in July

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,066
Open the window and watch the white birds fly over the ocean

3
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:23,166
The more beautiful the scenery, the more I want to lean on your shoulder

4
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:26,966
Two people walked together in the evening when the wind came

5
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:30,666
How long has it been waiting for you to say thank you, friend

6
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:37,300
Even though there's space between us, we've already kissed secretly

7
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,333
My love for you is three centimeters deep

8
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,066
Not more, not less, it is on the tip of my heart

9
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:48,766
I am lucky to be with you, my dear, before we fell in love

10
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:51,766
Three centimeters of sunshine sprinkled on my face

11
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:55,100
Melting you into that distant place

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,700
Later I went Everywhere is sunny

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,366
My love for you is three centimeters deep

14
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:06,100
No more, no less, on the tip of my heart

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,900
I am lucky to be with you, my dear, before we fell in love

16
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,700
Three centimeters of sunshine on my face

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,133
Melting you into that distant place

18
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:24,733
Later, every place I went was sunny

19
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,900
This is for you

20
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,833
Thanks, Mr. Lu

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,733
Why are you still here?

22
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:26,133
Mr. Lu, I...

23
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,866
Do you think Mr. Lu will be interested in you?

24
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,066
Get out of here now

25
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,333
Well, you are really getting more attractive

26
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,133
What are you looking at?

27
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:57,366
Nothing

28
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,733
Just a scumbag

29
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,100
Don't drink spirits if you can't handle them

30
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:40,066
Come here. Lean on me

31
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,533
I'm a little tired

32
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm going to the toilet

33
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,600
I'll go with him

34
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,133
Are you sure you don't need a ride?

35
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:34,400
Yes, I'm afraid I won't be able to leave if you do

36
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:38,700
Remember to miss me

37
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Gotta go

38
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,200
Gotta go. Remember to miss me

39
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:13,600
Sorry! The subscriber you dialed is busy now

40
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,466
Sorry! The subscriber you dialed is busy now

41
00:05:21,866 --> 00:05:23,966
Sorry! The subscriber you dialed...

42
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:39,266
Hey bro. Let's go to the toilet

43
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:50,733
Well, are you trying to pretend you don't know me now

44
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,066
or is there someone else

45
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,666
so you can't know me?

46
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:55,866
You are drunk

47
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,133
Isn't it just right to be drunk?

48
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,800
Why don't we just go upstairs and stay the night?

49
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,000
Stay the night?

50
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,333
Looks like you had a good time back home

51
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,700
How many people have stayed at your place?

52
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:08,900
You are jealous, right?

53
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:12,166
You're as bold as ever

54
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:38,700
Wet your hair and ruin your makeup

55
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,733
Sorry, I'm too emotional sometimes

56
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:53,066
Thank you for listening to me talk about my scars

57
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:01,233
Slowly growing branches

58
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,200
Suddenly you blossomed in my heart

59
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,533
Every moment I want to hug you

60
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:17,700
You are the rose that I want to possess despite the pain
(Blooming alone, wanting to pass through the thorns)

61
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,266
I want to pass through the thorns, holding the thorns, and squeeze into your world
(In a deserted place)

62
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:28,133
I only dare to enjoy the warmth briefly, but I dare not hope to cross that line
(I dare not hope to cross that line)

63
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:36,600
Is it love or is it my illusion?

64
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,366
Like a butterfly flapping its wings, flying in the windy season
 (You appear)

65
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:46,833
You gently buried your head in my left shoulder
 (warming the whole season)

66
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:55,800
I want to hide you in the page that the wind opens

67
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:09,366
I want to hide you in the page that the wind opens
