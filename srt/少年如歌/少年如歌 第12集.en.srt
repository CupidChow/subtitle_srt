What do you want?

344
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,010
You want me to make an omelet for you?

345
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,670
I don't want an omelet

346
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,640
But when you asked me to be their music teacher at that time

347
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,790
you said that

348
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,950
you will grant one of my wishes

349
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,830
as long as I promise you

350
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,230
I have never forgot it

351

I want you to stay true to your original aspiration and follow your dreams

No, it's not what I mean

Yes, I am a leader now

Yan Ke

388
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,480
Yan Ke decided to

389
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,180
help his father to fulfill

390
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,630
his dream of attending boxing game at last

391
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,830
His father must be very happy

392
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,430
His father is happy

393
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,550
but Yan Ke will suffer

394
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,070
Don't worry about him

395
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,580
We will go and support

396

him when he competes

397
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,590
Of course, you should work hard on your training as well

I used to think that it was the title of the music club

402
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,600
that I wanted to protect

403
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,230
I always cared about the music club being number one

404
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,790
Now I know that

405
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,550
what I really want to protect is

406
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,190
the youth when I was with you

407
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,830
and the time when we pursued our dreams
