00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,250
Youth Melody

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,890
Episode 1

4
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,030
Now let's welcome the Yi 'an Music Club

5
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,710
All right, class

6
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,510
I'm going down

7
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,030
The ball is in your court

8
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,910
OK, teacher, you can rest assured

9
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,030
We'll do our best

10
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,750
Come on

11
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,310
Director Chen

12
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,950
Yi'an music club is doing really well!

13
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,470
It's all thanks to our instructor, Mr. Chu

14
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,870
No, no

15
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,110
It's all thanks to the kids

16
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,030
I'm just a helper

17
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,710
It's good

18
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,870
Well, sure enough

19
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,950
the Yi'an Music Club feels something missing

20
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,590
without He Luoluo

21
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,470
Yes

22
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,710
It just doesn't feel perfect

23
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,150
No, Lin Mo and others are very nice as well

24
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,950
No

25
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,710
Compared with He Luoluo, they are...

26
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,070
Hush, be quiet!

27
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,030
Watch the show. What are you arguing about?

28
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,750
Hello everyone, we are Yi 'an Music club

29
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,550
I am Lin Mo, the president of the music club

30
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,829
I'm Sun Yihang from Yi 'an Music Club

31
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,950
I'm Zhan Yiwen

32
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,350
Hello everyone, I'm Chi Yi from Yi 'an Music Club

33
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,910
Hello, my name is Fang Xiangrui

34
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,030
I have something to say

35
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,890
I'm quitting the Yi 'an Music Club

36
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,390
Fang Xiangrui

37
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,800
- What's the matter? 
- I can't believe this is happening

38
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,670
when He Luoluo is not here

39
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,910
What's wrong with the Yi 'an Music Club?

40
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,709
Fang Xiangrui, don't go. The Yi 'an Music Club needs you

41
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,390
Fang Xiangrui, don't go

42
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,190
Fang Xiangrui, don't go

43
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,590
Mr. Chu

44
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,870
What's going on?

45
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,670
These kids

46
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,270
piss me off

47
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:39,790
Fang Xiangrui

48
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,070
Thank the students of Yi 'an Music Club from Yi 'an Middle School for their wonderful performance

49
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,740
-Come on. 
 -AKB48 Team SH

50
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,070
from Sixian Middle School

51
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,790
will play next

52
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,550
Let's give them applause to welcome them to the stage

53
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,350
You still have the mood to look at others?

54
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,100
Ah?

55
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,190
Follow me

56
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,630
He Luoyi

57
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,430
What do you want?

58
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,870
The performance is a warm-up

59
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,510
for the national Youth Art Group competition in a few months

60
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,310
This is not an ordinary show

61
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,120
And you, Fang Xiangrui

62
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,350
You want the whole city

63
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,550
to witness your withdrawal?

64
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,030
I said I wanted to withdraw last month

65
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,550
I didn't approve it because we were preparing for the show

66
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,990
But what were you doing today?

67
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,830
The music club was performing to the whole city today

68
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,790
Who were you trying to embarrass?

69
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,310
You forced me into this race

70
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,830
You're nothing in the club

71
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,590
without Luoluo

72
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,150
Fang Xiangrui

73
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,710
You have gone too far in this matter

74
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,030
Everybody, just calm down for a second

75
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,710
We're all in the same club

76
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,990
Does it have to be like this?

77
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,950
The music club went from the top of the school to what it is today

78
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,550
I think you all know why

79
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,110
You are not qualified to be the president

80
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,950
You think I'm the only one who wants to withdraw?

81
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,510
Zhan Yiwen

82
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,390
What are you afraid of?

83
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,750
Yes, Lin Mo

84
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,790
I will leave as well

85
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,390
I'll be a sophomore in high school soon

86
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,350
I should focus on my study

87
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,950
I don't agree

88
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,800
You really want me to tell you the truth?

89
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,270
I think this shitty place...

90
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,310
What do you mean, Zhan Yiwen?

91
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:57,950
Ah, ah, ah

92
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,750
Lin Mo

93
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,990
Let him go!

94
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,390
You, you, you

95
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,150
Don't you dare be a jerk in front of me now, do you?

96
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,110
I, I, I

97
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,550
I gave you a face, didn't I?

98
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,040
I, I, I

99
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,470
I spoiled you, didn't I?

100
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,270
Ah?

101
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,550
Now you're famous all over the city

102
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,910
You've

103
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,230
ruined

104
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,710
the school's reputation

105
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,110
and our faces

106
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,750
I dare to accept the consequences

107
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,310
I will take all the responsibility by myself

108
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,310
You take responsibility?

109
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,990
How do you take responsibility?

110
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,510
How do you take responsibility?

111
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,550
Just because you can win a gold medal doesn't mean

112
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,470
you can break the rules

113
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,909
You can do whatever you want?

114
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:45,870
You are impulsive!

115
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,270
You are hot-tempered!

116
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,790
You are undisciplined!

117
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,150
You are short-sighted!

118
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,350
You acted without considering consequences!

119
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,430
You acted without considering consequences!

120
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,520
Sorry, coach

121
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:56,830
I know I was a little impulsive

122
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,390
But I got good results every time I played

123
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,390
And I won a lot of gold medals for my team

124
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,710
I have won honors for my team too

125
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,470
You guys still thinking about the race?

126
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,870
I think your music club

127
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,390
should be disbanded

128
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,550
You go to Yi 'an Middle School for some training

129
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,430
You will be an intern P.E. teacher there

130
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,870
Try refocus

131
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,590
Coach

132
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,710
You're not sending me away, are you?

133
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,870
I am an excellent javelin thrower in our team

134
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,310
You know the game is important now?

135
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,230
What did you do?

136
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,710
What have you been doing just now?

137
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,190
You are not allowed to come back

138
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,360
until you get a good teacher award

139
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,010
OK

140
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,150
Take care of yourself. Bye

141
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,470
Hey, come back

142
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,909
I have not finished talking

143
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,990
See that javelin?

144
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,950
Look at your idol!

145
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,870
Make sure you practice after you go to the new school

146
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:53,390
Yes

147
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,200
Thank you, coach

148
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,630
Hey, it's public property

149
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,830
I have given Lin Mo the withdrawal application a month ago

150
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,320
I want to quit

151
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,830
Hey

152
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,110
Fang Xiangrui

153
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,350
Lin Mo

154
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,110
I'm sorry

155
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,390
I'm quitting too

156
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,870
Come back

157
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,670
You are right

158
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,480
I am incompetent

159
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,870
But what about you?

160
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,430
Do you dare to say that you are on the club's side?

161
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,230
Back in the day

162
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,070
you said you loved the music club more than anyone

163
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,910
You were shouting slogan louder than anyone

164
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,910
Now, Luoluo has gone

165
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,790
You think the club's dead

166
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,350
You didn't perform actively in group rehearsals

167
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,390
All you want is making yourself be seen

168
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:44,910
Lin Mo

169
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,910
You really know how to make excuses

170
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,390
Our club is in decline

171
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,270
Don't you have any responsibility as the president?

172
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,910
Zhan Yiwen, will you shut up?

173
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,190
You're dictatorial

174
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,430
You don't listen to others

175
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,110
Is the music club your personal belonging?

176
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,710
Then what are we?

177
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,550
Lin Mo

178
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,750
In my opinion

179
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,110
you ruined the music club

180
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,080
Zhan Yiwen, that's enough

181
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:12,950
Zhan Yiwen

182
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,230
Who the hell ruined the music club?

183
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,350
Who loafed every time we dance?

184
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,550
Who was that singing out of tune several times on stage?

185
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,270
You really think you can play dumb just because people don't know?

186
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,070
The music club is what it is now

187
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,030
because someone didn't take every show seriously

188
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,030
Lin Mo

189
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,470
the director is still here

190
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,230
Some people just want to show off

191
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,400
Some people don't even look at themselves in the mirror and see how much they're worth

192
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,350
I'm responsible for my own faults

193
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,630
But I'm not responsible for what you have done

194
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,910
If you want to go, go as fast as you can

195
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,350
Don't procrastinate

196
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,390
And don't take me with you

197
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,230
Alas

198
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,910
You've worked hard, Luoluo

199
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,070
You've made great progress recently

200
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,590
Thank you for all the hard work

201
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,110
But for your help

202
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,790
I might not have progressed so fast

203
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,390
Luoluo has always been humble as this

204
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,720
Zhan yiwen

205
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,710
and Fang Xiangrui

206
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,090
- have quit the club 
- Luoluo

207
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,430
Luoluo

208
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,630
Thanks for your hard work

209
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,350
Goodbye

210
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,790
Bye

211
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,960
[Yi 'an Middle School, Haicheng City]

212
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,790
Morning

213
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,110
Morning, girl

214
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,710
He's a pretty good guy

215
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,950
Do you know that

216
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,910
the music club embarrassed themselves yesterday?

217
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,910
I heard that Mr. Chu was so angry that he was sent to the hospital

218
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,790
So seriously?

219
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,190
Mr. Chu was like this

220
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,750
Director Chen

221
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,870
must be mad

222
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,390
He must be mad

223
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,990
Don't talk about Lin Mo like that

224
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,230
Who are you?

225
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,230
We are talking about the music club. It's none of your business!

226
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,510
He's the president of global fan support club

227
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,150
for Lin Mo, the president of the music club

228
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,390
Laugh my ass off. Lin Mo turns out to own a support club

229
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,790
Who do you look down upon?

230
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,070
Let's go

231
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,430
It's really funny

232
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,590
What the hell are these two doing?

233
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,750
There is only one month left before the mid-term exam

234
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,310
Hurry up, guys

235
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,790
Don't groan

236
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,420
If you have studied hard, why are you afraid of the mid-term exam?

237
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,750
For those of you who are not very good at learning and don't work very hard

238
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,710
there is still one month left for you to make an extraordinary effort

239
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,550
Let's move on

240
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,670
Go on to Question 11 in your exercising books

241
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,590
Where on earth is Director Chen's office?

242
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,590
Pheromone

243
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,720
Tachycardia

244
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,950
Dopamine surge

245
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,070
Alas!

246
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,270
It's a good thing that it didn't break

247
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,590
Teacher

248
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,030
what did you say to me?

249
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,270
Nothing

250
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,110
Teacher

251
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,030
here you are

252
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,070
Thank you

253
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,470
Could you tell me how to get to the director's office?

254
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,790
I know it

255
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,310
I take you there?

256
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,470
Show me the way, please

257
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:22,630
On this side

258
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,550
No, no, no

259
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,110
On this side

260
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,630
I will take you there

261
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,990
Sure

262
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,710
Comrades

263
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,230
I have good news

264
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,510
Fu Yunzhe from Mr. Wang's class won the first prize

265
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:46,510
in the science and technology competition among high schools in the city

266
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,910
This is Fu Yunzhe's trophy

267
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,830
and certificate

268
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,030
Ah!

269
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,950
This is Director Chen

270
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,550
This Director Chen turned out to be the one

271
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,990
who lectured in the dressing room last night

272
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,470
Hello, Director Chen

273
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,150
I'm an intern from the city team

274
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,150
I am He Luoyi

275
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,310
This's my resume

276
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,470
Please take care

277
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,350
Ah, you must be Miss. He

278
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,750
Yes

279
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,510
I've already read your resume

280
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:42,990
Li

281
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,710
Take Miss He around the school

282
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,670
and let her know the school

283
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,950
You will take over

284
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,150
the P.E. class of grade two in the afternoon

285
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,470
Ah?

286
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,710
So soon?

287
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,470
Thank you, Mr. Li

288
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,670
Thank you, thank you

289
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,230
Ah?

290
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,230
You are welcome

291
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,790
I want to buy one too

292
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,710
Unexpectedly, Lin Mo still comes to class so calmly

293
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,190
If I were him

294
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,910
I'd find a hole in the ground to hide myself

295
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,470
The music club is not what it used to be

296
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,150
without He Luoluo

297
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,230
In my opinion

298
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,270
you have to know yourself

299
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,150
and think whether you are worth before everything

300
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,790
Have you finished yet?

301
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,070
Why do you keep targeting Lin Mo?

302
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,390
You got a problem?

303
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,230
He didn't even say anything

304
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,270
You don't have to care that much

305
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,430
Besides

306
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,750
we're telling the truth

307
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,590
It's enough

308
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,750
Stop it

309
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,710
He is Fu Yunzhe

310
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,750
Good students have their own haloes

311
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,470
Who is he?

312
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,910
You don't know about Fu Yunzhe?

313
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,950
He is a new transfer student

314
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,270
As soon as he came, he became the president of the student union

315
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,710
He's like a legend

316
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,510
Miss He, let me introduce myself

317
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,990
I'm a biology teacher in Yi 'an High School

318
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,750
My name is Li Mingfan

319
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,369
You can call me Li or Mingfan

320
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:12,930
No

321
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,790
Call me Li

322
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,710
Nice to meet you, Mr. Li

323
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,150
I'm a new intern PE teacher

324
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,790
He Luoyi

325
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,310
Ah

326
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:28,830
I'm sorry

327
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,110
The javelin is everything to me

328
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,350
The javelin is always with me

329
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,190
This is a pretty big school

330
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,430
Yes

331
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,240
the school is very large

332
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,750
And

333
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,790
Miss He

334
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,550
This place

335
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,590
This is where our PE teachers have lessons

336
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,270
Look

337
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,870
On this side

338
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,510
these two are basketball courts

339
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,550
The volleyball court and the tennis court

340
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,790
are behind this

341
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,070
The playground is on this side

342
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,310
The gym is behind it

343
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,630
The facilities in this school are amazing

344
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,190
There are many sports in our school

345
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,590
I can tell you about them

346
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,670
Oh, yes, Mr. Li

347
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,190
There's something I'd like to ask you

348
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,550
I didn't have much teaching experience

349
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,910
so I was wondering

350
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,390
how to teach a class

351
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,110
How to teach a class?

352
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,030
A P.E. class?

353
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,390
A P.E. class

354
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,230
Miss He

355
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,350
I think you can start by teaching what you're good at

356
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,710
The students in our school are easy to get along with

357
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,310
You just need to make them trust you

358
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,950
and then it will be easy to be friends with them in class

359
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,030
I see

360
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,870
Mr. Li, I'm gonna get ready for my class

361
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,310
Goodbye, Mr. Li

362
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,910
Goodbye. Goodbye

363
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,430
Class

364
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,390
I'm your new PE teacher

365
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,270
I am He Luoyi

366
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,790
I'm here

367
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,830
not only to help you build your bodies

368
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,510
but also to give you hearts of athletes

369
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,510
Are you ready for the challenge?

370
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,990
The teacher is a bit silly

371
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,390
What are you talking about?

372
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,320
Speak up

373
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,750
I said you were a girl that throws javelin

374
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,360
Sister J

375
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:15,270
It is an honorific name

376
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,550
Sister J is an honorific name?

377
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,390
I warn you

378
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,310
Don't call me names

379
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,190
In this class

380
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,590
I will teach you how to throw the javelin

381
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,910
First, I will briefly introduce the javelin

382
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,650
- You have seen this javelin in my hand.\ N- Why hasn't Lin Mo come yet?

383
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,380
- I'll show you how to hold it first. 
- I don't know

384
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,950
First, we need to clench it with five fingers

385
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,950
Your index finger will clasp the edge here

386
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,910
You've got to hold it tightly

387
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,390
Then, it is the cross step

388
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,390
I'll teach you the cross step in a moment

389
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,150
The third step is that you use all your energy to...

390
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:44,790
Report!

391
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,590
You are...

392
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,310
I'm Lin Mo from Class three, Grade Two

393
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,910
Why are you late?

394
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,510
Teacher, he is the president of the music club

395
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,880
He must be busy running the music club

396
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,390
Why don't you say anything?

397
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,310
I want to hear your answer

398
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,270
Don't want to say?

399
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:11,950
OK

400
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,550
According to the rules of our team

401
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,390
those who are late without a reason and those who are not disciplined will be punished by running

402
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,790
Running?

403
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,160
Are you in the same class?

404
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,510
Yes

405
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,150
Very good

406
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,350
Since you are a group

407
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,150
you should not gloat

408
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,670
If one person is late, all will run

409
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,990
Do you know why?

410
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,150
Because if someone had reminded him and called him

411
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,470
he wouldn't have been late

412
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,430
All right, let's start

413
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,360
No need

414
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,950
I run myself

415
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:48,990
Go, go, go

416
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,350
Let's run. Go, go, go

417
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,190
What are you doing?

418
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,310
Are you expecting me to buy you dinner?

419
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,930
Lin Mo is not very happy today

420
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,940
Let's ask

421
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,310
Sure

422
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,230
Lin Mo

423
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,670
I am fine

424
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,270
Ah!

425
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,430
You guys haven't even finished running yet

426
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,310
and you are all lying over the place

427
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,270
Teacher, class is over

428
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,550
Look at your physical fitness

429
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,830
You can't even pass the threshold of our team

430
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,270
Class is over!

431
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,710
I'm sorry, Miss He

432
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,310
I'd like to apologize for Lin Mo

433
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,430
He didn't mean to be late and talk back to you today

434
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,070
Why did you come to apologize to me

435
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,150
for him being late?

436
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,510
Something happened to Lin Mo recently

437
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,510
He's kind of in a bad place right now

438
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,470
What?

439
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,630
Is it about the gym?

440
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,590
You know it?

441
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,400
Lin Mo is the president of the music club

442
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,990
When the music club went wrong

443
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,390
he was the first to be criticized

444
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,350
He's been under a lot of pressure lately

445
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,830
And he was often compared to the previous president, He Luoluo

446
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,110
Luoluo?

447
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,600
So I apologize for Lin Mo

448
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,990
I hope you'll stop blaming him

449
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,670
It doesn't matter

450
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,990
Teachers can't be so mean

451
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,310
You can go back now

452
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,430
Thank you, Miss He

453
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,710
Lin Mo, Lin Mo, don't be like this

454
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,790
Lin Mo, stop dancing. Stop dancing

455
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,590
Chi Yi

456
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,030
Tell me, Luoluo is not here anymore

457
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,750
so the music club is gone, isn't it?

458
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,590
Lin Mo, what are you saying?

459
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,670
Calm down

460
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,230
The music club is the music club

461
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,710
It never changes

462
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,280
I'm going for a walk

463
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,190
Mom

464
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,550
I told you to give me some time to think about it

465
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,310
Don't push me all the time, OK?

466
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,830
When you applied for schools, you said you needed time to think about it

467
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,110
You have received the admissions from American schools now

468
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,910
how long do you need to consider it?

469
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,230
The clock is ticking, son

470
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,870
I see

471
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,230
Well

472
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,390
I'll think it over before I give you an answer

473
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,990
I'm going to the class first

474
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,990
I will hang up the phone

475
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,590
Lin Mo

476
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:19,920
Why are you here?

477
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,920
Oh

478
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,070
I'm just walking around

479
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,350
A rhythm

480
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,630
occurred to me just now

481
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,270
I'll go to the club classroom after writing it

482
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,710
Sure

483
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,230
Lin Mo

484
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,790
Do you remember what the music club was like when it was founded?

485
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,190
We had nothing then

486
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,510
We are of different minds

487
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,790
No one dare to talk about the future

488
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,470
No one knew whether it had a future

489
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,990
But we're here now

490
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,150
Aren't you curious about its next step?

491
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,870
Aren't you curious about the landscape at its end?

492
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,470
So will you accompany the music club to the end?

493
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,310
I will

494
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,350
Headmaster

495
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,390
there are only three of them left now

496
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,950
I wonder if they can be disbanded

497
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,230
Director

498
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,630
Headmaster, I am listening

499
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,830
School rules require that clubs with fewer than five members be disbanded at the end of the semester

500
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,510
It's still early

501
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,950
But I don't think

502
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:02,230
they're in the state of competing in national games

503
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,870
I think

504
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:08,470
we should start a new club

505
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,230
That's a good idea

506
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,950
Then we'll start a Xinsheng Club

507
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,390
Let the two clubs fairly compete for

508
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,280
the qualification for this national competition

509
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:18,890
Sure

510
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,790
You can start to prepare for this

511
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,990
OK, headmaster

512
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:36,950
Miss He

513
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,470
Yes

514
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,710
You're

515
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,790
new to the job

516
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,030
You should read more about

517
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,510
the rules and regulations of the school

518
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,390
Yes

519
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,670
Well

520
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:50,830
You can just pull over here

521
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,350
OK

522
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,470
OK. Thank you

523
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,470
Take care!

524
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,230
Please get in the car, Miss

525
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,230
Again?

526
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,190
Sister

527
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,350
you know that

528
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,230
I used to be the president of the music club

529
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,190
But the club teacher fell ill recently

530
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,390
So

531
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,990
I want you to be their teacher

532
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:06,910
Is it OK?

533
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,600
You want me to be the club teacher for the music club?

534
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,750
No. More of less than about!

535
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,640
Don't try to entrap me

536
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,590
or I will play the show of quitting the club on the spot as well
