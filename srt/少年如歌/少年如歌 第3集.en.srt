Youth Melody

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,560
Episode 3

4
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,110
Well.

5
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,150
Let's take a look at the life sciences first.

6
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,990
Hey, Lin Mo.

7
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,000
I think the priority is to gather together enough people.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,039
Yeah.

9
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:37,410
Otherwise, let alone competing with the Xinsheng Club,

10
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,030
our club will be disbanded at the end of the term.

11
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,030
So...

12
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,509
Mr.Li is coming.

13
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,420
Yan Ke is good. What are you hesitating about?

14
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,420
[Chi Yi]

15
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,450
I have the same question.

16
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,450
[Sun Yihang]

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,390
The thing of top priority is to break in with Yu Muyang, isn't it?

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,390
[Lin Mo]

19
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,870
[Chi Yi]

20
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,270
Yu Muyang seems to have a hard time fitting in.

21
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,750
Sir.

22
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,949
Lin Mo,

23
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,910
What happens

24
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,830
in mitosis?

25
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,030
What?

26
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,710
Everyone,

27
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,710
What happens in mitosis?

28
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,230
You said you have a solution. That's it?

29
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,050
Lin Xuanhao had learned dance before.

30
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,110
Let's just get him here first.

31
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,270
All right, let's get back to rehearsing.

32
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,670
OK.

33
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,910
Let's take a break.

34
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,990
Take a break.

35
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,630
Look at Yu Muyang.

36
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,310
We need to cheer him up.

37
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,910
I have an idea.

38
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,030
Hey, Sun Yihang.

39
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,470
Nice shoes.

40
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,829
New shoes, right?

41
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,070
Stop that.

42
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,350
Do you remember the rule of stepping on three feet on new shoes?

43
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,790
Let's do it.

44
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,520
Everyone steps on the shoes.

45
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,750
Give his shoes a good start.

46
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,990
Ok.

47
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,470
I'll start then.

48
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,990
Stay away from me.

49
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,630
Go away.

50
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,070
Yu Muyang, you should come too.

51
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,750
Everyone here has the chance.

52
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,190
Come on!

53
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,870
Yeah, yeah, let's do it together.

54
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,870
Come on.

55
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,790
All right, all right.

56
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,150
Chi Yi.

57
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,870
Don't let me see you in your new shoes next time,

58
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,760
or I'll make it dirty.

59
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,110
All right, all right.

60
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,830
Shoes with a good start

61
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,670
ensures you won't slack off during the rehearsal.

62
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,550
Come on.

63
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,550
Let's get back to rehearsal.

64
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,510
Ms. He.

65
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,270
What are you doing here, Mr.Lee?

66
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,390
I just heard from a first-grade student after class

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,870
you were injured in class.

68
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,150
Ah, I'm fine.

69
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,750
We get injured on the training ground all the time.

70
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,030
Ah.

71
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,030
If only there was someone who could take care of you.

72
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,470
We have training partner. We look after each other.

73
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,270
Training partner?

74
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,150
Yes.

75
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,150
Ms. He.

76
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,310
What's this?

77
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,590
This is called the notoginseng flower.

78
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,150
It's a Chinese medicine.

79
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,250
It can clear away heat and toxic materials

80
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,270
and stop the bleeding quickly.

81
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,590
If you ever get hurt again,

82
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,870
you can put it on your wound and heal it.

83
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,990
That's great.

84
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,230
Thank you, Mr.Li.

85
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,750
Ms. He,

86
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,590
you have a good time teaching here.

87
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,710
Are you going back to the sports team?

88
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,990
Of course.

89
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,350
My idol is there.

90
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,350
Javelin thrower Lyu Huihui.

91
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,790
She won many gold medals for our country,

92
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,350
which is also my dream.

93
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,590
Mr.Li,

94
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,150
What is your dream?

95
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,670
My dream is ...

96
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,950
right in front of me.

97
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,310
I want to be a good teacher.

98
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,950
I also want to be a good teacher.

99
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,920
Plan 2.

100
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,230
To celebrate the first plenary rehearsal

101
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,310
after the recruitment of Yi'an Music Club,

102
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,430
Let's eat herbal jelly. It's near the school gate.

103
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,830
Great! I agree.

104
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,150
Good.

105
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,070
Eat something sweet.

106
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,270
Yu Muyang, come with us.

107
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,020
You guys go.

108
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,900
Plan 2.

109
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,190
Failed.

110
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,580
Plan 3.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,260
Chi Yi, what do you want to eat?

112
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,140
Yeah.

113
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,980
I'm going to give you a make-up lesson tonight. Don't you remember?

114
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
Oh.

115
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,060
Yeah.

116
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,860
Then we'll go first, Lin Mo.

117
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,020
Ok.

118
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,220
What? Don't we eat herbal jelly anymore?

119
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,900
Forget about that.

120
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,740
Hey.

121
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,580
You two,

122
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,300
take Lin Xuanhao with you.

123
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,180
Study hard and make progress every day.

124
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,860
Go.

125
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,510
Quickly.

126
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,540
What are you doing later?

127
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:16,940
Let me take you somewhere.

128
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,180
Where?

129
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,580
You'll know when you get there.

130
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,180
My bag!

131
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:21,740
Go!

132
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,820
Thanks.

133
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,260
Yu Muyang.

134
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,710
Le me introduce it to you.

135
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,900
This is Fur Ball.

136
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,770
It is exceptionally well behaved.

137
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,940
I watched its birth.

138
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,330
That's why I'm so close to it.

139
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:51,730
If you don't want to talk,

140
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,330
you can come over and talk to Fur Ball.

141
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,850
This is my good friend.

142
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,610
Its name is Flower.

143
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,850
I often come to see it.

144
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,530
It will be your good friend from now on.

145
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,210
If you don't want to talk to anyone,

146
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,330
you can come to it.

147
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,810
Fur Ball.

148
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,370
How do you know that?

149
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,770
A friend of mine brought me here.

150
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,930
Since then I've grown to like the place.

151
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,530
Between you and me,

152
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,570
this is my secret place.

153
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,050
How did you know about this place?

154
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,890
I found it by accident.

155
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,330
Between you and me,

156
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,380
this is my secret place.

157
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,289
I've never brought anyone here before.

158
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,210
You're the first one.

159
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,929
In the future,

160
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:38,610
I'm going to buy a big boat

161
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,130
with a lot of cats on it.

162
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,210
I am the captain.

163
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,809
Shark, you're the co-captain.

164
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,450
We will go on an adventure with a boatload of cats.

165
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,050
Well.

166
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,530
Let's stop here.

167
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,570
Take a break.

168
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,410
Just look at it.

169
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,730
At the point we start,

170
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,930
we turn around.

171
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,090
Move a little bit more.

172
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,410
This action hits the word "can".

173
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,850
♫You can♫

174
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,370

177
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,890
Wow. Yu Muyang.

178
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,690
I didn't know

179
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,090
you could dance as well as sing.

180
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,090
How come you've heard me sing?

181
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,170
Of course.

182
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,570
Come on. Show us a dance.

183
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,970
Music! Sun Yihang!

184
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,130
I can't believe it! Yu Muyang!

185
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,610
You know a lot

186
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,210
about popping.

187
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,770
Yes, Lin Mo.

188
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,290
You picked an amazing boy

189
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,610
just like me.

190
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,970
Yes, yes, yes.

191
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,930
Sun Yihang,

192
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,810
now you have competitor.

193
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,970
Hey, student.

194
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,290
Hey.

195
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,890
Where's your school uniform jacket?

196
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:31,930
The coat?

197
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,450
Yes.

198
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,410
In the classroom.

199
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,650
Class?

200
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,210
Name?

201
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:35,890
I'll take points off.

202
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,610
What's going on here?

203
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,770
And then there's the one who threw himself in.

204
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,010
What's wrong with your hair?

205
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,210
I

206
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:45,890
You what?

207
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:47,970
I was born with this hair.

208
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,010
Really?

209
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:49,490
Ok.

210
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,290
Class?

211
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,850
Name? I'll take points off.

212
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,090
You what?

213
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,290
And you.

214
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,370
Why isn't your coat tucked into your school pants?

215
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,050
Class?

216
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,370
Names? Points off.

217
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,090
This is the first time.

218
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,530
Just a warning is enough.

219
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,410
Yu Muyang. I need to talk to you.

220
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,130
All right, then he's done.

221
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,050
You.

222
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,090
What's your name?

223
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,450
Points off.

224
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,290
And you. Don't run!

225
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,850
I'm not interested in Xinsheng club,

226
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,370
let alone joining your club.

227
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,170
Yu Muyang,

228
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,410
You know who really cares about you.

229
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,290
I'm the captain.

230
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:47,970
You're the co-captain.

231
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,100
Captain?

232
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,850
Would the captain have abandoned the ship and the co-captain three years ago?

233
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,290
Yu Muyang,

234
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,210
You have to learn to grow up by yourself.

235
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,490
I made the mistake of thinking you were outgoing enough

236
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,330
to face the new environment by yourself.

237
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,490
And my mom chose my school.

238
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,300
So growing up is about betraying the pact, right?

239
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,610
So I apologized.

240
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,340
I went back to Yi 'an School.

241
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,810
I want to find the cheerful Yu Muyang.

242
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,060
It's not late.

243
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,380
Now quit the music club

244
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,380
and come with me to the Xinsheng Club.

245
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,290
I'm good now.

246
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,570
The music club is good, too

247
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,460
I'm not going to Xinsheng Club.

248
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,490
I hope you'll reconsider.

249
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,490
Don't say anymore.

250
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,890
I'm not going.

251
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,770
From now on,

252
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,810
let's go our own way.

253
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,290
Zhe, you're back.

254
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,130
Mom heard you had got promoted to president of the Xinsheng Club.

255
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,490
Great!

256
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,370
This is a cake from Aunt Li

257
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,370
to congratulate you.

258
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,330
Mom, you bought this, right?

259
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,090
You know mom.

260
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,730
Mom found that you are becoming more and more like me now.

261
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,890
I have to do my homework,

262
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,890
mom.

263
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,810
Zhe, then do it quickly.

264
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,610
And then play the piano.

265
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,330
Don't forget it.

266
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,570
Mom believes that

267
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,210
you will go further and further on the road of music.

268
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,650
Mom, as long as you're happy.

269
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,610
Everybody,

270
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:03,930
today we are going to have a real drill in fire rescue.

271
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,890
Representatives from each grade

272
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,410
form a fire brigade.

273
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,090
So next

274
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,690
we will invite

275
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,050
our beloved firefighters

276
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,050
to explain the matters needing attention in the fire.

277
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,490
After explaining how to use the fire fighting equipment,

278
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,850
we will have a drill.

279
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,010
Next,

280
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,530
we will explain how to use fire engines

281
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,450

285
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,010
Fire hoses are generally divided into two types.

286
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,210
Fu Yunzhe led the senior one next to us.

287
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,890
It is mainly used by firemen in fighting fires

288
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,010
He again.

289
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,810
Now the second floor of our building is on fire.

290
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,810
There are six people trapped inside.

291
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,890
We need you to find them and get them out safely.

293
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,130
Change into protective clothing.

294
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,410
Ready to drill.

295
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,330
Go!

The rest of you come with me into the building. Let's go!

Blow the whistle when you find the trapped person.

310

[Rescue progress of Team B]

314
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,850
Look at me, OK?

315
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,650
Do me a favor. I know you're pretending.

316
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,130
Hey, hey!

317
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,010
All right.

318
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,650
I can go.

Go.

Why is Mr. Li here?

323
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,130
Is he one of the trapped people?

324
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,930
For the drill,

325
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,290
we cleared the entire building.

326
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,740
Mr. Li!

327
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,050

00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,270
Get ready to rehearse after the meal.

520
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,390
Lin Mo, come back.

521
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,670
You promised that

522
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,350
you would listen to me at the serious thing of music club.

523
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,390
The refusal is not a big matter.

524
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,150
Lin Mo.

525
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Fu Yunzhe, what are you doing here?

526
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,510
I heard about

527
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,750
Lin Mo turning you down at the water bar.

528
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,550
It's all over the school.

529
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,230
Turn me down?

530
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,550
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

531
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,390
It was because he wanted to refuse you

532
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,390
that he reluctantly chose Lin Xuanhao.

533
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,550
Don't get upset about people like that.

534
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,360
I hope you will consider joining our Xinsheng club.

535
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,470
I've seen you dance.

536
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,070
We'd love to have you join us!

537
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,070
No. I won't join Xinsheng club.

538
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,070
Your talents and dreams need to develop in a better stage.

539
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,790
Xinsheng club will be the best club in Yi 'an Middle School.

540
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,970

543
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,350
You've done a great job.

544
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,430
Remember what I told you three years ago

545
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,630
when I gave you this Rubik's cube?

546
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,760
You told me not to get too attached to anything.

547
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:34,750
and to excrete obsession and emotion in a different way.

548
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,070
That's why you gave me the Rubik's cube

549
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,030
Yes.

550
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,510
All roads lead to Rome.

551
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,870
Life is like this Rubik's cube,

552
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,670
with infinite possibilities.

553
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,630
Different methods,

554
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,110
different journeys,

555
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,000
different turning points,

556
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,550
but we all go round and round in circles towards the same place,

557
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,750
that is,

558
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,470
where your heart leads you.

559
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,230
You mean

560
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,110
find my goal

561
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,830
and don't leave myself any regrets.
