happy birthday.

I hope this is helpful for your dance.

Thank you, Sis Biao.

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,980
Thanks a lot, Yan Ke.

20
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,500
No big deal.

21
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,980

This is a gift for you.

What is this?

32
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,460
It's Mimi.

Really.

I'm already so glad that you're here.

36
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,500
I didn't expect

37
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,940
that you'll give me such a gift with heart.

38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,180
Okay. Put it down.

39
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,300
So delicate. As if it's real.

40
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,580
Yi Hang, I have a gift for you.

41

43
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,980
Mr Li,

44
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,340
this is heavy gift.

45
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,500
It is heavy.

46
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,860
Is it?

47
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,060
I find it useful.

48
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,060
Right,

49
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
you can work together.

50
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,620
If you find it difficult,

51
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,180
just ask me.

52
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,700
How is it?

53
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,060
Did you have fun with friends?

54
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,100
It's great, mum.

55
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,860
But,

56
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,780
can I not tell them

57
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,340
that I'm going to study abroad?

58
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,140
Do you want to leave quietly?

59
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,220
You can do that.

60
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,220
No, mum.

61
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,020
I'm thinking about...

62
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,220
What did you say?

63
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,260
You don't want to go?

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,460
That's impossible.

65
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,540
You promised me

66
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,579
that you will say goodbye to them on birthday.

67
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,380
But I really don't want to leave them.

68
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,300
Can I postpone?

69
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:24,860
Can I...

70
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,780
Listen, babe.

71
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,020
I understand your ideas.

72
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,300
But your future path

73
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,500
is well-planned by mum.

74
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,460
You have the options to say goodbye with your friends

75
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,500
or to leave quietly

76
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,900
without telling them.

77
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,380
Is there another choice?

78
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,740
Mum, I know you did everything for me.

79
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,220
But I haven't prepared to separate with them.

80
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,060
I just want to spend more time with them.

81
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,540
No, Yihang.

82
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,100
You may hate me now.

83
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,700
But when you grow up,

84
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,620
you will be grateful of what I did.

85
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,300
Alright.

86
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,100

Sun Yihang, quick.

88
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:13,660
Come on.

89
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,940
Birthday boy.

Stand in the middle.

91

Your call took so long.

92
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,460
It's from my mum.

93
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,060
She's asking did you have fun.

94
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,900
Okay.

95
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,350
Now, Let's

96
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,100
sing the birthday song together and make a wish.

97
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,660

Actually, today

100

I have something to announce.

101
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,380
I want to tell you all

102
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,380
that the wish I made

103
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,860
is being forever with you, with Yi'an Music Club.

104
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,220
We can be number one.

105
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,620
- Yes. 
- Yes.

106
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,280
Forever.

107
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,390
Being together forever.

108
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,460
- Come. 
- Come.

109
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,660
Three, two, one, fighting.

110
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,140
Okay, let's take a photo together.

111
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,940
Come to take group photos.

112
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,740
Put a cool pose.

113
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,500
Smile.

114
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,110
Let me have a look.

115
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,230
Don't waste this.

116
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,860
Yu Muyang is clean. Quick!

117
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,340
Yu Muyang.

118
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,180
What is it?

119
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,780
Come for dinner tonight at my place, okay?

120
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,380
My mum said she hasn't seen you for ages.

121
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,180
I still have to train at the Music Club.

122
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,860
I don't have time.

123
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,020
What about tomorrow?

124
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,460
I don't like gathering.

125
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,460
Then why you went to the beach

126
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,830
last night?

127
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,620
How do you know?

128
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,100
Yu Muyang,

129
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,860
Don't try to impress them

130
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,780
in order to fit in.

131
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,340
Never.

132
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,180
I don't want to see you pretending to be happy.

133
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:02,900
I am happy.

134
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,380
Don't ever assume

135
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,420
that you know my thoughts.

136
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,140
Just manage your Xinsheng Club.

137
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,740
What are you doing?

138
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,260
Why aren't you training?

139
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,620
The head of the club is not active.

140
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,300
It's no use that we are active.

141
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,340
Sombody thought he's got talent

142
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,860
that can lead us with no training.

143
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,020
Fu Yunzhe,

144
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,270
I followed you from Student Union to Xinsheng Club.

145
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,780
I was not to waste time here.

146
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,179
Just get to the point.

147
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,419
Don't be sarcastic.

148
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,100
Get to the point.

149
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,539
Okay.

150
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,140
I will make it clear today.

151
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,390
Fu Yunzhe,

152
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,260
you're not qualified as the president.

153
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,780
Recently,

154
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,260
you hardly focused on training.

155
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,180
Every time something happens, you just leave us here.

156
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,220
What are you here for?

157
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,220
You were bluffing to me

158
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,220
that Xinsheng Club attended the National Competition

159
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,060
to edge out the Music Club.

160
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,340
But what now?

161
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,860
An unqualified president

162
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,500
will definitely screw up

163
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,380
the performance.

164
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,020
Are we done here?

165
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,820
No need to speak artificially.

166
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,200
You know perfectly

167
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,180
how much you have invested.

168
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,020
I don't have to explain

169
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,380
how much I have invested for Xinsheng Club.

170
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,940
You can leave whenever you want.

171
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,830
Whatever you like.

172
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,260
He just leave.

173
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,540
I think

174
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,740
he doesn't deserve to be the president.

175
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,300
Let's continue.

176
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,980
Where's Fu Yunzhe?

177
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,660
Fu Yunzhe...

178
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,820
Eh...

179
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,260
Yan Ke,

180
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,860
have you realized that recently the president

181
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,460
seldomly took us to training?

182
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,260
What about it?

183
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,220
If he is still the president,

184
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,820
Xinsheng Club will be ruined.

185
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,980
Then?

186
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,180
If we want to compete with the Music Club,

187
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,100
we must change another president.

188
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,460
Who will be the president?

189
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,780
Among us.

190
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,860
You?

191
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,660
If Fu Yunzhe is unqualified,

192
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,140
you are not even close.

193
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,860
No, Yan Ke.

194
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,620
What do you mean?

195
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,900
What's wrong with us?

196
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,140
I used to be the president of the Skating Club.

197
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,380
You won the Music Club once by dancing.

198
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,260
After that,

199
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,020
have you ever worked hard?

200
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,540
You're saying the Music Club is worthless.

201
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,180
What now?

202
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,780
The Music Club outran you

203
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,220
and you didn't notice.

204
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,220
If you keep gossiping around,

205
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,180
you can quit the club.

206
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,940
Yan Ke,

207
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,980
do you think Fu Yunzhe values you a lot?

208
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,580
It doesn't matter.

209
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,860
I will do my job.

210
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,460
So, what are we going to do next?

211
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,140
I know the leader of the fishing club.

212
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,260
Let's borrow some fishing rods from him

213
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,180
and go fishing at the lake.

214
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,540
Fishing is more interesting than this.

215
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,460
Go Go Go

216
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,740
I got a fish.

217
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,100
Do you know what time is it now?

218
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,620
Don't your club do training today?

219
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,820
Maybe you don't know it.

220
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,220
Our ex-leader Fu Yunzhe

221
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,260
has been fired by us.

222
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,820
It is our new leader Yihan.

223
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,380
We are relaxing.

224
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,300
Could you please give me back my hook?

225
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,100
[A message from Fu Yunzhe:  Can you come to the water bar for a while?]

226
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,300
Thank you for coming.

227
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,860
Today, in the garden...

228
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,470
It's ok.

229
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,380
New Voice Club. What do they want to do?

230
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,740
Who doesn't have a sound?

231
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,690
New Voice Club

232
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,700
Endless

233
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,990
Lin Mo

234
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,260
What are you doing?

235
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,940
What are you guys doing?

236
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,420
Lin Mo was having a contest with

237
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,180
the New Voice Club just now.

238
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,980
It was deafening me.

239
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,340
Do you hear what

240
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,140
the New Voice Club is doing?

241
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,860
It's bullying.

242
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,420
I had a look at the New Voice Club a minute ago.

243
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,020
There's only Fu Yunzhe in the room.

244
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,540
I can't stand it.

245
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,620
Let me take a look.

246
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,380
Fu Yunzhe, are you ok?

247
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,380
Oh. It's painful.

248
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,020
I rub for you.

249
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,020
The National Youth Art Group Competition asks

250
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,540
each group to have at least five members.

251
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,900
Lin Xuanhao was punished by Director Chen.

252
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,960
National Youth Art Group Competition

253
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,780
He can't be a member.

254
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,500
It's annoying.

255
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,860
Fu Yunzhe and Yan Ke are good.

256
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,380
I know they are good.

257
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,470
However, they are members of the New Voice Club.

258
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,740
One chopstick is easy to break.

259
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,060
How about a pair of chopsticks?

260
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,340
Headmaster

261
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,460
Headmaster,

262
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,060
what do you mean by this?

263
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,630
You think about it.

264
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,060
You want to put the two clubs together.

265
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,180
National Youth Art Group Competition

266
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,420
is coming.

267
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,500
You are competing with the New Voice Club.

268
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,780
We are here

269
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,500
to support you as fans.

270
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,700
Brother Lin Mo,

271
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,060
what about having me in the music club?

272
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,780
With my entrance,

273
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,580
the music club will be more competitive.

274
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
Right. With his entrance,

275
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,180
I will be the leader of the support team.

276
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,500
No need

277
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,260
Ummm

278
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,890
Xiaopang

279
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,380
Oh, sorry.

280
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,000
Shen Yisheng

281
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,470
Your name is

282
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,410
Shen Yisheng.

283
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,860
You go back and wait for the notice first.

284
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,940
There's no fear

285
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,220
for us to compete

286
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,020
with the New Voice Club.

287
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,780
For example,

288
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,820
I'm good at everything.

289
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,700
Look at Sun Yihang.

290
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,260
He can sing, dance,

291
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,020
write songs, and play the guitar.

292
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,620
Chi Yi

293
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,580
is welcomed among the audience

294
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,900
when standing on the stage.

295
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,500
Yu Muyang is good at

296
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,620
singing, dancing, doing rap, and playing yo-yo.

297
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
Why are we afraid?

298
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:48,940
However,

299
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,700
Yu Muyang,

300
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,660
you never sing a song

301
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,100
after you join the music club.

302
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,980
I'm not good at singing.

303
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,740
Why are you so modest?

304
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,300
I didn't ask you to show yourself

305
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,740
when you had your interview.

306
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,820
I admitted you straightly entered the music club

307
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,740
because I heard you sang.

308
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,859
On that day, I heard a beautiful song.

309
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,300
I followed the tune

310
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,220
and saw you holding a yo-yo

311
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
walking out of the music room.

312
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,460
Your yo-yo is special.

313
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,780
So, I recognized you

314
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,060
at the recruitment.

315
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,220
That wasn't me.

So, the voice you heard was

322
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,100
Fu Yunzhe.

323
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,740
So, that voice was Fu Yunzhe.

324

The best vocal we need is at

325

Finally, we are back.

The room for our music club

338
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,820
is the best.

339
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,740
We can use these together from now on.

00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,780

we merge.

343

A club like this is perfect.

344
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,660

345
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,500

348
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,900
as the most important thing.

349
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,380
Why is it different when we talk about the New Voice Club?

350
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,020
I dislike the New Voice Club.

351
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
I dislike Fu Yunzhe.

352
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,580
Even though we are competitive,

353
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,420
the rehearsal won't be fluent.

354
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,420
Lin Mo, you are the leader.

355
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,500
Please be a leader.

356
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,460
Lin Mo,

357
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,940
do you know why I am

358
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,060
your teacher?

359
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,420
When I was at the gymnasium team,

360
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,700
I had a competition with others without my coach's permission.

361
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,140
Your team asked you to be our teacher

362
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,140
because of this.

363
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,900
It was because our competition

364
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,380
led to some problems.

365
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,580
As a result, both of us

366
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
missed the important provincial competition.

367
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,500
We could have won the gold medal that time.

368
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,020
It was a very serious mistake to enter 
contests without permission.

369
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,660
I was impulsive

370
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,980
and stubborn at that time.

371
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,100
I just think I should stick to my own ideas,

372
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,140
just like you are now.

373
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,020
You refuse to merge the clubs because you 
don't want to,

374
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,900
But, Lin Mo,

375
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,500
it was because my impulsion that

376
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,180
made the whole team lost the gold medal.

377
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,820
Now,

378
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,300
I have realized that I was wrong.

379
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,620
But Lin Mo,

380
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,460
you are the president of the music club.

381
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,900
Do you know what you should consider first

382
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,660
before you put forward what you like or dislike?

383
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,140
Shark, what's wrong?

384
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,420
I'm fine.

385
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,820
I'm worried about Fu Yunzhe.

386
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,860
Fu Yunzhe? What happened to him?

387
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,140
Fu Yunzhe,

388
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,580
he is always a competitive person.

389
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,620
But the members in Xinsheng Club don't listen to him,

390
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,940
coupled with the merger of the two clubs,

391
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,820
I'm afraid

392
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,500
he can't recover after the setback.

393
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,020
Yu Muyang,

394
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,900
what's going on with you and Fu yunzhe?

395
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,340
I thought that you were in a conflict,

396
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,940
but now you are worrying about him.

397
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,300
Yes.

398
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,020
I don't like Xinsheng Club either.

399
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,780
But to be honest,

400
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,820
Fu Yunzhe has great talent and gifts

401
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,860
in music.

402
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,260
He isn't really that into music.

403
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,300
His mother is proficient in music,

404
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,420
so he has been influenced

405
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,820
deeply by his mother.

406
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,660
He never had any setbacks during his growth,

407
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,020
so I'm afraid he would give up directly.

408
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,820
Give me his address,

409
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,860
I'll find him by myself

410
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,580
and ask for his permission for the merger.

411
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,020
Who?

412
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,780
Hi!

413
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,740
Don't close the door!

414
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,540
I'm inviting you to merge our clubs.

415
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,380
I know you are mad at me.

416
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,540
Let's put our personal issues aside for now.

417
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,220
There must be a reason

418
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,520
for the school's arrangement.

419
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,460
We are all for our clubs' sake, right?

420
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,900
Fu Yunzhe!

421
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,380
Just give me an answer!

422
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,620
Do you want to join us?

423
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,660
No.

424
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,940
Fu Yunzhe, you'd better open the door

425
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,460
and let me finish my words,

426
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,900
or I'll keep knocking

427
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,430
until you open the door.

428
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,380
Fu Yunzhe,

429
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,260
I know you are in conflict with me.

430
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,460
But before we make decisions,

431
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,540
we can't mere consider

432
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,820
our own preference.

433
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,740
If the merged club

434
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,180
can make our school

435
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,580
more likely to win the contest,

436
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,710
I think we need to do that.

437
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,860
Think it over. Join us.

438
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,100
No.

439
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,740
Look at me!

440
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,980
I came to find you sincerely with gifts.

441
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,380
This is a snack from the stand 
near our school gate.

442
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,020
I found Yu Muyang and you love it so much,

443
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,060
so I bought you a bag of it.

444
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,020
Come on, eat it while it's hot!

445
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,540
Please consider joining us...

446
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,380
Fu Yunzhe! Good for you!

447
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,660
Why do you treat me like this?!

448
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,980
You can tell me if you refuse to join us!

449
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,100
Why did you clamp my hand!

450
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,460
Can't you open the door and see it?

451
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,540
It seems like...

452
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,900
You pissed me off!

453
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,500
Look! Look!

454
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,350
He's gone too far!

455
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,220
I appealed to him sincerely

456
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,860
and praised him

457
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,900
as much as I could!

458
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,740
He not only refused to open the door,

459
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,940
but also clamped my hand!

460
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
I'm pissed off!

461
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,460
I'll go.

462
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,900
I'll go and find him.

463
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,260
Dinner is ready!

464
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,900
Look! This is your favorite fish.

465
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,660
How is it?

466
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,060
Today I cooked many dishes

467
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,940
that you love very much.

468
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,020
Eat as much as you can!

469
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,470
OK.

470
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,500
Come on.

471
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,220
Zhe, don't be in a daze!

472
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,340
Pick a piece of fish for Yang.

473
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,460
Zhe, you told me to go to Yi'an to take care of Yang,

474
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,180
but I think you didn't take good care of him!

475
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,980
You always anwer me with “Ah”. Just eat.

476
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,180
Auntie's cooking is still so good,

477
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,820
I haven't eaten her dishes for a long time.

478
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,380
Four years.

479
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,740
Four years and four months.

480
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,620
-Well...
-Well...

481
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,500
You first.

482
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,130
Yu  Muyang,

483
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,500
I know what you want to say to me.

484
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,200
You want to persuade me to accept the merger

485
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,500
and invite me to join your music club.

486
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,460
Is the music club really

487
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,580
that important to you?

488
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,420
Fu Yunzhe,

489
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,620
what kind of person do you think

490
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,180
I am?

491
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,140
You were introverted since your childhood

492
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,180
and seemed to resist the world.

493
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,980
So I was always by your side

494
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,180
and wanted to let you know that

495
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,070
this world is really wonderful.

496
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,460
But I found that you are trying to 
accept the world gradually.

497
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,140
Yes. Lin Mo found me with a firm attitude

498
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,580
and invited me to join their music club.

499
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,220
Members of the club are very nice people.

500
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,780
Just like, you introduced Hua to me,

501
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,350
taught me to play YO-YO

502
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,620
and advised me to learn dance.

503
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,390
Members in the music club

504
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,460
also let me know that music can cure me.

505
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,620
So it means a lot to me

506
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,420
at present.

507
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,500
Yu Muyang,

508
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,660
have you heard the story of sardines?

509
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,540
Long long ago, there was a fisherman.

510
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,180
He wanted to sell fresh sardines in the market,

511
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,420
but he found that

512
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,580
many sardines died during the transport

513
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,340
from the port to the market.

514
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,940
So he tried to

515
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,740
put two catfishes

516
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,660
in the cabin full of sardines.

517
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,540
To avoid being attacked by catfishes,

518
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,260
the sardines moved their bodies desperately

519
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,820
and used all their survival instincts.

520
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,540
Finally, all of them were alive when 
arriving at the market.

521
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,460
I couldn't stop you

522
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,100
when you insisted on joining the music club.

523
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,620
But I don't want to see you fail

524
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,780
the contest together with the music club.

525
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,020
Now,

526
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,820
as a catfish,

527
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,420
I have completed my task.

528
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,020
And you, a little sardine,

529
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,180
can show on a big stage happily.

530
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,220
I should say goodbye to you.

531
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,980
Are you going to quit Xinsheng Club?

532
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,500
Do you want to play music with such poor capacity,

533
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,500
huh?

534
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,830
You'll never play it well because you have no talent!

535
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,460
Yi'an Music Club was the only one who chose me.

536
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,140
I can't give them up,

537
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,220
and they won't give me up.
