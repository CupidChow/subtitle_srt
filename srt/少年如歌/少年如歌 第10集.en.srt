Thank you for being here everyone.

Today, our global 
 fans support club are gathered here.

11
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
May I ask you to offer greater support

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,640
to Bro Lin Mo and the Music Club?

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,560
Is that all right?

14
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,720
No problem！

15
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,490
Let's make it!

16
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,800
This is outrageous!

17
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,920
This is appalling!

18

Are you gonna turn the world upside down?

19
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,199
How could you catch the fish in 
 the lake of our school?

20
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,800
Did you steal the eggs of the swans in our lake?

21
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,770
Take it out!

22
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,360
Give it to me!

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,320

How can you eat little swans?

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,640
The little swans are so lovely!

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
How can you eat them?

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Actually we intended to give them to the 
 brothers in the music club

30
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,410
so that they can intake more nutrition.

to do with you?

Can you win more tickets

After he found out that you gave me 
 the lunch card,

108
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,640
he spent the money in it lavishly 
 in that canteen,

109

buying expensive food all the time.

Yes! It's him!

OK, Luoluo,

112

Just say it if you want to drink milk tea,

115
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,720
why did you blame the card?

116
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,720
Yes, in deed, he wanted to drink it himself.

117

What are you talking about?

118
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,680
Did I say this for myself?

119
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,130
I said that because I wish everyone 
 can have more milk tea.

120

But, anyway,

121

Maybe we will not be this lucky next time.

132
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,680
It will be tougher as we go upward.

133

We need to show everyone

134

that our club is more excellent than others.

135

All right everybody,

147
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,450

 -OK.

159

Your application for returning has been proved,

160
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,409

161

 "Outstanding Teacher Award" yet...

What is it now? You are reluctant to come back

166
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,530
when you enjoyed yourself too much outside, huh?

167

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,850
for the closed training.

170
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,210
It's a great opportunity,

171
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,690
do remember to come back.

172
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,530
Lyu Huihui?

173
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,210
Is that real sir?

174
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,210
Would I lie to you to

175
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,380
take you back?

176
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,180
Come back to the team in three days.

177
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,540
Yes, sir!

178
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,260
I'll return to our team 3 days later.

179
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,500
See you.

180
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,060
Sis Biao, Sun Yihang has just came back,

181
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,380
you have to leave now?

182
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,980
I don't know...

183
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,340
Ms. He,

184
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,820
are you going to return to the sports school?

185
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,520
Yes.

186
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,580
Sis Biao,

187
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,300
You said this because you're 
 afraid that we will be over proud

188
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,500
after we won and you wanna calm us down,

189
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,380
you are not serious,right?

190
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,780
I'm serious.

191
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,420
In that case,

192
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,500
when will you leave?

193
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,740
I must leave in three days.

194
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,620
That's too fast!

195
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,940
Do you have to leave?

196
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,260
Sis Biao,

197
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,540
you will return here, right?

198
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,660
We can prepare for 
 the final competition together.

199
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,100
Really? Sis Biao.

200
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,340
I'm not sure.

201
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,670
The coach sent me to Yi'an Middle School，

202
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,980
Luoluo also asked me to be your tutor.

203
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,020
To be honest,

204
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,180
I was reluctant.

205
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,260
But after being your tutor,

206
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,380
I see a lot of myself

207
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,660
in you.

208
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,100
Every single one of you

209
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,420
touched me.

210
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,380
From all of you,

211
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,980
I learned a lot.

212
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,100
I already have feelings for you

213
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,460
and Yi'an Middle School.

214
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,220
The application of returning to the team

215
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,640
I started writing on the first day

216
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,080
I joined Yi'an.

217
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,180
Once a week.

218
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,660
It has become a habit.

219
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,220
Now it's really passed,

220
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,980
but I'm not happy.

221
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,020
The team asked me to go back for closed training.

222
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,580
I can even see the idols

223
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,460
I have worshipped for a long time.

224
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,620
But I hesitated.

225
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,620
Sis Biao, what's your dream?

226
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,660
Or what kind of people you want to be?

227
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,500
Of course win the javelin game.

228
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,420
This has always been my dream.

229
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,540
Never changed.

230
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,900
In that case,

231
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,780
why are you hesitating?

232
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,650
I...

233
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,100
Our dream,

234
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,590
We will work hard to defend.

235
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,100
Sis Biao, you have helped us a lot.

236
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,260
Now,

237
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,580
You can also pursue your dreams

238
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,700
with conviction.

239
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,180
We will support you behind,

240
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,180
be your back,

241
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,060
rooting for you.

242
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,580
Right?

243
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,260
Of course.

244
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,420
You are already an excellent teacher.

245
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,780
We

246
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,120
must also be good students

247
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,460
who are brave to let you go.

248
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:16,970
Yes!

249
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,620
Miss He,

250
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,100
if you are going to closed training,

251
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,900
can I...

252
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,940
can they still see you?

253
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,660
Oh, Mr. Lee, if you

254
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,600
want to ask whether you can see Miss He again,

255
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,000
just ask directly.

256
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,820
Why use us as a guise?

257
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,220
You

258
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,620
Thank you all.

259
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,380
I'll come back to see you.

260
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,260
Come back with a gold medal.

261
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,230
Good.

262
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,460
Gold medal!

263
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,230
Yes!

264
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,660
Fighting, fighting, fighting!

265
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,870
[Page not found]

266
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,700
Which website is the live of broadcasting votes?

267
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,700
Don't worry, I am trying to find it.

268
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,260
What a support club activity!

269
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,370
I would watch the live broadcast by myself

270
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,470
if I knew the case.

271
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,860
Exactly, can it work?

272
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
That's all the money.

273
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,060
What Can we do with that money?

274
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,780
We can only buy some food and drinks.

275
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,100
And have a farewell party in the rehearsal room.

276
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,660
I just want it to be big,

277
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,300
so it can impress her deeply.

278
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,820
A big farewell party...

279
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,700
Then there is no money left for gifts.

280
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,780
I guess,

281
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,420
we can only buy a cheap

282
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,620
key chain.

283
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,420
Oh, if I didn't fall out with my mother,

284
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,140
maybe I can have a little more money.

285
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,580
She doesn't give me pocket money anymore.

286
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,820
Oops, it's okay.

287
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,180
Let's put it this way,

288
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,060
Our feelings for Sis Biao

289
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,060
cannot be measured by money.

290
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,740
Although we don't have much money,

291
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,860
there will be one way using less money.

292
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,700
First,

293
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,820
what does Sis Biao like?

294
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,500
Do you even have to ask?

295
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,020
Sis Biao, Sis Biao.

296
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,500
Of course she likes javelin.

297
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,100
But she already has her precious javelin.

298
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,180
Is it possible that we will give another one?

299
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,580
It’s so boring

300
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,540
to give away what she already has.

301
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,020
In my opinion,

302
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,300
We might as well give her

303
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,900
a javelin necklace.

304
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,460
Preferably diamond-studded.

305
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,260
And designed by the designer himself.

306
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,060
We don't have that much money.

307
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,460
It's not necessarily enough to sell you.

308
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,540
I think,

309
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,840
We have to start with the core needs of Sis Biao.

310
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,300
What is Sis Biao missing?

311
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,180
Boyfriend.

312
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,740
Yes, boyfriend!

313
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,540
Alright, alright.

314
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,340
There is no way.

315
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,190
Then it seems I have to sacrifice my beauty.

316
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,190
You wish!

317
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,460
It's not you.

318
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,220
We are talking about Mr. Lee.

319
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,570
You didn't realize that Mr. Lee

320
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,820
has a thing to Sis Biao?

321
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,780
But,

322
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,380
I think,

323
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,620
Miss He didn't feel Mr. Lee's love for her.

324
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,700
Exactly.

325
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,990
How can we

326
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,950
get them together?

327
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,790
Mr. Lee is so boring.

328
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,350
You say he spent all his time with

329
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,390
bullfrog, skull, speciments.

330
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,950
It doesn’t look like the type

331
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,550
that can make Miss He’s heart beat faster.

332
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,110
That's right.

333
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,790
If Sis Biao

334
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,750
can't realize Mr. Lee's feelings about her,

335
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,030
it's useless no matter how we get them together.

336
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,510
How about let's make a styling for Mr. Lee?

337
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,630
Dress him up.

338
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,430
-Yes.
- This is okay.

339
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,310
These

340
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,910
are my favorite clothes.

341
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,110
But can Mr. Lee

342
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,350
wear your clothes?

343
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,270
We can think about it first,

344
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,110
after the change of style, will Mr. Lee impress Sis Biao's heart

345
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,790
when they date?

346
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:16,710
In this way,

347
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,950
let's try this set first.

348
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,270
Miss He, emm...

349
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,160
I...

350
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,550
Waiter,

351
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,910
please pour me a cup of coffee.

352
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,070
Thank you!

353
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,910
This style is too far apart from Mr. Lee

354
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,510
in peacetime.

355
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,150
Sis Biao, a straight-tempered person,

356
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,710
must have a sneer at Mr. Lee.

357
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,990
How about this one?

358
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,270
Miss He, actually...

359
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,470
I like you.

360
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,790
Are you crazy?

361
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,150
Who allowed you to stay so close?

362
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,830
I kill you pervert.

363
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,670
Forget it.

364
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,430
Mr. Lee,

365
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,630
even language attacks can't stand,

366
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,950
let alone Sis Biao's sturdy physical attacks.

367
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,630
Right?

368
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,350
This one?

369
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,630
Luoyi, look at this nice weather.

370
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,830
Let's go sweat it out.

371
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,070
Okay.

372
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,110
Let's do a 10km run first.

373
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,950
Oh, no.

374
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,070
The physique of Mr. Lee,

375
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,790
he can stand in line with the skeleton frame

376
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,310
after running for ten kilometers.

377
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,790
I don't think we need to try.

378
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,720
What we changed is the appearance,

379
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,880
not the personality.

380
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,420
If it's not a change from the inside out,

381
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,420
no matter how we get them together, it's useless.

382
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,700
Isn't it difficult to change the personality?

383
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,619
Mr. Lee is such an adult,

384
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,980
how could the personality be changed

385
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,819
by the few of us?

386
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,420
Have you heard of the suspension bridge effect?

387
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,660
Psychologist Richard De La Sal said,

388
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,220
People's emotions

389
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,780
will be affected by the environment at the time.

390
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,100
In a dangerous situation,

391
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,540
humans will think

392
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,640
that their physiological response

393
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,740
to the acceleration of their heartbeat

394
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,940
is caused by love.

395
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,820
So when you’re scared,

396
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,420
it’s the best way to promote the love

397
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,060
between two people.

398
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,100
So do we

399
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,700
still have to find a suspension bridge?

400
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,980
No.

401
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,740
We can do like this,

402
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,220
everyone.

403
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,580
Are you ready, Sis Biao?

404
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,940
Yes!

405
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,460
Three, two, one.

406
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,820
Is this me?

407
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,450
Yeah, is it very similar?

408
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,940
Oh,

409
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,900
why do you prepare these things?

410
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,140
Sis Biao, you are leaving.

411
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,660
Of course we have to see you off.

412
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
Right.

413
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,980
Sis Biao, when you came to Yi'an,

414
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,580
you were not coming magnificently.

415
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,700
So when you go back,

416
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,020
we have to let you

417
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,540
leave magnificently.

418
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,660
Sis Biao, light the candles.

419
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,540
It doesn‘t seem appropriate to say happy birthday.

420
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,100
Then let's tell Sis Biao.

421
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,460
Sis Biao, you must win the game!

422
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:57,980
How's this?

423
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,260
Okay.

424
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,060
So, Sis Biao.

425
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,780
You must win the game!

426
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,340
Got it. I'll make a wish.

427
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:13,860
Go ahead.

428
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,140
Sis Biao.

429
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,020
Thank you for coming to our music club

430
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,460
when we were down.

431
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,820
You helped us keep the music club.

432
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,740
And thank you

433
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:24,980
for taking the consequences

434
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,860
of participating games privately.

435
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,500
You took us to He Luoluo's concert.

436
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,540
Finally, you helped us to make a group.

437
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,900
Thank you so much.

438
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,180
You made me understand again

439
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,460
the responsibility and significance

440
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:37,620
of being a music club's president.

441
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,740
And how to be a qualified president.

442
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,180
All of us in music club

443
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,620
are thanking everything you have done for us.

444
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,860
The wind is so strong.

445
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,420
I'll show you

446
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,260
what it was like the first time I saw Lin Mo.

447
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,660
Hand in pocket.

448
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,260
Really cool.

449
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,220
Then tell me.

450
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,580
Lin Mo, Class three of Grade Two.

451
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,580
You don't know,

452
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,260
at that time, the fire inside me

453
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:51,260
just suddenly came up.

454
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,340
Is that you, Lin Mo?

455
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,060
Yes.

456
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,180
I eat some potato chips.

457
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,580
Well.

458
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,180
I need to go to the bathroom.

459
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,940
I need to go there too.

460
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,500
Being this case,

461
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,660
while they are in the bathroom,

462
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,380
I'm going to tell you a story.

463
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,380
Lin Mo, are you serious?

464
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,660
Can you tell a story?

465
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,300
Lin Xuanhao told me.

466
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,580
I find it very interesting.

467
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,940
I'll share it with you.

468
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,580
It's not a horror story, is it?

469
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,780
Sis Biao, are you afraid?

470
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,700
What are talking about?

471
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,060
How can I be afraid?

472
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,700
I'm worried about these stories

473
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,580
are no good

474
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,260
for your kids' physical and mental health.

475
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,940
Kids?

476
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,900
We are teenagers.

477
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,420
We're not afraid.

478
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,820
Good.

479
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,780
Pay attention!

480
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,060
What I'm going to talk about

481
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,220
is all real.

482
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,700
It's said that

483
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,100
a long time ago,

484
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,960
there is a student who is excellent

485
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,060
in characters and academics.

486
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,540
Her grades are exceptionally good.

487
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,380
But nobody knows what's wrong.

488
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,140
One day...

489
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,250
[Sun Yihang]

490
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,180
Hello, Yihang.

491
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,740
Hello, Mr. Lee.

492
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,660
Well, we

493
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,820
are trapped.

494
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,180
And Miss He...

495
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,820
Yes, we are in the library.

496
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,260
Mr. Lee, please come and save us.

497
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,420
Mr. Lee, help!

498
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,460
Mr. Lee!

499
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,660
Hello, Yihang?

500
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,540
Mr. Lee, help!

501
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,260
Hello?

502
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,620
And she was wearing

503
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,100
all in red that day.

504
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,260
Oh, don't believe this kind of story.

505
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,500
You told me you're teenagers,

506
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,620
and you still believe in these

507
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,420
stories made up to deceive children.

508
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,020
I thought you are courageous.

509
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,340
But one more thing,

510
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,020
it is said that

511
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,540
if you hear someone calling you from behind,

512
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,220
you mustn't look back.

513
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,380
Because you don't know

514
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,820
what it is behind you.

515
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,300
What's wrong? Is there a power outage?

516
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,900
Sis Biao, how can you turn around?

517
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,060
Ah!

518
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,220
Come!

519
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,180
I hope nothing happened to them.

520
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,180
Go and see.

521
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,460
What's going on here?

522
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,540
There won't be any dirty things, right?

523
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,460
Is it

524
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,260
the kid in red?

525
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,300
Don't scare yourself.

526
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,660
What are you thinking of?

527
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,100
These don't exist at all.

528
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,940
Yan Ke.

529
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,860
This is not real.

530
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,540
Yan Ke.

531
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,060
Don't come here.

532
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,940
See!

533
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,260
I'm Lin Mo.

534
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,060
What happened?

535
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,700
Let's stand up first.

536
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,180
Yan Ke, where is Sun Yihang?

537
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,540
Sun Yihang...

538
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,140
We just finished using the bathroom.

539
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,940
Behind the glass,

540
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,900
we saw a piece of red clothes flash past.

541
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,700
I... Sun Yihang screamed.

542
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,860
I opened his stall.

543
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,020
He was gone.

544
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,700
No way. No way.

545
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,540
We'll be fine. We'll be fine.

546
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,020
I'm here.

547
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,780
We'll be fine.

548
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,780
Help!

549
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,900
Voice from Sha Yu.

550
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,740
Where is he?

551
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,460
When we came out,

552
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,900
was Yu Muyang around us?

553
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,420
What's going on?

554
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,020
It's you who had to tell us horror story.

555
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,940
This kind of stuff can't be talked about.

556
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,100
Didn't you encourage me to say it too?

557
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,500
Yan Ke, please accompany me to the bathroom.

558
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,780
Go to the place where Sun Yihang

559
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,900
was gone just now and look for him again.

560
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,980
I'd like to see

561
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,500
what is this bad thing.

562
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,540
Ah, Lin.

563
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,260
Wait a moment.

564
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,300
You don't go.

565
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,460
There is no light.

566
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,020
What if something happens to you.

567
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,780
Sis Biao, don't be afraid.

568
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,100
You stay with Chi Yi.

569
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,980
Don't leave here. We'll come back soon.

570
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:14,980
Go, go.

571
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,820
What's going on?

572
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,860
Who is there?

573
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,980
Who is there?

574
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,980
Chi Yi, come over.

575
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,300
Let's go find them.

576
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,540
Go.

577
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,260
Yan Ke?

578
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,340
Sorry, the number you have dialed

579
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,900
can not be connected for the moment.

580
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,090
Please redial later.

581
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,820
No signal, didn't we just talk on the phone?

582
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,060
Call Miss He.

583
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,220
Please answer the phone, please.

584
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,940
Lin Mo, I don't mean to say,

585
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,980
but I also watched your performances,

586
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,460
it is still a bit difficult to beat us.

587
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,860
Nobody can tell the result of a game.

588
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,020
Even we lost the stage of preliminaries,

589
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,820
we're still standing here.

590
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,140
The music club is never what you think it is.

591
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,780
We'll see you on the stage.
