4
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,610
Are you quitting Xinsheng Club？

5
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,729
Doesn't the captain want to go fishing

6
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,490
with his deputy captain?

7
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,180
Five o'clock tomorrow afternoon

8
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,250
at the rehearsal room.

9
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,410
The one of Xinsheng Club.

10
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,370
The Music Club will conduct its first rehearsal

11
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,259
for participating in the national competition.

12
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,930
Will you go?

13
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,329
Lin Mo,

14
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,570
Fu Yunzhe, he...

15
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,530
It has been a long time,

16
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:29,970
I'll go and find him.

17
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,090
I've heard of Fu Yunzhe's personality that

18
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,010
he is never late.

19
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,650
He doesn't want to come, let's just don't force him.

20
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,970
Is the first rehearsal of the music club here?

21
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,410
Yes.

22
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,290
Welcome to the music club.

23
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,530
Change another hand.

24
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,810
Hey, who hurt my hand like this?

25
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,770
Lin Mo, I am very sorry.

26
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,290
Alright, that seat is yours.

27
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,020
Come on, let's start practicing.

28
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,250
Yes, come in.

29
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,820
Director Chen,

30
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,810
This is the list of participants for this

31
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,370
National Youth Art Group Competition.

32
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,130
I have watched their rehearsal before.

33
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,490
And I finally selected these six people

34
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,410
as representatives for the school to join the competition.

35
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,220
[Participants in the National Youth Art Group Competition]
[Lin Mo, Chi Yi, Sun Yihang, Yu Muyang, Fu Yunzhe, Yan Ke]

36
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,170
I will hand over this list to Principal Liu as soon as possible.

37
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,409
But before confirming the game,

38
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,409
you need to do one thing first.

39
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,530
This is how it dance in this part.

40
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,730
Let's do it a few more times.

41
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,530
I think Fu Yunzhe seems to be doing poorly recently.

42
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,090
Clubs have just been combined and it needs time to work.

43
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,490
We can do a team building.

44
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,130
It sounds good!

45
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,410
Come, everyone, come here.

46
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,970
President Liu has approved

47
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,170
the list of participants to join

48
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,810
the National Youth Art Group Competition

49
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,170
So there are six students who will represent the school to participate this competition.

50
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,250
They are Lin Mo, Chi Yi, Sun Yihang,

51
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,170
Yu Muyang, Fu Yunzhe, and Yan Ke.

52
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,770
Let's congratulate them!

53
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,650
Don’t be discouraged if you haven’t been selected.

54
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,370
Just work harder.

55
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:37,810
You are all important reserve force in our music club.

56
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,010
By the way, there is one more thing.

57
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,210
Director Chen said that

58
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,090
because in the previous citywide competition,

59
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,610
the music club caused a bad influence,

60
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,130
therefore, you must pass

61
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,090
the examine of Director Chen and Principal Liu  before participating in the competition.

62
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,820
If the examine fails,

63
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,690
then the school is likely to

64
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,860
give up this competition.

65
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,690
Ms. He, don't worry.

66
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,290
The current music club

67
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,530
is much better than the previous music club.

68
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,210
Yes, Lin Mo is very strict now.

69
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,090
Well, the internal examine is on next Friday after school.

70
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,210
The principal and the director will also arrive early.

71
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,060
So we have to go ahead and prepare.

72
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,210
Do you understand?

73
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,330
Yes.

74
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,450
Okay, then you can go on practicing.

75
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,530
OK.

76
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,850
What kind of internal examine? It was too sudden.

77
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,410
You were quite calm just now.

78
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,010
Chi Yi, why don't we do a team building?

79
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,850
Yes, yes.

80
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:44,010
Then, we will train for two more hours tonight.

81
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,170
Tomorrow we will do the team building.

82
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,450
And after that, we have to train for two more hours everyday,

83
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,210
until the internal examine.

84
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:49,940
OK.

85
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,909
OK.

86
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,330
Lin Mo, I...

87
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,930
I know, you can go first.

88
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,690
It's only half a month before the competition.

89
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,250
From now on,

90
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,810
We need to increase the training intensity.

91
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,290
Today we will focus on speed, reaction and defense.

92
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,810

93
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,810

Uppercut.

97
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,610
Uppercut.

98
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,370

101
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,410
Uppercut.

102
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,780
Jab and uppercut!

Jab and uppercut!

104
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,450
The team building you were talking about is not riding a bicycle, is it?

105
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,130
Yes, it is.

106
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,890
No, I can't do this.

107
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,650
Yu Muyang,

108
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,810
You know I don't know how to ride a bike.

109
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,250
I didn't know it was riding a bicycle until I got here.

110
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,730
I may not be able to participate in this team building.

111
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,290

Why suddenly do you remember to practice the piano

Lin Mo from our club gets hurt in the hand

140

so I am in charge of the piano accompaniment now

149
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,890
you only want me to be happy

00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,490
but you know what

151
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,530
only when you are happy

152
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,610
I will be happy

you can live to be the person you want to be

I don't know what I do

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,610
is to fulfill your dream

158
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,330
or it has become my dream as well

159
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,890
I just don't know

160

164
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,060
But I want you to promise me

165
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,890
the final decision you made

166
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,410
shouldn't be a burden for you

167
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,410
Do you understand?

168
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:05,770
Step on this weighing scale

169
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,490
You did a great job in putting on some weight these days

170
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,850

343
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,490
You are great

344
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,570
you can even fight with others

345
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,450
and beat your dad

346
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,130
Right

347
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,290
That's not fighting

348
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,330
It's called free fighting

349
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,460
It's a kind of sports program

350
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,390
not fighting

351
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,930
Isn't

352
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,130
that fighting?

353
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,370
Believe it or not, I can take you

354
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,330
to our boxing club

355
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,810
and let my dad give you a free lesson

356
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,050
Then from now on

357
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,650
no one can stop our music club

358
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,690
Yi'an Music Club

359
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,770
Fighting, fighting fighting

360
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,770
Let's go back and practice

361
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,210
What are these?

362
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,010
What is this?

363
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,530
Chi Yi loves eating

364
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,290
This one, this one and this one

365
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:53,890
Chi Yi especially ...

366
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,490
Yihang

367
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,050
Uncle

368
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:56,810
Hello

369
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,090
Dad, why are you here?

370
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,690
I am here to help you

371
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,570
to take the rest things in your classroom to the car

372
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,810
Right

373
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,690
your mom has completed the drop-out procedure

374
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,250
and the procedures for going abroad have been completed

375
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,970
I have told the teachers in your school

376
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,850
you don't need to attend the following classes

377
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,970
Going abroad

378
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:15,890
but I

379
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,770
Yihang

380
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,810
You know dad has no decision on this matter

381
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,970
You and your mom

382
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,550
I am really embarrassed

383
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,650
in between

384
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,210
But I support your mom's decision

385
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,050
It's for your good

386
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,170
we can talk about this later in car

387
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,330
I know you will feel sad

388
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,370
You can just leave if you have to go, Sun Yihang

389
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:06,890
I don't want to see you again

390
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,410
Lin Mo

391
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:13,930
Goodbye
