1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,210
Youth melody

3
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,890
Episode 6

4
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,920
Oh my god. Is it really Lin Mo's brother and the others?

5
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,360
So cool.

6
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,140
When will Lin Mo's brother inform me

7
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,759
to join the music club.

8
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,600
I also want to dance dressed like this.

9
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,240
Forget it.

10
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,440
Is it really Lin Mo and the others?

11
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,080
It's the music club.

12
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,280
I didn't expect the music club to be so handsome in the girl group dance.

13
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,870
Look.

14
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,050
What?

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,729
What?

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,240
Everyone, wait a minute.

17
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,920
I'll briefly announce

18
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,759
that our midterm exams for the semester

19
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,960
are scheduled for Wednesday.

20
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,400
I don't think

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
I need to stress the importance of this midterm.

22
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,760
Since every test that follows

23
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,280
is an advance preview of the entrance exam,

24
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,240
I hope you can pay a little attention to it.

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,920
OK?

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,720
Be quiet.

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,800
What's all the noise!

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
You guys talk more than I do.

29
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,760
Is it necessary

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,560
to discuss a test?

31
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,120
Show it to me.

32
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,440
Still watching girls dance?

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,360
I am anxious for you.

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,000
Really.

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,600
You are not anxious at all?

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,720
I'd like to see

37
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,079
how many points you two got on the midterm.

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,160
Tell your mother to come and get the phone.

39
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,880
Teacher, this is my cell phone.

40
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,160
Then call your mother.

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,880
It's all your fault.

42
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,400
Well, school's out.

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,240
Everyone go home.

44
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,360
Cheer up, Lin Mo.

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,240
What about tonight?

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,210
Get your ass to training.

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,120
Let's go.

48
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,720
It's time to rehearse, what are you two doing?

49
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,800
Come.

50
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,960
Look.

51
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,000
It's really him!

52
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,880
Impossible.

53
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,320
Yan Ke is such a cool guy.

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,400
When did this happen?

55
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,120
When?

56
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,640
I heard it was last weekend.

57
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,800
You don't know?

58
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,040
This video is all over our school.

59
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,140
Look.

60
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,160
You guys train on your own first.

61
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm going out.

62
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,520
What happened?

63
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,840
Let Yan Ke dance female group dance.

64
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,520
He would not find Lin Mo to sort him out, right?

65
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,360
Maybe.

66
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,280
You know.

67
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,130
This thing is all over our school.

68
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,170
You're awesome.

69
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,280
What a way to see justice regardless of the consequences.

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,520
A group of 16 or 17-year-old boys

71
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,440
wearing women's clothes dancing in a female group.

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,600
No...

73
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,880
Enough.

74
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,840
I know you.

75
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,400
But

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
everything you say and do when you go out

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,080
represents the image of Yi'an.

78
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,920
Think carefully before you do something.

79
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,960
We were the ones who didn't think it through

80
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,080
and we know we were wrong.

81
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,450
The situation was urgent

82
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,760
and we purely wanted to help them.

83
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,240
But

84
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,120
this dance is not bad.

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,920
Women's clothing is also quite good-looking well.

86
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,320
Really.

87
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,600
Even you think so.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,440
Then why do you still blame us.

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,960
What's the use of my ideas,

90
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,080
and Director Chen doesn't feel the same way.

91
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,480
Look at you dance!

92
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,160
The twist is too bad.

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,600
Sun Yihang is quite similar.

94
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,880
Quite similar.

95
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Also quite suitable for you.

96
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,400
Lin Mo's skirt is a little short, right.

97
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,080
Very easy to expose.

98
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,400
Ji Yi is also powerful!

99
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,280
Hey. Aren't you training?

100
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,360
Yan Ke.

101
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,600
Why don't you give us that girl group dance again?

102
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,120
Right?

103
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,760
Yeah. We want to see a live version.

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,360
What do you mean?

105
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,200
Nothing.

106
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,320
It's just that there's not enough footage of you

107
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,280
in this video,

108
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,240
it's not enjoyable.

109
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,050
Yan Ke.

110
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,120
So many people have seen it,

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
you can dance for us again.

112
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,200
Do you guys want to train or not?

113
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,960
If we train with you,

114
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,040
who knows if it's a male or female group dance?

115
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,320
Yeah.

116
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,840
Thank you.

117
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,240
Yan Ke.

118
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,560
Mr. He.

119
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,920
Why do you stay here alone?

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
Have a bottle of water.

121
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,840
Shouldn't the New Voice Club

122
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,440
be training at this time?

123
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,120
I don't want to go to training.

124
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,320
There's no understanding

125
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,000
among our teammates.

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,840
I don't see the point of this.

127
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,560
Music club is good!

128
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,770
They are particularly harmonious

129
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,880
and the teammates have a special understanding of each other.

130
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,200
Who gave you this illusion?

131
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,560
There is no such thing as a naturally compatible teammate.

132
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,120
You have not seen the look behind the music club.

133
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,160
You see just like Lin Mo and Lin Xuanhao

134
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,520
all day long are bickering.

135
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,120
Yu Muyang's personality was also introverted,

136
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,760
and at first was not integrated.

137
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,050
Because it's a club,

138
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,560
everyone has their own personality.

139
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,440
So you need to be understanding and tolerant of each other.

140
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,800
Well, don't think too much about it,

141
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,960
hurry up and go to training.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,159
I believe that all your questions that you can't find answers to,

143
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,520
eventually your sweat and hard work

144
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,960
will give you the answers.

145
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,600
I'll go first.

146
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,880
Mimi what do you think I should do?

147
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,920
I received an acceptance letter from a school abroad.

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,720
My mom has always wanted me to study abroad.

149
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,120
But my best friends are in the music club

150
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,760
and I can't leave them.

151
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,570
Mimi.

152
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
What do you think I should do?

153
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,600
You...

154
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Did you hear the conversation

155
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,809
I just had with it?

156
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,960
I didn't mean to.

157
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,000
Can you keep a secret for me?

158
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,920
Okay.

159
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,320
I'll keep it a secret for you.

160
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
Go.

161
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,680
Not go.

162
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,200
Go.

163
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,160
I've been looking for you for a long time.

164
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
Why are you here?

165
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,320
Nothing.

166
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,240
I just came up alone to blow off some steam.

167
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,080
You look like you have something on your mind.

168
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,520
Me?

169
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,200
Yes.

170
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,840
No.

171
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,280
Last night

172
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,240
a friend of mine

173
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,960
told me

174
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,680
that he was going to study abroad.

175
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,400

178
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,880
And then?

179

No more.

180

And we thought about it all night

181
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,200
and still didn't know what choice to make.

182
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,970
This is simple,

183
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,560

184
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,880

Yes.

186
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,520
Imagine

187
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,640

188
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,920

191

Do you know?

192
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,360
What is really important about the coin toss

193
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,640
is not the result,

194
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,080
but the coin in the process of falling

195
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,520
actually you have the answer in your heart,

196
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,720
right?

197
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,800
Think back

198
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,280
to what you just thought in your mind?

199
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,600
OK.

200
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,530
The coin toss does not make the decision for anyone,

201
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,640
but it allows you to make a choice

202

in the shortest possible time.

203

As for Mr. He,

508

Besides,
