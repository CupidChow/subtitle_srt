00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,010
Episode two

4
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,539
Sister!

5
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,620
Save it!

6
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,340
There is nothing good

7
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,259
when you call me your sister.

8
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,539
I just what to know how you are.

9
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,140
What it's like being a teacher recently?

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,820
Is it exhausting?

11
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,900
Not so well.

12
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,380
The director is grumpy.

13
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,300
Co-workers are strange.

14
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,780
Students don't really listen to me.

15
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,500
My younger brother picks me up after work.

16
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,420
It does not seem like good thing will happen.

17
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,300
Poor me!

18
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,820
What is it?

19
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,660
I am just eating one of your chocolate, what's wrong?

20
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,500
Sister.

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,300
This is tea.

22
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,540
This is not chocolate.

23
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,380
Alright then.

24
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,460
What is it?

25
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,660
Sister.

26
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
You knew it.

27
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,980
I was the president of the music club.

28
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,579
But the teacher of the club got sick recently.

29
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,180
So,

30
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,220
I want you to be their teacher.

31
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,300
Is that OK?

32
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,260
Me?

33
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,740
Being the teacher of the music club?

34
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,579
No!

35
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,020
It's better to save trouble.

36
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,860
Don't screw me over!

37
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,020
Otherwise, don't blame me for quitting the club on the spot.

38
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,900
You knew about it?

39
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,220
I have known more than that!

40
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,460
It's Lin Mo, isn't it?

41
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,900
I remembered this guy quite well.

42
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,820
He was late on the first day of my class.

43
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,900
He looked like he did not care and had no manners.

44
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,660
He just pretended to be like that.

45
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,220
In this case,

46
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,780
if Lin Mo made you upset,

47
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,660
I apologize for his behaviors.

48
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,660
And....

49
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,180
Because something comes up recently in the music club.

50
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,660
So,

51
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,340
sister,

52
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,180
you have to do me this favor!

53
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,140
Help them just like the way you helped me.

54
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,700
That would cheer them up in no time.

55
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,260
Don't call me your sister.

56
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,660
I would not do something

57
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,500
this troublesome.

58
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,180
How about

59
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,660
I meet one of your conditions

60
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,020
if you agree to help.

61
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,660
Any conditions?

62
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,420
Any condition.

63
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,340
Yes.

64
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,380
Brother,

65
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,580
you have come back.

66
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,380
Brother,

67
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,300
Luoluo's show is on,

68
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,380
do you want to go outside and watch?

69
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,300
No.

70
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,820
You may leave.

71
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,740
You don't want this poster anymore?

72
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,100
Give it to me if you don't want it.

73
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,700
Damn,

74
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,460
go go go,

75
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,500
leave me alone!

76
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,380
Good morning master.

77
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,020
Good morning, morning.

78
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,540
Even the staff of the shcool is this handsome.

79
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,659
No way,

80
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,659
I need to go back to the training team.

81
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,340
Ugh,

82
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,460
When can I get the prominent teacher award?

83
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,180
[Shame]

84
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,540
Is it prominent teacher award?

85
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,060
Here it is.

86
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,340
Quite a task for Ms. Qian.

87
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,060
Well,

88
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,460
it takes some effort to earn

89
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,900
the pominent teacher award.

90
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,580
Ms. Qian.

91
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,020
Yes?

92
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,580
You have won the pominent teacher award?

93
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,100
Right.

94
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,340
May I ask

95
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,820
how to get the pominent teacher award?

96
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,380
You scared me.

97
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,420
Our school stresses the importance of

98
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,740
credits.

99
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,780
Different kinds of work gets different

100
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,020
credits.

101
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,420
Only if you can earn enough

102
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:40,860
credits.

103
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,340
Credits?

104
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,740
How do we get more credits?

105
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,300
You can publish articles,

106
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,180
cover classes for other teachers,

107
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,700
or lead students to participate the Mathematical Olympiad.

108
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,180
Leading any club might also works.

109
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,659
Right.

110
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,780
It's okay to be an advisor of the clubs.

111
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,460
Advisor of the clubs?

112
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,260
Come in.

113
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,420
Director.

114
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,780
I want to file an application for the position of advisor for music club.

115
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,380
What?

116
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,260
The music club will be dismissed by the end of this semester.

117
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,940
What are you thinking?

118
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,060
Me....

119
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,740
I....

120
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,420
Actually music was my dream since childhood which

121
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,860
was held back from physical trainings.

122
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,860
I saw their performance that day,

123
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,140
just like I saw the old me.

124
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,300
I saw they made the dream come true for me.

125
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,340
Oh dear,

126
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,220
in my heart,

127
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,560
I was delighted.

128
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,900
I was excited.

129
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,100
I felt my whole life was fulfilled.

130
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,260
He Luoyi,

131
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,540
it is good for young people to have dreams.

132
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,140
But let me tell you, He Luoyi.

133
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,780
Kids are tough to lead recently.

134
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,900
They are going through a period of rebelling.

135
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,260
I can understand how they feel.

136
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,180
In any case,

137
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,420
I also went through that period of time.

138
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,460
I believe I can help them.

139
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,660
I promise you,

140
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,260
I can lead the music club well.

141
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,940
Shall we try?

142
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,060
Thank you, director!

143
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,260
Well,

144
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,660
director,

145
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,340
I want to ask that

146
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,780
I heard

147
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,620
being an advisor of clubs can help to earn pominent teacher award right?

148
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,740
That's one of the way to get the pominent teacher award.

149
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,940
Great!

150
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,299
Thank you, director!

151
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,179
Bye, director!

152
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,860
He Luoyi!

153
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,740
Watch out for rules of the school.

154
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,540
I am just an average young talented athelet.

155
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,380
How can I lead the music club?

156
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,700
Oh lord,

157
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,420
the life has taken its toll on me.

158
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,980
Can I guide these kids well?

159
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,540
Girl,

160
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,500
everything happens for a reason.

161
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,180
It's you, master!

162
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,940
Sigh,

163
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,980
you would not understand my worries.

164
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,500
I envy you,

165
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,620
being a staff of the school would not have this much of things to worry about.

166
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,460
You are not me,

167
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,460
you don't know if I understand your sufferings or not.

168
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,180
You are not me,

169
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,940
you don't know my sufferings either.

170
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,980
There are surely a lot of hidden talented people in Yian Middle School.

[Rehearsal Room 4]

172
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,500
He Luoyi,

173
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,700
you can do it!

174
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,500
Come on!

175
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,140
Ms. He.

176
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,700
Why are you here?

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,820
I am here to surprise you.

178
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,860
What is it?

179
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,620
I am going to become your new advisor for the club!

180
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,740
A physical education teacher comes to lead our music club.

181
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,260
What is it?

182
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,060
Leading us to throw javelins?

183
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,020
Lin Mo,

184
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,340
I cannot help you anything on music,

185
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,020
but

186
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,060
I can help you to solve all the problems

187
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,740
when you have any.

188
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,020
No matter what difficulties you encounter,

189
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,260
I'll face them together with you!

190
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,700
Face them together with us?

191
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,780
You're so strong?

192
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,420
So why don't you work as a drudge?

193
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,660
Lin Mo!

194
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,980
That brat…

195
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,380
Sorry, Miss He.

196
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,140
I'll go check his condition.

197
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,580
Well,

198
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,060
sorry, Miss He.

199
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,500
You can see the status quo of our music club.

200
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,460
We're the only three left.

201
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,860
That's interesting.

202
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,900
Lin Mo made the mistake, and the three of you apologized one after another.

203
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,860
Three?

204
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,620
Who else except Chi Yi and me?

205
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,740
No one…

206
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,140
Only three of you are left here?

207
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,980
According to the rules,

208
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,020
a club shall disband only if they have less than five people at the end of the term.

209
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,540
It's still early now.

210
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,020
Why don't you recruit someone?

211
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,020
Miss He,

212
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,740
we will if we can.

213
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,540
In the last year,

214
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,860
the application forms were abundant.

215
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,580
But now,

216
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,780
everyone thought we were a shame of our school.

217
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,900
The way they look at us just show

218
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,860
that they hope to see us disband.

219
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,660
Now that no one's willing to come, then just take the initiative to recruit!

220
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,540
I believe

221
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,540
we can find another two members

222
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,860
in such a big campus to join our music club!

223
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,180
Do you still remember

224
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,740
how you cajoled me into joining the music club from the football field?

225
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,820
Of course I do.

226
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,140
There were only Luoluo and I in the music club back then.

227
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,460
To take in enough members,

228
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,540
we really tried everything.

229
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,420
The situation now resembles it a lot, right?

230
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,660
Now we even have one more member.

231
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,900
Or,

232
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,660
let's try to enroll another two members?

233
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,180
It's because we met you, a little fool.

234
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,620
The music club now

235
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,700
has already been a joke to them.

236
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,300
What's worse,

237
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,500
Luoluo also left.

238
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,660
Lin Mo,

239
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,540
you're the president of the music club now!

240
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,140
Luoluo has left,

241
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,980
but the spirit of our club is still here.

242
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,860
Now everyone wants to laugh at us.

243
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,060
Do you want to give up and just see them do it?

244
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,180
We must fight back!

245
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,970
Knowledge Building

246
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,100
Miss He,

247
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,860
What are these for?

248
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,220
Aren't we going to recruit members?

249
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,300
These are the information of every student in our school.

250
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,500
I believe

251
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,980
we can find two more members!

252
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,340
Get it started.

253
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,940
This Wu Yinyue

254
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,500
sounds pretty good.

255
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,660
Not him.

256
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,260
His singing and dancing

257
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,220
are both awful.

258
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,780
Totally different from what his name indicates.

259
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,300
Alright.

260
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,780
This one…

261
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,540
Zhao Wenyu.

262
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,340
He's also not suitable.

263
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,820
Stop beating a dead horse there.

264
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:42,480
Flash Mob
Yi'an Music Club

265
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,980
Flash mob?

266
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,860
Nice idea!

267
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:49,270
School Culture
Core Socialist Values

268
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,220
As for the places to send them out,

269
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,660
you could go to the library,

270
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,420
and I'll be in the teaching buildings.

271
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,500
Lin Mo,

272
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,900
we're here to help.

273
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,300
This is my friend, Yan Ke.

274
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,540
Okay…

275
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,420
Hello,

276
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,740
please have a look at our music club's flash mob activity.

277
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,060
Thank you.

278
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,100
Hello,

279
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,700
this is the music club's flash mob activity.

280
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:16,900
Hello,

281
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,540
this is our music club's flash mob activity.

282
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,260
Have a look, please.

283
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:18,820
Thanks.

284
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:19,940
This is our flash mob activity.

285
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,420
Please have a look.

286
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,980
Thank you.

287
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,540
Hello…

288
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,060
Check it, please.

289
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,620
Thank you.

290
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:24,860
Hello…

291
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,420
Please have a look

292
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,500
at the latest activity of Yi'an Music Club.

293
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,460
Yi'an Music Club?

294
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,820
Isn't it a trash club?

295
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,580
Why are you giving out these leaflets?

296
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,660
Yan Ke!

297
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,940
Stop it…

298
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,300
Hello,

299
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,700
this is our flash mob activity.

300
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,180
Have a look at it.

301
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,820
Alas,

302
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,100
still not efficient.

303
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,180
♫ The youth melody ♫

304
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,700
♫ Echoes in the sky. ♫

305
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,940
♫ One day I will ♫

306
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,180
Hello everyone.

307
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,660
After a busy week,

308
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,580
do you need a good rest?

309
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,700
The music club will hold an excellent flash mob activity

310
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,300
in the courtyard of the teaching buildings at 5: 30 pm.

311
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,180
Surprise is waiting for you.

312
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,300
Look forward to see you there.

313
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,780
Isn't there a performance?

314
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,780
Where are they?

315
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
The point of the flash mob is surprise.

316
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,900
Stop nagging since you know nothing about it.

317
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,500
I know!

318
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,300
Everyone! Our music club is now recruiting members!

319
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,300
We need fresh blood!

320
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,700
Come and join us!

321
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,260
Come on.

322
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,940
Those who are interested in it can come here to get application forms.

323
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,380
Fill in them right away

324
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,620
and you can seize the chance!

325
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,380
Follow me!

326
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,300
I want it!

327
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:11,740
Come on.

328
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,460
This is the application form.

329
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,860
Take pens to fill in by yourselves.

330
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,260
Hello!

331
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,220
Hello.

332
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,020
Are you interested in joining our Yi'an Music Club?

333
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,430
Come here for promotion.

334
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:32,900
Come on.

335
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,820
- Yu Muyang, 
- Let's go.

336
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,740
- The flash mob is over. Why are you still here?
- Send out more.

337
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,060
None of your business.

338
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,060
Do you want to join our music club?

339
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:47,860
No.

340
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,300
I do.

341
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm Yu Muyang.

342
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,500
Great!

343
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:54,980
Let's go!

344
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,260
Fill in the application form there.

345
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,140
How's it,

346
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,900
President Fu?

347
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,140
Have a look at our music club?

Dean,

350
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,420
I want to be the president of Xinsheng Club.

351
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,300
Really?

352
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,020
It's so good to see you accept it.

353
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,580
Don't worry.

354
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,900
I'll go report it to the principal right away.

355
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,300
Let us know

356
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,620
if you need anything.

357
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,860
We'll try to fulfill your requirements.

358
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,740
Then,

359
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,300
can I get a name list of our students talented in music?

360
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,300
I've already prepared it for you.

361
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,140
Thank you, sir.

362
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,260
How's it going with your management?

363
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,620
Check these, Miss He.

364
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,700
So few of them.

365
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,660
That's all.

366
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,820
Alright.

367
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,860
Have a look at them.

Miss He,

369
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,620
when I gave out leaflets today,

370
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,300
I heard there seemed to be a newly-established Xinsheng Club.

371
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,540
I heard that they're taking our place at

372
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,620
the national competition. Is that true?

373
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,700
Not exactly.

374
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
Director Chen said that

375
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,340
both of the two clubs can compete for

376
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,780
the game places fairly.

377
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,620

Yan Ke?

380
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,860
Why did you refuse his interview application?

381
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,540
Didn't he perform well today?

382
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,940
Our club can't accept such troublemakers anymore.

383
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,620
I saw him fight with other people today.

384
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,460
Did you see the wounds on his face?

385
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,220
We can't accept him.

386
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,820
The interview should be equitable,

387
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,940
we'd better decide after his interview tomorrow.

388
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,460
Take it.

389
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,700
All right.

390
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,220
Today's pop-up activity was really successful

on the stage over there?

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,420

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,570
I have explained this to you before.

521
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,030
You should give him one more chance.

522
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,330
That's OK,

523
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,260
take it easy.

524
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,560
Our school formed Xinsheng Club,

525
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,180
and I'm the president.

526
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,840
All of our members have music specialties.

527
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,470
I leave a place for you.

528
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,990
I hope that you can join us.

529
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,110
Lin Mo's club is not suitable for you.

530
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,950
It's my own business.

531
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,120
Are you still playing YO-YO?

532
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,330
What I'm playing is

533
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,350
none of your business.

534
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,020
It was me who taught you how to play YO-YO.

535
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,840
I remember the first time...

536
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,320
Why?

537
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,910
Why do you think everything I do

538
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,450
is related to you?

539
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,660
Yu Muyang,

540
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,290
if you really love music in your heart,

541
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,480
Xinsheng Club is a better choice than the 
almost dissolved Yi'an Music Club.

542
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,290
You can't decide which is the better one.

543
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,540
What's the matter?

544
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,200
Why are you so frustrated today?

545
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,620
Come on, drink some water.

546
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,740
Besides Yu Muyang,

547
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,800
our club still has a vacant place.

548
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,580
We asked all the students we wanted,

549
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,810
but none of them wanted to join us.

550
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,590
Students that you wanted?

551
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,240
Let me see.

552
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,940
Have they been enrolled

553
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,890
in the Xinsheng Club?

554
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,260
[Concert Tour · A Date With You]

555
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,470
What's this?

556
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,410
Tickets to my concert next week,

557
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,940
Chi Yi asked me for them before.

558
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,240
You are their teacher,

559
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,770
so you can give them passingly.

560
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,450
You are so kind.

561
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,420
-Of course!
-OK.

562
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,260
Then I'll give them tickets.

563
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:58,870
Huh?

564
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,510
Why is there an additional one?

565
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,490
That's for my...

566
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,980
...future brother-in-law.

567
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,560
Well, you must take them

568
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,410
to my concert.

569
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,030
Do you want to be spanked?

570
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,730
Stop!
