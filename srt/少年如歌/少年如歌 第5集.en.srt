He wants me to compete in man's over 45-kg boxing,

280
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,580

Just put it there, Ms. He.

320

Then I'll leave.

One kilo heavier than before.

324
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,420

325

Again!

Again!

332
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,380
I'm exhausted!

333
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,700
You can only rest for 20 minutes.

What's wrong?

339

Mr. Li,

340
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,260
Are you... okay recently?

341
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,500
I'm fine.

342
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,940
What's the matter, Ms. He?

343
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,860
Why do I feel that

344
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,500
you are avoiding me these days?

345
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,740
Avoid, avoiding...

346
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,860
That's impossible.

347
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,940
Maybe I'm too...

348
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,460
I'm too busy recently, Ms. He!

349

I have too many classes.

Are you coming to the bilology lab for other things?

351
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,660
Didn't you say

352
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,060
you were going to help those kids with their tutoring?

353
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,620
Yes.

354
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,180
I think the midterm exams are getting closer and closer.

Can you start earlier?

How about tonight?

Yeah, I've informed them.

They'll be here tonight.

362
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,380
My brother said he wants you

363
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,940
to go to the biology classroom tonight at 7:00 for tutoring.

364
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,580
Let me go to the club first.

365
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,900
Don't be late!

366
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,300
My brother will scold me to death if you are late!

367
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,150
Before tutoring,

368
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:10,940
students,

369
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,500
I need to know your weak subjects.

370
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,860
And according to the weak subjects

371
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,740
to make the appropriate study plan.

372
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,900
So you have to tell me

373
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,740
which subjects you are not learning well.

374
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,340
We will go by focus to cram those.

375
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,860
In this way, you will have more room for improvement.

376
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,700
Teacher.

377
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,740
I'm not very good at math,

378
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,300
and physics.

379
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,540
Usually, I can't get a score for the last big question.

380
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,700
For me, all the subjects were pretty average

381
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,260
except for language and English.

382
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,340
My greatest strength is that I am not biased.

383
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,300
Anyway, if it's going to be worse, it's going to be worse together.

384
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,140
I just started my first year of high school,

385
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,980
and I'm struggling with every subject.

386
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,710
It is more normal for Lin Xuanhao to be like this.

387
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,980
It's okay.

388
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,140
How about you, Yu Muyang?

389
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,660
I am poor in science.

390
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,920
OK.

391
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,140
Then we will start with math today.

392

Let's take out the test papers first.

393

Let's spend thirty minutes doing multiple choice questions.

Does Yan Ke come or not?

395
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,220
Did you inform him for me?

396
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,380
I made sure I informed him.

397
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,620
I'm sorry.

398
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,070
I took the javelin by accident.

399
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,340
But you do not pay too much attention to it.

OK.

The few inks in my belly told me that
