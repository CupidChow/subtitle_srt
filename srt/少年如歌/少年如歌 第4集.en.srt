1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,090
Youth Melody

3
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,020
Episode Four

4
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,420
For the Music Club at present

5
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,100
Yan Ke is of really great help

6
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,380
I don't mean that Lin Xuanhao doesn't perform well

7
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,620
Yet Yan Ke is really excellent in all aspects

8
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,700
and there is nothing to be particular about

9
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,140
Why didn't you allow him to join us?

10
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,539
Yeah Lin Mo

11
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:46,500
Of course I'm not boasting about my sixth sense

12
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,940
but I think you're always avoiding the problems

13
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,780
Lin Mo

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,580
Please speak out if you have any worries

15
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,979
Chi Yi, you asked me before

16
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,020
whether it's Luoluo

17
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,540
who has taken away the spirit of the Music Club

18
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,100
Now I know that

19
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,259
the spirit of the club never lies in a certain person

20
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,340
but consists in everyone who would like to shoulder the dream of the club

21
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,460
and join hands to strive for a better stage

22
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,460
Doesn't Yan Ke agree with our requirements?

23
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,900
He is too impulsive

24
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,940
and likes solve problems with his fists

25
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,570
Right?

26
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,540
But he doesn't behave like this at ordinary times

27
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,020
In terms of impulsiveness

28
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,060
I've been suffering a lot

29
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,980
There must be no such uncertainty for our music club

30
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,100
I hope that you can think it over, Lin Mo

31
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:44,300
You've never had any real contact with him

32
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,420
Just give him an opportunity

33
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,340
Well I'll get some water for you

34
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,860
Go ahead with your rehearsal

35
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,780
But we don't have any chance for trial and error

36
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,060
Let's rehearse

37
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,500
Now the rehearsal room belongs to Xinsheng Club

38
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,860
Just pack up your stuff and go away

39
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,060
What's that?

40
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,420
My eyesight is too poor to see clearly

41
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,579
It's a notice published by our school

42
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,020
Why?

43
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,340
We've used this classroom for a long time

44
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,180
You want to use just this light piece of paper

45
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,180
to snatch the classroom from us

46
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,900
No no

47
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,220
Look at the big mirror in front of you

48
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,860
Except for my incomparable charm

49
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
as well as the Music Club

50
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,500
Who will it be interested in?

51
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,060
We've used this classroom for a long time

52
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,900
Why shall we transfer it to you?

53
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,260
Just come to me if you have any trouble

54
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,500
Why do you snatch our rehearsal room?

55
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,540
This is not snatching

56
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,020
The Xinsheng Club was established for the national talent competition

57
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,780
So we can use anything of the best quality at school

58
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,580
We're also for the national competition

59
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,420
Only the most excellent club can represent our school to take part in the national competition

60
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,060
Can you represent our school?

61
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,020
Yeah

62
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,580
The Music Club has been a thing of the past

63
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,700
Do you think that it's still

64
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,460
the Music Club which once got first place in the whole city?

65
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,659
Although our  Xinsheng Club was newly established

66
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,340
all the members are very excellent

67
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,020
We're different from some clubs which has had no team spirit

68
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,060
and has been messing around

69
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,940
Who has no team spirit? Who messes around?

70
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,340
A thing of the past?

71
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,500
I'll show you what is a thing of the present

72
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,740
Dare you compete with us, Fu Yunzhe?

73
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,380
The most excellent club shall be voted by

74
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,340
all students at our school

75
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,780
Such comment can't be

76
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,540
made simply by talking with your mouth

77
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,420
My great pleasure

78
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,020
Okay! At School Hall,

79
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,260
We'll wait for you

80
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,580
Do you know what happened?

81
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,140
It's a competition. They're asking for trouble!

82
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,700
There's a competition between Music Club and  Xinsheng Club

83
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,500
Let's watch together

84
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,340
Where?

85
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,820
At School Hall

86
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,740
What competition takes place so abruptly?

87
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,700
I heard that they'll compete for the rehearsal room

88
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,659
Never mind. Let's go and watch!

89
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,860
Let's go!

90
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,180
I've found you at last

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,700
Oh! How nervous I am!

92
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,900
What's wrong with you?

93
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,700
I created the dance for the Music Club

94
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,020
Don't drag me behind

95
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,140
There is a competition between the Music Club and  Xinsheng Club

96
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,540
Will the Music Club compete?

97
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,340
I haven't joined the Music Club

98
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,660
Why will the club take part in a competition?

99
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,860
Hurry up

100
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,620
Will it be able to win without us?

101
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,860
Hurry up

102
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,860
The Music Club

103
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,980
will battle with  Xinsheng Club

104
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,290
We'll battle two rounds of competition

105
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,580
We'll dance in the first round

106
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,700
and sing in the second round

107
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,580
We'll decide on the winner based on whom they'll yell for

108
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,500
The club which gets louder sound will win

109
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,060
Do you agree?

110
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,740
Okay

111
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,380
After you

112
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,340
Let's decide by tossing a coin

113
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,100
Number or flower?

114
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,500
Flower

115
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,300
You perform first

116
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,380
Come on

117
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,140
Do you guess who will win?

118
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,580
Xinsheng Club, of course

119
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,740
The Music Club will certainly win

120
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,140
Brother Lin Mo performs best

121
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,220
He Luoluo has left and the Music Club has collapsed

122
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,260
Unlike  Xinsheng Club

123
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,580
it's the official club at school

124
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,140
which is led by the President of Students' Union

125
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,180
The members all have exceptional ability

126
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,540
Forget about it! Did you ever see that?

127
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,820
Come on

128
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,000
Come on

129
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,110
Come on

130
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,100
Don't worry

131
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,340
Dance as you do normally

132
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,620
I believe in you

133
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,180
Fu Yunzhe Fu Yunzhe

134
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,860
Just so so

135
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,140
We'll beat them in a single second

136
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,500
I know they'll make a mistake

137
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,340
Don't you know that it's not allowed to run and fight on stairs?

138
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,180
Okay, Director

139
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,060
When does the competition between the Music Club

140
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,820
and  Xinsheng Club start?

141
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,900
It must begin now

142
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:06,740
It's very far from here

143
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,100
Hurry up

144
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,740
At least we'll see who wins

145
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,900
Competition?

146
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,740
Isn't the School Hall being decorated?

147
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,540
What happened?

148
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,060
Did they get into trouble again?

149
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,060
Fu Yunzhe Fu Yunzhe

150
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,580
Xinsheng Club Fu Yunzhe

151
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,020
Let's start voting

152
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,020
Music Club Music Club

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,900

156
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,260
Okay

157
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,460
You won this round

158
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,420
You perform first next round

159
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:34,660
Okay

160
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,020
It's OK. You just have a rest

161
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,980
We'll perform this round

162
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,620
Fighting

163
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,580
Why is it dark?
-What happened?

164
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,380
Why, the electricity is off!

165
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
He Luoyi

166
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,140
Who allowed to compete with teammates without permission?

167
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,380
It should be fair to recommend who to take part in the competition

168
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,980
I have the right to be recommended

169
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,460
You're totally messing around

170
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,500
Whether you win or lose

171
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,180
won't represent you real capability

172
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,500
Without any sense of team or discipline

173
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,020
How can you become an excellent player?

174
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,620
I have capability to take part in the competition

175
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,740
and get a medal

176
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,620
If you don't arrange for me to take part in the competition

177
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,980
then that'll be unfair

178
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,140
I know you feel wronged

179
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,540
But I have tried to strive and coordinate for you

180
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,100
Can't you wait for a moment?

181
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,740
Music Club

182
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,340
Stop

183
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,780
Stop

184
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:32,700
Lin Mo

185
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,300
What are you doing here?

186
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,860
Which class are you in?

187
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Go to your classes!

188
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,300
Let's go

189
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,860
Take care!

190
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,380
Come down from the stage!

191
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:55,980
And you!

192
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Who stirred up this trouble here?

193
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,580
It was Lin Mo who stirred up this trouble, Director

194
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,380
They came here to snatch our classroom

195
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,740
Keep quiet!

196
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,580
Who allowed you to use the School Hall without any permission?

197
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,620
Don't you know the School Hall is being decorated?

198
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,300
And you! Ms. He!

199
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,900
How did you promise you?

200
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,860
You promised me faithfully

201
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,300
that you could handle Yi'an Music Club

202
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,380
Are you handling the club in this way?

203
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,020
They just want to keep their own rehearsal room, Director

204
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,180
Keep their own rehearsal room?

205
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,020
It should have been arranged by our school

206
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,220
What are you doing here?

207
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,260
Are you starting a revolt here?

208
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,900
Call your parents  to come here tomorrow

209
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,740
It won't matter if their parents don't come here

210
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,620
I'll be in full charge of this matter

211
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,700
How can you be in full charge of?

212
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,540
If there were really something wrong

213
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,340
how could you take the responsibility?

214
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,180
From now on

215
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,460
You'll be suspended from your duties and have to review this matter

216
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,220
Please don't dismiss Ms. He, Director

217
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,380
All this matter

218
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,700
was organized by ourselves without any permission

219
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,060
There was nothing to do with Ms. He

220
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,900
Just punish us if you want to punish someone

221
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,380
You can punish us as you like

222
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,900
Are you becoming bad-tempered?

223
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,340
You're always so active to make trouble

224
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,580
Don't you know that you should put study first?

225
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,340
Now you're bargaining with me?

226
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,020
We can also put study first

227
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,700
For this mid-term exam,

228
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,620
we promise that we'll be in the top 100 of our grade

229
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,660
What are you saying?

230
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,740
For this mid-term exam,

231
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
we promise that we'll be in the top 100 of our grade

232
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,740
You mean that

233
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,250
you can be in top 100 of your grade?

234
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,540
Yeah

235
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,100
Director Chen

236
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,820
Shut up!

237
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,700
Good morning, President!

238
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,620
Good morning, President!

239
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,460
I'm rebuking them, President

240
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,460
Such naughty kids

241
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,620
dare to use the School Hall without any permission?

242
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,060
I've heard about that

243
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,780
And Ms. He

244
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,340
You're spoiling these children too much!

245
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,860
You

246
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,530
You're President?

247
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,380
Lin Mo

248
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
What activity did you organize?

249
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,980
We organized a competition with Xinsheng Club

250
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,700
I've heard all about

251
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,540
your conversation just now

252
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,220
President

253
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,300
It's really our fault this time

254
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,820
Ms. He was just got into trouble by us

255
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,620
Please don't dismiss Ms. He

256
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,100
We'll prove that

257
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,660
with the guidance of Ms. He, Music Club

258
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,380
will be better and better

259
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,140
Better and better?

260
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,300
Including your grade?

261
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,860
Yeah! Including our grade

262
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,420
Such being the case

263
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,540
Director Chen

264
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,140
I mean that we just agree with their terms

265
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,380
If all members in Music Club

266
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,820
can be in top 100 of the grade

267
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,300
this mid-term exam

268
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,100
Ms. He

269
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,500
will continue to work here

270
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,300
Your rehearsal room will also

271
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,260
be arranged

272
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,660
But anyone who doesn't enter the top 100

273
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,860
will quit the club by himself

274
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,340
Will you accept?

275
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,620
Yes

276
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:50,930
Okay

277
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,020
This mid-term exam

278
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,140
we promise that we'll be in top 100 of the grade

279
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,460
That's right

280
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,060
We'll never allow Ms. He to be dismissed

281
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,980
But President,

282
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,900
Since Music Club has been punished

283
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,500
Will Xinsheng Club

284
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
also be punished?

285
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,579
Yeah! Xinsheng Club

286
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,579
should also be responsible for this matter

287
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,260
Forget it! Mind your own business!

288
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,500
For misbehavior  today,

289
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,740
both sides should shoulder responsibility

290
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,579
Well, stay here to finish your review after school

291
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,579
Everyone should write at least 2,000 words

292
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,140
And in this way you'll also learn a lesson

293
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:27,980
Director Chen

294
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,900
Please treat them fairly

295
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,300
Since you'll be treated fairly

296
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,220
you should finish your review in time

297
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,580
and at the same time work hard every day

298
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,700
to become the backbone of our nation in the future

299
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,740
Are you clear?

300
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,540
Yeah

301
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,620
Come on! I have something to talk with you!

302
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,380
Review!

303
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,460
Look at yourselves! Just suffer from your own actions!

304
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,180
Go back to finish your review

305
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,660
Are you Okay with that?

306
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,900
No problem

307
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,380
We have the absolute strength

308
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,140
to be in top 100 of the grade. That's a piece of cake

309
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,660
Let's go

310
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,620
There's no point of getting them into trouble

311
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,740
They're all top students at school

312
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,940
I was ignorant about that

313
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,100
It doesn't matter

314
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,740
I can help you with your study

315
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,740
Heh heh heh

316
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,660
You?

317
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,740
Do you have any doubts?

318
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,020
Come in please

319
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
You are watering flowers, President?

320
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,260
En

321
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,900
For this matter today,

322
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,940
does that work?

323
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,340
Will that really cheer them up?

324
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,260
Take it easy

325
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,620
Isn't it a good start today?

326
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,220
Just take your time

327
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,020
Like this plant

328
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,900
You see

329
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,540
As long as the root grows well

330
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,180
we just cut off those withered

331
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,700
and ensure it to grow better

332
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:28,930
But

333
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,780
We can't pull up seedlings to help them grow

334
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,700
Let's just wait and see

335
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,900
How about this?

336
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,820
Isn't it more beautiful after being trimmed?

337
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,580
Yeah! You're right!

338
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,820
Of course

339
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,620
We also need a good gardener

340
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,740
Sorry sorry

341
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,820
Why are you so late?

342
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,940
Yeah

343
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,060
Luoluo's vocal concert is about to begin

344
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,780
I just came out of Director's Office

345
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,580
I was bothered by the review that we have to finish

346
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,500
so I just forgot about it

347
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Let's go

348
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,290
-Hurry up
-Let's go

349
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's go

350
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,900
I feel there's not a big gap between me and Lin Mo

351
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,500
Hi Mr. Li

352
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,580
Why are there so many mosquitoes?

353
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,260
Mr. Li

354
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,340
You are so fashionable today

355
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,940
I feel that you can debut in the center of the stage

356
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,180
Yeah Mr. Li

357
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,340
You dance just now was also really nice

358
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,300
There are many mosquitoes

359
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,060
Aren't we fashionable to watch vocal concert?

360
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,140
We're going to watch a vocal concert

361
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,540
Let's go

362
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,260
He Luoluo's vocal concert has begun

363
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:42,820
Okay

364
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:45,780
Thanks

365
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,020
Oh so cool

366
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,580
Ms. He

367
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,940
How long will it take to get there?

368
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,220
It says that we should enter 30 minutes before it starts

369
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,900
We might not arrive there on time

370
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,380
Sorry Mr. Li

371
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,700
They're too expectant for He Luoluo's vocal concert

372
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,860
I see

373
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,500
Oh Ms. He

374
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,060
I heard that they promised

375
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,500
to be in top 100 of their grade

376
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,500
Wow Mr. Li

377
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
You even heard about this matter

378
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,460
Are you confident in achieving that?

379
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,140
There's no problem with Chi Yi and Sun Yihang

380
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,500
I'm the least possible to make it

381
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,780
If necessary

382
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,020
I can help you with your study

383
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,860
Really? Mr. Li

384
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,780
Thank you so much

385
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,300
But it seems that we can only improve biology

386
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,260
It's not enough

387
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,780
That's right

388
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,420
That would be better if we could improve math

389
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,900
Of course

390
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,740
Who told you that biology teacher can only teach biology?

391
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,260
After all, I'm the top student in science of our city

392
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,260
Mr. Li

393
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,700
You're a super scholar

394

and the top student of your city

Maybe I can never go after you successfully

397
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,970
Actually it's not difficult to go after me, Ms. He

398
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,340
Open the door

Yeah

415

We're in the first row of VIP seats

416

It's not allowed even for VIP seats

Forget it! We just stay here

After Luoluo finishes performing

he must come out of here

Let's go

427
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,060
Is the sound Luoluo's?

428
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,540
It sounds like his

429
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,620
but to some degree it doesn't sound like his

430
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,580
They seem to be very disappointed

431
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,420
Yeah

432
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,060
It has been a long time since they met Luoluo last time

433
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,180
For them Luoluo

434
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,340
is very special

435
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,340
There is a deep affection between them

436
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,540
Well

437
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,260
Is there such a person for you?

438
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,300
Ah what?

439
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,300
I mean a person who has a deep affection with you

440
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,420
and who is very special to you

441

As for something else

444
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,900
it seems that I've never thought about that

445
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,620
Has the vocal concert come to an end?

446

Does it come to an end?

It doesn't matter

00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,620
I call Luoluo first

457

to see whether we can meet him

00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,820
We're farther and farther from him

512
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,260
So we must work harder to catch up with him

513
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,140
Now Luoluo has been running forward

514
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,900
We should not be here to stay

515
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,740
and we should be more dedicated

516
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,860
and work much harder

517
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:24,780
Right?

518
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,260
En

519
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,460
Why do I feel that you robbed my lines?

520
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,580
You look so sad, so I just help you speak out

521
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,300
-Fighting\-Fighting

522
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,700
Music Club! So brilliant!

523
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,530
Brilliant!

524
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,250
Brilliant!

525
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,700
I want to ask you for a favor

526
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,180
to take the place of our member

527
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,460
and help us to perform the opening show

528
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,940
Are you joking?

529
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,340
We're boys

530
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,380
Boys

531
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,220
It doesn't matter

532
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,180
We have costumes

533
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,820
It feels a little exciting
