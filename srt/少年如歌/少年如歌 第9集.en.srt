Sun Yihang.

5
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,100
What is your situation now?

6
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:32,740
Are you really going abroad?

7
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,420
Is there any possibility that you don't go?

8
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,460
Can you still participate in

9

the competition with us this time?

10
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,060
Perhaps, I can't.

11
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,479
My mom hopes I can go there as soon as possible
to get used to the environment.

Would you just send us a message

Lin Mo,

19
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,579
I was going to tell you at that time.

20
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,579
But at that time I asked you

21
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,420
whether you would accompany the music club
till its last minute,

22
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,660
what did you say back then?

23
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,020
Aren't you curious about

24
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,020
what it will become next

25
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,460
or what it will become eventually?

26
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,980
Will you accompany the music club
till its last minute?

27
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,180
I will.

28
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,660
You already knew.

29
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,500
You already made your decision.

30
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,940
After all the things we've been through,

31
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,550
how could you treat me like this?

32
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,420
Can you say something or not?

33
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,980
Can you give me an explanation?

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,100
I don't know where to start.

35
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,620
You don't know where to start?

36
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,580
You don't know where to start,
so you've kept silent.

37
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,900
You don't know where to start,

38
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,020
so you lied to me that
you would not leave the music club.

39
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,350
You don't know where to start,

40
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,460
so you planned to sneak away.

41
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,620
You want to study abroad.

42

43
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,180
But you lied to us.

44

I didn't mean to do that.

Sun Yihang,

46
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,460
I made a mistake.

47
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,020
For all this time,

48
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,630
I've seen you as my best friend.

49
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,540
But now I find you don't deserve that.

50
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,020
You don't deserve that at all.

51
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,420
Can you stop being so judgmental?

52
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm judgmental?

53
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,579
You'd withdrawn yourself from the school,

54
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,579
but you didn't tell me you were leaving.

55
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:39,730
Now you blame me for being judgmental?

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,170
You treat me like a fool,

57
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,980
and play me as if I were a fool.

58
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,860
You now blame me for being judgmental?

59
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,100
Can you try to understand me a bit?

60
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,900
I didn't want to do that either.

61
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,900
You didn't want to?

62

When you made the decision,

63
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,700
did you think about me?

64
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,060
I knew you would be upset.

Perhaps he didn't mean to act like this.

He probably has his own reasons.

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,460
I will do live streaming for the whole process.

175
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,420
Let's take a look at the rehearsal video.

176
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,140
Every one adjusts yourself.

177
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,660
It's our turn to perform in a moment.

178
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,580
-OK 
 -OK.

179
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,940
You guys had performed in rhythm very well.

180
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,900
When we are on the stage,

181
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,220
just follow the rhythm like this.

182
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,020
OK.

183
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,460
Yan Ke,

184
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,180
you had good condition today.

185
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,020
Just keep it.

186
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,540
Brother Mo,

187
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,220
When you praised me like that,

188
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,620
it seems that

189
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,100
I didn't practise seriously off the stage.

190
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,860
What you've said is just like Sun Yihang's words.

191
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:37,740
Come in.

192
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,780
You two again?

193
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,780
Thanks.

194
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,630
As the president of Lin Mo's global fan club,

195
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,220
and as the vice assistant,

196
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,260
we come here

197
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,260
to bring supporting beverages for our brothers.

198
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,660
This type of tea with milk,

199
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,620
is my favorite.

200
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,660
I bought them especially

201
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,900
to quench your thirst.

202
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,420
Be sure to keep up the good work, my brothers!

203
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,500
We will shout our support from the audience.

204
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,460
By the way,

205
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,820
I want to ask that

206
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,340
how many fans are there in our fan club?

207
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,500
We are the only two in this club.

208
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,620
However, brother Lin Mo,

209
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,580
Don't worry.

210
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,220
When you've finished the performance,

211
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,860
our club will at least be joined by a few more fans.

212
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,060
Yes. Yes. Yes.

213
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,820
Alright, now I won't bother you.

214
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,780
Come on my brothers!

215
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,820
You'll win!

216
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,460
We're leaving now.

217
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,230
Byebye.

218
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,940
Kids are so cute.

219
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,220
Come on,

220
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,820
even for our fans,

221
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,620
we need to work hard.

222
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,740
We can't disappoint our fans who like us very much.

223
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,420
Uh huh.

224
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,900
Even if we only have two fans,

225
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,140
we need to fight for the end for them.

226
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,140
Yes.

227
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,660
To live up to the love of our fans,

228
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,180
cheers.

229
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,380
Cheers.

230
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,900
See? Brother Lin Mo

231
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,940
did drink the tea with milk we gave him.

232
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,300
Yes! Yes! Yes!

233
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,100
It is

234
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,860
my favorite peanut dew milk tea.

235
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,300
Yihang,

236
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
You will leave here very soon.

237
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,820
What is the use for watching their competition?

238
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,300
When we rehearsed,

239
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,140
I saw every one was in a good state.

240
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,620
What's the matter?

241
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,180
Chi Yi!

242
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,820
What's wrong with you, Chi Yi?

243
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,860
Why are your face so red?

244
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,500
-Chi Yi 
 -Chi Yi.

245
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,100
Call the hospital. Hurry up!

246
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,700
Don't move him.

247
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,660
Let's undo his buttons first.

248
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,300
Hello? Is that emergency center?

249
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,150
Someone fell in a faint now.

250
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,100
Pull over!

251
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,660
What's wrong with you?

252
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,300
Chi Yi fell in a faint, I will go back!

253
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,230
Doctors would save him if he fainted.

254
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,620
What is the use for you going back?

255
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Mom, I'm unwilling to go abroad.

256
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,060
I hope that you can respect me.

257
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,940
I'm choosing my own way.

258
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,310
Mom, I'll take responsibility for my choice.

259
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,020
My son, I support you.

260
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,140
What are you doing?

261
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,020
Yihang, come back!

262
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,380
Don't say that.

263
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,700
-Chi Yi 
- be quick,

264
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,190
Chi Yi.

265
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,660
Chi Yi.

266
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:15,780
Chi Yi.

267
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,060
Can you hear me? Chi Yi!

268
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,420
Chi Yi!

269
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,220
What happened?

270
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,140
I have no time to explain, I have to go to the hospital.

271
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,220
It's your turn in a moment.

272
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,980
I really have no time!

273
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,740
Don't you compete?

274
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,500
What about this:

275
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,300
since they have difficulties,

276
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,140
we can switch the order of performances with them.

277
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,180
Just give them some time.

278
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,020
What on earth is wrong with Chi Yi?

279
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,220
He'll be fine.

280
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,620
Yes, doctor,

281
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,540
that's what happened.

282
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,140
he was in good health before,

283
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,140
why did he just collapse

284
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,700
without any signs?

285
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,020
Doctor, save him，

286
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,860
please!

287
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,020
Rest assured, this is what we should do.

288
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,500
Just wait outside for a while.

289
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,380
Thank you.

290
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,580
Hello, who's speaking?

291
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,420
Excuse me,

292
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,860
is that Lin Mo,  president of Yi' an Music Club

293
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,780
speaking?

294
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,070
Yes.

295
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,110
Who is that speaking?

296
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,110
I'm the staff member of the organizer of this competition.

297
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,300
The thing is,

298
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,460
that now is your turn to perform.

299
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,220
However, our member

300
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,100
reported to us that you've encountered unexpected condition.

301
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,060
How soon will you be back, please?

302
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,270
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

303
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,500
We left in such a rush

304
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,740
that we forgot to report to you.

305
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,220
One of our members fell in faint.

306
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,180
Now, he's still not awake.

307
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,620
All of us are in the hospital.

308
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,300
I can't tell when we can go back.

309
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,300
Would you please

310
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,380
buy some time for us?

311
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,740
Well,

312
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,260
we've tried to stall.

313
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,860
You were supposed to be the third team

314
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,980
to perform on the stage.

315
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,020
However, we heard from AKB team that you had gone to the hospital,

316
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,380
and they voluntarily switched the order of performance with you.

317
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,220
Now, you are the last team，

318
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,740
but the game is coming to an end.

319
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,500
If you haven't been back

320
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,460
within half an hour,

321
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,260
then the competition will end.

322
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,460
What if we couldn't go back

323
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,820
within half an hour?

324
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,660
We can wait for you for at most half an hour.

325
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,020
After half an hour,

326
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,220
if you haven't come back yet,

327
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,540
then

328
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,700
your team will be recorded as nil.

329
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:02,620
However,

330
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,339
I suggest that you come back and finish the game first.

331
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,420
Without one member,

332
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,780
you can still perform, right?

333
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,380
Performing with one member missing

334
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,700
is better than being recorded as nil anyways.

335
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,740
I'm sorry.

336
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,339
I have to discuss with my team members.

337
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,020
Chi Yi is our team member.

338
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,819
I can't leave him here.

339
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,380
I agree.

340
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,020
Brother Mo, I listen to you.

341
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,020
Contestant Lin Mo？

342
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,060
Hello？

343
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,500
Contestant Lin Mo？

344
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,140
Hello?

345
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,420
What's your decision?

346
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,940
We...

347
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,140
We default.

348
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,540
Then,

349
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,100
you will be recorded nil.

350
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,220
Yes, we default.

351
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,140
OK.

352
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,660
I got it.

353
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,420
Person who never abandons any team members

354
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,780
is our good president.

355
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,060
It's OK, brother Mo.

356
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,900
Just think about it:

357
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,220
We can prepare for an extra year.

358
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,580
The most important thing is that

359
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,620
we stay together!

360
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,910
Nurse Wang, check No. 15 ward.

361
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,660
OK.

362
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,580
[Emergency Room]

363
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,060
Who is the patient's family?

364
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,100
His parents haven't come yet.

365
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,860
I'm a teacher.

366
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,580
About his condition,

367
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,460
you can tell me directly.

368
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,260
He is all right now.

369
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,580
He was in shock because of allergy to peanut.

370
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,500
I've checked with him in the room that

371
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,020
it's probably because his beverage

372
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,340
includes peanut.

373
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,460
So,

374
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
Now he's all right now.

375
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,380
He will be fine after taking a rest.

376
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,420
However,

377
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,140
you need to pay close attention to what he drinks.

378
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,820
OK, OK. OK.

379
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,980
Can we see him now?

380
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,460
Yes, you can enter the room now,

381
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,140
but don't affect their rest.

382
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,220
Be quiet.

383
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,820
-OK 
- OK.

384
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,700
Clear.

385
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,100
I'm sorry

386
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,660
that I worried you guys.

387
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,140
It's OK

388
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,580
as long as you are fine.

389
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,540
Yes.

390
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,900
You have to pay attention to your food.

391
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,790
We were in a hurry back then,

392
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,660
and I was thirsty.

393
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,700
I didn't notice the content of peanut in the milk tea.

394
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,660
I'll be keenly aware of that next time.

395
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,380
The little chubby,

396
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,820
did bad things with good intention.

397
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,140
I was not careful enough. It's all my fault.

398
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,780
Then,

399
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,580
let's go to the site quickly.

400
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,740
It's our turn to perform, right?

401
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,860
Slow down.

402
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,660
Lie down.

403
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,300
You just woke up,

404
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,540
so your body is weak.

405
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,500
Doctors advised you to take an extra rest.

406
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,300
Take your time.

407
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,780
How can I not be anxious?

408
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,020
What time is it?

409
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,620
Will we still participate the game?

410
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,940
Let's go.

411
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,820
What happened?

412
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,780
When you just fainted,

413
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
we gave up our performance

414
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,820
because we couldn't leave you alone.

415
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,580
Lin Mo,

416
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,940
we've strived for this goal for so long.

417
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,790
Just because of me,

418
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,740
you gave up such a precious chance.

419
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,260
Such a fool.

420
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,140
When we prepare to draw a picture

421
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,060
to show to the whole world,

422
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,460
one color is missing.

423
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,460
Then, is it complete?

424
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,060
Without any color,

425
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,420
It would be no more than an incomplete painting.

426
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,100
Chi Yi, do you understand?

427
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,060
This is what you mean to us.

428
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,460
Chi Yi,

429
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,860
Chi Yi, come out quickly.

430
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,620
Don't cry.

431
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,180
I'm sorry.

432
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,660
It's me getting you into trouble.

433
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,460
It's all because of me.

434
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,820
Chi Yi.

435
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,900
What can we do?

436
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,620
By the way,

437
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,060
we can gain scores online.

438
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,540
We haven't lost yet.

439
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,260
Online score？

440
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,620
Yes, didn't you see the rules?

441
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,500
Chi Yi!

442
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,620
Chi Yi!

443
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,220
Can we really perform online?

444
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,740
The total score of our preliminary session

445
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,540
is the sum of online and live stage scores.

446
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,740
The final ranking is based on the combined score of the two scores

447
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,820
Although we can't perform on the stage now,

448
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,140
as long as our online score

449
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,220
can rank the first,

450
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,340
then we will stand a chance of qualifying for the next round.

451
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,180
However,  we have to score twice as high as other teams

452
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,260
to qualify.

453
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,820
Ms. He,

454
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,580
The odds are almost none.

455
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,500
How would you know if you don't even try it?

456
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,660
Chi Yi, are you OK?

457
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,660
I'm OK.

458
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,340
Sun Yihang,

459
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,340
Why didn't you answer the call?

460
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,780
I'm sorry.

461
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,420
It's all because of my hesitation.

462
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,420
I disappointed you guys.

463
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,500
Lin Mo,

464
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,580
just beat me if you want to,

465
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,900
as long as you can allow me to be back to the music club.

466
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,340
I'm glad that you're back.

467
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,980
Since

468
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,620
every one's here now,

469
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,540
would you like to participate in the game?

470
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,500
Yes.

471
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,780
But we didn't perform.

472
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,700
The audience didn't see our performance, either.

473
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,260
How is it possible for them to vote for us?

474
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,740
we have no live performance.

475
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,460
But it's online voting,

476
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,270
we can still perform online.

477
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,940
Not just our performances,

478
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,780
our real selves,

479
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,580
our solidarity,

480
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,140
and our daily life

481
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,420
can all be presented to our audience.

482
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,660
Yes,

483
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,980
let people see the real music club.

484
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,180
How about

485
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,780
you guys recording the video first,

486
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,220
and me

487
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,940
uploading the video to major websites

488
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,860
to bid for some votes.

489
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,700
And you,

490
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,020
also log in your own social platform to bid for votes.

491
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,660
By doing this, it will be more efficient.

492
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,740
Go for it! Boys!

493
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,860
Go for it! Music Club!

494
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:35,940
How do you feel?

495
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,140
I'm a good editor, right?

496
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,260
See?

497
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,060
I'm a good cameraman, right?

498
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,580
Look,

499
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,540
I'm quite good as the best looking person of the team, right?

500
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,780
How can you brag about yourselves like that!

501
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,100
It's obviously me doing well as the president of our club.

502
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,060
I'm also great as the supporting director.

503
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,980
What kind of team is this?

504
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,900
All the members are so immodest.

505
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,620
The best team!

506
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,060
Lin Mo, my elder brother,

507
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,860
I can't wait to see the voting results.

508
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,700
OK, let's check it out.

509
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,820
The effect is really good.

510
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,620
See our votes.

511
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,580
It keeps going up.

512
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,060
Yeah, the votes rises really fast.

513
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,740
But the votes of other teams

514
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:18,750
[To support the best team in your mind!!!]

515
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,020
also grow steadily.

516
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,540
Yeah.

517
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
So what to do then.

518
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,780
If we can't make a big gap

519
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,180
with other teams,

520
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,220
all those votes mean nothing at all.

521
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,260
If it goes on like this,

522
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,100
we might not make it to the second round.

523
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,380
I have a suggestion.

524
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,260
We can try to use live show

525
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,700
to canvass votes.

526
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,740
That's a good idea.

527
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,380
Shall we do a live show?

528
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,300
Hello everyone.

529
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,660
This is Yi'an Music Club.

530
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,900
Thank you for watching our live show.

531
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,100
You might be wondering

532
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,620
why you didn't see our performance

533
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,780
at the game spot.

534
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,060
Because there was a sudden situation with our members that day.

535
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,300
We chose to be with him.

536
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
Without his performance,

537
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,940
our show was incomplete.

538
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,100
So please forgive us

539
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,020
for the decision we made on the spot.

540
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,300
In order to let everyone

541
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,180
better understand our Yi'an Music Club,

542
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,220
we did an online dance performance specially.

543
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,540
We hope you will enjoy it.

544
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,100
Although the video is not beautiful enough,

545
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,060
we filmed and edited it with our heart.

546
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,940
After watching, I hope everyone

547
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,220
can give Yi'an Music Club

548
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,860
your valuable vote.

549
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,180

551
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,540

Miss Li, do you take a power bank.

569
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,860
My phone is almost out of power.

570
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,460
Did you bring it?

571
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,140
I didn't have my power bank. Is the charging cable okay?

572
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,780
Ok, I'll charge it on my computer.

573
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,580
Shall we go buy them some water?

574
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,300
They have also been on the live show for several hours.

575
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,860
Well, there's nothing we can help,

576
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,500
but it’s okay to do well in logistics.

577
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:50,980
OK, let's go.

578
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,300
Move.

579
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,740
Come on! Come on!

580
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,060
Okay.

[To support the best team in your mind!!!]

What's going on?

583
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,180
The live show is working.

584
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,020
Maybe

585
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,540
they have seen the drop-dead gorgeous me.

586
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,790
Yes yes yes , you are the most handsome man.

587

What's up, Chi Yi.

It's Luo Luo.

591
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,060
Hello everyone.

592
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,860
I’m the member of R1SE , He Luoluo.

593
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,900
The music club of my alma mater

594
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,740
is participating in

595
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,740

Music club

is the club I joined since I was a child.

598
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,820
It's also where my dream started.

599
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,220
But  they gave up the game

600
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,500
because of sending their teammates to the hospital.

601
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
Maybe you will think they are particularly stupid.

602
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,180
But if it were me,

603
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,660
I would have done the same thing.

604
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,620
I am very grateful to everyone.

605
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,660
With your support and accompanying this year,

606
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,700
I joined in R1SE, this team.

607
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,430
I'm also

608
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,060
very grateful for giving me so many chances and stages to perform.

609
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,660
But I hope that they can also

610
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,900
have the opportunity to chase their dreams, just like me.

611
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,660
Now they stand a glimmer of hope,

612
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,020
I hope that you can also cast your precious vote,

613
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,340
and pump them up.

614

619

I've told you that Luoluo didn't forget us.

620

He keeps bidding for votes for us.

621
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,950
We misunderstood him at that time.

622
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,500
Yes.

Now it's the time that they need encouragement most.

626

What's all this about?

Sis Biao, what is your relationship with Brother Luo Luo?

635
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,780
There is no relationship between us.

[He Luoluo]

637

Luo Luo is your younger brother, right?

638
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,580
It seems that I can't hide the truth.

639
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,020
Luo Luo is your younger brother.

640
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,060
What is the point of hiding this fact?

641
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,940
I didn't intend to tell you about it from the start

642
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,700
because I was afraid of troubles

643
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,300
Since the first day I came to Yi'an Music Club,

644
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Luo Luo has urged me to take good care of you.

645
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,910
I was afraid of hurting Lin Mo's self-esteem,

646
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,540
so I didn't tell you.

647
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,420
But now, I'm not worried.

648
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,900
I'm not that fragile, OK?

649
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,140
Sis Biao, if you could actually tell us earlier,

650
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,900
then misunderstanding would be reduced a lot.

651
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,970
