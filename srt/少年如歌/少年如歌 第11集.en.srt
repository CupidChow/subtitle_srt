00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,210
Youth Melody

3
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,380
Episode 11

4
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,020
Where did they go?

5
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,890
Why isn't there anyone around?

6
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,050
No way, I need to go save them.

7
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,490
I need to look for a handy weapon to save them.

8
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,210
Why isn't there any handy weapon?

9
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,729
Bro,

10
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,050
lend me both of your arms.

11
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,210
Good weapon.

12
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,210
Ms. He, I'm coming!

13
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,850
Yan Ke!

14
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,770
Why don't I enter first?

15
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,130
Is that fine?

16
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,410
Go and come back quickly!

17
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,740
Lin Mo.

18
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,490
Say something.

19
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,490
Don't scare me.

20
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,250
Sis Biao.

21
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,130
How was it?

22
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,570
They're not inside.

23
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,900
Not inside?

24
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,450
Let me call someone.

25
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,410
Why isn't there any signal in the library?

26
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,140
It's the exam season.

27
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,970
I think the library installed the signal jammer.

28
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,570
Ah?

29
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,180
Then what do we do?

30
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,970
Then...

31
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,810
Why not...

32
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,010
We leave first?

33
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,730
Alright.

34
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,570
One moment...

35
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,530
Let me turn on the light.

36
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,090
Follow me.

37
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,690
Walk slowly.

38
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,850
Is someone over there?

39
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,970
Yihang, where's Ms. He?

40
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,180
Yihang... Yihang!

41
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:10,850
Yihang, don't scare me!

42
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,090
Oh no...

43
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,330
Yihang, wake up!

44
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:15,980
Yihang!

45
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,250
Don't scare me, Yihang!

46
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,770
He's still breathing.

47
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,050
My white coat will protect you.

48
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,690
I'll come back for you.

49
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,260
Ms. He!

50
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,570
Where are you, Ms. He?

51
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,490
Ms. He!

52
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,490
Chi Yi, follow me!

53
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,250
Don't lose your way.

54
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,330
Sun Yihang!

55
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,170
Sun Yihang!

56
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,010
Oh my, my face!

57
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,850
You got scared by Mr. Li and fainted earlier.

58
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,690
Mr. Li just left.

59
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,530
Let's leave quickly.

60
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,410
Let's go.

61
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,409
Chi Yi,

62
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,930
let's have a look over there.

63
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,570
Follow me closely.

64
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,490
It's me!

65
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,020
Li Mingfan, Li Mingfan.

66
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,450
I borrowed these tools from the biology classroom.

67
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,370
Having a weapon can

68
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,250
protect you.

69
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,490
Gosh... You scared me!

70
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,410
Chi Yi!

71
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,330
Chi Yi?

72
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,530
Chi Yi.

73
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,890
Where's Chi Yi?

74
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,610
You didn't see him?

75
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,410
Chi Yi is not here.

76
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,170
It's only you.

77
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,530
Oh right,

78
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,970
I met Sun Yihang just now.

79
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,530
He disappeared after he fainted.

80
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,770
What happened to Sun Yi Hang...

81
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,370
Wait, no...

82
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,410
Chi Yi was just with me.

83
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,290
You didn't see him?

84
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,010
Ms. He, is there something fishy?

85
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,450
Let's look for them first.

86
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,370
Chi Yi.

87
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,450
Yihang.

88
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:44,970
Yihang.

89
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,570
Chi Yi.

90
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,210
Come out, Yihang.

91
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:49,650
Yihang.

92
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,010
Chi Yi, Chi Yi!

93
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,330
I'll protect you.

94
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,210
Don't worry.

95
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,810
It's gone!

96
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,170
Don't worry.

97
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,930
Don't be afraid.

98
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,450
Don't worry.

99
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,570
Don't come over.

100
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,890
Help!

101
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,370
What are you guys doing?

102
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,210
Lin Mo!

103
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,690
Stop right there!

104
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:28,890
Come here!

105
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,770
I was scared to death.

106
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,490
Do you want to die?

107
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,690
Where are the rest?

108
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,330
What are you guys up to tonight?

109
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,690
You guys created such a big trouble before I leave.

110
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,210
Once I leave, wouldn't things be more undesirable?

111
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,650
Ms. He,

112
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:54,930
don't be mad anymore.

113
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,130
Luckily, these are all fake.

114
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,090
And no one was injured.

115
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,450
Mr. Li, don't speak on their behalf.

116
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,730
Explain yourselves.

117
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,730
Sis Biao,

118
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,370
this was actually a part of your farewell party.

119
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,050
We wanted to leave Sis Biao

120
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,740
with a deep impression.

121
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,690
It sure is a deep impression...

122
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,250
One moment someone disappears,

123
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,380
and the next someone faints.

124
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,050
Look, even Mr. Li got involved because of you all.

125
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,090
Don't you guys know how worried we were?

126
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,330
Sis Biao,

127
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,530
we went overboard this time.

128
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,730
We apologize.

129
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,730
What about Mr. Li?

130
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,130
He came running here at midnight.

131
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,610
If he catches a cold after getting caught in rain,

132
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,010
it will be all your fault.

133
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,250
Sorry Mr. Li.

134
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,770
It's our fault

135
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,970
for making you worry this time.

136
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,970
That's alright.

137
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,100
I ran for so long

138
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,970
and broke out in a cold sweat.

139
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,530
But now my shirt is all dried.

140
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,290
Moreover,

141
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,690
Yihang's shirt is the one that's most soaked.

142
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,570
Yihang,

143
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,130
are you alright?

144
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,610
I'm fine.

145
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,130
After I fainted,

146
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,210
I was dragged away by Lin Mo.

147
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,610
And he was the one who woke me up.

148
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,850
That's actually quite a scale today.

149
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,290
There is smoke

150
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,570
and ghost

151
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,090
and crying.

152
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,810
How did you make that ghost?

153
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,810
Sun Yihang made it with the keyhole imaging projection box.

154
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,330
He said it's taught by Mr. Li in class.

155
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,130
Let me see.

156
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,490
What a genius!

157
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,330
Honestly

158
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,010
it's quite...

159
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,860
When the disciple learnt

160
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,370
the master will be scared.

161
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,650
Then what about the crying and the smoke?

162
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,370
How did you make them?

163
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,650
Oh, that.

164
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,690
I am coming, I am coming.

165
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:06,930
How's it going?

166
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,930
That's it!

167
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,050
You guys should go back and clean up.

168
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,970
But again,

169
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,090
Today was indeed a memorable farewell party.

170
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,290
I should remember it for my whole life.

171
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,170
Then it's time to say goodbye.

172
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,260
Well, Miss He, just go home.

173
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,730
We'll do the best we can even without you.

174
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,970
We've decided

175
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,210
to be the best Heluo support group.

176
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:37,810
Right?

177
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,210
Yes.

178
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,050
I believe you.

179
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,250
Mr. Li,

180
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,330
Now that I leave,

181
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,810
please take good care of them.

182
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,570
I trust them will take care of themselves.

183
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,890
However,

184
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,850
please pay attention to them from time to time.

185
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,690
Don't let them make any mistakes.

186
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,410
Ok, Miss He, you can go at ease.

187
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,210
Don't worry Miss He,

188
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,810
I will take good care of them.

189
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:03,930
Good.

190
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,410
Now that

191
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,330
Mr. He asked Mr. Li for a favor,

192
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,330
we also want to ask Mr. Li for a favor.

193
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,610
Please Mr. Li

194
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,610
send Miss He home tonight.

195
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,880
Oh I almost forget it.

196
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,330
Your clothes, Mr. Li

197
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,860
Mr. Li, since you have hug each other,

198
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,970
just take one more step forward.

199
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:28,090
We shall go now.

200
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,850
Miss He, goodbye.

201
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,730
Bye, goodbye.

202
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,450
Be careful on your way home.

203
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:33,610
Take care.

204
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,090
Take care of yourself.

205
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,650
Mr. He, let's go.

206
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,290
Ok.

207
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,170
Oh,

208
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,050
I have to give the arm back.

209
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,890
Ok, let's go.

210
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,690
Mr. Li, just stop here please,

211
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,250
there's no parking space inside.

212
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,970
Just a short way left, I can walk by myself.

213
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,170
It's okay. I'll walk you there.

214
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,650
Won't it bother you?

215
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:00,930
No, not at all.

216
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,610
Let's go down for a walk.

217
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,890
Alright then.

218
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,090
Miss He, this is for you.

219
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,650
This

220
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,170
is Sanqi!

221
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,810
Mr. Li, you planted another pot.

222
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:34,490
This

223
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,210
is that me?

224
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,810
Really,

225
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,370
it actually looks like me.

226
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,210
Look!

227
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,370
I hope this little man

228
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,930
Can protect this pot of Sanqi

229
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,570
from being bald so quickly.

230
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,970
I mean that

231
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,370
I hope you don't get hurt as much.

232
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,810
Don't worry, I will take care to

233
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,130
prevent it from getting bald so quickly.

234
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,730
Miss He, the Sanqi

235
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,250
is easy to keep.

236
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,410
That's to say, you don't need to care it elaborately.

237
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,370
Even without special care, like watering and fertilizer

238
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,610
it can also grow well.

239
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,890
This plant

240
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,490
is very stubborn, very strong.

241
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,850
But also

242
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,010
very soft.

243
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,090
Great, I love it.

244
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,730
It,

245
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,610
is just like you,

246
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,010
that I love very much.

247
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,540
What?

248
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,210
He Luoyi,

249
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,420
I'll take care of the music club for you.

250
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,460
Just go to the study camp.

251
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,650
I believe that you can make it.

252
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,090
I think the boys are gonna think you are verbose

253
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,210
Anyway, I want you to take care of yourself.

254
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,050
If you get hurt,

255
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,810
You remember how to use Sanqi, right?

256
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,210
Let's go.

257
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,330
Ok.

258
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,650
Good, everyone's here now.

259
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,130
Today we are going to rehearse

260
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,530
the song for the national competition.

261
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,730
I'm sure you've all heard it.

262
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,970
And watched the video, too.

263
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,490
Any problem?

264
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,340
No.

265
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:23,980
- No.
- No.

266
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,130
Ok.

267
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,730
What are you waiting for?

268
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,610
Turn the radio on.

269
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,530
I was really afraid that her leave

270
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,370
will have you all soaked in bad mood.

271
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,930
Surprisingly,

272
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,090
you adapt to it so fast.

273
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,690
In your opinion,

274
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,050
we are heartless like that?

275
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,690
As she goes to chase her dream,

276
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,410
we should work towards our dreams too.

277
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,890
There's a saying goes,

278
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,410
Work on our own,

279
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,530
and meet at the sumit.

280
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:54,970
Chiyi is right.

281
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,610
Yes, he is.

282
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,380
It's half a month before the final round,

283
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,850
We mustn't leave this room today,

284
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,010
until finish the rehearsal.

285
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,130
I agree.

286
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,330
Keep your wits about you.

287
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,970
Show them how does

288
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,290
the champion team practice.

289
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,610
alright, next please.

290
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,850
Is Super youth group here?

291
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,650
Yes, teacher.

292
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,090
You can walked down the rehearsal.

293
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,330
Sound, light, music ready?

294
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,770
I've heard of the group before.

295
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,250
It is always on the top of Jufeng District.

296
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,690
Don't underestimate them.

297
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,610
What's more, their style is similar to ours.

298
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,450
I am quite expecting for

299
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,370
their performance this time.

300
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,850
Isn't it

301
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,730
Zhan Yiwen?

302
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,730
All I know is that he changed to another school,

303
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,690
but I don't know that he is in Super youth group.

304
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,290
You know him?

305
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,569
Lin Mo,

306
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,770
their song is very hot

307
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,370
We are so far off.

308
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,410
Not only them,

309
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,570
I also saw AKB practice.

310
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,610
Their movements were in unison,

311
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,330
and steady in singing breath.

312
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,260
The overall stage presence is strong.

313
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,330
In the end,

314
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,570
the smile on their face

315
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,010
make the group

316
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,210
very cohesive.

317
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,970
All in all,

318
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,210
they are no worse than the Super youth group.

319
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,490
This time, it's my fault.

320
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,850
I didn't pick the right song.

321
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:01,770
It's too boring.

322
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,210
Lin Mo,

323
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,690
don't blame yourself.

324
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,850
We picked the song together

325
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,730
It's not your fault

326
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,410
Yeah, don't sweat about it

327
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,050
Let's find a solution together

328
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,050
Why don't we

329
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,170
swap the song

330
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,570
But

331
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,970
The contest's tomorrow

332
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,330
Don't you think it wont' work

333
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,170
If we just swap the song today

334
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,890
Yan Ke's right

335
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,050
If we swap it now

336
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,210
We just can't fully prepare in just one night

337
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,650
If we keep, we'll definitely lose

338
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:33,770
If we swap

339
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,570
We still have a chance to win

340
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,770
I agree with Sun Yihang

341
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,410
If we end up as something ordinary

342
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,050
We might as well take the risk

343
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,130
Since I make the decision on behalf of everyone else

344
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,250
I'll take full responsibility

345
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,050
Lin Mo

346
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,170
Are you underestimating us

347
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,290
We did all those crazy stuff together

348
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,850
Let's just get crazy again after all

349
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,410
Li, follow me to dressing room 3

350
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:57,890
Sure

351
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,730
You see Yi'an's rehearsal today, right

352
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,010
I think they're pretty good

353
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,650
It's how they usually perform

354
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,260
I think the singing's OK

355
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,410
But if their song is for competing

356
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,410
Don't you think it's too risky

357
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,770
I agree

358
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,050
And I think

359
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,530
Based on their choice today

360
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,290
There's not much chance for them

361
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,410
To squeeze into the top 3

362
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,690
You're right

363
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,250
If Yi'an Music Club want to step into top 3

364
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,690
It's going to be tough

365
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,610
I guess in the end

366
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,170
It's still going to be a fight between us

367
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,570
You

368
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,650
I know you

369
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:35,930
Weren't you a member at Yi'an music club

370
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,610
We used to watch you perform

371
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,690
Are you the one who started an argue at the backstage

372
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,850
I quit already

373
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,850
It's not worthy to stay in a club like that

374
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,290
Not like the one I'm staying now

375
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,610
This one is close to winning

376
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,490
Did you watch our performance

377
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,740
You guys did well enough

378
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,780
But it's not

379
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,050
As good as ours

380
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,570
Hey watch your tongue

381
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,850
Your performance does have potential to win

382
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,010
To tell you the truth

383
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,970
I appreciate you guys a lot

384
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,770
But I really

385
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,370
Don't appreciate traitors

386
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,330
Let alone those who kick others when they're down

387
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,650
Hey, who are you pointing at

388
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:18,930
Stop it

389
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,050
Long time no see, Lin Mo, Chi Yi, Sun Yihang

390
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,010
So, he's

391
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,050
Your new member

392
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:39,570
Yeah

393
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,250
Even better than the one who left

394
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,690
They can accept your flaws

395
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,850
And your failures

396
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,170
They can stay with you when things are tough

397
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,330
When you're sad

398
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,930
They will cry their hearts out with you

399
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,890
But they never

400
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,810
Think about grabbing your attention

401
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,250
Even if they will leave one day

402
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,330
They will definitely keep

403
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,410
The dignity of our music club

404
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,290
Hey, who are you accusing at

405
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,130
My apologies

406
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,410
I'm appreciating my team members

407
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,010
I'm not talking about you guys at all

408
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,610
Lin Mo

409
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,010
No offense

410
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,050
I watched your performance

411
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,170
You guys just can't

412
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,530
Beat us that easily

413
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,570
Well, when it comes to competitions

414
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,090
Who knows

415
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,090
Even if we lost at the beginning

416
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,890
We're still here

417
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,210
The music club is not something you could imagine

418
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,850
I'll see you on stage

[Guang Shi Building]

420
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,170
We don't have much time left

421
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,210
Any other good advice

422
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,850
Don't be silent

423
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,060
Let it out

424
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,250
We've told you

425
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,210
All the songs

426
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,410
We had in mind

427
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,370
But you turned down all of them

428
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,290
Actually

429
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:01,730
I wrote a new one

430
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,170
It has a similar vibe to what we want

431
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,730
But I'm not sure

432
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,850
Hey, you

433
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,300
Why didn't you mention it earlier

434
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,090
You've made us

435
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,170
Wracking our brains the whole time

436
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:11,970
Yeah

437
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,850
We wanna know how it sounds like

438
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,450
But it's not finished yet

439
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,970
I just wrote a sample

440
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,130
Just a general idea

441
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,850
Never mind, share with us

442
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,250
Mm-hmm, we trust you

443
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,730
OK

444
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,290
Here

445
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,330
So, here goes

446
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,170
How is it

447
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,330
I personally like it

448
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,410
What do you guys think

449
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:10,980
I like it

450
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:12,970
I'm OK with it too

451
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,370
I think it suits our club well

452
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,970
I agree

453
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,330
It's just this song is half-done

454
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,690
Let's settle with this one

455
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,610
Nothing else beats it

456
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,730
But

457
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,650
It's still unfinished

458
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,260
I need everyone's help

459
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,010
Only less than 16 hours left

460
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,770
Till our rehearsal begins

461
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
During this time

462
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,810
We need to finish not just the composing

463
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,380
But also the instrument arrangements, and practice

464
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,970
So let's burn the midnight oil guys

465
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,930
Chi Yi, you're are a good writer

466
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,930
Why don't you write the lyrics

467
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:53,730
No problem

468
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,540
Sun Yihang, Fu Yunzhe, can you two deal with the arrangments

469
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,970
Because we need live instruments to play

470
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,010
So guys

471
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,810
Bring your instruments when we practice

472
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,970
Let's hurry up and get going

473
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,570

474
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:22,610
Please go on

475
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,330
Well, in regards to this group

476
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,410
I think they lack a whole atmosphere

477
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,610
So could you warm up the audienece

478

And now you're telling me you want to change your song

491
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,450
No way

492
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,930
Go and prepare
