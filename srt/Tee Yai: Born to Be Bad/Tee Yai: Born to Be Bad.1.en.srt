- Hello there.

It's hot out there.

5
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,500
- It is! Oh yeah?
- I just came from the market.

6
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,958
I should quit the police
and sell limes instead.

7
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,208
- What?
- They're more expensive than gold now.

8
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:56,041
- I hear your daughter's getting married.
- Yes, you must come to the wedding!

9
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:56,958
I'd like that.

You know, when we get there,

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,250
I swear I'm gonna let them
beat the shit out of you.

Hey, Tee.

32
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,833
Is it true,

33
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,250
everything they say?

34
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,750
That this special stuff
can make you disappear?

35
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:00,250
Hey, I've seen it.
He really can disappear.

36
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,375
Ah, Somchai, you're so damn superstitious.

37
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,958
That's why these bastards are so cocky.

38
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,458
Okay, then.

39
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,375

Stay still.

41
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,916
Like this. How's he gonna disappear, huh?

You fucking try to do it now.

00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,666
Go ahead.

These reporters write, like,
make him out to be a hero.

67
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,166
And who are the villains?

68
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,791
That's you and I.

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,416
This business with him,
it needs to end soon.

70
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,291
You'll have full authority
over the operation.

71

Jakarat,

72
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,791

00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:24,208
You two shouldn't have come back here.

76
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,000
What's going on?

77
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,416
The police,
they took all my amulets, Luang Por.

78
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,666
It's really my fault, Luang Por.

79
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:01,875
You are cursed, Tee.
It's time for you to quit.

80
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,458
Keep my words in mind, Tee.

81
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,250
You have escaped
because your fate is strong.

82
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,958
It is not because of this amulet.

83
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,541
And due to your friend,

84
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,250
whether you live or die,

85
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,791
depends on him.

86
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,916
Tee, hand it over.

87
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,500
Choose which hand. Pick one.

88
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,666
Come on, which hand?

89
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,541
Hey.

90
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,125
How did it disappear?

91
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,916
Keep your eyes on the rings in my hands.

92
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,041
Don't blink even once.

93
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,791
All right.

94
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,000
- There, how about that?
- Whoa!

95
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,791
How do you do that?

96
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,791
All right.

97
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,208
Before we move on now to the next show,

98
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,333
take a few moments

99
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,708
and you should buy these medicines
which can cure all diseases.

100
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,583
Let me through. You there!

101
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,958
- You're under arrest. Turn around.
- Hey. What's going on?

102
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,958
- Leave me alone!
- Hey, don't struggle.

103
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,125
- Drugs here.
- They're not mine.

104
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,708
How could you say that? What's this?

105
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,083
Those are not mine.
I told you, it's not mine. It's not mine.

106
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,208
- No, no!
- Pa! Pa!

107
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,416
- Boy, wait.
- Take him away.

108
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,708
- Boy, stop!
- Leave my dad alone.

109
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,125
They're not mine.

110
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,541
- Stop struggling.
- Luang Por, look after my son.

111
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:53,541
- There's no point making a fuss.
- Pa! Pa!

112
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,750
<i>Pa! Pa!</i>

113
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,541
I'll get you outta here.

114
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,833
We'll find a better place.

115
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,208
Yeah.

116
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,416
Hey, you.

117
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,958
Yeah, you, you haven't paid up.

118
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,708
Fuck him up, yeah.

119
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,625
Luang Por, please help Tee.

120
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,583
Rerk, stitch his wound. Stitch it now.

121
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,166
Tee, bite down. Be strong.

122
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,000
Just stay still, Tee. Stay still.

123
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,583
What trouble did he get into?

124
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,416
He wouldn't pay the protection money,

125
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,000
so Adisak's henchmen ambushed him.

126
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:27,125
<i>From now on, no one will be able</i>
<i>to hurt you or me again.</i>

127

<i>Inspector, Tee and his crew</i>
<i>are holed up in Bang Khun Phrom.</i>

<i>What's our next move?</i>

129
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,416
We can't let him walk free
and become a celebrity.

130
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,541
- Keep me updated, okay?
<i>- Yes, Inspector.</i>

131
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,291
Sergeant Somchai, sir.

132
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,041
I'm Sergeant Ouan reporting for duty.

133
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,166
Captain Weera sent us to assist you,
Inspector.

134
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,250
About Tee's escape.

135
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,833
You guys believe he has magic powers,
don't you?

136
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes.

137
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:35,291
It's because you think that,
you screwed up.

138
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,541
If he truly had those powers,
he would never have been caught.

139
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,458
Those so-called powers,

140
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:47,625
are nothing else but just a con.

143
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,916
Thanks, Kid.

144
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:40,291
Guys your age. Like this kind of music.

145
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,333
I have different tastes.

146
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,833
I've been in and out
of so many brothels, sir.

147
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,458
Still no sign of them.

148
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,666
You see that kid over there?

149
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,208
You remember their first case?

150
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,333
They robbed Adisak.

151
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,625
<i>They took out all of his henchmen.</i>

152
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:27,666
Tee.

153
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,166
What are you doing?

154
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,750
<i>As for his only son, Kid?</i>

155
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,458
<i>He disappeared without a trace.</i>

156
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,333
Damn you, Kid.

157
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,500
You ungrateful son.

158
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,250
<i>He put a bounty on their heads,</i>

159
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,500
and to this day, they still can't return.

160
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,416
Back off.

161
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,625
Hey, you can't come in.

162
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,458
Don't come in.

163
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,083
She said no.

164
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,625
Let's talk.

165
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,166
I told you no.

166
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,208
Don't you get it?

167
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,791
Listen, Dao,
if you don't take a client today,

168
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,541
you'll get a whipping instead.

169
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,625
- Looks bad.
- No fucking way.

170
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,666
He tried to stick it in my ass,
the sick fuck.

171
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,958
Ah!

172
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh!

173
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,750
Come here, you bitch.

174
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,125
Let me go, you piece of shit.

175
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,791
Ah!

176
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,041
You're a tough one, hey?

177
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,083
Fuck you.

178
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,333
Hey!

179
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,666
Hey. Hey.

180
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,208
- That's enough.
- Dao. You bitch.

181
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,708
Rerk, watch out.

182
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,583
Tee, don't.

183
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,166
Trust me.

184
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,708
You're making a lotta noise.

185
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,083
You guys live up to your reputations.

186
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,625
Madam. I'm begging you. I came in peace.

187
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,708
If you really came in peace,

188
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,125
then don't make me regret it.

189
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,708
Come on, Madam.
Aren't you rather shortchanging me here?

190
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,750
You don't want it?

191
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:53,750
Are you badly hurt?

192
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,250
I'm not taking clients. You should go.

193
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,291
The reason I came here…

194
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,791
…was to thank you

195
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,166
for helping me.

196
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:32,416
I hate bullies
and those who look down on women.

197
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,791
Madam? Madam. The police are here.

198
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,083
The bar is closed.

199
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,000
If you're here to search,
you'd need a warrant.

200
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,458
I've already paid.

201
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:37,166
I've never taken from you.
Who did you pay?

202
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,583
Go on, move faster.

203
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,250
Get in there.

204
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,125
Has anyone seen Tee and his gang?

205
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:05,125
If no one speaks up,
I'll take all of you downtown.

206
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:10,250
Oh, Inspector.
Those guys haven't been here for months.

207
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,708
You should just ask Sergeant Sam.

208
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,958
Inspector Jakarat, sir.

209
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,041
Isn't this going a bit far?

210
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,625
Hm?

211
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,541
You mind your damn tongue.

212
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:45,666
If I wanna hear from you,
I'll ask you, okay?

213
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,333
Yes, sir.

214
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,875
He will definitely come back here.

215
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:03,541
When that day comes and you're all silent,

216
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:05,958
you'll regret it.

217
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,500
What the fuck are you lot
all standing here for?

218
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,291
Get to work.

219
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,458

So it was them, right?

232
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,166

and they were lurking around
the other day.

00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:44,500
Keep watch here, Sergeant.

238
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,833
They're probably scouting.

239
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:50,208

I've spoken to everyone but the janitor.
His house is completely dark.

291

306
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,250
Get down.

307
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,125
Get back. Fall back.

308
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,208

Hey.

311
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,708
Drag him out. Be careful.

312
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:40,208
You stay here. I'll handle the police.

313
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,333
Cover me.

314
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,666

363
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,083
<i>Mo can't see</i>

364
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:28,458
<i>Bud is hiding</i>

365
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:29,708
<i>Dha is sleeping</i>

366
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:31,125
<i>Ya disappears</i>

367
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,875
<i>Namo buddhaya</i>

368
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,791
<i>Yatha buddhamona</i>

369
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:39,083
When the smoke had all gone away,
everyone had disappeared.

370
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:44,791
That's a fairy tale.

371
00:39:45,291 --> 00:39:47,708
How can a person just disappear?

372
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,666
Search every corner of the house.

373
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,166
Search everywhere. Sergeant?

374
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:59,958
- Sir?
- Pull up the temple entrance.

375
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:02,375
He must be hiding somewhere close by.

376
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,208
- Go!
- Yes, sir.

377
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,875
Hey, Ouan, you see,
I told you, they have something special.

378
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:15,500
We had them surrounded.
How could they just disappear like that?

379
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,500
How did you let him slip away?

380
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:23,833
Are you trying to humiliate me?

381
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:27,416
Those damn reporters
are writing terrible shit about me.

382
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Goddamn it!

383
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:30,250
Shit.

384
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,208
I underestimated him.

385
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:39,500
The witness said he just disappeared, sir.

386
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:44,208
Don't let those reporters find out,

387
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,958
that a cop actually believes that.

388
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,208
Otherwise we're all screwed.

389
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:51,500
Yes, sir.

390
00:40:55,375 --> 00:41:01,375
TALING CHAN, BANGKOK

391
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,250
Thank you, Doctor.

392
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:24,708
And thank you, Joon.

393
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:27,458
If this isn't enough
for your mother's treatment,

394
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:28,666
come ask me for more.

395
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,333
I thank you.

396
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,791
Oh wow.

397
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,125
Shit.

398
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:54,041
The cops put a 50,000 baht bounty
on your head, Tee. Check it out.

399
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:57,958
Any news about Dao?

400
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:00,833
About Dao?

401
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,625
Uh…

402
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:10,208
Just tell me what you know, Kid.

403
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:15,250
A while ago, Taweeb went to the brothel.

404
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,458
The hookers were saying that Sam

405
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:22,500
gave Dao a serious beating.

406
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,750
You're so tough, eh?

407
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,000
You want more?

408
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,166
Remember this.

409
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:34,875
As long as I'm around,

410
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:37,625
you'll be a whore here until you're dead.

411
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:51,375
That bastard.

412
00:42:52,291 --> 00:42:53,666
Piece of shit.

413
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:01,041
Tee?

414
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,416
I need your help.

415
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:22,666
- Hey, do it right.
- So, are you gonna work or not?

416
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,541
- That's how I taught you.
- Yes, I'll work, madam.

417
00:43:25,625 --> 00:43:27,666
Yesterday, we had a VIP client.

418
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,541
- He complained about you.
- Your turn, loser.

419
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,208
Coast is clear.

420
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:41,500
I'm here for Dao!

421
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:45,166
You stop right there.

422
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:47,875
Rerk.

423
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,291
Rerk, let me go.

424
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:52,083
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

425
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,291
Don't do it, Sam, or I'll kill her.

426
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,583
Let her go.

427
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,125
Sergeant Sam?

428
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:09,875
Sergeant Sam.

429
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:11,250
You bastard!

430
00:44:13,583 --> 00:44:15,916
- Hey!
- Tee.

431
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,375
- You bastard. Let me go.
- Stop your wriggling.

432
00:44:19,916 --> 00:44:21,500
- Let me go!
- Go, man.

433
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,208
Let's go.

434
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:27,625
Come here.

435
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:51,333
Dao?

436
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:56,458
Let me go. Let me go. Let me go!

437
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:03,291
Dao.

438
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,208
Dao.

439
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:16,041
- Hey. Hey. I'm here, baby.
- Hey, Rerk.

440
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:19,125
I'm here to rescue you.

441
00:45:57,625 --> 00:45:59,250
Shit. Tee.

442
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:00,833
Tee.

443
00:46:10,916 --> 00:46:13,291
Tee. Cops everywhere.

444
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:15,333
I'll draw them the other way.

445
00:46:15,416 --> 00:46:17,291
- I'll meet you at Joon's.
- Kid, don't.

446
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,833
Get outta the way!

447
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:36,458
Hey, stop. Hey.

448
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:37,375
- Police.
- Stop.

449
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:57,708
<i>Witnesses said Tee and another associate</i>

450
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,583
<i>stormed in and began shooting people</i>
<i>at Golden Heaven.</i>

451
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:03,833
<i>There were two injured victims</i>
<i>and six dead,</i>

452
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:07,333
<i>including Madam Sri,</i>
<i>who was shot dead in one of the rooms.</i>

453
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:09,291
<i>We questioned all of the witnesses</i>

454
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:11,708
<i>and found out</i>
<i>that two people were missing.</i>

455
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:17,333
<i>A prostitute named Dao and Sergeant Sam,</i>
<i>Madame Sri's close associate.</i>

456
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,416
Inspector?

457
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,166
We've caught one of Tee's men.

458
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:30,666
Kid, Adisak's son.

459
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,416
Take him downtown, lock him up.

460
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,625
I'll be there soon.

461
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:38,791
- And look into Sergeant Sam for me.
- Yes, sir.

462
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,166
Get in there.

463
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,125
Now!

464
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:52,833
Damn it, shit.

465
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:54,625
Bastard.

466
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:56,958
Let me go, you bastard.

467
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,375
Do you know who I am, asshole? Let me go!

468
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:04,083
Hey. What the fuck are you yelling about?

469
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:15,791
That's for yelling, asshole.

470
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:21,333
Let me go.

471
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,541
Oh!

472
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,583
Hey!

473
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,166
You piece of shit.

474
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:37,458
You bastard.

475
00:48:57,666 --> 00:48:58,500
That's enough.

476
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:24,500
Hey, Tee. Apparently they got Kid.

477
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:27,250
He's held at the police station.

478
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:32,041
Kid'll never give you up.

479
00:49:33,208 --> 00:49:35,625
The police will use him to bait you.

480
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:50,916
His life is my responsibility.

481
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:53,333
I can't leave Dao here alone.

482
00:49:57,291 --> 00:49:58,125
Hey, Rerk.

483
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,416
You come with me, Joon.

484
00:50:12,833 --> 00:50:13,958
Let's go.

485
00:50:28,541 --> 00:50:31,291
Thank you for helping me.

486
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:34,583
Yeah.

487
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:38,583
What's your name?

488
00:50:39,458 --> 00:50:40,333
I'm Pae.

489
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:42,625
I'm Kid.

490
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,250
What are you in for?

491
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:47,500
I got into a fight.

492
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,083
Put a bullet in my stepfather.

493
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:53,458
He was hitting my mother.
Couldn't stand it anymore.

494
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:05,000
Get up.

495
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:10,125
- Quickly.
- Get up.

496
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:11,875
Hey.

497
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,333
Luang Por.

498
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,458
I'm here to ask for your help.

499
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,083
I think it is best

500
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:30,916
for the girl to stay with your mother,
don't you think?

501
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:35,458
I'll leave it to your mercy.

502
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,166
And your friend, Tee?

503
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:52,791
Hello, what did you say?

504
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:54,375
Hey, thief. Thief.

505
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:55,708
Help, help!

506
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:58,125
Tee robbed a place? Where?

507
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,791
CHAROENRAT PAWN SHOP

508
00:52:01,375 --> 00:52:03,166
In Bang Lamphu. Go!

509
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:07,125
Tee's robbed another place.

510
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,000
Now he's hit a horse racing dancer.

511
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:13,583
Tee robbed a gold shop in Yaowarat.

512
00:52:14,083 --> 00:52:16,916
How could Tee rob four places at once?

513
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:23,791
CONTACT

514
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:28,708

It's the jail.

Hey, everyone,
the holding cells, let's go.

521
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:20,833
Leave me alone.

522
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,250
Bastard, let go.

523
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:26,875
- Joon?
- Yeah.

524
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:28,208
- Let's go.
- Joon!

525
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,166
- Come on.
- Wait.

526
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,375
- Pae, Pae. Wake up.
- We gotta go now.

527
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,625
Kid?

528
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:35,750
- Tee!
- Let's go.

529
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:40,791
- Oh, shit!
- Get down.

530
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:45,791
Tee, come out. You can't get away.

531
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:47,250
Give it up.

532
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:53,625
Push the cabinet.

533
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:05,208
Damn.

534
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,833
Grenade!

535
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:41,625
Go.

536
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:45,541
Rerk.

537
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:47,458
- Quick, Tee!
- Go, get in.

538
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:48,541
Go.

539
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:50,250
- Go, go!
- Watch out.

540
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,333
Inspector, grenade!

541
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:39,500
Thank you, Tee, everyone,
for coming to my rescue.

542
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:41,791
Otherwise I'd be in deep trouble.

543
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:44,416
I was nearly caught.

544
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:46,958
Because of you.

545
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:49,625
Good thing that Rerk arrived.

546
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:52,000
You should be thanking him.

547
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,625
Thank you, Rerk.

548
00:55:58,125 --> 00:55:59,666
We should split up.

549
00:56:06,208 --> 00:56:07,541
Be careful.

550
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,625
Weeb, you have somewhere I can stay?

551
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:14,916
Let's go to Damnoen.

552
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:17,250
You joking?

553
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:21,125
Tee and I can't set foot
in Damnoen anymore.

554
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:25,583
I'm gonna go pick up Dao.

555
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,166
When did Dao see Luang Por?

556
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:31,916
Why didn't you tell me you took her there?

557
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,791
If they find out, Luang Por is in danger.

558
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:38,916
Did you hear what I just said?

559
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:43,000
Goddamn it!

560
00:56:45,541 --> 00:56:46,791
Excuse me, sir.

561
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:52,166
Stay here, Sergeant.

562
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:56,791
You did well.

563
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,833
Very well.

564
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:07,208
You managed to screw everything up.

565
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:12,541
What do you think
the Prime Minister will ask me?

566
00:57:13,041 --> 00:57:14,125
I don't know, sir.

567
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:22,208
You're lucky I'm a merciful man.

568
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:26,041
Or I'd be sending you
to hunt communists in the north.

569
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:30,875
Is that all, sir?

570
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:34,958
I'd like to ask you something.

571
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,666
You actually want to catch Tee?

572
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,291
- Or just please your superiors?
- That's enough!

573
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:03,791
Luang Por!

574
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,625
You guys be careful,
the police are all over the temple.

575
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:13,083
Is everything all right?

576
00:58:13,708 --> 00:58:16,250
Someone named Sam
came looking for you here.

577
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:23,250
Your woman is alive.

578
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:28,708
But I'm afraid your mother…

579
00:58:38,541 --> 00:58:39,625
Mother!

580
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,125
No, Sam!

581
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:45,625
Rerk. You guys need to leave here quickly.

582
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,166
Rerk, come on, let's go.

583
00:58:50,958 --> 00:58:52,375
Take it easy, Rerk.

584
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:54,916
Hey, Rerk.

585
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:03,083
Tee?

586
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,458
I want to blame myself.

587
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,833
I made you who you are today.

588
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,958
Rerk, I'm sorry.

589
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,041
About your mother.

590
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,083
You should've told me.

591
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:44,291
So what if I had?

592
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:47,916
Would it have made any difference
if I told you Dao was here?

593
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,541
Wasn't it you?

594
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:52,333
You were the one
who never wanted to return.

595
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,833
That's right, I didn't want to.
And you shouldn't have come.

596
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:59,125
Because of you,
it's why I had to leave here.

597
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:00,541
Rerk, don't you remember…

598
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:01,833
You stay outta this, Kid.

599
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:06,625
I told you, Tee.

600
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:10,625
If you'd listened to me,
I wouldn't have had to bring her here.

601
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,916
Goddamn it.

602
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,041
Are you blaming me?

603
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:17,791
Yeah. You're a shitty friend,
you know that?

604
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:19,625
Rerk!

605
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:22,166
Go on, do it.

606
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:23,833
Go on.

607
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:34,958
I never saw my father again.

608
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:37,958
Not after I met you.

609
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:40,958
And today, it's my mother!

610
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:45,375
I…

611
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:49,791
I've been with you my entire life, Tee.

612
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:55,541
And now I…

613
01:01:56,041 --> 01:01:58,208
I have no one left.

614
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,750
- Was his hair short or long?
- I think his eyes…

615
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:06,791
Three shots were fired.

616
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:10,291
After the first two shots,
the gun seemed to jam.

617
01:02:21,916 --> 01:02:25,166
- Okay, try again now.
- All right, take it slowly now.

618
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,083
Tee?

619
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:53,791
Rerk.

620
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:57,583
I'm so sorry.

621
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:02,500
It's my fault that you're mother…

622
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:13,666
Don't blame yourself.

623
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:18,833
Get some rest now, okay?

624
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:21,375
Soon, you'll be better.

625
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:23,375
Tee?

626
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:25,208
Next time,

627
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:27,333
let me help with planning.

628
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:31,208
Not yet, Kid.

629
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,791
It's just that, Rerk…

630
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:42,291
I think he's over it.

631
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:47,541
Seems like he wants out completely.

632
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:50,000
Let him go be with his woman.

633
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:54,958
You're still way too young, Kid.

634
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:57,458
You don't know what we've been through.

635
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:00,916
Everything I've done,

636
01:05:02,416 --> 01:05:04,333
Rerk's always been there.

637
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,125
I'll take care of Sam myself.

638
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:27,708
You stay here with Dao.

639
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:29,833
She needs you.

640
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,500
Can you promise me something?

641
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:37,125
I'm asking you just this once, Tee.

642
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:40,541
Take care of Dao for me.

643
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,541
Let me go and kill him.

644
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:52,083
I beg you.

645
01:05:58,458 --> 01:05:59,458
No.

646
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:06,583
He has to die by my hand alone, Tee.

647
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,583
MAE CHEE SAWAI

648
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,000
MAE CHEE SAWAI SAISANGWAN

649
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:45,166
Hey!

650
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,208
Sam.

651
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:10,916
Hey, you bastard…

652
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,375
…let me go.

653
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:17,916
Tee?

654
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:22,250
How'd it go, Kid?

655
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:24,666
I went to check.

656
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:26,833
No one's in Damneon.

657
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:30,000
The police, they're causing trouble.

658
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:38,375
Tee.

659
01:08:39,625 --> 01:08:41,083
Have you seen Rerk?

660
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,166
Where did Rerk go?

661
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:05,958
Cuff him. Take it off.

662
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:12,166
You'll talk now.

663
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:14,625
Just tell me where to find Tee,

664
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:16,958
and then I'll leave you alone.

665
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:23,375
And then,
you'll get some money to start a new life.

666
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:24,833
Huh?

667
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,125
- Ugh.
- Hey.

668
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:28,666
Hold him still.

669
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,750
Uh…

670
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:04,000
Just so you know,

671
01:10:04,083 --> 01:10:07,500
nobody on the force
knows you're being held here.

672
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:10,083
If you don't help me,

673
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:12,708
it's over, you piece of shit.

674
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:44,083
Shot.

675
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,750
You still haven't told me
how you got outta jail.

676
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:51,416
My uncle's a soldier.

677
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,625
He bailed me out.

678
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:56,958
Your uncle?

679
01:10:58,541 --> 01:10:59,375
Excuse me.

680
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:08,125
Hey, get yourself a drink.

681
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:10,166
And don't cheat, asshole!

682
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,666
Yeah, sure.

683
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:18,708
Tee.

684
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:35,708
Who did you bring here?

685
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,291
Oh, him. That's Pae.

686
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:40,291
He helped me in jail.

687
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:43,000
Without him,
I'd have ended up dead in there.

688
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:45,333
It's like this.

689
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:49,041
Pae heard that Sam
is hunting down Rerk in Bangkok.

690
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:52,375
He was helping me look out for Rerk,
make sure he's okay.

691
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:55,916
What did you tell him?

692
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:57,541
Huh?

693
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:03,833
I… I'm just trying to help find Rerk.
That's why I brought him.

694
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,041
Who do you think you are?

695
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,083
What were you thinking, Kid?

696
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:20,625
I don't trust him
and now I'm starting to not trust you.

697
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:26,666
Don't ever do anything

698
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:28,833
like this again.

699
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:40,000
Damn.

700
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,541
Hey, bring me a drink.

701
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,125
What's going on?

702
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:10,708
It's just Tee.

703
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:14,750
He doesn't trust your info.

704
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:16,750
And he blames me for bringing you here.

705
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:19,458
Damn it. What the fuck did I do wrong?

706
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:21,083
Tee.

707
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:24,333
- He's here.
- Yeah.

708
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:27,333
He's probably gone now.

709
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:32,333
Screw it. Let's get drunk.

710
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:33,875
Yeah.

711
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:35,541
Screw it.

712
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:38,166
<i>A suspect wanted under arrest warrants</i>

713
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:43,083
<i>for multiple robbery and homicide cases</i>
<i>in Damnoen district and Bangkok.</i>

714
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:46,708
<i>Mr. Rerk Srivichien</i>
<i>was a key subordinate of Tee Yai,</i>

715
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:50,666
<i>the notorious bandit</i>
<i>currently being hunted by the police.</i>

716
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:55,333
<i>However, the police have not yet released</i>
<i>details about the fatal shooting,</i>

717
01:13:55,416 --> 01:14:00,875

<i>the operation to apprehend Tee Yai</i>…

718
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:03,625

719
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:05,416

<i>to the Police General Hospital</i>
<i>for an autopsy.</i>

723
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,166
It could be a made-up story.

724
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:25,541
If it's on the radio, it's probably true.

725
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:56,791
<i>Here's an update</i>
<i>on the fatal police shooting</i>

726
01:14:56,875 --> 01:14:58,583

01:14:58,666 --> 01:15:00,875
<i>a key subordinate of Tee Yai.</i>

728
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:03,833
<i>The autopsy confirmed</i>
<i>that the cause of death</i>

729
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:06,250
<i>was gunshot wounds to the forehead.</i>

730
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:09,916
<i>These were bullets</i>
<i>fired from police officers' pistols</i>

731
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,666
<i>during an attempted arrest</i>
<i>of Mr. Rerk Srivichien</i>

732
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,000
<i>that resulted in a shoot-out.</i>

733
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:19,583
<i>Senior police authorized</i>
<i>the fatal shooting of Mr. Rerk</i>

734
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:22,958
<i>due to concerns</i>
<i>for public safety in the area.</i>

735
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:27,958
I'm thinking about buying your freedom.

736
01:15:28,583 --> 01:15:32,375
Be serious, will you?

737
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:33,958
We only just met each other.

738
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:40,583
<i>I really wanna be with you, Dao.</i>

739
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:55,333
This has to be true.

740
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:58,375
TEE YAI'S RIGHT-HAND MAN
FATALLY SHOT BY POLICE

741
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,875
Ever since Rerk disappeared,

742
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:11,500
Tee's been acting quite strange.

743
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:15,833
He doesn't rob, he doesn't do shit.

744
01:16:15,916 --> 01:16:17,083
It's like…

745
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:20,375
like he doesn't give a damn
about anything anymore.

746
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,041
Go for it yourself.

747
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,250
Why not, huh?

748
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:34,291
Just us.

749
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:37,666
Show Tee what you can do yourself.

750
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:48,250
<i>Breaking news.</i>

751
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:50,541
<i>Earlier today,</i>
<i>authorities received a report</i>

752
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:54,041
<i>that Tee Yai's gang</i>
<i>has committed robbery and murder</i>

753
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:56,208
<i>in a district of Ratchaburi province.</i>

754
01:16:56,291 --> 01:17:01,083
<i>The gang made off with over 100,000 baht</i>
<i>in cash and gold jewelry.</i>

755
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:03,500
<i>All of the victims were brutally executed.</i>

756
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:07,083
<i>It seems the Tee Yai gang,</i>
<i>which had laid low for some time now,</i>

757
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:08,333
<i>is back in action.</i>

758
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:12,208
<i>The Crime Suppression Division</i>
<i>has swiftly mobilized its forces,</i>

759
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:15,166
<i>conducting intensive searches</i>
<i>in Damnoen and Saduak</i>

760
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,208
<i>in pursuit of Tee Yai and his men.</i>

761
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:46,166
Tee. Where are you taking me?

762
01:17:55,208 --> 01:17:57,041
We'll move by boat now.

763
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:01,041
The police won't find us.

764
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:07,833
I have something to tell you.

765
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:16,750
I'm pregnant.

766
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:19,291
With Rerk's child.

767
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:22,208
I only just found out.

768
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,333
Rerk.

769
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:43,000
It's really you.

770
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,083
Where have you been?

771
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:56,833
I'm so sorry.

772
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:00,875
Rerk.

773
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:09,625
Hey.

774
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:33,041
Don't you know what this is? Huh?
I'm back from the dead.

775
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:44,958
All of the news reports.

776
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:47,250
Bastards.

777
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,625
They made them up to bait you.

778
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:56,166
I thought about warning you,
but I didn't know who I could trust.

779
01:21:57,666 --> 01:21:58,750
What about Sam?

780
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,625
I sent him to hell.

781
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:06,791
Tee.

782
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:10,541
I wanna do one more robbery.

783
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:15,416
Get enough to start a new life.

784
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,958
After this job, I think

785
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:28,166
I'm going to move to Nan.

786
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:30,958
What do you think?

787
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:35,708
I think we should go.

788
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:38,083
Let's go now.

789
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:40,750
Why risk another robbery?

790
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:50,458
It's the last one, Dao.

791
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:54,833
Trust me, okay?

792
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:17,166
Hey.

793
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:22,500
I brought your family back.

794
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:36,500
The police are everywhere now.

795
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:41,833
It's like they knew I'd be here.

796
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:50,416
Who do you think it is?

797
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:04,833
It's Kid.

798
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:10,125
He brought in someone I didn't know.

799
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:12,291
Who's not from Damneon.

800
01:24:13,791 --> 01:24:15,958
I suspect he's a police informant.

801
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:18,583
When you were in Bangkok,

802
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:21,666
did you hear anything about this?

803
01:24:23,666 --> 01:24:24,500
No.

804
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:34,875
My plan is almost complete.

805
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:37,916
Won't be long now before I get to Tee.

806
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:42,833
I sent you undercover
to catch a criminal, not to become one.

807
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:46,541
Listen to me carefully, all right?

808
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:48,458
If you don't pull this off,

809
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,500
I will lock you up myself.

810
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,083
THAI BANK

811
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:11,500
So, here's my plan for this job.

812
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:18,833
Sergeant Ouan and I will be here.

813
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:22,958
Everyone else will spread out
to surround and catch them.

814
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,833
THAI BANK

815
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:38,333
<i>The cash-transport vehicle</i>
<i>will come through here.</i>

816
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:42,000
THAI BANK

817
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,041
<i>In two days' time,</i>

818
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:03,250
<i>you guys wait for me</i>
<i>in front of the Thai Bank.</i>

819
01:26:07,583 --> 01:26:10,208
Don't do anything until I get there.

820
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:24,916
<i>They're going to hit</i>
<i>the cash transport in front of the bank.</i>

821
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,291
That's where we'll ambush them.

822
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:29,375
Can we trust him, sir?

823
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:34,750
<i>So in two days,</i>

824
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:38,166
just wait there outside the Thai Bank,
okay?

825
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:41,000
<i>Don't forget what we agreed on.</i>

826
01:26:41,083 --> 01:26:44,833
<i>You take Tee alive,</i>
<i>you let Dao and me walk free.</i>

827
01:26:45,791 --> 01:26:48,208
That's the deal.

828
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:55,458
<i>Let me ask you something.</i>

829
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:58,375
Does Tee actually have magic powers?

830
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:16,500
That day on the train,
how did you escape from us?

831
01:27:16,583 --> 01:27:18,208
I handcuffed you myself!

832
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:28,250
<i>Nah, close his eyes</i>

833
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:31,250
<i>Mo can't see</i>

834
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:34,125
<i>Bud is hiding</i>

835
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,083
<i>Dha is sleeping</i>

836
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:39,750
<i>Ya disappears</i>

<i>Yatha Buddhamona</i>

839
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:04,791
Like that, right?

840
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:11,000
You do the same cheap tricks
your father did.

841
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:15,166
At the janitor's place.
What was that trick?

842
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,083
Uncle, I need you to help us.

843
01:28:19,708 --> 01:28:21,625
Tell this story to the police.

844
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:23,875
We'll chant over beetle leaves.

845
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:26,833
- And then I'll just vanish, okay?
- <i>Which way did he go?</i>

846
01:28:28,625 --> 01:28:30,625
Do you trust in magic?

<i>When smoke had all gone away,</i>

848
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:35,000
everyone had disappeared.

849
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:42,833
Slowly. Slowly.

850
01:28:42,916 --> 01:28:44,083
Watch out.

851
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,083
Okay.

852
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:55,291
<i>You might call it a cheap trick or magic,</i>
<i>Inspector,</i>

853
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:58,208
<i>but I pull it off every time.</i>

854
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:22,333
Do you know the angel trumpet flower?

855
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:26,750
<i>My father said its poison is potent.</i>

856
01:29:28,333 --> 01:29:30,458
<i>Just take one sniff of it and you're…</i>

857
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:34,000
…out like a light.

858
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:48,333
Rerk.

859
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:53,125
I'm coming with you.

860
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:56,958
I don't think so.

861
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,291
It's not safe.

862
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:04,708
If you're there,
what do I have to be afraid of?

863
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:06,083
Dao.

864
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:08,208
It's too dangerous.

865
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:10,208
I can't risk it.

866
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:13,791
I don't wanna risk being alone either.

867
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:32,291
I know what to do.

Don't know.

874
01:32:06,375 --> 01:32:08,500
He said wait, so we wait.

875
01:32:45,916 --> 01:32:47,833
This'll take five minutes to do.

876
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:07,375
I knew we couldn't trust these bastards.

Get out. Out!

Pull back, Tee.

885
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:40,250
Fucking Tee.

886
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:43,541
Come on.

You bastard, Tee.

You bastard.

It's been over half an hour.

895
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:49,875
Think he's bailed.

896
01:37:01,125 --> 01:37:02,208
Dao.

Hey, hey, hey. Dao, Dao, Dao.

898
01:37:04,666 --> 01:37:06,375
Stay with me, Dao. Dao.

899
01:37:08,166 --> 01:37:10,708
Dao, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have brought you.

900
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:14,333
I was worried about you.

If something happened to you,
how would our child and I get on?

Please save Dao and Rerk's child.

Luang Por,

907
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:19,000
there's a police officer for you here.

908
01:38:22,166 --> 01:38:24,166
I'm begging you, Luang Por.

909
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:26,375
I'll take whatever comes.

910
01:38:26,958 --> 01:38:28,500
I'll accept death.

911
01:38:29,291 --> 01:38:31,125
I'll bear all the karma.

912
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:43,583
<i>You need to leave now.</i>

913
01:38:44,083 --> 01:38:46,166
<i>I'll handle everything here.</i>

914
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:21,125
<i>Tee and his gang</i>
<i>are in a yellow pickup truck.</i>

915
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:23,708
<i>They fled the temple</i>
<i>through the back door, Inspector.</i>

916
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,333
We'll wait for them here.

917
01:40:40,791 --> 01:40:42,041
Let's go.

918
01:41:06,791 --> 01:41:07,958
<i>If you help me,</i>

919
01:41:09,208 --> 01:41:10,541
I promise,

920
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:12,291
I'll take Tee alive.

921
01:41:15,375 --> 01:41:18,416
Tee would rather die than go to jail.

922
01:41:18,916 --> 01:41:21,291
Death is too easy for him.

923
01:41:22,375 --> 01:41:24,125
I'll lock him up to rot.

924
01:41:25,208 --> 01:41:27,583
He'll live to see the day he's forgotten.

925
01:41:31,875 --> 01:41:33,541
<i>I'll get you outta here.</i>

926
01:41:34,041 --> 01:41:35,958
<i>We'll find a better place.</i>

927
01:41:37,333 --> 01:41:38,375
<i>Yeah.</i>

928
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,250
Rerk…

929
01:42:46,541 --> 01:42:48,541
I don't think I'll make it.

930
01:42:49,166 --> 01:42:54,250
Damn it.
Damn it, Tee. Damn it, damn it, damn it.

931
01:42:56,333 --> 01:42:58,375
It wasn't meant to turn out like this.

932
01:42:59,625 --> 01:43:02,125
I wish we'd had more fun together.

933
01:43:02,625 --> 01:43:05,166
No, no, no, no, Tee.

934
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:09,041
I'm so glad, to have you as a friend.

935
01:43:09,125 --> 01:43:13,916
Tee. No.

936
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,541
- You need to make it back to your child.
- No, Tee.

937
01:43:17,041 --> 01:43:18,250
And Dao.

938
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:21,875
We have to make it through together, man.

939
01:43:23,541 --> 01:43:26,208
Come on. Come on, please. Tee.

940
01:43:26,291 --> 01:43:28,166
I want you to be the one…

941
01:43:31,083 --> 01:43:32,083
who shoots me.

942
01:43:32,166 --> 01:43:36,916
Fuck. No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

943
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,750
No, no, no.

944
01:43:49,458 --> 01:43:50,750
Shoot me.

945
01:43:56,791 --> 01:43:58,958
Shoot me!

946

948
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:11,708
Are you dead, huh?
Are you dead, you piece of shit, huh?

949
01:46:12,666 --> 01:46:15,083
