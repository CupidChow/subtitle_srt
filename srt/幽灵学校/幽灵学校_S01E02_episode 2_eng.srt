1
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:06,398

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,508

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,372

4
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,960

5
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:24,788
- A Phantom? 
 - Yes.

6
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:27,825
We call evil spirits phantoms.

7
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:29,691
And I came here because seven of the phantom beads

8
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:33,266
that keep phantoms sealed were stolen from where we store them.

9
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:39,738
It is the same thing I told you yesterday!

10
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:43,101
I know...

11
00:00:43,101 --> 00:00:44,829
but I was so flustered yesterday

12
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:47,805
that I can't remember a thing.

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:56,650

14
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,236
Cute pen. Where did you get it?

15
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:02,395
Just study.

16
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:10,720
It seems like he doesn't remember a single thing from last night.

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,080
Of course.

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,092
Usually, the memory of being possessed by a phantom gets erased immediately.

19
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:19,353
Do you think another Phantom will show up at our school?

20
00:01:19,353 --> 00:01:20,489
Probably.

21
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,916
Since we only caught one so far.

22
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,044
So we probably have six more to go.

23
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,555
What are you going to do when another phantom appears?

24
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:31,841
Well...

25
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,568
I should catch it.

26
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:40,181
But... didn't you say that you're a trainee?

27
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:42,877
Is that the only thing you remember?

28
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:48,947
Anyway, are you sure you can handle it on your own?

29
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:50,685
Yesterday, Eun Ho...

30
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:52,495
I mean, the phantom...

31
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:54,889
It was no joke.

32
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:55,942
It's fine.

33
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:59,602
I may be a trainee, but I'm still an official hunter.

34
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:04,420
But isn't it better to work as a pair than to work alone?

35
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,344
What?

36
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:09,545
What I'm saying is...

37
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:13,449
I could be quite helpful.

38
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:17,536
Are you saying... that you want to help me seal the Phantoms?

39
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:20,878
Well... If it's all right with you.

40
00:02:25,743 --> 00:02:27,363
Don't you want to?

41
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,327
Why would I not want to? I would definitely be thankful if you would help.

42
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:33,492
You're super strong, right?

43
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:37,723
But this has to be a secret between just the two of us.

44
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,628
The two of us?

45
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,133
The two of us, yes.

46
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,024
I'll be right back then.

47
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:53,123
Where are you going?

48
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:54,282
The library.

49
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:57,977
I should look for the warp one more time before lunch is over.

50
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,719
You remember the warp that disappeared, right?

51
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,752
Yes. Do you want me to tag along?

52
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:06,293
No, you said you have baseball practice.

53
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:10,040
And we might attract other kids' attention.

54
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,059
Wouldn't it be easier to look for it at night if you're worried about that?

55
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,436
It's okay.

56
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:18,296
Not many students use the library during the afternoon.

57
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:22,481
And the kids here don't read. They're just on their phones the whole time.

58
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:24,278
See you later then!

59
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,500
- He's so cool. He's stunning. 
 - Wow, seriously...

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,293
Awesome.

61
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:48,211
He's so handsome.

62
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:51,514
Gi Wu! You're so cute!

63
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,726
It must be nice to be you.

64
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,572
Since you're good-looking and popular.

65
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:03,225
Are you popular because you're good-looking?

66
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:05,086
What's this popularity talk all of a sudden?

67
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:09,430
Dude, popularity makes life easier.

68
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,752
You don't realize it because it's everyday life for you.

69
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,973
It's because of Ha Na, isn't it?

70
00:04:28,498 --> 00:04:30,278
Do you like her that much?

71
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:32,680
Yeah.

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,432
Just looking at her makes me happy.

73
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:36,693
Why do you just look at her?

74
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,574
Go tell her how you feel.

75
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:43,307
If my life was as easy as yours, I would've told her already.

76
00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:45,893
Who said my life was easy?

77
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,705
When it comes to one-sided crushes,

78
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,673
it's tough for everyone.

79
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,657
What do you know about one-sided crushes?

80
00:04:57,878 --> 00:04:59,865
Anyway,

81
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:02,660
if you like her so much, at least send her some signals.

82
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,463
I know, but...

83
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:09,625
I'm afraid she might reject me.

84
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,993
Still,

85
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:13,898
it's better than regretting it later.

86
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:17,041
That's also true.

87
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:18,406
Whatever.

88
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:21,954
I'm not you or Do Gyeom.

89
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:24,749
Who's Do Gyeom?

90
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,186
Don't you know him?

91
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:34,350
 He's the heartthrob of Seonghon High School.

92
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,429
 I've never heard of him.

93
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:40,907
 Well, the only thing on your mind is baseball.

94
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:43,963
Do Gyeom, this is for you.

95
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:45,678
Thanks.

96
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,700

97
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,740

98
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,860

99
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:06,223
It's still not here.

100
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:10,180
Seriously, where is it?

101
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,320

102
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,765
I see you a lot these days.

103
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,042
You're the freshman named Kang Yu Na, right?

104
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:35,603
Ah, yes.

105
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,394
Thank you.

106
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:44,604
No problem.

107
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,148
I had nothing to do anyway.

108
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:53,521
By the way, did you find the thing you were looking for?

109
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:57,791
No, not yet.

110
00:07:01,106 --> 00:07:03,923
If you lost it here, I could help you find it.

111
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,117
No, it's all right.

112
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:08,786
Only I can recognize it...

113
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:11,480
I see.

114
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,701
Well, it must be something very special since you're looking for it every day.

115
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,461
Yes.

116
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,072
Then...

117
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:25,161
Don't try too hard to find it.

118
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:28,280
Excuse me?

119
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,380
Usually, you can't find lost things if you look hard for them.

120
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,458
And when you forget about it, it suddenly shows up.

121
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:41,040
That's true.

122
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,421
I hope it helped.

123
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,347
See you later then.

124
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:59,587
 When you forget about it, it will suddenly show up?

125
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,649
 That is true, actually.

126
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,996
 Instead of wasting my time searching around the library every day,

127
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,505
 I should just...

128
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:13,170
All right! I should focus on finding phantoms for the time being.

129
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,768
Let's do this!

130
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:24,665
Ji Hyuk!

131
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:25,892
Is something bothering you?

132
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:27,798
Nope! I'm fine.

133
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:30,009
Okay.

134
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,096
What is it?

135
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:46,342
Since you're so curious...

136
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:49,579
I'm confused because of what Choi Gi Wu said earlier.

137
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:52,767
Why? What did he say?

138
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,738
He said that if I like a girl, I should confess to her with no regrets.

139
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,456
It seems like he said the right thing.

140
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,350
What's the problem?

141
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,537
I'm the problem.

142
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:05,024
The girl I like is...

143
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:08,221
pretty, has a lot of people who like her, and is kind.

144
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,980
But I know I'm not.

145
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,643
I'm afraid she'll reject me if I tell her my feelings.

146
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:15,263
Why is that important?

147
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,131
It's all about whether you two get along.

148
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:20,457
Humans...

149
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:22,111
Humans?

150
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:28,267
Are you in the middle of eighth-grade syndrome*? 
  (*a term used to describe young people who are overly dramatic or prone to viewing themselves as more special than others)

151
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:33,358
Anyway, you should go for it if you really like her.

152
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:35,449
Tell her that you like her, okay?

153
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,294
You should confess to her!

154
00:09:38,633 --> 00:09:39,954
All right.

155
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,131
Then if I do confess to her,

156
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:44,433
where should I do it?

157
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,602
Let's see...

158
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,130
A safe place could be...

159
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,821
the classroom?

160
00:09:53,034 --> 00:09:54,120
Good idea.

161
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:58,669
Okay, then I should tell her to see me in the classroom after school.

162
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,708
Thanks, Yu Na!

163
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:03,828
Hey, you forgot this!

164
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:05,787
You can have it!

165
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,754
What a productive day. I decided on what I should do

166
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:20,027
and helped a friend find love.

167
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:27,284
It'd be a perfect day if only a phantom would appear.

168
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:29,195
Hey, Kang Yu Na!

169
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:37,368
Oh! You are...

170
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:42,457
I've seen you somewhere...

171
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:43,764
What do you mean you've seen me somewhere?

172
00:10:43,764 --> 00:10:46,320
You saw me at school, every day for two months.

173
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:49,831
I sit right behind you!

174
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:53,319
Oh, right! We're in the same class, right?

175
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,046
I'm sorry, Su Yeon.

176
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,676
That's not my name.

177
00:10:57,676 --> 00:11:00,686
Oops, I'm sorry Su Yong.

178
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:03,219
Stop! It's Su Yeong.

179
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:05,114
Han Su Yeong.

180
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,290
Whatever, I'm invisible at school anyway.

181
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,640
My name doesn't matter right now.

182
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:14,840
What matters is...

183
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,928
what a hunter of the demon realm is doing at our school.

184
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:28,846
Stop eating and say something.

185
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:31,198
What were you talking about earlier?

186
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:35,577
You already know.

187
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,897
I have no idea.

188
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:42,504
If you're going to pretend that you don't know, why did you bring me here?

189
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:44,211
That's because!

190
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:51,010
I was just afraid that other kids might misunderstand our conversation.

191
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,137
What is this about demon realms and hunters? That's total nonsense...

192
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:01,578
That's a Soulance, isn't it?

193
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:07,401
Wh-What?

194
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:12,764
It's my first time seeing an actual Soulance in real life.

195
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:15,258
Can I try it on?

196
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:17,985
What... are you?

197
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:21,755
Me? I'm just a normal high school student.

198
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:23,425
But...

199
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:25,252
How?

200
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,380
How do I know about the demon realm?

201
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:37,089
It's because of this.

202
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,285
This book...

203
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:56,358
It's already been two hours.

204
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,965
Don't cry, it's not like you didn't know about it.

205
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:23,458
I didn't. That's why I confessed to him.

206
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,495
This is humiliating.

207
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:28,914
Don't be. Do Gyeom is famous for not going out with anyone.

208
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:30,013
It's all right.

209
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:33,272
Still, I thought it'd be different for me.

210
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,989
I like him so much...

211
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:38,525
I really like him...

212
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:45,891
So annoying.

213
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:49,537
Ji Hyuk said he wanted to see me in the classroom earlier.

214
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,889
I could tell that he was going to ask me out.

215
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:53,908
Do you think we suit each other?

216
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:55,443
Are we in the same league?

217
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:57,300
No way, how's that possible?

218
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,470
Ji Hyuk is nowhere near your league!

219
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,307
Right? I'm so offended.

220
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:14,493
What? So annoying?

221
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:16,755
"I'm so offended"?

222
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,733
How could she look down on my feelings like that?

223
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,035
Isn't that too much?

224
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:30,560
♫  I spend my days not being someone you hold in your heart  ♫

225
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:33,910
Who are you?

226
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:39,890
♫  I will never let go of the version of you I have in my memories  ♫

227
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,601
You're so good!

228
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,465
Ji Hyuk! You're so cool!

229
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,875
When did you secretly debut?

230
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,626
What are you talking about?

231
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,831
Aren't the kids at the back your fans?

232
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:44,868
They're finally acknowledging me now.

233
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:49,306
Excuse me...

234
00:15:49,306 --> 00:15:51,242
Sorry, I don't usually eat these...

235
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,943
Whatever...

236
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,839
Have some of these while you practice.

237
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,215
You can leave it there and go.

238
00:15:58,215 --> 00:16:00,441
Okay, good luck!

239
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:21,943
Ji Hyuk... is acting a little weird, right?

240
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:25,117
Yeah, totally weird.

241
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,650
That was stern.

242
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:29,413
Are you sulking because the kids are no longer interested in you?

243
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:33,423
No way! It's because it is really strange.

244
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:39,006
The girls are suddenly following Ji Hyuk around,

245
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:42,784
and Ji Hyuk is acting differently from his usual self.

246
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:47,267
Right... I'm sure something's up.

247
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,975
From what I can tell, it...

248
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,077
It must be the phantom!

249
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,396
You were going to say that, right?

250
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:56,206
Who are you?

251
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:59,451
What do you mean? We've been in the same class for two months now.

252
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,787
Do you really think that's what I meant?

253
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,912
I know you're Han Do Yeong.

254
00:17:03,912 --> 00:17:05,816
No, I'm not.

255
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:10,068
Hey, you should know your classmate's name. Han Su Yong!

256
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:12,739
It's Han Su Yeong!

257
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,725
Anyway! How do you know about the phantom?

258
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:22,231
He found out about phantoms before through a book.

259
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:23,925
A book?

260
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,928
What book?

261
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:38,302
I'm sorry, Do Gyeom.

262
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:41,216
Oh? What are you sorry about?

263
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:45,722
I'll be taking everything.

264
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:48,835
What do you mean?

265
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:53,221
You'll find out soon.

266
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,473
Ji Hyuk, what are your plans for today?

267
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:23,960
Oh Ha Na, why didn't you come yesterday?

268
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,837
I was busy.

269
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:27,865
You should've let me know that you wouldn't be coming then.

270
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:29,903
I don't have your number.

271
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:31,601
You have my messenger ID.

272
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,312
Oh, right.

273
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,424
I spent over two hours waiting for you.

274
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:38,674
Who told you to wait? It's not like we made an appointment.

275
00:18:38,674 --> 00:18:40,240
You just told me to come.

276
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,695
Ha Na.

277
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:44,039
You're so annoying.

278
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:54,307
Wait!

279
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,614
Ji Hyuk, I'm sorry about yesterday.

280
00:18:57,614 --> 00:19:01,229
What are you doing after school? I can wait if you're busy.

281
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:03,840
I'm free tomorrow too.

282
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:06,614
Don't be clingy.

283
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:09,364
Can you give me one more chance?

284
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:12,655
Ji Hyuk!

285
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:23,244
 It's Dras.

286
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,925
- Dras? 
 - Yes.

287
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:31,111
It's the phantom that makes you popular by charming others.

288
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:36,156
Phantoms usually stick to the person who needs their abilities.

289
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,413
In that case, everything makes sense now!

290
00:19:42,362 --> 00:19:46,248
But... Why yesterday of all days?

291
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:50,142
 He said that if I like a girl, I should confess to her.

292
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:51,960
 I'm afraid she'll reject me if I tell her my feelings.

293
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,872
 You should confess to her!

294
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:58,647
It's probably because things didn't go his way yesterday.

295
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:02,065
Anyway, we're sure about the phantom's identity now.

296
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:04,324
So what should we do now?

297
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:05,444
We should seal it.

298
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:08,848
We can't let the phantom cause harm to other students.

299
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:13,037
But... It has to be at night when nobody is around.

300
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:16,173
How are you going to call Ji Hyuk out at night?

301
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,358
Since Ji Hyuk... wants to be more popular right now.

302
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:23,479
We could take advantage of that.

303
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:26,082
"Wants to be more popular..."?

304
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,877
Should I pretend to confess to him?

305
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:32,005
Wouldn't that be enough to make him come?

306
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:34,566
Confess?

307
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,125
Yeah! That's perfect!

308
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,779
No, no! I don't think so.

309
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,206
That seems a little dangerous.

310
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:44,976
We should think more carefully...

311
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,386
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

312
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:51,799
I have something to tell you, can you meet me in Class 1 later?

313
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:54,145
I sent it!

314
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:56,942
He says yes!

315
00:20:56,942 --> 00:20:58,923
That's great!

316
00:21:00,364 --> 00:21:02,837
Why did he reply so quickly?

317
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:06,514
Should we meet up again later then?

318
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:11,845
We?

319
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:13,513
Yeah!

320
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:17,701
Does that include you, too?

321
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:19,277
Yeah!

322
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,758
Is it because I could get in the way?

323
00:21:24,758 --> 00:21:26,261
Get in the way? Absolutely not.

324
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:29,936
You've been a great help in confirming the pattern of Dras!

325
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:31,102
I can help you more!

326
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:33,725
No, it's fine.

327
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,422
But you'll regret it if you leave me out.

328
00:21:36,422 --> 00:21:38,880
It's really fine.

329
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:45,827
The two of us will take care of it from here.

330
00:21:45,827 --> 00:21:47,797
So don't worry.

331
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:49,629
See you tomorrow.

332
00:22:00,072 --> 00:22:02,612
Can you take me with you, please?

333
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,341
You're late.

334
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,802
Well, I'm not the one who's desperate.

335
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:28,805
Why did you want to see me?

336
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,999
Why do you think?

337
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,400
Since you wanted to see me alone at this late hour,

338
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,271
isn't it obvious?

339
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,882
You're right.

340
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,039
I knew it.

341
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,138
Everyone's in love with me.

342
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:48,896
Every single kid in this school.

343
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,247
Sorry about this,

344
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:20,588
but you're not my type.

345
00:23:25,556 --> 00:23:27,314
Do you think it's funny?

346
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:40,043
Stop it, you guys!

347
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:44,656
Don't hit each other!

348
00:23:49,787 --> 00:23:51,896
What's that noise...

349
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:54,707
It can't be...

350
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,223
What do we do?

351
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,233
I don't know.

352
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:40,120
Hey! Get a hold of yourself!

353
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,279
Do you think asking them will work?

354
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,311
Isn't there a different way?

355
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:49,968
Aim for the eyes! Cover Ji Hyuk's eyes.

356
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:53,433
Dras can control people through their eyes.

357
00:26:29,843 --> 00:26:33,222
Will Ji Hyuk and the others be all right?

358
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,394
They'll be fine.

359
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:40,214
If they get some good sleep, they'll forget all about today.

360
00:26:40,214 --> 00:26:42,234
That's a relief!

361
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:46,946
Although there was a crisis, we caught the second phantom safely, too, right?

362
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:54,012
Yeah, all thanks to you.

363
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,980
You knew Dras' weakness.

364
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,315
Did you really read the whole thing?

365
00:26:58,315 --> 00:27:00,293
Read what thing?

366
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,455
The book from earlier?

367
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,763
What is this?

368
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,365
The Book of Phantoms.

369
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,630
"The Book of Phantoms"?

370
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:18,319
It's an ancient book that contains information about the Phantoms of the demon realm.

371
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,416
It's a very rare book, but Su Yeong had it somehow.

372
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,501
It's been in my house since I was a kid.

373
00:27:24,501 --> 00:27:27,111
It was passed down by my grandfather.

374
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:31,049
Let me see.

375
00:27:37,902 --> 00:27:39,649
What's this about?

376
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:42,319
It's hard to read because it's written in secret codes.

377
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:44,446
It's complex and covers a lot of subjects.

378
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:47,481
No wonder...

379
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:49,693
What does this say?

380
00:27:58,185 --> 00:27:59,525
Don't you know it?

381
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:01,825
I'm not the only one who can't read it.

382
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:05,984
Only the Master Hunters get to read the Book of Phantoms.

383
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:09,121
I can't believe I get to meet an actual Phantom Hunter!

384
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:12,173
Soulance!

385
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:14,953
Just as I thought, it's dazzling.

386
00:28:14,953 --> 00:28:17,145
Hey, Su Yeong!

387
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,397
What?

388
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:23,369
Uh... Let's go grab something to eat. It's my treat.

389
00:28:24,317 --> 00:28:25,663
Fine.

390
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,772
If it's your treat.

391
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:35,888
 But...

392
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:38,616
 What was that lightning from earlier?

393
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:52,000

394
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,750
♫  Let's get louder, louder  ♫

395
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:16,320
♫  To me who dug in deep, Chaser Chaser, it's deep  ♫

396
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,260
♫  To me who gives thick darkness, Chaser Chaser  ♫

397
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,650
♫  It's the truth  ♫

398
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,220
♫  Run without hesitation, you're missing the hands reaching  ♫

399
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,560
♫  My shadow is disappearing, the loneliness enlarged in fear  ♫

400
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,700
♫  Even my actions change, intensely, zap, zap, zap  ♫
