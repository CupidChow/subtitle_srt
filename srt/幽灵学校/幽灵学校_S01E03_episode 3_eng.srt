1
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:06,398

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,708

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,272

4
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:22,080

5
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:32,323
This place is... The Hall of Magic...

6
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:37,019
But I don't remember going through a warp.

7
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:40,356
What happened?

8
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:09,546
Excuse me! Are you all right?

9
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:11,396
Hello?

10
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:16,709
Glow?

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,841
Glow!

12
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:25,750
Glow! Glow! Glow!

13
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,820
Glow!

14
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:36,910

15
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:55,663
What did you do last night for your face to be in this condition?

16
00:01:56,903 --> 00:02:00,194
I couldn't sleep last night because of nightmares.

17
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:10,230
Here!

18
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:17,586
Didn't you bring it to eat yourself?

19
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:20,205
It's all right. I have more.

20
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,852
Why do you always carry around two snacks in your pocket?

21
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:30,007
Is it because...

22
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,311
You...

23
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:48,693
got this as a buy-one-get-one too?

24
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:56,110
Yes, you're right! I got it as a buy-one-get-one.

25
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,150
Where is that convenience store?

26
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,240
They're always doing promotions.

27
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,153
- I'm sorry. 
 - No, it's okay.

28
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:07,060
Hold on. Oh, no... I'm really sorry.

29
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:10,261
But you didn't get anything on it...

30
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:13,251
I'll be more careful next time.

31
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:15,803
I'm so sorry.

32
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,618
I feel sorry because she apologizes too much.

33
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:27,841
There is nothing we can do. She's used to apologizing.

34
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,592
Why? Who is she?

35
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,488
Yang Ju Hui.

36
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,510

37
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,060
 She's in Class 3. I think she gets bullied by her classmates.

38
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,010

39
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,817
Hey, what's that smell?

40
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:05,929
What? Who used the bathroom?

41
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,410
It must be her.

42
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,010
Seriously.

43
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,368
No wonder it stinks.

44
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:16,174
Did you see the look on her face?

45
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,810
Throw it harder!

46
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,140
Don't just throw it in any direction.

47
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,801
You're ruining it! Why didn't you catch the ball?

48
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,595
Sorry.

49
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:36,959
What are you doing?

50
00:04:40,687 --> 00:04:43,432
Hey, are you going to keep spacing out?

51
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,520
What are you going to do?

52
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:47,714
I should stop them.

53
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:51,023
If they could be stopped, they would have ages ago.

54
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:02,183
What's going on? Why are you guys fighting during class?

55
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:06,755
We're not fighting. We're just hanging out together. Right?

56
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:10,391
What happened to your clothes?

57
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:13,237
Ju Hui fell on the soccer field.

58
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,157
Is it true?

59
00:05:16,157 --> 00:05:18,048
It's true, right?

60
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:20,770
Yes.

61
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,450
You should've been careful.

62
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:30,790
Group 3, get ready for your P.E. test!

63
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,120
Hey, stand up straight.

64
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,412
The school has tried several times to refer it to the school violence commission,

65
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:42,400
but there's nothing we can do about it because the victim denies it.

66
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,669
Why does Ju Hui act like that?

67
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,104
Probably because she's scared.

68
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:57,564
Hey, pass me the ball.

69
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:02,277
What are you doing? I said, pass me the ball.

70
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:07,949
- Hey! 
 - Forget it.

71
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:09,431
So Jin's always like that.

72
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:12,479
Yes, let's stop playing.

73
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:23,511
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,376
It's okay.

75
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:29,069
I'm really sorry.

76
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,140
I said it was fine.

77
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:37,171
So Jin...

78
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,568
Thank you for earlier.

79
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,822
You should do it yourself next time.

80
00:07:00,737 --> 00:07:04,857
They're bullying you because you don't fight back.

81
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,701
You should say something next time.

82
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:09,612
That's easy for you to say.

83
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:14,072
Since you don't have to put in effort for people not to bother you.

84
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:16,273
But...

85
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:18,496
that doesn't apply to me.

86
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:23,265
I'm... scared.

87
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:29,006
Then live like that for the rest of your life.

88
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:39,692
Hello?

89
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:42,144
Now?

90
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,954
Where?

91
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,807
Okay.

92
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:53,923
Hey!

93
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,850
What took you so long?

94
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,009
I came as quickly as I could...

95
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,134
Hey! Where is my chocolate bread?

96
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:17,004
It's right there.

97
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:19,849
There are only three of them. I told you to get four.

98
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,601
Where is my boyfriend's?

99
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:25,900
What? No, I'm sure I bought four of them.

100
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,482
Look at you! That's a lot of excuses when you should be apologizing.

101
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,247
Hey! Have you gone crazy?

102
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:37,940
Those girls have really lost their minds.

103
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,080
- Give me that one. 
 - What's your problem?

104
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,430
I don't want to.

105
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,737
- What's up with you? 
 - What was that?

106
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,380
But it was hot!

107
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,954
What do you mean it was hot?

108
00:08:51,954 --> 00:08:54,967
- Are you crazy? 
 - What's wrong with you?

109
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,357
Oh... D-Did you...

110
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,198
Do you think she saw the whole thing?

111
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,390
Not sure. I can't tell from her expression.

112
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,115
She looks like her usual self to me.

113
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:29,857
Well... She does have a poker face.

114
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:35,085
You don't think she saw it, right? Right?

115
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,348
It's fine, it's fine. I'm sure nobody saw it, right?

116
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,389
Think about it. How could an average person show no response after seeing something like that?

117
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,900
Yes. That's true.

118
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,150
Maybe she really didn't see it.

119
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,245
Right? Do you think so?

120
00:09:57,789 --> 00:10:00,520
Then...

121
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:02,776
Problem solved!

122
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,157
Is that it?

123
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,560
You're very... positive.

124
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,325
Of course! What's the point of overthinking?

125
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:19,618
If I concluded that she didn't see it, I should focus on what to do next.

126
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:24,707
It's about time the third phantom appears.

127
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,934
Why are we going to the science lab all of a sudden?

128
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,308
You'll know when you get there. It's something important.

129
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,011
What is it?

130
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:56,213
It's...

131
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,083
What's that?

132
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,175
What are you doing? Open it!

133
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:07,491
It seems like you're acting up lately, so we're teaching you a lesson.

134
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:10,736
We'll come back in the morning, so until then, stay and reflect on yourself.

135
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,504
- Let's go, girls. 
 - Bye.

136
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:15,031
Guys! I'm really sorry!

137
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:18,635
Please open the door! I'm sorry!

138
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,935
Guys, I was wrong! Please open the door! Please?

139
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,385
Wh-Who are you?

140
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,650
Did you see Ju Hui's face earlier?

141
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,521
Freaking hilarious.

142
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,793
I know, she got all scared.

143
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:06,004
And she was like, "I'm sorry."

144
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:10,270
Kids like her need to be taught a lesson...

145
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,850
- Man... 
 - What?

146
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,224
I left my phone at the lab.

147
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,051
Yang Ju Hui, my phone...

148
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,417
What? Where did she go?

149
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,379
Did you hide or something?

150
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,520
She's really gone.

151
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,283
Guys, she must've gotten so scared that she vanished.

152
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,796
What?

153
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,441
What are you guys doing?

154
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:50,915
Quit joking around.

155
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,354
It was one of the freshmen.

156
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,743
I heard someone saw a ghost.

157
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:36,354
A ghost appeared last night.

158
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:39,484
I don't know the details either...

159
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,498
Is everything all right?

160
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,118
What's with the vibe?

161
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,478
Last night,

162
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,873
there was a ghost at our school.

163
00:14:08,873 --> 00:14:10,858
A ghost?

164
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,336
Girls in Class 3 fainted after seeing the ghost.

165
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:17,990
And they were sent to the hospital when the janitor found them early in the morning.

166
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,384
Where were they found?

167
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,823
At the new building,

168
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:28,550
in the science lab.

169
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,321

170
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,598
Are you scared?

171
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,207
No...

172
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:48,140

173
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,858
I don't think we should go in...

174
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,158
Go in. Hurry!

175
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,692
- Do you feel the energy? 
 - Yes.

176
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,740
It's not a ghost. It's definitely a phantom...

177
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,709
I didn't expect to see you at the science lab.

178
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,578
And you're with a friend.

179
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,389
Hello.

180
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,708
- Have you guys heard the rumor, too? 
 - Yes.

181
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,079
We heard about the ghost, so we got curious.

182
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,258
Yes, well. It's strange, isn't it?

183
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,595
Why would a Drowned Ghost appear in a place like this?

184
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,175
A Drowned Ghost?

185
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:50,560
Yes. Didn't you know?

186
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,010
There was also a Virgin Ghost and an 8-foot-tall Ghost.

187
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,579
All at once.

188
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,805
What?

189
00:15:56,805 --> 00:16:00,968
But they normally don't show up together.

190
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,930
I know, right?

191
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,824
I wonder what's happening.

192
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,440
I should get going then.

193
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,890
Okay.

194
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:24,249
The girl who saw the Drowned Ghost has trauma from nearly drowning.

195
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,694
It'll get worse due to this accident.

196
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,820
I'm worried.

197
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,124
If what Do Gyeom said was right,

198
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,970
the third phantom is Scared.

199
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,760
- "Scared"? 
 - Yes!

200
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,034
It's the phantom that uses the opponent's fear.

201
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:54,371
It has the ability to show a vision of one's worst fear.

202
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:59,551
That explains why three different ghosts appeared at the same time.

203
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,562
They each saw what they feared.

204
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,096
That's right.

205
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,401
Thanks to Do Gyeom, we found out which Phantom it is really quickly.

206
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,807
The whole school will know about that info by the end of the day anyways.

207
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,131
By the way, shouldn't we find out who's been possessed by the phantom?

208
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,900
I guess we should find the kid who always wanted to be feared by others.

209
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,287
Who wanted to be feared by others...?

210
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,635
Do you have something to tell me?

211
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,393
Everyone is afraid of something.

212
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:00,754
What?

213
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:04,816
What are you afraid of?

214
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:09,962
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

215
00:18:09,962 --> 00:18:13,707
It's just... I got curious.

216
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,471
I wonder what your biggest fear is, So Jin.

217
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,621
Can I speak with you later?

218
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:34,079
 If it's someone who wants to be feared by others...

219
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,999
 Ju Hui seems to be the perfect suspect.

220
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:40,769
 But there weren't any reactions...

221
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:43,997
All right.

222
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,333
Should I try summoning it?

223
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:17,270
Scared has a weakness for fear,

224
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,381
so I thought it would come if we watched a scary movie.

225
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,090
But why would it come? You guys don't look scared at all.

226
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,075
But we can't pretend to be scared.

227
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:31,759
It's true. Movies are just fictional.

228
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,347
I fear things that are more realistic.

229
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:38,868
Like... clowns.

230
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:44,816
What about you, Gi Wu? What are you scared of?

231
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,485
Me?

232
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:49,788
I don't have anything that I'm scared of.

233
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:55,251
I saw you running away from your baseball coach last time.

234
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:57,551
Hey, that's because...

235
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:02,501
Yes, I'm scared of our coach.

236
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,478
What about you, Yu Na?

237
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:09,297
Let's see...

238
00:20:09,297 --> 00:20:11,890
What do I fear...

239
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,690
- Isn't this where... 
 - That's right. It's the science lab.

240
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:48,009
She looks a bit angry.

241
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:51,845
It looks like she's fed on enough fear.

242
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:56,868
It doesn't matter one way or the other.

243
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:08,461
What do you fear the most?

244
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:10,595
It's not you.

245
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:21,374
Su Yeong! Pull yourself together!

246
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:22,696
Su Yeong!

247
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:26,420
Clowns... Clowns are following me.

248
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:37,735
Su Yeong! What's wrong?

249
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:44,073
I'm sorry.

250
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:47,215
You think you could get on the roster after slacking off like this, huh?

251
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:49,595
Choi Gi Wu, you're off of the team!

252
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:52,539
No, no!

253
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:54,302
I was wrong.

254
00:21:54,302 --> 00:21:58,223
It's all my fault, I'm sorry.

255
00:21:58,223 --> 00:22:01,997
Gi Wu! Wake up!

256
00:22:01,997 --> 00:22:04,275
I'm sorry, Coach.

257
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:06,814
What's wrong with you, too?

258
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:15,773
I'm sorry, Coach, I'm sorry.

259
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:20,743
What is...

260
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:25,017
your worst fear?

261
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:35,070
This place is... Glow?

262
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,189
Glow!

263
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,922
Glow! Glow!

264
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:45,109
Glow!

265
00:23:09,503 --> 00:23:11,968
You get a hold of yourself.

266
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,867
Didn't you hear me? I said, get a hold of yourself.

267
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,437
Hurry and do some magic or something.

268
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:49,929
You're...

269
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:53,611
not scared of me?

270
00:23:59,392 --> 00:24:02,415
I'm not scared of a phantom like you!

271
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:16,920

272
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,168
When did you find out?

273
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,953
You use magic in public.

274
00:24:30,953 --> 00:24:33,279
How could I not notice that?

275
00:24:34,077 --> 00:24:35,986
She's right about that.

276
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:43,025
Then why did you pretend that you didn't know?

277
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,079
That's because...

278
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:52,104
It's none of my business?

279
00:24:56,275 --> 00:25:00,126
But I guess it is my business now.

280
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:03,962
I was close to becoming a victim today.

281
00:25:05,345 --> 00:25:07,729
It was horrible.

282
00:25:07,729 --> 00:25:09,673
Those clowns.

283
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,742
Not at all!

284
00:25:12,742 --> 00:25:14,963
It wasn't that scary for me.

285
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:16,563
Oh, I see.

286
00:25:16,563 --> 00:25:20,828
Then who was that kid who was shaking like a leaf earlier?

287
00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:27,615
Whatever. Everything worked out well today.

288
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:31,178
And I'm sure the bullies will stop pushing Ju Hui around.

289
00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:33,236
Do you think so?

290
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:35,881
They must've learned their lessons through this incident.

291
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:40,381
If they haven't learned their lessons, I can just teach them a lesson.

292
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,670
I think you're scarier than my coach.

293
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:49,704
Yes, you're as scary as a clown.

294
00:25:57,033 --> 00:26:00,736
We have four phantoms to catch, right?

295
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,411
Yes.

296
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:07,114
All right, then shall we hurry...

297
00:26:08,424 --> 00:26:10,384
and catch them?

298
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:24,340
♫  I'm alone in a world you can't see  ♫

299
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:31,740
♫  And I had a fear that no one knew  ♫

300
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:39,190
♫  Your touch to me, someone who had no expectations  ♫

301
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,360
♫  This world  ♫
