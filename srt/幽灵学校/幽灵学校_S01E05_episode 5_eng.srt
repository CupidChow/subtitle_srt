1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,398

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,510

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,306

4
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,022

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:32,000

6
00:00:36,527 --> 00:00:38,898
Seonbae Do Gyeom...

7
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:44,994
Is that...

8
00:00:44,994 --> 00:00:47,409
a Soulance?

9
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:50,855
Yes, it is.

10
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:53,574
But it's a black Soulance...

11
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:55,468
Does that mean you're Master Hunter...

12
00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:57,503
Seriste?

13
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,461
I'm honored that you recognize me.

14
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:07,121
M-Ma... Master?

15
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:08,981
Why are you shocked?

16
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:10,576
What is that?

17
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:13,643
They're the strongest Phantom Hunters. They're at the top of the ranking.

18
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:16,409
A trainee like Yu Na doesn't even compare to him.

19
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:19,175
Wait...

20
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:23,424
Then why did the Master Hunter sit back this whole time?

21
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:26,570
You could've just caught the phantoms yourself.

22
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,696
As you saw just now, my Soulance is broken,

23
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:33,218
so I can't seal the phantoms myself.

24
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,541
Hmph.

25
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:38,439
I wasn't here to seal the phantoms in the first place.

26
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,778
I was here for a different mission, but the warp disappeared, so I couldn't go back.

27
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:44,370
Right, the warp.

28
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,385
Why did that disappear all of a sudden?

29
00:01:49,324 --> 00:01:51,092
I'm not sure...

30
00:01:51,092 --> 00:01:54,196
But I think it has to do with the beads disappearing.

31
00:01:55,629 --> 00:02:00,345
What exactly... is happening in the magic world?

32
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:03,376
I don't know.

33
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:08,176
But... I know what we should do right now.

34
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:12,143
First, we have to seal all the phantoms that have been released.

35
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:14,797
That's true.

36
00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:18,350
By the way, I have a question, too.

37
00:02:18,943 --> 00:02:22,860
Yu Na, why do you have a Soulance?

38
00:02:24,506 --> 00:02:27,280
There's no way Glow would have given it to you.

39
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,802
Did you... steal it?

40
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:33,085
N-No way!

41
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:38,516
I'm only... borrowing it for a little while.

42
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:41,406
Really?

43
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:43,106
It's interesting.

44
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:47,019
A soulance won't work unless it's used by its owner.

45
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:53,131
Well, anyway, I'm glad I have you right now.

46
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:57,121
You're the only person who can seal the phantoms.

47
00:02:57,749 --> 00:03:01,031
When you finish collecting all seven sacred beads, hand them over to me.

48
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:04,502
It's too dangerous for you to hold onto them.

49
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,888
Hold on. What?

50
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,057
So Yu Na does all the dangerous work

51
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:16,111
and... you will take all the credit for it?

52
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:17,912
I wouldn't do that.

53
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:23,049
When you collect all the beads, the phantoms will come after Yu Na.

54
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,359
You can handle it until then, right?

55
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:27,590
Of course, don't worry.

56
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,226
I'll make sure to seal the remaining three phantoms.

57
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:45,779
I'll count on you then.

58
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:47,379
Okay.

59
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:55,693
Okay, I'll do my best.

60
00:03:56,835 --> 00:03:59,893
"I'll count on you"? Yeah, right.

61
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:02,600
Like he can do anything with that broken sword.

62
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:06,453
Hey, nice form.

63
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:09,044
That looks like a new phone. Did you get a new one?

64
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:10,008
Yes.

65
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:14,475
While I was at it, I just bought the most expensive one.

66
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,878
The quality is amazing.

67
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:22,653
Put your phone away and start practicing.

68
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:27,561
Choi Gi Wu, how does it feel to be the MVP?

69
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,670
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

70
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,787
I'm okay.

71
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:42,328
I'm really sorry.

72
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:45,404
It's okay. Good luck with your practice!

73
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,550
I thought he would get angry.

74
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,991
You're lucky it was him.

75
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,297
Who is he?

76
00:04:58,297 --> 00:04:59,991
You don't know him?

77
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,828
He's Bae Hyeon Wu from Class 7. He plays the violin.

78
00:05:04,828 --> 00:05:08,145
He's talented and has a great personality.

79
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,251
He's the total package.

80
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:14,893
Just like me, right?

81
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:18,334
Let's get back to practice.

82
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:21,540
Hey! Aren't I similar?

83
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:28,080

84
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:38,494
- Hey, Hyeon Wu, you're here. 
 - Jin Tae, you're early.

85
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:41,006
- I was waiting for you. 
 - For me?

86
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,213
I wanted to ask you something.

87
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,578
You know the finger position you taught me last time.

88
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,413
Do I move my finger like this?

89
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,383
I think it'd be better if you played in the third position.

90
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,031
Oh, like this?

91
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:53,894
Thanks.

92
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:03,719
Honestly, I think you're much better than my tutor.

93
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:04,869
I'm so jealous.

94
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:06,516
Come on, you're good, too.

95
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:09,388
Not as good as you.

96
00:06:09,388 --> 00:06:11,048
I want to be as good as you are someday.

97
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:13,328
Enough of that. Let's go to the store.

98
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:15,551
Sure! It's your treat, right?

99
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,085
Why always me? You should pay this time.

100
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,309
Thanks, man.

101
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:24,399
- Oh, guys. 
 - Hello.

102
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,695
I was on my way to your club room.

103
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:32,847
I got a call from the broadcasting station, and they're going to start a classic audition program next month.

104
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:34,597
What? Really?

105
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:38,214
The prize money is big, and a great opportunity to get your face out there.

106
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:39,540
Nice.

107
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,835
Um... But there is one problem...

108
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:47,306
Only one student can represent each school...

109
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:54,735
Decide between yourselves who will go on the show and tell me, okay?

110
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:57,090
- Okay, thank you. 
 - Okay.

111
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,560
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

112
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,085
 So you're saying that...

113
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:14,117
this pattern... matches with this phantom, right?

114
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:15,287
Yes.

115
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:16,811
Then...

116
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:20,899
this pattern is this phantom, right?

117
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,759
It looks like it, but it's not.

118
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,900
Why not?

119
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,205
There is a trap hidden between the pages.

120
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:29,470
What?

121
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,235
What crazy author would create a trap in a book?

122
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,726
Have you guys heard the news?

123
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:37,866
What news?

124
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:41,793
During lunch, the orchestra club will be performing.

125
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:45,373
They want us to vote for the student representing our school at an audition.

126
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:47,331
Really? Sounds fun.

127
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:49,066
I should go watch.

128
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:52,280
Well, obviously, Bae Hyeon Wu will win.

129
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,419
And the next will be... Kim Jin Tae?

130
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,359
It seems like you know everyone in the school.

131
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:59,468
True, and she knows all the gossip.

132
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:03,777
You act like you don't care about others, but you have the most interest in others.

133
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:05,272
Exactly.

134
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:08,029
So where are they performing?

135
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,297
The new building's auditorium.

136
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:34,087
It's my first time watching a performance like this.

137
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:37,199
I guess the main performances haven't started yet.

138
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:14,331
So that was the end of our club performance.

139
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:20,062
We would appreciate it if you could vote for the best violin performance.

140
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,384
Excuse me!

141
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:56,384
You forgot this.

142
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,187
I worked so hard.

143
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:15,467
I could've done better.

144
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,735
It's all because of this crappy violin.

145
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:21,895
I got humiliated,

146
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,331
and I always miss

147
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:28,705
good opportunities!

148
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:35,245
It's unfair that I can't win because I don't own a good violin!

149
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,780
♫  The dream I want to wake up from  ♫

150
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:53,440
♫  I can't ever go back  ♫

151
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,165

152
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,480
What are you doing?

153
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,689
It's so weird. I can't find my textbook.

154
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:14,445
Seriously?

155
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:16,630
My notebook is missing.

156
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,462
Why would someone steal that?

157
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:21,510
I bet you lost them because you can't take care of your stuff.

158
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:30,744
What? Where did my chair go?

159
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,870
Hey! Isn't that my chair?

160
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,082
Yes... It is.

161
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:42,310
But where's your chair?

162
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,253
I gave it to someone.

163
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:46,198
Why would you do that?

164
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:48,133
Hey, Gi Wu!

165
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,497
The practice schedule changed.

166
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:51,659
Why all of a sudden?

167
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:54,822
The coach is busy. See you later then.

168
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,162
Did you come all the way to our class just to tell me that?

169
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:00,462
You could've just texted me.

170
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:02,431
Oh, because I don't have a phone.

171
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:04,414
What? Why not?

172
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:07,387
Did you lose it? Didn't you just get a new one?

173
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:10,324
No. I gave it to someone.

174
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:12,455
Whom?

175
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,120
Your shoes...

176
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,532
look nice.

177
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:31,985
Oh... Here.

178
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:39,581
He seems to be the phantom, right?

179
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,879
Definitely.

180
00:16:00,142 --> 00:16:03,103
The phantom that attached itself to Hyeon Wu is Scirsta.

181
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:05,092
Scirsta?

182
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:08,434
Yes, it's a phantom that's very greedy.

183
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:12,045
It has the power to steal everything it wants.

184
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:14,447
Is its weakness written down here too?

185
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:18,025
The exact moment it finds an object it wants

186
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:19,860
is its weakest point.

187
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,443
Its eyes become glued to the object,

188
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,358
and it drops its guard.

189
00:16:26,865 --> 00:16:31,365
Then we should start by finding out what Hyeon Wu wants.

190
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:34,356
True...

191
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:36,392
But how?

192
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:53,783
I've been wondering how you're so in the know.

193
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:55,889
So this is why.

194
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:19,463
It looks like it's not your first time.

195
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:22,027
I'm merely copying what I saw in the movies.

196
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:26,789
Are you not going to check?

197
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:40,890
I guess this is what Hyeon Wu wants.

198
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,935
Yes, I think we've found the right one.

199
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,485
It's about time he showed up.

200
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,315
Are you talking about me?

201
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:09,783
The fourth phantom is Scirsta, isn't it?

202
00:18:09,783 --> 00:18:10,735
Yes!

203
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:13,358
It's attached to Hyeon Wu, right?

204
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,416
You know everything.

205
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,671
Do you need my help?

206
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,109
It's this one.

207
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:26,788
It's the secret weapon that can attract Hyeon Wu.

208
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:30,766
But it's a handmade violin which is one of a kind.

209
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:32,932
So it must be pretty expensive.

210
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:36,635
Could you get it by any chance?

211
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:41,754
Of course.

212
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,639
Although I can't seal phantoms,

213
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,284
I have a lot of money.

214
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,729
It looks nice.

215
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:34,998
Do you want to have it?

216
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:44,524
- Will it work? 
 - Yes.

217
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:47,791
It seems like... his eyes are glued to it already.

218
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,246
Hurry and throw the spear.

219
00:20:00,636 --> 00:20:02,730
My Soulance.

220
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:11,051
Do you mean this?

221
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:15,371
What?

222
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:20,856
Hey, Bae Hyeon Wu!

223
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:26,228
You shouldn't touch other people's stuff like that.

224
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:34,789
What's happening?

225
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:38,971
What are you both doing? You wasted a good opportunity.

226
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:41,818
Oh, well.

227
00:20:41,818 --> 00:20:44,230
Right now!

228
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,539
Right now, what?

229
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:52,722
Right now.

230
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:58,860
I... forgot what I was going to say.

231
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:01,471
Wait...

232
00:21:02,251 --> 00:21:07,037
Can he not only steal other's belongings but also others' capabilities?

233
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:19,694
Try to steal something from me!

234
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,836
Seonbae Do Gyeom!

235
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:47,425
Thank goodness.

236
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:49,808
What took him so long?

237
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,963
Seonbae Do Gyeom won't lose, will he?

238
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:31,061
There's no way.

239
00:22:57,968 --> 00:22:59,568
It worked.

240
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:32,120

241
00:23:38,936 --> 00:23:42,195
I get that you're upset because you lost a great opportunity,

242
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:45,148
but you still shouldn't steal other's belongings.

243
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,611
This is a present for you,

244
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:52,590
so keep it.

245
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:06,930
♫  I was alone in a world you can't see  ♫

246
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:14,350
♫  And I had a small fear that no one could see  ♫

247
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:21,690
♫  Your touch to me, someone who had no expectations  ♫

248
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:29,010
♫  As long as we are together in this world, we can do it  ♫

249
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,850
♫  Light of my life, you're shining  ♫

250
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,830
♫  I'm not lonely anymore  ♫

251
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:44,360
♫  Even if I fall again, I won't be afraid  ♫

252
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,190
♫  I can fly high, I understand this world now  ♫

253
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:54,130
♫  Should I just go after this beautiful feeling  ♫

254
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,160
♫  I want to feel what it's like to go after this light of mine  ♫

255
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,570
♫  Us, together  ♫
