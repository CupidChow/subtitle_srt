00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,877

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,339

4
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,022

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,880

6
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:55,668
"You shouldn't steal other's belongings."

7
00:00:56,547 --> 00:00:58,258
So cool, right?

8
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,294
He's so cool.

9
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:01,808
I think it's very cringy.

10
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:04,285
Have you guys heard the news?

11
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:08,480
No. You're probably the first to hear, so just say it already.

12
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:12,806
Shim Chae Yeon. She's transferring to our class.

13
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,812
Are you serious?

14
00:01:14,812 --> 00:01:16,143
Who is she?

15
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:19,670
It's that girl who became famous after going on an audition program.

16
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,548
I heard she joined an agency and will be debuting soon.

17
00:01:22,548 --> 00:01:23,839
Yes, that's her.

18
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:30,040
She used to attend art high school, but she suddenly transferred to our school because something happened.

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,240
Did something happen? Like what?

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,993
Well, I heard a rumor.

21
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:36,013
But I'm not sure.

22
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,357
She's so pretty.

23
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:52,968
Is she? I didn't know.

24
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:55,932
Why didn't you know? It's obvious that she's pretty.

25
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:59,129
Yes, I'm jealous.

26
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:03,681
Why? Do you want to be pretty, too?

27
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:05,446
No, that's not what I meant.

28
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:07,518
I'm worried about tomorrow's music performance assessment.

29
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:10,644
Just thinking about singing in front of people

30
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:13,207
makes me nervous already.

31
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,735
But it must be so easy for her.

32
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:20,367
It was because of singing? What's there to be nervous about?

33
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:22,783
Singing is all about confidence.

34
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,405
Confidence?

35
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:28,189
Yes, I'll show you after school.

What's wrong with you?

53
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:24,036
You did so well.

54
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:26,498

 - Yes.

I'm so relieved that you will be singing first.

58
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:39,593
It somehow doesn't sound like a compliment.

59
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:42,716
Wait a minute. I'll show you for real this time.

60

It's my turn now.

I didn't even sing yet. What are you covering your ears for?

What?

64
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:54,537
Oh, yes, I thought I didn't have to listen.

Even I can sing better than her.

112
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,648
The rumor that she has singer's nodules must be true.

113
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:22,266
Then the rumor that she got kicked out of the agency must be true, too, right?

114
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:25,428
Heol, so that's why she came to our school. Did she get kicked out of art school?

115
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:27,836
Wow, what will she do with her life?

116
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:29,918
She worked so hard to become a singer.

117
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,301
Well, looks like that's going to be impossible in this life.

118

136
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,629
If I had to quit baseball...

137
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:11,000
Just thinking about it makes me miserable.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,910
It would be the same for anyone who lost their dreams.

139
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,844
Have you seen Seonbae Do Gyeom in the magic world?

140
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:23,417
No.

141
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:27,668
Trainees like me don't get the chance to see Master Hunters,

142
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,479
but I've heard about him through Glow a couple of times.

143
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:34,781
That he's a young and talented Hunter.

144
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:36,316
He's so surreal.

145
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:40,394
He's young and talented and also good-looking.

146
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:41,929
Who cares if he's young and talented?

147
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,058
He can't even take care of his weapon.

148
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:46,298
There he goes again.

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,533
Wow, that's crazy.

168
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:07,361
Who said she has singer's nodules?

169
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:09,799
I know, she's so good.

170
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,445
But why did she sing like that yesterday?

171
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:13,050
Maybe she wasn't feeling well.

172
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,793
Stop talking. I can't hear her sing.

173
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:20,948
♪ Waiting for you ♪

174
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:44,329
Have you heard the news?

175
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:45,705
No.

176
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:48,108
What is it this time?

177
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:52,511
Just now, Shim Chae Yeon sang in the music room.

178
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:54,825
And she was... good.

179
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:56,257
What?

180
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:59,079
But... when she sang yesterday...

181
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,803
That was the best song I've ever heard.

182
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:02,356
I won't be able to listen to a different song.

183
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:05,221
Chae Yeon's amazing.

184
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,724
- By the looks of it... 
 - Yes.

185
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:16,795
It must be the sixth phantom.

186
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:19,708
It's Siren.

187
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,609
It's the phantom that lures people with its voice.

188
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,426
It turned out well.

189
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:59,521
Everything is back to normal.

190
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,775
I'll be able to get up on stage again.

191
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:08,972
And I'll be able to sing again.

192
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:37,664
Manager. It's me, Chae Yeon.

193
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:39,878
Can I drop by the agency later?

194
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:42,089
I have something to tell you.

195
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:46,051
It's good news.

196
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:07,237
We should hurry this time.

197
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:10,516
 Shim Chae Yeon. Shim Chae Yeon.

198
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:12,157
 Shim Chae Yeon.

199
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:17,279
 Shim Chae Yeon! Shim Chae Yeon! Shim Chae Yeon!

200
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,235
 Shim Chae Yeon!

201
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:20,500
That's not a good sign.

202
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,890
The more the kids like her, the stronger the Siren becomes.

203
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,354
Just like Dras.

204
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:29,161
I think she's already strong.

205
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,730
It's not like it's just one or two people.

206
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,898
At least it didn't spread outside the school.

207
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:36,676
What if she debuts as a singer?

208
00:15:36,676 --> 00:15:40,074
We should catch her before that happens.

209
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:43,058
Siren's weakness is actually pretty simple.

210
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:47,056
We just have to try... not to listen to her song.

211
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:48,872
That's easy.

212
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:51,724
We just need to prepare.

213
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:55,861
Then should we each bring our thing and meet up again?

214
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:57,025
Okay.

215
00:15:57,025 --> 00:16:00,250
Let's meet at the front gate when it gets dark.

216
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:05,551
Wait.

217
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:06,441
What is it?

218
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,654
I left my phone in the classroom.

219
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:11,317
- Do you want us to wait for you? 
 - It's fine, I can go get it myself.

220
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,687
You guys can go first.

221
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:14,450
See you.

222
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,657
What's that noise?

223
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:09,469
It's already been thirty minutes.

224
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:11,224
Why isn't he coming?

225
00:17:11,224 --> 00:17:12,836
I know, right?

226
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:15,521
There's no way he wouldn't show up to catch the phantoms.

227
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:17,677
He's not answering his phone either.

228
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:26,051
Siren is nearby. This is our chance.

229
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,530
Should we just do it without him?

230
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,806
Yes, let's do that.

231
00:17:29,806 --> 00:17:32,559
We know Siren's weakness

232
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,861
and brought the thing we need.

233
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:37,936
Okay, then.

234
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:39,643

242
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:01,448
Hey, Su Yeong​. What took you so long?

243
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:22,329
No way!

244
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:24,432
It got him.

245
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:25,364
