1
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:06,440

2
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:10,636

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,350

4
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:22,075

5
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,475
I had a bad feeling about him from the beginning.

6
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:28,750
The way he smirked all the time.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,888
He looked just like a traitor.

8
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:33,141
I still can't believe it.

9
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:36,785
Do Gyeom was the thief who stole the beads.

10
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:39,797
The real enemy is always nearby.

11
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:41,746
We forgot about that.

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,707
So what do we do now?

13
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:51,785
We lost all the beads to him.

14
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,040
Well...

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,180
There is no guarantee that phantoms will only appear in our school.

16
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,300
Should we ask Yu Na?

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,201
How would Yu Na know?

18
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:03,237
She must be so shocked right now.

19
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:04,400
You're right.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,275
She used to look up to Do Gyeom more than anyone else.

21
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:11,988
Seriously, I didn't see this coming.

22
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:23,066
By the way,

23
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:25,084
where did Yu Na go?

24
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:34,030

25
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:46,005
There is still no response.

26
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,636
 Was it a lie that

27
00:01:51,636 --> 00:01:53,868
 he had found the warp?

28
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:58,774
 Then what was that important matter

29
00:01:58,774 --> 00:02:00,811
 he mentioned last time?

30
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:05,190
He's not here today either.

31
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,557
How come?

32
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:08,520
Not sure.

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,459
I heard he can't come for a while because of family matters.

34
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:18,936
But... why do you keep looking for Do Gyeom?

35
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:22,020
I just have something to ask him.

36
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,160
Well... If... you're planning to ask him out...

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,801
I don't want to go out with him, either.

38
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:29,548
That stupid thief.

39
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:32,068
Why are you yelling at me?

40
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,718
Did he steal something?

41
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,063
"He can't come for a while"?

42
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,133
Where in the world did he go?

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,057
Hi.

44
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:58,888
Can I sit next to you?

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,587
Do you want to see something cool?

46
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:18,172
Are you a magician?

47
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:20,087
Something like that.

48
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:23,060
Why aren't you in school?

49
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,879
It's the school anniversary.

50
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,992
Then why aren't you at work, Ahjussi?

51
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:30,848
Hey, I'm not an ahjussi.

52
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:32,726
I'm still a student, too.

53
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:34,341
At least around here.

54
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:38,910
Anyway, why is a grown-up student like you hanging out by yourself?

55
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:42,471
Don't you have any friends?

56
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:49,457
No, I don't.

57
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:52,131
What? That must be boring.

58
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,016
It's fine.

59
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:55,969
I don't need a friend.

60
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:00,447
Everyone needs a friend.

61
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:01,770
Who told you that?

62
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,951
My teacher.

63
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,397
Yes...

64
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:11,584
Your teacher's right.

65
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:16,480
It would've been nice...

66
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,391
if they had been my friends.

67
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,090
Sorry?

68
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,473
Tae Wu, come on!

69
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,937
Have fun by yourself, Magician Ahjussi!

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,316
I said I'm not an ahjussi.

71
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:51,197
Easy, dude.

72
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:53,103
Are you going to fight someone?

73
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,490
You're going to hurt your arm like that.

74
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,109
Why are you overdoing yourself? We don't have an upcoming match.

75
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:04,978
I should've done this sooner.

76
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,594
What?

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,353
If I had been stronger,

78
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:12,002
we wouldn't have needed that jerk in the first place.

79
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:15,440
And we wouldn't have been tricked.

80
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:19,489
What are you talking about? Tell me in a way that I can understand.

81
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:23,264
Did you lose money to a bully?

82
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,090
Money?

83
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,905
It's something much more important than that.

84
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:38,740
When I meet him next time,

85
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,174
I'm going to get it back, no matter what.

86
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:48,280
Will there be another chance?

87
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:50,688
Who knows?

88
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:52,977
We might not have another chance.

89
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,480
That's negative.

90
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,756
I'm being realistic.

91
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:01,402
If that's what you think...

92
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:05,892
What are you so busy writing?

93
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:12,562
A plan for the possible chance in the future.

94
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:13,982
What plan?

95
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,857
Anything.

96
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:19,687
I'm starting with organizing all the information we have.

97
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:33,572
Why did Do Gyeom steal the seven phantom beads in the first place?

98
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:36,714
That's because he wanted to release the sealed phantoms.

99
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:41,108
Then why did he release the phantoms in the human world instead of the magic world?

100
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:43,744
Maybe it's because there are many hunters in the magic world,

101
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:45,845
so the human world is easier?

102
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:49,800
What happens when the phantoms are released into the human world?

103
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:54,818
They will find victims to suck out the desires

104
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:56,974
and become stronger, I guess.

105
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:59,885
Then why did he try to seal back

106
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:02,630
the phantoms that became stronger?

107
00:07:04,812 --> 00:07:06,900
Well...

108
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,953
I'm not sure about that.

109
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:11,956
Let's just say he has to seal them for some reason.

110
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,450
Then why did he need our help

111
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,569
instead of doing it himself?

112
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:19,696
That's because...

113
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:22,821
he can't use his Soulance?

114
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,053
I don't know...

115
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,804
No matter how hard I think,

116
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:31,165
there are so many fishy things about Do Gyeom.

117
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:32,708
You're right.

118
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,387
But one thing's for sure.

119
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:40,426
He managed to take advantage of us.

120
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:05,470
♫  Even my nightless day is forgotten  ♫

121
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:14,290
♫  I can't let go of you who is in my foolish memories  ♫

122
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,800
♫  The dreams that I used to be pulled into  ♫

123
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,660
♫  Some dreams faded away  ♫

124
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,360
♫  The further and further I go  ♫

125
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,450
♫  The more I can't turn back  ♫

126
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:39,440
♫  The tears I cried in defeat  ♫

127
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,540
♫  Your words that hurt as much as a physical wound  ♫

128
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,400
♫  Trapped inside other desires  ♫

129
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:03,619
Even though I looked for him all day, I couldn't find the slightest trace of him.

130
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:08,364
If Do Gyeom is going around erasing the magical powers,

131
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:11,775
there's no way for me to find him.

132
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:17,067
Man! I wish that punk would just get struck by a lightning.

133
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:38,701
You're here.

134
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:41,188
You let me know where you were on purpose.

135
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:43,248
How thoughtful of you.

136
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:46,293
You've been looking for me, right?

137
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:50,255
Do you have more to steal from me?

138
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,885
I have something to tell you.

139
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:57,398
You do?

140
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,306
I have something to tell you, too.

141
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,255
Well, that's a pretty harsh talk.

142
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,900
What conversation should I have with you, you traitor?

143
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:17,966
Take out that broken sword of yours.

144
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:24,179
I forgot that you're the student of that short-tempered Glow.

145
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:03,818
Yu Na!

146
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:05,814
Yu Na!

147
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:14,339
Are you all right?

148
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,991
Yes.

149
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,012
You lost him because of me.

150
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,771
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:24,516
It was still worth it.

152
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:29,339
Isn't this...

153
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:54,254
I retrieved the Gaze bead somehow.

154
00:11:57,989 --> 00:12:00,093
But what do I do now?

155
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:06,959
I'm sure Do Gyeom will come back for this.

156
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:13,365
But I can't fight against a Master Hunter on my own.

157
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,502
What are you doing here at this time of the day?

158
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:38,432
We were just passing by.

159
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:40,801
But your house is in the opposite direction.

160
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:44,488
I wanted to do some exercise.

161
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:46,611
I've gained some weight lately.

162
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,447
You look the same to me.

163
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:52,537
She did gain some weight.

164
00:12:55,698 --> 00:12:58,276
Actually...

165
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,375
We were worried about you!

166
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,935
Right?

167
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,860
No, you're wrong.

168
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,463
We were really just passing by.

169
00:13:09,463 --> 00:13:12,786
Yes, I'm just trying to stay in shape.

170
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:15,210
They're all dishonest.

171
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:28,306
Do Gyeom will come back.

172
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:32,417
We can't just sit back and let him fool us.

173
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:34,217
Of course.

174
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:36,181
He's not an easy opponent

175
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:39,167
so we need to prepare flawlessly.

176
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,845
What's our strength?

177
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,805
Teamwork, right?

178
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:46,202
Of course, it is!

179
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:51,023
It's better if the environment is favorable to us.

180
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:53,998
We should make him come to our home ground.

181
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:55,819
I agree.

182
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:04,259
Should we get going then?

183
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,679
To our home ground.

184
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:19,450
♫  And I had a small fear that no one could see  ♫

185
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:26,800
♫  Your touch to me, someone who had no expectations  ♫

186
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,840
♫  As long as we are together in this world  ♫

187
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,130
♫  We can do it  ♫

188
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,850
♫  Light of my life, you're shining  ♫

189
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,940
♫  I'm not lonely anymore  ♫

190
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,290
♫  I'm not afraid to fall again  ♫

191
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,290
♫  I can fly high, I understand this world now  ♫

192
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,220
♫  Shall we go in this beautiful direction?  ♫

193
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,640
♫  I couldn't stop now even if I wanted to  ♫

194
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,450
♫  I can fly high, high above this world  ♫

195
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,510
♫  Shall we go in this beautiful direction?  ♫

196
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,540
♫  To the future that we'll begin building  ♫

197
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,870
♫  Us, together  ♫

198
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:39,537
Have you guys all been waiting for me?

199
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:41,186
Of course.

200
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:44,109
We should say our final farewell together.

201
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:46,836
I'm honored.

202
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,619
But I'm pretty busy right now.

203
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,166
So instead of wasting each other's time,

204
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,976
just hand over the bead.

205
00:16:01,976 --> 00:16:03,962
Do you think that'd work?

206
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,016
Never.

207
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:09,758
Give back the beads you have with you.

208
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,334
Bring it on.

209
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:52,319
I see Glow has taught you well.

210
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:57,599
But let's end it here.

211
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:15,644
It's fake.

212
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,674
Let's fight head-to-head.

213
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:47,078
 Are you suggesting we use the Phantom?

214
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:51,948
 We can never beat Do Gyeom on our own.

215
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:56,347
 To beat him, we need the phantom's help.

216
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:59,336
 Wouldn't it be too dangerous?

217
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:01,805
 It can't be helped.

218
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:04,207
 I've been thinking about it,

219
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:08,119
 but Do Gyeom has only one weakness.

220
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:12,024
 He can't seal the phantoms.

221
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,060
 That's why he used us.

222
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,365
 So now it's our turn to use that weakness.

223
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:24,335
 While Do Gyeom is sidetracked by the fake bead, we use the real bead–

224
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,190
 I'll do it.

225
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:54,681
 But will we be able to beat Do Gyeom by using the Gaze phantom?

226
00:18:54,681 --> 00:18:56,076
 Of course, it's impossible.

227
00:18:56,076 --> 00:19:00,297
 Still... we will be able to hold him for a while.

228
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:04,649
 Meanwhile, Su Yeong, you should bring back the rest of the six beads.

229
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:06,605
Go get it now!

230
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,110
Yu Na!

231
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,660
Yu Na, are you... trying to release the beads?

232
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,232
You won't be able to seal the phantoms again with that broken sword anyways.

233
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:39,527
So give up now.

234
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:44,495
Well, it can't be helped.

235
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,610
But... we're at the rooftop.

236
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:18,066
Did you think that I would let you get away?

237
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:37,393
Great job following me.

238
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:40,196
Why do you keep calling me to this place?

239
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:42,987
Because...

240
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:49,077
we have to pass through this place.

241
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:52,484
Pass through what?

242
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:57,088
I said I had something to tell you, right?

243
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:09,534
I found a new warp.

244
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:15,899
Why... are you telling me this?

245
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:19,227
I promised you

246
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,838
that I'd find the warp that disappeared.

247
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:27,617
Even a broken promise... is still a promise.

248
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:33,933
Whether you'll fight with me now

249
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:37,562
or go save your friend who's being eaten away by the phantom.

250
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,714
It's up to you.

251
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:42,722
And the result is on you, too.

252
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:46,137
What do you want to do?

253
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:56,706
You know, Yu Na?

254
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:19,729
I feel like puking.

255
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:23,207
I told you I was against the idea.

256
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:26,499
I mean... you could've been more gentle when you sealed the phantom.

257
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:29,014
What a crybaby.

258
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,608
I'm not being a crybaby.

259
00:22:31,608 --> 00:22:33,827
Have you ever gotten stabbed by a spear?

260
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:36,308
Seriously...

261
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:38,400
Still...

262
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,382
Thanks to Gi Wu, we got the beads back.

263
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,237
Right?

264
00:22:45,237 --> 00:22:49,096
I don't remember a thing, but I did win, right?

265
00:22:49,096 --> 00:22:52,036
Yes, let's say that you won.

266
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:57,636
Guys, there's someone over there.

267
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,936
No way...

268
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,950
Do Gyeom?

269
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:08,736
Let's go check.

270
00:23:09,778 --> 00:23:12,232
Hey, wait for me.

271
00:23:14,736 --> 00:23:16,736
Glow!

272
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:21,260
Yu Na, I told you to just keep your eyes on them.

273
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,543
How dare you steal my Soulance!

274
00:23:23,543 --> 00:23:27,347
I said it's dangerous to handle the phantoms on your own.

275
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:29,537
Do you know how...

276
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:32,227
Do you know how worried I was?

277
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:41,878
Don't worry.

278
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,355
I wasn't alone.

279
00:23:47,704 --> 00:23:52,204
But... what was going on in the magic world?

280
00:23:52,204 --> 00:23:56,065
Why did the warp disappear all of a sudden?

281
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:03,330
After you left for the human world, a revolt broke out in the magic world.

282
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,611
And the rebel force is growing.

283
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,297
Do Gyeom...

284
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:13,014
I mean, Seriste...

285
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:15,483
How do you know him?

286
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:18,794
Did you meet him?

287
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:21,834
It's a long story.

288
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:26,713
Anyway, the magic world is in chaos because of the rebellion.

289
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:29,859
The location of the warps has changed

290
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:34,539
and all the phantoms have been released.

291
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,270
What?

292
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,042
Brace yourself.

293
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:46,012
Soon, a long fight is about to begin.

294
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,857
By the way,

295
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:57,765
what happened to the phantoms that were released here?

296
00:24:57,765 --> 00:25:01,989
You managed to seal them, right?

297
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:03,835
Oh! Right.

298
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,754
I caught all seven of them and sealed them again.

299
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:09,571
But...

300
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:17,040
I lost all of them to Seriste today.

301
00:25:18,581 --> 00:25:20,081
What?

302
00:25:24,505 --> 00:25:26,549
 You know, Yu Na?

303
00:25:30,556 --> 00:25:32,697
 Do not trust Glow.

♫  To me who gives dense darkness, Chaser Chaser  ♫

332
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,420
♫  It's the truth  ♫

333
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:20,841
My Soulance.

334
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:24,245
Shouldn't you return my Soulance?

335
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:27,119
If you want me to complete that task.

336
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,062
I guess.

337
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,775
What are you doing?

338
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:44,800
What? Can't you do it with a broken sword?

339
00:27:46,244 --> 00:27:50,275
Well, I need a backup plan, don't I?

340
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,950
