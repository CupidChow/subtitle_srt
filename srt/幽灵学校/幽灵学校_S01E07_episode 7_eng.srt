1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,423

2
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:10,601

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,451

4
00:00:19,248 --> 00:00:22,059

5
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:32,898
 It's been three months since I came to the human world

6
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:36,385
 after being assigned to my first mission as a Phantom Hunter.

7
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,841
 So many things have happened since then.

8
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,760
 I've met many good friends

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,320
 and even came across a Master Hunter.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,383
 I also managed to seal six phantoms successfully.

11
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:57,265
 Now, there's only one phantom left.

12
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,880
 I wonder what the last phantom will be.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,030

14
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,340
♫  I'm not afraid to fall again  ♫

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,060
♫  I can fly high over this world  ♫

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,254
 Right!

17
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:22,765
 I forgot I had an exam today.

18
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:32,316
Yu Na, focus on your test sheet.

19
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,920

20
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:53,162
Are you all right?

21
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:54,633
What?

22
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,566
Yes.

23
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,445
You don't look okay.

24
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:03,931
Is it because of the exam?

25
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:09,695
How badly did you do?

26
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:16,943
Did you get a 20 on your exam?

27
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:20,043
It's fine. I only got a 30 on mine.

28
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:24,450
Who cares about exams anyway? You can do better next time.

29
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,328
Yes, you can do better next time.

30
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:29,002
You got this! Good luck!

31
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:36,104
What's wrong? I was comforting him.

32
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:39,325
You're in no position to comfort him.

33
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,093
How come? I did better than him.

34
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:45,473
I got a 30, and he got a 20.

35
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,099
What he meant was...

36
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,219
he got only two wrong.

37
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:51,830
What?

38
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,066
Then why does he look so upset?

39
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,670
Probably because it's not as good as he expected.

40
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,472
His goal is to become the top student in school.

41
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:05,726
Why did he set such an unreasonable goal?

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,622
That's because that's his only next goal.

43
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:16,748
Since middle school, Tae Ho has always ranked in second place.

44
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,460

45
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,887

46
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:42,405

47
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:43,974

48
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:05,703
It's finally over!

49
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:09,557
It was so exhausting.

50
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:11,376
Still, it was worth it.

51
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,670
Are you serious?

52
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,890
Of course! We did our best in our own ways.

53
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,300
Right! I tried so hard to guess every question.

54
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,572
Since the hard work is over, let's go grab something to eat.

55
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:31,704
You all know the exam period ends tomorrow, right?

56
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:39,186
Do Gyeom!

57
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,715
Someone's in a good mood. Did you do well on your exam?

58
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:45,116
Nope!

59
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:49,229
Yes, well... there's no need for magic users to do well on exams for humans.

60
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:52,555
Yes. Did you fail your test, too?

61
00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:55,144
No, I did well.

62
00:04:57,138 --> 00:05:01,324
Well, whether you do well or not, there's more to life than exams.

63
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:03,294
And not everyone can be the top student.

64
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:08,256
You're right. So we're just gonna go grab something to eat.

65
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:10,884
Do you want to join us?

66
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:13,996
I'm sorry, I have an errand to run.

67
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,213
An errand?

68
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:21,311
Yes. It's important, so count me in for next time.

69
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:23,946
Have a great time then.

70
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:35,543
Wow, it looks delicious.

71
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,180
- Get some dumplings too. 
 - Dumplings, okay.

72
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:41,924
I wish Do Gyeom was here with us.

73
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,193
It's a bummer.

74
00:05:43,193 --> 00:05:44,608
I know.

75
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:46,737
He's been helping us out a lot.

76
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:49,139
He pulled out his sword like this!

77
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,727
Well... he did show up whenever we were in dangerous situations.

78
00:05:57,727 --> 00:05:59,118
That's ridiculous.

79
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:01,509
He should've shown up early if he was going to help.

80
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:03,872
He only shows up when we're in danger.

81
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:07,049
That's a disease, you know. A hero complex.

82
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:11,704
He gets worked up every time we talk about Do Gyeom.

83
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,679
That's how much he's jealous.

84
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:19,211
Me? Jealous? Not even a little bit.

85
00:06:19,211 --> 00:06:22,821
But... I wonder what that important matter is.

86
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:26,352
Well... it should be related to the magic world, I guess.

87
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:30,741
By the way, regarding the phantoms you have to catch, we only have one more to go.

88
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:34,868
Yes, I can't wait to find out which phantom it will be.

89
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:37,171
Do you know which phantom it is?

90
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:39,177
No idea.

91
00:06:39,177 --> 00:06:43,119
There are over 300 phantoms written in the Book of Phantoms.

92
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:46,921
I can't figure it out if there's no sign of anomaly.

93
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:04,552
Then... what happens next after we catch all the phantoms?

94
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:06,316
Right.

95
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:10,220
Do you have to return to where you came from, Yu Na?

96
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:17,576
If the warp opens again, I guess I should.

97
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:22,313
Do you... have to go back?

98
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:31,028
I mean, our school could become endangered when the warp opens again.

99
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:34,362
I was wondering if you could...

100
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:36,981
just stay here and protect the school.

101
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:40,369
Well, that's true,

102
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:42,428
but I should go back first.

103
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:47,227
It's been a while since I lost contact with the magic world, and I'm worried about Glow.

104
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:58,976
B-But then... I can come to visit you guys anytime.

105
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:03,589
Let's think about that again later and focus on what we should do now.

106
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:11,488
Yes, let's catch the last phantom and take our exam tomorrow.

107
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:13,854
Oh, right.

108
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:16,879
Gi Wu, you said earlier that

109
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,183
Tae Ho was always in second place since middle school.

110
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:22,182
Yes.

111
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:26,406
So... who was the top student?

112
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:30,081
Oh... that annoying kid is...

113
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:36,597
What?

114
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:40,299
Why are you surprised? Isn't it obvious?

115
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,750
Hey, Tae Ho, are you still here?

116
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,846
You can go first. I'm going to study a little more.

117
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:04,510
Wow, you're really determined to get first place this time.

118
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,004
Life's unfair if you can't achieve the first rank even after all this.

119
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:14,077
I should get going then. See you tomorrow.

120
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:40,112
You have ten minutes left.

121
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,453
How was the exam?

122
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:57,074
It was fine.

123
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:59,482
She'll probably get a full score again.

124
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,367
Probably.

125
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,303
Who's in for some tteokbokki since the exam is over?

126
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,655
But we ate that yesterday, let's go eat malatang.

127
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:08,107
I don't like malatang.

128
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:17,392

129
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:19,944

130
00:10:19,946 --> 00:10:22,846
Hey, stop that!

131
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:26,850
Stop fighting!

132
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:33,106
Invest more time if I'm not smart?

133
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:38,439
I get 24 hours just like everybody else.

134
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:40,781
How much...

135
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:43,592
How much more does he want me to do?

136
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:53,683
You scared me. Tae Ho, why are you still here?

137
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:57,214
It's really late, you should get going now.

138
00:10:57,214 --> 00:11:00,107
I'm sorry. I'll leave soon.

139
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:04,580
Yes, don't overdo it. You'll harm your health.

140
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,475
I have to close the library at 1 a.m., so start wrapping up.

141
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:11,144
Why is your book all crumpled?

142
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:40,232
Gosh, I said I'd leave in a bit!

143
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,723
What's wrong?

144
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:19,898
Something... doesn't seem right.

145
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:25,869
Do you feel the phantom's energy?

146
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,706
No. It's the opposite.

147
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:32,993
It's about time it showed up.

148
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:36,146
But it's strange how there's no sign of it.

149
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:45,113
Look carefully. See if anyone is acting suspiciously.

150
00:12:50,164 --> 00:12:52,579
You look the most suspicious.

151
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:04,245
Anyways, why are you in such a hurry?

152
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:07,603
Are you that excited about catching the phantom?

153
00:13:07,603 --> 00:13:08,822
Of course!

154
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:13,417
Then I can find the warp and check if Glow is safe.

155
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,608
Gi Wu!

156
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:19,846
Hey! Choi Gi Wu!

157
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:33,612
Tae Ho, are you all right?

158
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,947
Yes, I'm fine.

159
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:38,784
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to throw it at you.

160
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,036
I'm so sorry.

161
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:42,746
It's fine, I didn't even get hurt.

162
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:44,390
 What is that?

163
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:47,610
Thank goodness he didn't get hit.

164
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,848
Hey! Who throws a ball in the hallway?

165
00:13:52,645 --> 00:13:54,245
Sorry.

166
00:13:57,028 --> 00:14:01,728
There's no way he saw that ball coming.

167
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:03,322
Let's go.

168
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,852
Oh, So Jin!

169
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:23,916
What is it?

170
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,531
Don't you... have something to tell me?

171
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:30,452
Not that I know of.

172
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,555
Really? Fine.

173
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:37,468
What? What were you expecting?

174
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:41,949
Anything... It's about time you told us,

175
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,641
"Have you heard the news?"

176
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:46,176
So I was wondering if you got any news.

177
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:52,282
True. The phantom should have showed up by now,

178
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:54,959
but it's awfully quiet this time.

179
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,888
Well, we'll hear something soon.

180
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,764
Shouldn't you be more careful when you look around?

181
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:17,274
But it's so strange, isn't it?

182
00:15:17,274 --> 00:15:20,319
Why isn't the last phantom showing up?

183
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,972
It's not easy to beat the final boss.

184
00:15:23,972 --> 00:15:28,678
But by now, something should've happened.

185
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:33,561
Do you still have no idea about the last phantom?

186
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:37,518
Actually, I was looking it up on the Book of Phantoms,

187
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:39,511
but I'm not sure

188
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:43,500
since high school students have all sorts of desires.

189
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:46,005
Let me see.

190
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,777
Okay. Thanks.

191
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:04,264
So... the other hunters

192
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,739
are just like you, right?

193
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:10,212
Yu Na, you're not the only one who can't read it, right?

194
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:12,404
No!

195
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:18,435
You should be at least a Master to read the Book of Phantoms.

196
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,632
Does that mean Masters... know everything about phantoms?

197
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:27,318
Of course. That's why they're Masters.

198
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:32,151
Wouldn't he know something about the current situation if that's the case?

199
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:44,472
- Do Gyeom? 
 - Yes.

200
00:16:44,472 --> 00:16:45,888
He didn't come to school today.

201
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:48,059
What? Why?

202
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,667
He said he had to take care of a family situation.

203
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,686
A family situation?

204
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:54,199
Yes.

205
00:17:03,436 --> 00:17:07,600
Phantom is nowhere to be found,

206
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,195
and Do Gyeom is gone.

207
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:14,966
What's happening right now?

208
00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:21,990
Where is the last phantom?

209
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,684
I wish there was a hint.

210
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:32,442
Yes. Now that's more like it.

211
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:48,385
This place is...

212
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:51,360
It's near the library.

213
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,668
Yu Na!

214
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:55,343
Hey, Tae Ho!

215
00:17:55,343 --> 00:17:57,734
What brings you here at this hour?

216
00:17:57,734 --> 00:17:58,972
What do you mean?

217
00:17:58,972 --> 00:18:01,038
I came to study.

218
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,702
Study?

219
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:06,918
I mean... I lost something, so I came to look for it.

220
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:08,979
Oh, I see.

221
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:10,689
Do you need my help?

222
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:14,184
No, I shouldn't get in the way of your studying.

223
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:15,874
I'll take care of it.

224
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:19,428
Okay. In that case, good luck looking for what you lost.

225
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:31,643
Are you sure it's Tae Ho?

226
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:35,802
Yes. The finder responded, so it can't be wrong, but...

227
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:37,535
But?

228
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:40,877
He looked like his usual self,

229
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:42,896
and I couldn't see the pattern.

230
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:44,286
That's impossible.

231
00:18:44,286 --> 00:18:48,368
We could easily tell from the other kids who were possessed by the phantoms.

232
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,230
That's what I'm saying.

233
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:55,201
So what's this last phantom?

234
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,486
Is there a phantom that doesn't harm humans?

235
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:07,435
Well, to find out, there's only one way.

236
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:09,173
Yes.

237
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:11,700
If we provoke the phantom enough...

238
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,469
It will naturally show its true colors.

239
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,560
Okay.

240
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,818
If we're all on the same page,

241
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:22,218
why don't we check it out tonight?

242
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:37,206
To me, he just looks like his usual self.

243
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:42,182
But... there's no doubt that he's the phantom.

244
00:19:52,217 --> 00:19:53,817
What?

245
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,838
Where did he go?

246
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:58,071
He was here just now.

247
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,883
Do you mean me?

248
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:09,574
How did he get up there so quickly?

249
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:11,323
Hey, Su Yeong.

250
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:15,418
Is there a phantom that can teleport?

251
00:20:15,418 --> 00:20:17,977
I'll look it up.

252
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:24,428
- Hurry! 
 - Wait a second.

253
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:26,655
It's useless.

254
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:33,064
How can we beat that kind of superpower?

255
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:36,735
Teleporting is beyond our capabilities.

256
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,521
I wish Do Gyeom was with us right now.

257
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:41,208
Weakness...

258
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,226
What was its weakness?

259
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,527
I don't have any weakness.

260
00:20:55,138 --> 00:20:57,756
I'm perfect, unlike you guys.

261
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:11,007
I can't find it.

262
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:13,521
A phantom that can teleport.

263
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:16,433
Come on.

264
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,485
What do we do, Yu Na?

265
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,712
First, let's go find Tae Ho.

266
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,314
I'm sure he's still in school.

267
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:25,255
Guys, wait.

268
00:21:27,644 --> 00:21:29,479
Look at this.

269
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:32,875

270
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:43,249
Do you really think Tae Ho will come this way?

271
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:45,753
I'm hundred percent sure,

272
00:21:45,753 --> 00:21:47,614
he'll come back to get his notebook.

273
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:49,983
What's so special about that study note?

274
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:54,702
Thanks to the notebook, we found out the phantom that got stuck on Tae Ho.

275
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,758
The phantom that stops time,

276
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:00,554
Timer.

277
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,948
The notes he took

278
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,034
would be impossible to write that in only one day.

279
00:22:08,598 --> 00:22:13,598
He definitely stopped time when he studied.

280
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:16,812
What you're saying is he didn't teleport

281
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:19,829
but stopped time before he moved, right?

282
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:21,853
I'm sure of it.

283
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:26,350
So I'm sure... this plan will work.

284
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,399

285
00:23:08,882 --> 00:23:11,149
Don't try to do anything stupid.

286
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:41,561
Looks like you were in a hurry.

287
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:45,632
You forgot to check below your feet.

288
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:00,322
Since you're the last phantom,

289
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:02,607
we should put in this much effort.

290
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,510
 Attack him all at once?

291
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:11,618
 Timer needs to get the timing right to stop time.

292
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:13,961
 Also...

293
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,199
 that snapping gesture.

294
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:20,225
 We should attack Tae Ho together from all directions

295
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,927
 so he can't find the timing to stop time.

296
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:27,096
 That's the only way we can beat him.

297
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:40,836
Now... Let's end this.

298
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,990
At last,

299
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,149
we found all seven beads.

300
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:13,594
Well, the final boss was much easier than I expected.

301
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:15,424
It's over!

302
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:20,707
Did we... really catch all the phantoms?

303
00:25:36,986 --> 00:25:39,098
Isn't that...

304
00:25:39,098 --> 00:25:41,011
Do Gyeom!

305
00:25:42,704 --> 00:25:45,562
Look at him showing up now after we did all the hard work.

306
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:50,173
Where have you been?

307
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,375
We were worried

308
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,909
since we couldn't find you.

309
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:56,679
Sorry, something important came up.

310
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,374
I finally got in touch with the magic world.

311
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:02,343
Really? Did you find the warp?

312
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:03,803
Yes.

313
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,952
By the way, Yu Na. You finally succeeded.

314
00:26:07,952 --> 00:26:09,609
Oh, that's right.

315
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,528
I collected all of them.

316
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,366
The seven sacred beads.

317
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:14,568
Just what I thought.

318
00:26:14,568 --> 00:26:17,825
I knew you could do it, Yu Na.

319
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:25,525
I couldn't do it without the help of my friends.

320
00:26:26,473 --> 00:26:28,173
I see.

321
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:30,201
Thank you all.

322
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:39,370
Then... Let's get back to the magic world.

323
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:57,356
Unbelievable...

324
00:26:57,356 --> 00:27:01,090
At last, I got all of them back.

325
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:04,515
What?

326
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:35,445
Seonbae?

327
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,950

328
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,450
♫  Dangerous breathing, everyone's silent  ♫

329
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,790
♫  Within this suffocation, a thorn tree bloomed  ♫

330
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,730
♫  A circuit that's turned off in deep despair  ♫

331
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,490
♫  The moonlight digs into me without hesitation  ♫

332
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,620
♫  The power seethes in the strangeness  ♫

333
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,990
♫  The underworld hidden behind the black fog

334
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,520
♫  Even if a cage that's put around me at the moment of desire makes me suffer  ♫

335
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,900
♫  I'll at least leave a talisman  ♫

336
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,370
♫  Into the dark  ♫

337
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,780
♫  The trembling that will burst out when the sun sets  ♫

338
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,410
♫  I was born to grow, and I've become complete  ♫
