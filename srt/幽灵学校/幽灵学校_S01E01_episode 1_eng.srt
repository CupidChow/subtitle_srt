1
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:06,398

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,708

3
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,372

4
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:22,080

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:32,080

6
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,259
What's that?

7
00:03:17,395 --> 00:03:21,175
 Evil beings that feed on human desires

8
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:24,854
 we call them Phantoms.

9
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:34,544
 And I... seal those phantoms.

10
00:03:34,544 --> 00:03:36,598
 I'm a Phantom Hunter.

11
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:40,684
 The phantoms have been sealed in sacred beads

12
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,140
 and stored safely in the underground depository for over a thousand years.

13
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,128
 Until yesterday.

14
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:54,050
Glow!

15
00:03:57,512 --> 00:04:00,541
I can tell from your dramatic entrance that you've heard the news.

16
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,736
Is it true? Did the phantom beads really–

17
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:05,084
Yes.

18
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:09,182
Someone broke into Depository A last night and stole seven of them.

19
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,253
Seven of them? Who was it? Did you find the culprit?

20
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,053
We don't know yet who they are or why they did it,

21
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:22,717
but I'm sure of one thing, it was no ordinary person.

22
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:24,763
Speaking of which,

23
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:28,885
all Phantom Hunters have decided to take action this time.

24
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:33,396
We confirmed that it went down to the human world through a warp.

25
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:35,866
All hunters? Does that mean...

26
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:39,402
Stop smiling. This is a serious situation.

27
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:50,147
Yu Na.

28
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:52,124
Are you ready?

29
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:53,773
Yes!

30
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:55,370
Here,

31
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,740
this is your first mission as a phantom hunter.

32
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:09,016
Do you want me to go to the human world through the 113th warp?

33
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:14,514
We can't let a phantom attach itself to humans, so it's your duty to protect one of the warps.

34
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,656
It's not that difficult, is it?

35
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:19,492
Of course not! Don't worry.

36
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:22,074
Here, this is the Phantom Finder.

37
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:26,158
When it detects the phantom's energy, it'll tell you where it is.

38
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:35,885
What?

39
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:38,066
Soulance!

40
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:41,626
I need that to seal the Phantom.

41
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:45,519
Could you reread the mission paper?

42
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:49,999
What?

43
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:52,377
I should only monitor the phantom and not catch it?

44
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:54,753
Of course. You're still a trainee hunter.

45
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:58,683
Only masters can use the Soulance. Don't you know that?

46
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:02,024
But... this is an emergency.

47
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:04,179
I even graduated from Hunter School...

48
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:06,302
No. You're still a trainee.

49
00:06:06,302 --> 00:06:08,294
You can't handle a phantom on your own.

50
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,729
As soon as you find the phantom, report back to me immediately.

51
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:14,311
But... Still...

52
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:16,123
Well, if you don't like it...

53
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,856
I can ask a different hunter.

54
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:19,290
W-Wait!

55
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:21,915
I'll do it. I'll do the mission.

56
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,591
Of course, you are.

57
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:28,121
But where does the 113th warp lead to?

58
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:32,331
You'll find out when you get there. It's a place that suits you.

59
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:42,843
Have a safe trip then.

60
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:19,411
 I'm a phantom hunter.

61
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:23,044
 To catch evil phantoms!

62
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:26,553
 I mean... to keep an eye on them,

63
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:29,606
 I came to Seonghon High School.

64
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:35,096
 It's been two months since I infiltrated an ordinary high school as a freshman.

65
00:07:35,096 --> 00:07:38,240
 So far, nothing has happened.

66
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:43,554
 A human being possessed by a phantom is known to use special powers.

67
00:07:46,156 --> 00:07:49,538
 But no matter how hard I search, I don't see anyone like that.

68
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:51,588

69
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:55,049
That's it for today!

70
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:56,793
Enjoy your lunch.

71
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:59,587
Eun Ho, can you bring these to the staffroom?

72
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:00,847
Da Hye, what's for lunch today?

73
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:01,800
It's tortilla today.

74
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,170
Tortilla? Sounds great.

75
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,025
Yes, okay.

76
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:11,433
Hey, look at him.

77
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,515
He can't even carry some books.

78
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:14,687
- Seriously, what's up with him? 
 - I know.

79
00:08:14,687 --> 00:08:16,594
There he goes again.

80
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:19,581
He's impossible.

81
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,878
Here you go.

82
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:27,656
Thanks.

83
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:50,205
 It's boring to keep a watch on humans, but not everyone is boring.

84
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:51,406
Sorry, I didn't see it.

85
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,058
- Do you promise to see mine today? 
 - Yeah.

86
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:54,850
- Mine too! 
 - Okay.

87
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:02,590
♫  Under a night sky so dark, it seems like no one else exists  ♫

88
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:10,030
♫  You are shining  ♫

89
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,070
♫  Some future  ♫

90
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,870
What are you looking at?

91
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,191
You scared me.

92
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:22,267
You're acting all suspicious, what is so interesting that you're blocking the way?

93
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:24,747
- Sunbaenim! 
 - Yeah?

94
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:25,721
Have you seen that movie?

95
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:27,775
It's nothing.

96
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,243
You should go ahead.

97
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,863
Why aren't you going?

98
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,270
Here!

99
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,507
What's this?

100
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:48,112
I got it for free at the convenience store this morning.

101
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:52,349
See you later!

102
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:58,038
Oops, wrong direction.

103
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:10,526
Oh, it's good.

104
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,389
Is it a new flavor?

105
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,586
Wait!

106
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:24,998
This isn't the time to be eating these jelly candies.

107
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,944
How long do I have to stay like this?

108
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:32,688
Is there even a phantom around here?

109
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:35,599
Man, why isn't this moving?

110
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,800
Choi Gi Wu! Do you have any spare wristbands?

111
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,017
Yes, check my bag.

112
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,219
Why is this so heavy?

113
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:20,391
Stop exaggerating.

114
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:24,656
I'm not! How do you even carry this around?

115
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,452
Are you really human?

116
00:11:28,777 --> 00:11:32,672
What's inside this thing?

117
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:48,415
What's this?

118
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:52,611
What gives? You never eat junk food because you're trying to keep in shape.

119
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,222
I didn't buy them to eat them.

120
00:11:54,222 --> 00:11:57,407
Why did you buy them if you won't even eat them?

121
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:02,900
And there are so many of them.

122
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,223
Don't ask.

123
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:09,343
By the way, where's Dong Su? I don't see him.

124
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,923
Who knows? It's not the first time he's skipped practice.

125
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:16,166
I bet he's playing games at an internet cafe again.

126
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,862
But the tournament is coming up soon.

127
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,320
Freshmen can't get on the active roster anyway.

128
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,441
Who knows? If we work really hard, we might get selected.

129
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:28,410
True. It could be possible for you.

130
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,717
Where are you off to?

131
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:46,940
It could be possible for you, but I know it's impossible for me.

132
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:51,445
I'll root for you, Gi Wu. Stay strong on my behalf.

133
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:53,845
And don't forget me when you get selected!

134
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:57,282
Fine, just leave me all alone here.

135
00:12:57,282 --> 00:13:00,070
See you tomorrow! Bye!

136
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:10,163
Hey! You have to return the equipment to the gym!

137
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,802
Eun Ho!

138
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,563
Eun Ho!

139
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:28,695
Please, I'm asking you a favor.

140
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:31,376
I know what you mean...

141
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:32,795
But Dong Su, I think this is...

142
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,280
It's because I'm in a hurry.

143
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,608
A friend can do this much, can't they?

144
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:40,344
But...

145
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:43,456
I did your performance assessment last time too.

146
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,766
I know.

147
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:47,799
That's why I'm asking you to do it one more time.

148
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,945
But I helped you the time before that too.

149
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:52,456
If you keep asking such favors...

150
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:56,068
What if I do?

151
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:58,712
Go ahead.

152
00:13:59,453 --> 00:14:02,032
Go ahead and finish your sentence you jerk.

153
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:06,286
Oh no, Eun Ho! Eun Ho!

154
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:08,664
Are you all right?

155
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:15,963
I just want to be good friends with you.

156
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:21,234
But why are you upsetting me?

157
00:14:38,303 --> 00:14:41,889
No matter how hard I look, I can't find a suspicious kid...

158
00:15:14,132 --> 00:15:19,126
Gi Wu, return your equipment and mind your business.

159
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,189
I'd love to do that, too,

160
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,825
but how can I leave after seeing this?

161
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,141
What does it matter to you?

162
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:30,662
Of course, it matters to me.

163
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:32,914
Eun Ho's in my class,

164
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,877
and you're on our team.

165
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:42,407
Who cares about the baseball team? I can't even get on the roster anyway.

166
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:44,705
I was going to quit soon.

167
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:48,736
I'm going to quit and give boxing a try.

168
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:00,474
Looks like you're not talented in boxing either.

169
00:16:00,474 --> 00:16:02,402
You punk.

170
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,869
It's somewhere around here...

171
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,340
Was he always this strong?

172
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,720
♫  What's going on?  ♫

173
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,380
♫  Everyone's silent  ♫

174
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,890
♫  Within this suffocation, only a thorn tree bloomed  ♫

175
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,870
♫  A circuit turned off in deep despair  ♫

176
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,110
♫  The moonlight digs into me without hesitation  ♫

177
00:16:44,112 --> 00:16:47,689
You finally showed up, Phantom!

178
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:52,320
♫  The underworld where evil spirits hide  ♫

179
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:08,269
Glow!

180
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:10,090
You're here.

181
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:17,102
Did you know that I'd come?

182
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,107
What is it that you want to tell me?

183
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:21,757
I finally found it.

184
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,318
The phantom.

185
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:26,331
What? At your high school?

186
00:17:26,342 --> 00:17:28,197
Yes, I'm hundred percent sure.

187
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:30,040
The finder registered the phantom too.

188
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,951
Who did it stick to?

189
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,587
One of my classmates, Choi Gi Wu.

190
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:39,284
Even though he's on the baseball team, his powers are superhuman.

191
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:42,530
Superhuman powers... It must be Phantom Gaze then.

192
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,146
How big was the pattern?

193
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:47,324
A pattern...

194
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:52,112
A pattern appears when a phantom enters a human body.

195
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,452
And the size of the pattern differs depending on how much it's been consumed.

196
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:56,806
Don't tell me...

197
00:17:56,806 --> 00:18:01,396
that you're saying that you are certain without even checking that first?

198
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,048
So far, I haven't received any report of phantom reactions in the human world.

199
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:13,214
And if it doesn't even have a pattern...

200
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:14,588
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

201
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:15,572
Of course not!

202
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:19,082
I witnessed it with my own eyes. He was using superhuman strength.

203
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:20,500
He was like...

204
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,321
Sorry, but I can't send a Master Hunter with that little information.

205
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,148
We're short of manpower here too.

206
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:30,074
But... what if I'm right?

207
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:32,603
Well, you should first prove that you're right.

208
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:38,113
Use all means to check the pattern with your own eyes and report back to me.

209
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,748
Okay, I understand.

210
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,581
I have something to take care of, so I should get going first.

211
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:49,692
Have some tea while you're here, and have a safe trip back.

212
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:18,581
What! It's awesome if it really goes down!

213
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:21,260
Hey! It's going down!

214
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,910
That's crazy.

215
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,905
- Who's next? 
 - Daebak, Gi Wu!

216
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:26,189
He's gonna beat everyone.

217
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:27,286
Seriously, are you human?

218
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:28,739
His strength is no joke.

219
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:30,204
- Start it right away. 
 - Okay!

220
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:32,379
Ready, set, go!

221
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,382
- Wow! 
 - Are you winning this too?

222
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:40,945
I'm sure he's possessed by a Phantom.

223
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:44,733
But how can I check the pattern?

224
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,650
Eun Ho!

225
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:51,064
- Should I help you? 
 - No.

226
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,982
I'll just help you carry one.

227
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,686
Are you all right? It's heavy, isn't it?

228
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:59,273
It's a little heavier than I thought.

229
00:19:59,273 --> 00:20:01,419
Sorry about that. I can carry them by myself, really.

230
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:04,378
What? You can't carry all this by yourself.

231
00:20:04,378 --> 00:20:08,398
Of course, I should help when someone needs it.

232
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:12,987
I could check it like that!

233
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:13,944
What?

234
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:16,965
Never mind, it's nothing.

235
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:24,539
 What do you want me to do here?

236
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,479
I want you to find the heaviest box.

237
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:29,002
Why?

238
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:31,438
The teacher asked me to bring it.

239
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:37,969
But...

240
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:40,645
why did you ask me

241
00:20:40,645 --> 00:20:42,582
instead of the class president?

242
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,560
That's because...

243
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:52,467
you're the strongest in the class.

244
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:57,289
Is that why you called me?

245
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,847
Fine.

246
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,902
Should I take this one?

247
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:12,629
I don't think that's it.

248
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:20,946
 He will lift somewhat heavy objects with his own strength,

249
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:25,308
 but when he has to lift a really heavy object, he will use the Gaze's power.

250
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:28,728
 Then the pattern will show for sure.

251
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,651
Is it this one?

252
00:21:35,457 --> 00:21:38,511
 But his natural strength is much higher than I thought.

253
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:41,599
I don't think that's it either.

254
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,484
What about that one?

255
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,235
What?

256
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,901
 That's it!

257
00:22:00,757 --> 00:22:02,846
Something's not right.

258
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:06,164
 Now, hurry and show yourself!

259
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:09,393
 Use your power, Gaze!

260
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:11,695
Hey, it feels like it's getting heavier.

261
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:13,999
Yu Na, something's strange!

262
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,251
Can you help me?

263
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,607
Don't be ridiculous. Why should I help you?

264
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:20,905
Go on! Reveal yourself!

265
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:23,867
What are you talking about?

266
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,582
Choi Gi Wu!

267
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:49,392
Why didn't Gaze use its power?

268
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:53,088
Am I really mistaken?

269
00:22:54,514 --> 00:22:57,765
I told you guys to be careful when you hang out.

270
00:22:57,765 --> 00:22:59,329
He's fine, right?

271
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:04,087
Yes, he's a sturdy kid, so he only got a small scratch.

272
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:05,559
That's a relief.

273
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,160
Thank you.

274
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,923
I should get going because of a meeting, so tidy up the place before you leave, okay?

275
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,415
Yes!

276
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:18,405
 I'm glad he's not hurt...

277
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:24,501
But what do I do with this?

278
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:46,900
What do you mean what do I do with it? I just have to return it to where it was.

279
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:52,555
Glow has been busy lately, so she probably hasn't even noticed that the Soulance is missing.

280
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:55,792
It'll be all right if I secretly return it.

281
00:24:20,222 --> 00:24:21,729
The warp...

282
00:24:21,729 --> 00:24:23,953
Where did it go?

283
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:27,949
How many times do I have to repeat the same thing to a smart kid like you?

284
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,577
It's simple.

285
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:34,239
You just need to write ten reports by tomorrow.

286
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,941
Is it that difficult?

287
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,868
How can I do that overnight?

288
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:41,262
Stay up all night, you jerk.

289
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:44,165
Do I have to walk you through every little detail?

290
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:46,918
I can't finish that even if I stay up all night.

291
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:53,016
Then give me yours.

292
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:56,160
Mine?

293
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,645
Why should I?

294
00:24:58,157 --> 00:24:59,772
What did you just say?

295
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:03,799
I asked why I should do that.

296
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:08,473
Wow... Look at that brat's gaze.

297
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,175
Have you lost your mind?

298
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,335
Why are you so confident all of a sudden?

299
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,149
You're acting like this because of Choi Gi Wu, right?

300
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:19,544
Listen, you brat.

301
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:23,684
Because you always get other people's help,

302
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:27,859
your life's a mess like this, you know?

303
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,239
Did you just grab me?

304
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:35,750
Our Eun Ho must've lost his mind, right?

305
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:41,439
Where did it go?

306
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,685
What's going on?

307
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:51,580
But the warp was here this morning.

308
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,470
Why did it suddenly disappear?

309
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,881
Hello?

310
00:26:04,892 --> 00:26:06,682
Is anybody there?

311
00:26:06,682 --> 00:26:08,783
Hello!

312
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,737
What do I do now?

313
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,602
Are you okay?

314
00:26:36,478 --> 00:26:37,887
Yes.

315
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,298
I'm sorry.

316
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:41,107
No problem.

317
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:47,011
But... where are you off to in such a hurry?

318
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,133
I...

319
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:52,693
I'm looking for something.

320
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:55,888
But it's dangerous at night. Why don't you look for it tomorrow?

321
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:02,680
Yeah, I should do that.

322
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,170
Then...

323
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,365
Go around the gym just in case.

324
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:13,906
I heard a strange noise back there.

325
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,559
The gym?

326
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,787
Okay! I'll get going then.

327
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:20,755
Thank you!

328
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:41,280
 Should I help you?

329
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,733
 You can't carry all this by yourself.

330
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,975
 I can carry them by myself, really.

331
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,349
So it was you.

332
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:51,052
I was totally wrong.

333
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,807
Kim Eun Ho!

334
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,179
You're finally showing yourself.

335
00:28:53,464 --> 00:28:55,675
Choi Gi Wu, why are you here?

336
00:28:55,675 --> 00:28:58,953
I heard strange noises, so I came over...

337
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:01,497
What's going on right now?

338
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,828
Is he...

339
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,130
the Eun Ho I know?

340
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,542
 It's now or never.

341
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,414
Hey, Choi Gi Wu!

342
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,580
Hold tight!

343
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,301
Duck!

344
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:05,400

345
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,880
♫  Dangerous breathing  ♫

346
00:30:08,883 --> 00:30:12,154
What... What are you?

347
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,220
♫  A circuit that's turned off in deep despair  ♫

348
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,960
♫  The moonlight digs into me without hesitation  ♫

349
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,070
♫  The power seethes in the strangeness  ♫

350
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,440
♫  The underworld hidden behind the black fog  ♫

351
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,030
♫  Even if a cage that's put around me at the moment of desire makes me suffer  ♫

352
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,810
♫  I'll at least leave a talisman  ♫ 
 ♫  Into the dark  ♫

353
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,180
♫  The trembling that will burst out when the sun sets  ♫

354
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,680
♫  I was born to grow, and I've become complete  ♫

355
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,140
♫  Start the engine when the light is hidden  ♫

356
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,650
♫  Climb up faster past your limits  ♫

357
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,210
♫  Get by, even if they keep pushing you down  ♫
