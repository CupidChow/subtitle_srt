1
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,440

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,593

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,314

4
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:22,022

5
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:33,077
All right. Please draw portraits of your group members

6
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:35,593
and hand in the final product next week.

7
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:37,010
It counts as your performance assessment,

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,948
so don't slack off and do your best, okay?

9
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:42,808
It's a drawing project, everyone, not a doodling project.

10
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:44,942
Start drawing!

11
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:52,927
Who put us in the same group?

12
00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:57,742
It's not me.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,900
Why would I do that?

14
00:01:02,705 --> 00:01:05,191
I thought it'd be nice if we worked together.

15
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,720
Sure. Why not? Let's do this.

16
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:21,060
What is this?

17
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,087
As you can see, it's paper.

18
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:27,614
Well... I was in charge of papers today.

19
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,216
Why you, of all people?

20
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:46,348
The bigger, the better!

21
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:48,691
We can just draw big.

22
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:59,980

23
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:07,267
What is this horrible object?

24
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,585
It's a portrait.

25
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,942
Of whom?

26
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:21,730
Forget it. I'll draw.

27
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,214
Are you good at drawing?

28
00:02:23,214 --> 00:02:26,370
I'm bad at being bad at things.

29
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:40,769
Wow, congrats.

30
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:43,909
It looks like you finally found something you're bad at.

31
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:46,191
It's all about the vibe.

32
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:49,310
What do you know about art?

33
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,997
Well, I know that this isn't art.

34
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:58,448
So your group...

35
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:00,421
- She drew it. 
 - He drew it.

36
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:03,648
I see. It's very interesting.

37
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:12,285
Are we... doomed?

38
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:36,272
That's so cool! Yun Su Yeong!

39
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:38,700
It's Han Su Yeong.

40
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,387
Right, Han Su Yeong.

41
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,948
I didn't know you were good at drawing!

42
00:03:43,948 --> 00:03:45,898
This is why we have to work in teams.

43
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:48,769
There's always at least one person who is good at something.

44
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:55,997
Why are you stopping?

45
00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:57,863
I'm too tired.

46
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,422
My maximum is one drawing per day.

47
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:07,823
Then... Please finish the rest for me.

48
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:24,281
By the way, you're terrible at drawing.

49
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,154
You're worse.

50
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:28,248
- Do you want to ask Yu Na? 
 - Fine, let's ask her.

51
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:29,944
Yu Na, who drew it better?

52
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:33,305
This one is mine, and that is hers.

53
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:38,549
- Sir! 
 - Oh, Min Ji.

54
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:43,791
I heard that we have to do a team project next class.

55
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,590
Can the three of us do it together like we did last time?

56
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,690
Sure.

57
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,786
I knew you guys would want to be in the same group.

58
00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:52,492
You guys are always together.

59
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,478
Yes. We've been friends since childhood.

60
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:58,870
Lucky you, keep up the friendship.

61
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,008
The rose tteokbokki restaurant nearby is so good.

62
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:02,827
You should try it sometime.

63
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:06,593
I wish I had friends like you, too.

64
00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:08,699
- See you then. 
 - Bye!

65
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,685
Bye!

66
00:05:13,926 --> 00:05:17,440
So do you two want to do the project after school?

67
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,845
- Sure, I don't have to go to cram school today. 
 - Okay.

68
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:24,304
Actually, I have to practice for the competition today...

69
00:05:24,304 --> 00:05:26,560
It's fine, you can leave early.

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,332
Let's try to finish it early.

71
00:05:28,332 --> 00:05:31,013
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

72
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,714
Oh! Hey, Seong Bin. Yes, hey.

73
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:38,613
If you're free today, do you want to eat rose tteokbokki with me?

74
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:40,901
You're busy? When do you get off? Oh, okay, I'll hang up.

75
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,020
Okay. Yes.

76
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,361
Okay, I love you.

77
00:05:48,543 --> 00:05:50,643
I feel so lonely.

78
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,312
Three chocolate breads, please.

79
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,010
Thank you.

80
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,909
Can I get one chocolate bread?

81
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:06,674
That was the last one.

82
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,550
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,565
I have to get some for my friends.

84
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:16,529
All three of them?

85
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,090
Yes.

86
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:22,539
You guys are real friends, right?

87
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:26,430
They're not bullies who forced you to buy them, right?

88
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,480
No, we are really close friends.

89
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,208
We even got friendship rings together.

90
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,630
I see. I was just worried.

91
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,285
I can see why you would think that.

92
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:41,798
We're doing a project together, but I have to leave early for my dance lesson today.

93
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:45,061
So I'm buying some snacks for them.

94
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:46,748
- That was why. 
 - Yes.

95
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:49,771
They're really nice people.

96
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:51,785
Then I'll see you around!

97
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,479
Can I get all the bread left in the store?

98
00:07:05,268 --> 00:07:09,915
Now, let's eat some snacks and get back to our drawing.

99
00:07:10,557 --> 00:07:14,783
We need to have good teamwork to catch phantoms.

100
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:18,138
You're right, we're no ordinary team.

101
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,262
Yes. Should we get on with it then?

102
00:07:21,262 --> 00:07:22,265
Fine.

103
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:26,431
Let's eat first and solve this mess.

104
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,004
I grabbed it first.

105
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:38,382
Can't you see my hand is below yours?

106
00:07:38,382 --> 00:07:40,428
But you ate your snack a minute ago.

107
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:43,346
What does that have to do with this? It's first come, first serve.

108
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:46,624
I can't eat any other bread; I have allergies.

109
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:49,751
What a joke, I saw you eat other bread.

110
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:52,138
That's so low of you to lie for a piece of bread.

111
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,108
Look who's talking! Why are you acting so low?

112
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,210
We agreed to work together only three seconds ago.

113
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,584
Stop fighting already!

114
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:05,367
And you! Why aren't you saying something?

115
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:16,566
It's so much easier doing it alone.

116
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:20,933
There, I'm finally done with the sketch.

117
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,445
Working on your homework?

118
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:28,520
Hi, Sunbae. Yes.

119
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,789
It's a group project.

120
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,345
Nice work.

121
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:35,764
- This is you, isn't it? 
 - No.

122
00:08:35,764 --> 00:08:37,896
Oh, is this you?

123
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:45,138
But didn't you say it was a group project?

124
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:47,438
Why are you doing it alone?

125
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:49,278
Two of them won't stop bickering,

126
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,156
and one isn't interested at all.

127
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:57,101
It's natural for a team to have conflicts at first.

128
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:58,787
That's true,

129
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:02,916
but I'm afraid we'll be like this forever.

130
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,957
But once you all get closer,

131
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:07,937
you'll probably have great teamwork too.

132
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:09,890
- Do you think so? 
 - Of course.

133
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,952
There's even a saying that friends get closer while fighting.

134
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,737
Just think of it as a process of getting to know each other.

135
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:20,259
That would be a relief.

136
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,036
Thanks, Sunbae.

137
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:24,104
I should get going then.

138
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,370

139
00:09:42,574 --> 00:09:44,574
Sunbae!

140
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:48,770
Where did he go?

141
00:10:14,255 --> 00:10:16,200
Hey...

142
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,597
Do you have to go now?

143
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:20,575
Yes, I'm sorry.

144
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:23,360
It's fine. It's for the rehearsal for your competition.

145
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,674
You should get going.

146
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:27,953
Yes, we will take care of the rest.

147
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:31,270
You know I love you, right?

148
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,098
- Yes, we do. Hurry, you're gonna be late. 
 - Okay.

149
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:36,632
- Text us when you're done. 
 - Okay, thank you, guys.

150
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:38,862
Bye, bye.

151
00:10:47,801 --> 00:10:50,201
Oh, my wallet.

152
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:52,442
Did I leave it in the classroom?

153
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:58,065
Min Ji is so annoying.

154
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,838
You know how she's like.

155
00:10:59,838 --> 00:11:01,702
But we don't have anyone else to pair up with.

156
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,905
Still, she's so annoying.

157
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,282
It's not her first time doing this.

158
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:07,715
Honestly, what's so special about getting special talent scholarships?

159
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:09,593
She's not the only one who is busy.

160
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:11,429
At least she pays for our snacks.

161
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:15,586
Of course, she should. She never does anything.

162
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:17,000
True.

163
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,053
She's been acting like a snob lately, right?

164
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,653
Yes.

165
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:22,690
So annoying.

166
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,463
How could they do this to me?

167
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:37,946
Why didn't they just tell me?

168
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:46,304
Why did we even get this in the first place?

169
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:19,998
- Give it! 
 - Didn't I tell you to get on time?

170
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:21,868
When will you ever listen?

171
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,036
Why do you care if I'm late?

172
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:37,468
- You piss me off. 
 - You piss me off, too.

173
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:38,895
Everyone in our class hates you.

174
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:41,122
They hate you more.

175
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:44,026
- Did you just push me? 
 - Stop messing around.

176
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:46,448
- Have you lost your mind? 
 - Let go.

177
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:49,274
What are you going to do about it?

178
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:50,441
Do you want a piece of me?

179
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:53,163
What? Who do you think you are?

180
00:12:57,122 --> 00:12:59,836
It's like I'm talking to a wall.

181
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:02,488
Isn't it obvious that I'm better than you?

182
00:13:02,488 --> 00:13:05,712
Excuse me? Gaze, Scared, Dras.

183
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:08,220
I've already caught these three phantoms.

184
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,898
We caught Dras thanks to Su Ho.

185
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:12,988
It's Su Yeong.

186
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:15,586
And we caught Scared because of me.

187
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:20,382
I saved you when you were all trembling in front of the baseball coach ghost.

188
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:25,771
You would've been the same.

189
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:30,284
Are you sure? Unlike someone, I'm not that weak.

190
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,770
Weak? What does that even mean? Gosh...

191
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,323
I've never heard that word in my entire life.

192
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:38,405
You...

193
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:40,896
Come on, let's have an arm wrestle match.

194
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:46,484
You're so childish.

195
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:48,251
What?

196
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,233
Childish?

197
00:13:55,557 --> 00:13:57,435
It seems like it appeared, right?

198
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:58,957
The phantom.

199
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:01,014
Yes, I can feel it.

200
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:04,579
I think... the fourth phantom is Friendy.

201
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:06,774
- Friendy? 
 - Yes.

202
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:10,265
It's a phantom that causes people to fight.

203
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:13,148
The hosts of Friendy

204
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:15,312
will show this pattern.

205
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:21,239
Look carefully.

206
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:23,570
The phantom might have attached itself to them.

207
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:27,090
They've always been like that.

208
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:32,667
Then do you have a clue of who the host might be?

209
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,394
Not yet.

210
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:36,516
I should start looking now.

211
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,006
It's about time it appeared.

212
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:45,883
- Who could it be? 
 - Hey!

213
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:51,899
- What did you just say? 
 - I said it's freaking embarrassing.

214
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,136
What's embarrassing?

215
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:55,824
Honestly, it's embarrassing to hang out with you.

216
00:14:55,824 --> 00:14:58,753
Do you think it's not humiliating for me?

217
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:00,899
Min Ji and I are hanging out with you because we feel bad.

218
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,987
Excuse me? It's the other way around.

219
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:04,778
What are you talking about?

220
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,431
Whatever, just go away.

221
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:08,171
You go away. Why are you asking me to go?

222
00:15:08,171 --> 00:15:11,055
- I was standing here first. 
 - Go, go away, go.

223
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:13,178
- Did you just push me? 
 - Yes, so what?

224
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,404
- Did you push me? 
 - Yes, I did push you.

225
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:15,998
- Go! 
 - You go!

226
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,443
I was here first, move.

227
00:15:17,443 --> 00:15:19,607
- Since when? 
 - I was here all along.

228
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:21,066
- So what? 
 - So you should go.

229
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:23,177
There you are.

230
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,376
You don't have practice today.

231
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:37,707
What are you doing out here?

232
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:41,287
No particular reason. I just wanted some lone time.

233
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:45,949
Are you upset because of what So Jin said earlier?

234
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:48,989
Don't mind her.

235
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,366
I really need you.

236
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:55,899
Right?

237
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:57,980
Of course.

238
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,208
Speaking of which...

239
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:04,162
Can you help me with something?

240
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:08,545
Is it about a phantom?

241
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:11,669
I know who's possessed by it.

242
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:13,554
Who?

243
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:15,612
That's...

244
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:17,559
to be revealed later.

245
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,854
Come to the art room at 7 o'clock.

246
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,573
Okay!

247
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:24,560
Good luck!

248
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:51,513
Didn't you... say that you really needed me?

249
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,896
I did.

250
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,849
So...

251
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,780
what are they doing here?

252
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,057
You're late.

253
00:17:01,057 --> 00:17:04,879
Why did you want to see us today?

254
00:17:04,879 --> 00:17:08,459
I desperately need your help.

255
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,213
The phantom will come here any minute.

256
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,730
What's this phantom's skill?

257
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,177
Yes, who's the host this time?

258
00:17:22,177 --> 00:17:24,159
You'll find out soon.

259
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:26,869
While we wait...

260
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,880
let's play cards.

261
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:45,410
Keep your eyes to yourself.

262
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:49,734
Don't try to take a peek at my cards while you say that.

263
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,302
I always play fair, unlike someone.

264
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:03,599
That's why the phantoms get you all the time.

265
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,992
Don't get in my way later.

266
00:18:04,992 --> 00:18:07,182
When did I ever get in your way?

267
00:18:07,182 --> 00:18:10,584
You should be careful not to bother us later. I can handle it myself.

268
00:18:12,764 --> 00:18:15,077
If you were as strong as Gaze,

269
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:17,879
I wouldn't be worried.

270
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:20,428
Oh... Can't we do that?

271
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:23,736
Can't we release Gaze when we fight?

272
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,529
Absolutely not.

273
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:28,716
When a phantom sticks to a person for long, the person can go crazy.

274
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,699
Crazy?

275
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:34,237
Maybe it's stuck on her right now.

276
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:38,174
What did you say?

277
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:40,443
I won!

278
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:46,350
You distracted me.

279
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,130
You're the one who started it.

280
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,488
Be quiet, I lost because of you guys.

281
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:53,087
This round doesn't count.

282
00:18:53,087 --> 00:18:56,012
Yes. You can't do this, we were busy talking.

283
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:57,991
- This round doesn't count. 
 - Yes.

284
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,021
It doesn't count. Start all over.

285
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:01,906
Yeah, start all over.

286
00:19:02,585 --> 00:19:05,540
Drop it already!

287
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,513
 Why are you suddenly yelling?

288
00:19:16,513 --> 00:19:18,566
 Yes, maybe he's the phantom.

289
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:22,530
 Wow, seriously. I can't work with you guys.

290
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,205
 I don't want to work with you guys, either.

291
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:39,484
I mean, this all started because you called us together.

292
00:19:39,484 --> 00:19:41,318
Are you blaming me all of a sudden?

293
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:44,441
That's because you made the suggestion.

294
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:47,702
Why did you have to suggest playing cards?

295
00:19:56,831 --> 00:20:01,235
You guys... also hate each other, right?

296
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:07,021
Why did I suggest we play cards?

297
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:10,307
Kang Min Ji. No,

298
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:11,881
Friendy.

299
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:14,387
I wanted to summon you.

300
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:19,058
They said you'd come if you heard us fight.

301
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:20,659
And you really came.

302
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:23,676
I told you my information's accurate.

303
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:25,686
Great job.

304
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:27,647
You're quite good at acting.

305
00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:33,882
Friendy's hands become tied when the opponents have strong teamwork.

306
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:36,042
If that's the case...

307
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,694
This should be easy.

308
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:54,245
What's happening?

309
00:20:54,245 --> 00:20:57,822
I guess she gathered enough power when the other kids fought earlier.

310
00:20:57,822 --> 00:21:00,356
What do we do now?

311
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:02,497
Then...

312
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,404
What? Where is she going?

313
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,138
Is she running away?

314
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:16,332
Let's follow her.

315
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,450
Where is Yu Na?

316
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,658
Why is she so fast?

317
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:54,162
Let's check over there first.

318
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:14,105
Can you... handle me by yourself?

319
00:22:14,105 --> 00:22:16,893
Who is worrying about whom right now?

320
00:23:03,537 --> 00:23:05,169
Friendship?

321
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:07,418
It's useless.

322
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:10,543
It hurts.

323
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:42,308
- Yu Na! 
 - Are you all right?

324
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:44,422
What happened?

325
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,371
What... was that?

326
00:23:52,950 --> 00:24:00,060

327
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,108
Isn't he...

328
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,440
♫  Within this suffocation, only a thorn tree bloomed  ♫

329
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,350
♫  A circuit that's turned off in deep despair  ♫

330
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,140
♫  The moonlight digs into me without hesitation  ♫

331
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,250
♫  The power seethes in the strangeness  ♫

332
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,550
♫  The underworld hidden behind the black fog  ♫

333
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,190
♫  Even if a cage that's put around me at the moment of desire makes me suffer  ♫

334
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,970
♫  I'll at least leave a talisman  ♫ 
 ♫  Into the dark  ♫

335
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,410
♫  The trembling that will burst out when the sun sets  ♫

336
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,900
♫  I was born to grow, and I've become complete

337
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,280
♫  Start the engine when the light is covered  ♫

338
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,870
♫  Climb up faster past your limits  ♫

339
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,510
♫  Get by, even if they keep pushing you down  ♫

340
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,050
♫  Burn everything, burn  ♫
