Selected Project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,770
Dr. Meng, are you waiting for someone?

3
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,500
Mr. Guo,

4
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,060
I'm just a bit nervous.

5
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,340
Indeed.

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,800
Such an important academic award ceremony,

7
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,560
and Dr. Meng being a nominee,

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,930
it's natural to feel a bit nervous.

9
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
Your boyfriend didn't come?

10
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,490
Alright,

11
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,180
let's go in.

12
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,570
Yao Jiajian.

13
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,410
What?

14
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,720
I've found something.

15
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,800
Fragments of a blade.

16
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,730
Come take a look.

17
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,240
The separation marks on the murder weapon

18
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
match perfectly.

19
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,050
The top of the skull was hacked.

20
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,600
The wound is quite large.

21
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,520
No skin peeling at the wound edges.

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,050
No subcutaneous bleeding.

23
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,200
There's a boat-shaped depressed fracture.

24
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,660
Extending bone cracks at the wound corners.

25
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,820
The murder weapon is the same.

26
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,460
All three bodies have head wounds from hacking.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Zhu Shan didn't hack and kill

28
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,660
Zhao Dachuan and Li Dahai.

29
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,320
The person who did the hacking from start to finish,

30
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,250
there's another person involved.

31
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,579
The suspect

32
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,280
must have planned to kill Zhu Shan long ago.

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,610
Destroy Zhu Shan's body

34
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,980
and make it look like he fled out of guilt.

35
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,960
There must have been some unexpected situation

36
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,220
that made them act earlier than planned.

37
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,850
Are you alright?

38
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,480
It's nothing.

39
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,000
You call this nothing?

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,040
You're coughing up blood!

41
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,920
Alright, stop examining.

42
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,180
Let's go home quickly.

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,960
Yeah, let's go, let's go.

44
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,280
go back, go back.

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,040
I'll take care of the trace detection.

46
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,280
Let's go, let's go.

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,340
Get some good rest.

48
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,580
Congratulations.

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,730
Thank you, Manager Guo.

50
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,050
Let's have a meal together.

51
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,120
No need, Manager Guo.

52
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,320
I'm waiting for someone.

53
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,720
Here.

54
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,920
Waiting for your boyfriend?

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,680
Such an important award ceremony.

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,810
if he wanted to come,

57
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,880
he would have been here already.

58
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,280
Youqi,

59
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,620
believe me,

60
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,040
whatever you want,

61
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,100
I can give it to you.

62
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,900
You wouldn't understand what I want.

63
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,120
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,570
I got a bit carried away.

65
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,160
Hello?

66
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,680
Yang Ming is sick.

67
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,520
Come to the station quickly.

68
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:04,960
What?

69
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,370
Okay.

70
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,810
Manager Guo,

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,930
could you give me a ride somewhere?

72
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,320
I know you want to follow in my footsteps,

73
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,120
but you can't push yourself

74
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,180
to the point of exhaustion like this.

75
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,080
Come on,

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,000
come here,

77
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:20,880
come on,

78
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,010
have some hot water.

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,840
Drink some water.

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,440
Thank you.

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,640
Finally, you're here.

82
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,160
He's been working so hard he's coughing up blood.

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,600
Youqi,

84
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,770
why are you here?

85
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,360
Who's this?

86
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,840
Mr. Guo,

87
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,370
from Wang Group.

88
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,040
Mr. Guo

89
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,300
gave me a ride here.

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Hello, everyone.

91
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,600
Let's go home.

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,380
No need,

93
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,480
I still have

94
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,680
other things to do.

95
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,840
But you can't

96
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,120
neglect your health.

97
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,680
My sister-in-law is right,

98
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,640
health is the most important thing.

99
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,200
Thanks,

100
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,560
come on,

101
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,440
let's go back.

102
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,720
The remaining work,

103
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,200
leave it to me and Lan Jing.

104
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,120
Comrade Lan Jing

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,440
is also an excellent forensic expert.

106
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,200
It'll be fine.

107
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,800
I know what you're thinking.

108
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Let's go home.

109
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,680
Then,

110
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,330
I'll leave it to you.

111
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,370
What's going on?

112
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
Stealing someone's lover.

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,380
Mr. Guo,

114
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,680
thank you for sending me home today.

115
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,610
Forensic doctor

116
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,340
is a respectable profession.

117
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,650
Alright.

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,800
Let's keep in touch.

119
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,159
Okay.

120
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,680
Take good care of him.

121
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,760
Yang Ming.

122
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,580
I understand you completely.

123
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,680
I know it's because of

124
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,600
your father's situation

125
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,200
that you're working so hard.

126
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,840
But promise me

127
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,280
you won't exhaust yourself like this.

128
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,880
Okay?

129
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,960
No matter what difficulties you face,

130
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,690
I'll always stand by your side.

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,160
I want to be

132
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,210
the brightest sunshine

133
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,760
and the most beautiful flower in your life.

134
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,880
Actually,

135
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,540
that person is quite nice too.

136
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,800
I know.

137
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,220
My parents like him very much,

138
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,320
but I don't.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,560
Youqi,

140
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,980
when I was at my lowest,

141
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,340
you were always there.

142
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,700
I'm truly grateful to you.

143
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,880
Me too.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,600
Oh, right.

145
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,650
Keep this bottle of medicine with you.

146
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,280
It's for treating coughs.

147
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,210
Remember to eat.

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,200
Licorice.

149
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,960
What?

150
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,160
Are you afraid of me, a medical doctor?

151
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,690
harm you?

152
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,320
You

153
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,929
What are you looking at?

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,930
What's going on?

155
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,370
Why did it take so long to open the door?

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,560
Youqi.

157
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,520
Teacher Meng.

158
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,160
That trophy and certificate of honor

159
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,640
were left at the bureau.

160
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,240
Thank you.

161
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,280
No.

162
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,010
Did I interrupt you two?

163
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,720
No, no, not at all.

164
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,850
Speak up.

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
What are you here for?

166
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,160
This is the autopsy report for Zhu Shan.

167
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,160
It detected a small amount of

168
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,320
canine-specific

169
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,120
coronavirus.

170
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,680
The fishermen nearby

171
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,240
all have a habit of keeping dogs.

172
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,000
There are also quite a few stray dogs around.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,880
Lao Xu and his team were in this area

174
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
and found very few body parts.

175
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
So it's possible,

176
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,840
that the suspect

177
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,080
dismembered the body and deliberately fed it to dogs.

178
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,120
The head was too big,

179
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,400
the dogs couldn't eat it,

180
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,320
so they had to choose

181
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,960
to burn and bury it.

182
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
They just carelessly disposed of the body.

183
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,720
Are you alright?

184
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:55,920
You

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,560
Do you want to go check it out?

186
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,760
It's just a small cold.

187
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,360
Besides,

188
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,730
Dr. Meng is here.

189
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,440
What's there to worry about?

190
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,760
They have Dr. Meng.

191
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,480
No,

192
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,330
it's just

193
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,700
chili pepper allergy.

194
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,460
Chili pepper allergy?

195
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:15,840
Yes,

196
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,840
you're allergic to chili peppers.

197
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,760
You know that.

198
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,040
I haven't

199
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,160
been in contact with any chili peppers recently.

200
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,080
I've been very careful about that.

201
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,920
So what do you think

202
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,580
is going on?

203
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,890
Someone who could be present at

204
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,300
all three crime scenes

205
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,840
must be one of the suspects.

206
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,570
We must find the chili peppers.

207
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,000
They might contain

208
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,340
the suspect's biological information.

209
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,420
No problem.

210
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,680
Leave it to me.

211
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,160
The suspect scattered chili powder

212
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,280
at the crime scene

213
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,300
probably to avoid detection by police dogs.

214
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,920
But what they didn't anticipate was that

215
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,040
the police dogs have undergone

216
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,700
training for irritant odors.

217
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,320
That's why

218
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,160
they were able to find Zhu Shan's head.
