Selected project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,280
Your father left here.

3
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,480
He went to Wang Corporation.

4
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,060
I've never heard of it.

5
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,640
I didn't know about this either.

6
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,100
Since he got into trouble,

7
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,800
I haven't

8
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,039
cared about his affairs like this anymore.

9
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,640
I can only work desperately,

10
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,660
work desperately,

11
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,560
to forget my disappointment in him.

12
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,520
Then getting poisoned while experimenting at home

13
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,680
would make sense.

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,240
You still plan to investigate further?

15
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,360
Wang Corporation is very powerful.

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,000
Old Yang,

17
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,200
From my childhood until now,

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,360
you're the only friend I've had a close relationship with.

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,020
You don't need to have any reservations with me.

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,960
Since I want to know

21
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,360
the truth of the matter now,

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,919
we're in the same boat.

23
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,480
If you don't want to investigate,

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,680
I won't say anything.

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,320
If you want to continue investigating,

26
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,540
I'll investigate with you to the end.

27
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,540
Thanks,

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,420
Old Yao.

29
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,079
When Director Qin initially proposed to transfer him here,

30
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,480
I knew what he was up to.

31
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,079
I strongly objected.

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,480
You insisted it was a good thing.

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,650
And now look,

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,740
we've let the wolf into the house.

35
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,760
I spent so much money on this research,

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,800
the data,

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,130
but Old Yang has hidden it away.

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,520
The data,

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,240
it definitely can't be taken out of the company.

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,370
It can only stay in this crappy office.

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,380
Why don't we

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,240
let his son give it a try?

43
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,480
I think it's still too risky.

44
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,760
If he continues like this,

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,320
he'll uncover a lot of things.

46
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,050
The things he's investigating

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,020
are all based on the clues I provided him.

48
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160
As for the direction of his investigation,

49
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
there's nothing to be afraid of.

50
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,450
What the father has hidden,

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,240
the son will find for me.

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,280
It's only natural.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,520
Oh, right,

54
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,240
that Mr. Guo,

55
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,650
tell him to keep his mouth shut.

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,800
I've already arranged for him to go abroad.

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,530
Don't worry.

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,560
As for him,

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,660
he can't stir up much trouble.

60
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,680
Taking this opportunity,

61
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,600
I can also do some weeding.

62
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,079
Just make sure to keep your hands clean.

63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,320
Yang Qihua.

64
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,250
Individual residence.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Who are you?

66
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,290
My father's classmate.

67
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,920
Determine the time of death.

68
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,040
Based on the condition of rigor mortis,

69
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,970
the time of death

70
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,260
was approximately five to six hours ago.

71
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,100
Check for any external injuries.

72
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
We discovered

73
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,880
an hour ago

74
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,080
that he died

75
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,740
in the bathroom of his office.

76
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,220
Lieutenant Xu,

77
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,560
after preliminary investigation,

78
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,600
the victim's time of death

79
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,520
was approximately five to six hours ago.

80
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,050
Alright.

81
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,000
What's the identity of the deceased?

82
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,260
His name is Liu Yaohui.

83
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,580
He's our company's

84
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,900
medical engineer.

85
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,850
He's been with us for over a decade.

86
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,170
He's always been diligent in his work.

87
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,420
This...

88
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,940
What's going on, officer?

89
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,120
Is this an accident

90
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,480
or...

91
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,500
We will investigate this.

92
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
We'll notify you immediately

93
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,799
when we have results.

94
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,000
I detected three types of liquids in the toilet at the scene.

95
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,880
three types of liquids were detected.

96
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,920
One is disinfectant.

97
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,360
Another is toilet cleaner.

98
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,560
When these two liquids are mixed,

99
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,840
they can produce chlorine gas,

100
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,080
which can cause reflexive respiratory center asphyxiation.

101
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,610
However,

102
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,500
this is not enough to be fatal.

103
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,240
A third liquid was also detected,

104
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,800
but at present,

105
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,240
we haven't identified what it is specifically.

106
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,000
However, I suspect

107
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,200
that the victim's death

108
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,880
is closely related

109
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,800
to this liquid.

110
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,280
Additionally,

111
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,720
on the disinfectant bottle,

112
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
some fingerprints were extracted.

113
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,660
After testing,

114
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,360
they were confirmed to be Liu Yaohui's.

115
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
After the autopsy,

116
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,420
we can confirm that

117
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,440
the cause of Liu Yaohui's death

118
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,040
was chemical asphyxiation.

119
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,970
The time of death

120
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,040
was approximately between 1 AM

121
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,340
and 2 AM last night.

122
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,760
So you're saying

123
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,490
it might have been an accident?

124
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,520
It's also possible

125
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,880
that he fell, lost consciousness,

126
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,080
inhaled toxic gases,

127
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,920
and died from poisoning.

128
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,080
We checked the surveillance footage.

129
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,880
Wang Corporation

130
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,680
After 9 PM,

131
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,240
no one left the building.

132
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,040
Maybe it really was an accident.

133
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,880
Around 12:30 AM last night,

134
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,220
I received a text message.

135
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,080
Let's see.

136
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,120
The time of the text message

137
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,380
coincides with the time of the incident.

138
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,660
In other words,

139
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,360
just after I received the message,

140
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,920
he died.

141
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,520
What a coincidence.

142
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,180
Why don't we

143
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,850
go to the Wang Corporation now and take a look?

144
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,410
What's there to see?

145
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,690
We have no basis.

146
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,520
A bunch of police officers coming and going

147
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,120
would not look good for them.

148
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,160
What if they sue us later?

149
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,780
Don't you think

150
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,370
this is a murder?

151
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,920
Not everything is a murder.

152
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,040
Even if it is a murder,

153
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
someone from inside the corporation

154
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,120
is more likely to be the perpetrator.

155
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,520
Let's first investigate

156
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,840
the relationships within the corporation.

157
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,480
Here's what we'll do.

158
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,610
I'll organize a team

159
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,120
to investigate the Wang Corporation.

160
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,520
to investigate the Wang Corporation.

161
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,560
We'll check their attendance records

162
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,440
and investigate the surrounding area of the corporation,

163
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
looking into the comings and goings

164
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,250
of people during each time period.

165
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,160
Yang Ming, wait a moment.

166
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,680
The rest of you are dismissed.

167
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Yes, sir.

168
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,760
Yang Ming,

169
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,640
the truth is often cruel

170
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,760
and it might end up killing

171
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,960
more and more people,

172
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,400
including yourself.

173
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,500
Do you understand?

174
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,210
510, I'm leaving first.

175
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,120
Excuse me.

176
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,780
Hello, sir.

177
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,120
I'd like to ask you something.

178
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,180
Can't you see I'm busy playing cards?

179
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,680
Sir,

180
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,760
Oh, it's a police officer.

181
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
please feel free to ask anything.

182
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,240
Do you usually park your car

183
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,970
in this spot?

184
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,240
Yes,

185
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,090
we like to park here regularly.

186
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,920
Because the people from Wang Corporation are quite wealthy.

187
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,320
We help them transport people and goods,

188
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,180
and they give very generous tips.

189
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,580
What about last night?

190
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,000
Last night, I also parked here.

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,520
Alright.

192
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,120
Thank you.

193
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,800
I investigated Wang Corporation.

194
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,960
The dashcam of a truck parked across the street

195
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,760
revealed that

196
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,000
on the night of the incident,

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,720
two people

198
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,320
entered the corporate building

199
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,580
through the back door.

200
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,520
Because the back door

201
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,640
has no surveillance cameras,

202
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,440
we couldn't find any related information before.

203
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,680
One of them is Fang Ao,

204
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,600
who is a technical consultant for Wang Corporation

205
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,930
and was in competition with the deceased.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
The other is Chen Qingqing,

207
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,760
who is Wang Yue's secretary

208
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,620
and a Ph.D. student in chemistry.

209
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,360
She's known to be quite smooth in her dealings with people.

210
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,440
Currently, these two individuals

211
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,300
are the main suspects in the case.

212
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,360
That's the situation.
