00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,850
Selected project for Guangdong Province's Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,020
There's also an encrypted document.

3
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,120
This...

4
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,640
We saw in my father's office...

5
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,200
the missing pages of the document...

6
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
might be in this confidential file.

7
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,009
Sure enough.

8
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
This document...

9
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,840
Uncle Yang didn't want others to discover.

10
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,160
Hold Ctrl and scroll the mouse wheel.

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,200
Oh my god.

12
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,480
Ephedrine.

13
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,770
It should be ephedrine.

14
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,900
The research and development data for the substitute.

15
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,480
Without this data...

16
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
we can't prove Wang Yue's crime.

17
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,440
Liu Yaohui...

18
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,690
and my father...

19
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,240
were the managers of this document's backup.

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,170
The managers...

21
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,420
also met with misfortune.

22
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,579
Family.

23
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,960
Ninety-four.

24
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,280
Twelve.

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,400
Six.

26
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,970
This is a Caesar cipher.

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,200
Ninety-four...

28
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,330
represents page 94.

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,240
Twelve...

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,120
represents the 12th line.

31
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,520
Six...

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,720
represents...

33
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,780
the 6th character.

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,840
or symbol.

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,680
Is this the...

36
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,620
missing corresponding data?

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Not necessarily.

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,860
This is a basic substitution method.

39
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,440
The code must have been encrypted.

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
We need the key...

41
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,560
and the original code...

42
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,530
to get the final answer.

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,900
For example...

44
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,240
ninety-four...

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,900
plus six...

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,200
is page 100.

47
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,240
Twelve...

48
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,320
minus nine...

49
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,380
is the 3rd line.

50
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,720
Six...

51
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,900
plus twelve...

52
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,020
is the 18th character.

53
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,640
So that means...

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,210
these chemical symbols...

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,120
are in a certain book's...

56
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,240
100th page...

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,960
3rd line...

58
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,050
18th character.

59
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,450
Or rather...

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,970
some chemical symbols.

61
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,610
Very likely.

62
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,490
So...

63
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,760
with so many books...

64
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
how can we determine which one it is?

65
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,320
Mr. Wang,

66
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,610
may I take a look?

67
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,250
Sure,

68
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,040
go ahead.

69
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,250
General Chemistry.

70
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,040
What?

71
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,490
It's the book my father gave me.

72
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,320
The first time I used a Caesar cipher...

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,980
to spell...

74
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,800
was from this book.

75
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,760
I found the chemical element symbols.

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,360
Xiao Fang.

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,000
This is from the explosion site at Chen Qingqing's house.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,440
from the severely damaged computer,

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,600
the hard drive that was removed.

80
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,560
Go to the technical department

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,480
and see if you can recover any data.

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,040
Understood, Captain Xu.

83
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,100
I'll go right away.

84
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,360
Yang Ming.

85
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,840
Why are you here?

86
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,040
Where are the things?

87
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,420
Everything has been put away.

88
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,880
You haven't been here for so long,

89
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,040
I thought they were all unnecessary items.

90
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,640
So I had someone tidy up a bit.

91
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,040
Where did you move the things to?

92
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,920
They're all in the company warehouse.

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Take me there.

94
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,650
Let's go.

95
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
Yang Ming,

96
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,440
Although I

97
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,840
wrongly accused your father before

98
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,760
and caused you suffering,

99
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,120
but

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,440
it was also I

101
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,320
who uncovered the truth about his death.

102
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,120
It wasn't you.

103
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,920
Call me uncle.

104
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,200
That's not too much to ask, is it?

105
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,100
Uncle Wang.

106
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,640
It's been years since my father passed away.

107
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,040
You're only dealing with these things now?

108
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,720
Yes.

109
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,440
I

110
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,620
have thought about it many times,

111
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,400
but

112
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,680
in the end,

113
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,600
I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,360
But you know,

115
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,890
one has to move forward.

116
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,380
With all the chaos in the company,

117
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
I suddenly realized

118
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,360
there are many things

119
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,560
that if I don't do now,

120
00:05:59,159 --> 00:05:59,680
in the future,

121
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,740
I might not have the chance to do them.

122
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,280
Are you

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,200
looking for something specific?

124
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,460
Let me help you search.

125
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,020
You're in such a hurry.

126
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,060
It seems you have something you want to find too.

127
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,240
Yes,

128
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,620
there is something I want to find.

129
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,970
But I believe

130
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,760
it

131
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,120
will soon

132
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,960
appear before me.

133
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,970
How can you be so sure

134
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,560
that it will definitely appear?

135
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,120
It will.

136
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,720
Nine four one two six.

137
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,760
What is it?

138
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,810
How do you know about it?

139
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,370
General Chemistry.

140
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,140
I really didn't expect

141
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,260
your father

142
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,080
would put such important data

143
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,520
in the most inconspicuous

144
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,440
book.

145
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,780
Your father

146
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
and Liu Yaohui

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,160
were both researchers in the project team.

148
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,560
Liu Yaohui handed over his part of the data,

149
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,650
but your father,

150
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,700
he refused to hand it over.

151
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,810
So you're saying

152
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
my father's death

153
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
is related to you?

154
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,480
Yang Ming,

155
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,080
you just asked me

156
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,520
why I kept these things

157
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,720
until now.

158
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,500
Let me tell you,

159
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,159
before your father died,

160
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
he told me

161
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,440
the key

162
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,960
was hidden in his office.

163
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,820
I searched for a long time,

164
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
but couldn't find any clues.

165
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,850
I've only just realized

166
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,360
you

167
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,480
are the key.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,600
You mean

169
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,260
you deliberately led me here?

170
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,760
Yang Ming,

171
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
don't throw away your promising future

172
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,480
for some so-called sense of justice.

173
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,740
Don't throw away your promising future.

174
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,380
Uncle Wang,

175
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,460
let me tell you,

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,400
I won't betray my father,

177
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,420
and I won't betray myself either.

178
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,260
Just because one or two corrupt cops were dragged down,

179
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,090
do you think all police officers will comply?

180
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,850
Wang Yue!

181
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,289
Open the door, Wang Yue!

182
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,090
Wang Yue!

183
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,580
Open up!

184
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,770
Wang Yue,

185
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,120
what exactly are you trying to do?

186
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,000
The pharmacological formulas and research data

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,440
are hidden in this ordinary chemistry book.

188
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,700
Can't I just buy a copy?

189
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,730
You're as stubborn as your father.

190
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,370
President Wang,

191
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,320
where are you rushing off to?

192
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,240
Why are you here?

193
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,640
We're here to pick you up.

194
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,090
Wang Yue,

195
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,880
you're suspected of murder.

196
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,940
Please come with us for questioning.

197
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,880
You must be joking.

198
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,340
Murder.

199
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,240
You police officers,

200
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,120
you need evidence to handle a case.

201
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,320
You can't just arrest people randomly.

202
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,600
We've recovered the hard drive from Chen Qingqing's computer.

203
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,080
There's a whistleblower letter on it.

204
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,880
It documents your criminal activities over the years,

205
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,840
including the murder of Yang Qihua,

206
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,170
Liu Yaohui, and others.

207
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,160
We're also searching for other evidence.

208
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
You can't escape.

209
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
It's all hearsay.

210
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,440
Where's the evidence?

211
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,640
Heaven's net is wide,

212
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,540
loose, but lets nothing through.

213
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,680
Let's see

214
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,170
how capable you are.

215
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,200
If

216
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
within 24 hours,

217
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,600
you can't find evidence,

218
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,120
you'll have to

219
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,050
bring me back here obediently.

220
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,180
Fragrance.

221
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,480
Datura.

222
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,960
Scopolamine.

223
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,280
Keep this bottle of medicine with you at all times.

224
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,640
next time, I might not

225
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,770
be able to get there in time to save you.

226
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,240
Licorice.

227
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:11,920
Licorice.

228
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,880
Licorice can alleviate the effects of poison.

229
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,640
Even at this point,

230
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,760
you're still so confident.

231
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,320
As expected of Director Wang.

232
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,400
Seems like you have quite a few umbrellas over your head.

233
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,520
No matter how many umbrellas,

234
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,380
the police can take them all down.

235
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,210
Cuff him.

236
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,440
Behave yourself.

237
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,500
What are you doing?

238
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,640
Hello?

239
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,480
Yao Jiajian.

240
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,000
Yang Ming.

241
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,720
Where are you?

242
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,380
I'm at Wang Yue's company.

243
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,300
in a warehouse.

244
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,050
There's poison gas inside.

245
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
They've been poisoned.

246
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,760
Yang Ming.

247
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,330
Let's go.

248
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,080
Yang Ming.

249
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,400
Dozens of warehouses.

250
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,680
If you're slow,

251
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,800
you'll only find a corpse.

252
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,580
Hello, sir.

253
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,920
Police business.

254
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,880
Get the surveillance footage

255
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,600
from half an hour ago

256
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,660
for all the warehouses immediately.

257
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,520
Yang Ming.

258
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,720
I've already entered the Wang Corporation.

259
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,380
Wait for me.

260
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,330
Wake up, wake up.

261
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,920
Yang Ming.
