Selected project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,880
There's more inside.

3
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,920
On this knife,

4
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,979
suspicious blood stains were found.

5
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,160
Crime scene investigation.

6
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,000
Detonator tube.

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,680
Crime scene investigation.

8
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,280
The copper wire on it

9
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,479
Crime scene investigation.

10
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,410
is identical to what was found at the explosion site.

11
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,010
You're not mute, are you, officer?

12
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,250
Let's go.

13
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,420
Come with me to a place.

14
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,960
I really don't understand this.

15
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,160
Why are we remeasuring the blast radius?

16
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,220
Don't you trust me?

17
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,920
The blood samples collected from Zhu Shan's bathroom

18
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,120
are not significant.

19
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,320
Because he could easily claim

20
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,450
it was from his own accidental injury.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,720
Finding

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,240
the materials for the explosive device in the kitchen

23
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,720
also doesn't conclusively prove

24
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,480
that Zhu Shan was directly involved in the assassination.

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,920
The surface of the physical evidence was burned,

26
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,380
leaving no fingerprints.

27
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,360
We can only make him talk

28
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,490
if we find strong evidence linking Zhu Shan to the scene.

29
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,890
We can only make him talk

30
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,300
What kind of evidence?

31
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,490
Zhu Shan was severely injured,

32
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,370
Yao Jiajian.

33
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,020
There's blood on the nail.

34
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,520
Yang Ming and I

35
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,040
conducted a new measurement and search of the explosion site.

36
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,920
On a rock,

37
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,260
we found this nail.

38
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,810
After testing and DNA comparison,

39
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,400
we discovered that the blood stains on it belonged to two people.

40
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,530
One is Zhao Dachuan,

41
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,740
and the other is the driver, Zhu Shan.

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,900
Based on the blood coagulation time,

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,200
we estimate that Zhu Shan's blood

44
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,880
was shed last night.

45
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,840
The timing matches perfectly.

46
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,960
Therefore, we deduce

47
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,080
that the suspect must have

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
after being injured,

49
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,920
gone home to bandage the wound.

50
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,680
This proves that Zhu Shan was present at the scene.

51
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,210
Correct.

52
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,880
We found a footprint on the coffee table

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,399
and another on a small stool

54
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,680
in Zhu Shan's living room.

55
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,880
We compared these two footprints

56
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,680
with those of Zhu Shan

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,480
and his wife,

58
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,079
and found

59
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,960
they don't belong to either of them.

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,960
There are two more people involved.

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,420
After visiting Zhu Shan's house,

62
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
I've also overturned my previous judgment.

63
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
This is not a simple case of

64
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,159
robbery and revenge murder.

65
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,560
It could be a group crime.

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,920
Driver Zhu Shan has experience in car repair

67
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,640
and knows some

68
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,200
mechanical assembly techniques.

69
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,240
He might have the ability

70
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,040
to make remote control devices.

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,730
However,

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,120
if he's someone with counter-detection skills

73
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,580
and meticulous thinking,

74
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,480
it's unlikely that he would

75
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,240
carelessly dispose of the explosive device manufacturing materials.

76
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,700
Is someone framing him, or

77
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
is Zhu Shan's wife

78
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,159
also involved in the murder?

79
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,760
We can't determine that yet.

80
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,960
The important thing now

81
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,890
is to find Zhu Shan's whereabouts.

82
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,450
His wife must be hiding something.

83
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,410
Yang Xiu.

84
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,680
What did Zhu Shan tell you yesterday?

85
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,360
He hasn't been back for many days.

86
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,620
I don't know anything.

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,040
You were at home all day yesterday.

88
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,680
Yes.

89
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,610
A neighbor said,

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,930
Zhu Shan came home injured.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,040
We have already found

92
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,360
his blood stains in your house.

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,640
The time when the blood stains occurred

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,770
was also last night.

95
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,530
The timing matches perfectly.

96
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,360
These footprints were found

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,280
on the chair in your house.

98
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,080
They're not yours or Zhu Shan's.

99
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,120
Zhu Shan,

100
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,330
did he really kill someone?

101
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,680
Now it's not about Zhu Shan killing someone.

102
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,409
We suspect you killed someone.

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,920
No,

104
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,640
I absolutely did not kill anyone.

105
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,120
You think saying you didn't makes it so?

106
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,250
All the evidence now

107
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,040
points to your involvement.

108
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,800
Last night,

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,760
Zhu Shan did come back.

110
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,280
and his face was injured.

111
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,210
Why are you here?

112
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,240
Who told you to come?

113
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,680
Honey,

114
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,320
what happened to your face?

115
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,520
Quickly, get inside.

116
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,820
Don't make a sound.

117
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,880
Shan,

118
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,880
Big brother.

119
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,610
Big brother.

120
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:29,880
Sit down.

121
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,240
Your house is so shabby.

122
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,770
Big brother,

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,640
when will you give me my share of the money?

124
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,320
What money?

125
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,250
Share the money.

126
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,159
What are you yelling about?

127
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,760
Yell again and I'll kill you.

128
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,680
The three of them seemed to say something.

129
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,480
But then there was no more sound.

130
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,650
I was too scared.

131
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,680
So I hid under the bed and didn't dare to come out.

132
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,400
Then I dozed off.

133
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,080
When I woke up in the morning, I was about to leave.

134
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,000
Then I heard someone coming in again.

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,400
So I didn't dare to go out.

136
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,500
I only dared to go out after that person left.

137
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,320
I saw blood on the ground.

138
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,000
I was about to run.

139
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,280
But I was worried.

140
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
So I came back.

141
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,840
I cleaned the house

142
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,700
inside and out.

143
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,159
Finally, you came in.

144
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,360
Did Zhu Shan tell you about the murder?

145
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,800
No.

146
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,570
He didn't say anything.

147
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,000
Then why did you clean up the crime scene?

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You were involved in the murder.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,520
No.

150
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,850
I really didn't.

151
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,930
My legs just moved on their own.

152
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,280
I came back to clean involuntarily.

153
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,080
But I really didn't kill anyone.

154
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,020
What were the characteristics of those two people?

155
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,760
Officer,

156
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,840
Actually,

157
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,940
I didn't see their faces clearly.

158
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,370
It seemed like one person was talking.

159
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,210
The other one

160
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,210
didn't say anything at all.

161
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,060
Anything else?

162
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,800
No.

163
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,360
That's not right, is it?

164
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,160
Your neighbors told us

165
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,000
that you and your husband

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,400
divorced six months ago.

167
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,900
The house belongs to Zhu Shan.

168
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,930
Is this true?

169
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,600
Yes.

170
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,540
Since you no longer live here,

171
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,120
why did you

172
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,860
show up yesterday?

173
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,760
I just...

174
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,640
I just wanted to come back and see

175
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,700
if there was anything valuable left.

176
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,860
It was just a coincidence.

177
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,450
Get to the point.

178
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,020
Six months ago,

179
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,080
Zhu Shan caught me with my lover.

180
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,500
That's why he divorced me.

181
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,200
That lover

182
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,040
was Zhao Dachuan, who was killed in the explosion.

183
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,880
He was angry

184
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,680
and wanted compensation.

185
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,800
But he ended up getting beaten instead.

186
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,440
But officer,

187
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,320
I really didn't know

188
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,980
he would dare to kill someone.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
I really didn't know.

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,530
Zhu Shan is a major suspect.

191
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,320
He has the skills.

192
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
He has the motive.

193
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,740
Lieutenant Xu,

194
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,120
if what his wife said is true,

195
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,490
it was a group crime.

196
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,770
Zhu Shan made his wife hide in the room.

197
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
He was aware of the danger.

198
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,040
A protective action.

199
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,320
Remember the photos

200
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,720
we saw in the living room?

201
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,040
The couple seemed very loving.

202
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,680
At least Zhu Shan

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,720
had deep feelings for his wife.

204
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
So Zhu Shan's motive

205
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,960
for revenge, murder, and robbery

206
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,220
becomes even clearer.

207
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,480
Is there a ship tomorrow?

208
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
There won't be a ship leaving for five days.

209
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,290
Get the money ready.

210
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,970
Brother,

211
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,530
I'm craving roast chicken.

212
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,200
(Go find your roast chicken then.)

213
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,000
Alright, alright.

214
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,520
Thanks, brother.

215
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,250
I'm off then.

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,920
Third Brother,

217
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,760
Third Brother,

218
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,850
I've missed you so much.

219
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:55,760
This time,

220
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,480
Give your brother a discount, will you?

221
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:56,960
No way.

222
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,420
Not a penny less than 5.

223
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,000
It looks like

224
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,200
they abandoned the car and fled to escape punishment.

225
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,840
Not necessarily.

226
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,540
Captain Xu,

227
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,600
There are signs that the car has been cleaned.

228
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,200
No fingerprints were found.

229
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,890
Let's begin.

230
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,820
Captain Xu,

231
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,840
The blood samples have been collected.

232
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,370
Alright.

233
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,280
Captain Xu.

234
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,120
There's an irritating smell in the car.

235
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,450
Okay.

236
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,360
Crime scene investigation kit.

237
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,200
Captain Xu.

238
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,600
Look at this.

239
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,130
Alright.

240
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,420
We also found this.

241
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,960
Maybe the suspect is...

242
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,890
...a womanizer.

243
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,370
Important lead.

244
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,640
Ah Jin.

245
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,200
Focus on investigating...

246
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,440
...hair salons, massage parlors...

247
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,640
...and similar entertainment venues.

248
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,690
Serious mentor.

249
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,100
Of course I'm serious.

250
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,920
Yang Ming.

251
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,330
Are you alright?

252
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,130
I'm fine.

253
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,600
Shop degree.
