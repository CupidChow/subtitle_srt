Selected project for Guangdong Province's Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,320
8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide.

3
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,720
The content is very high.

4
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,380
8-what-yl?

5
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,020
This is the chemical name for capsaicin.

6
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,520
The chili pepper found at the scene.

7
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,000
It contains a high level of capsaicin.

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,880
Scoville scale.

9
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,140
It's over one million.

10
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
There's a type of chili pepper that matches this description.

11
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,960
commonly known as

12
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,759
ghost pepper.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,479
People who love eating this kind of chili pepper.

14
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,680
They are real devils.

15
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,120
There's another theory.

16
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,000
It's said that this chili pepper can cure stomach problems.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,560
Maybe.

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,160
This person might have a stomach problem.

19
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,840
Are you crazy?

20
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,640
This can cure stomach problems?

21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,370
Capsaicin high.

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,840
What high?

23
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,919
It's achieved by consuming.

24
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,640
foods rich in capsaicin.

25
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,600
which produces a euphoric feeling.

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
Capsaicin brings a spicy sensation.

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
It makes people produce endorphins.

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,680
Enough endorphins.

29
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,640
usually makes people experience.

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,770
something similar to a runner's high.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,120
You don't understand again, do you?

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,920
The killer must be relying on this.

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,180
To keep themselves constantly excited.

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,680
Is this hard to understand?

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,640
Isn't it just a kind of.

36
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,400
chili pepper that's rarely sold in the market?

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
If the suspect loves eating this.

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
they will definitely buy it again.

39
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,300
Or have a large purchase history.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,760
Based on eyewitness descriptions.

41
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,320
we have obtained.

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,780
sketches of two suspects.

43
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,880
Additionally.

44
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,200
The suspects have a particular fondness.

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,240
for ghost peppers.

46
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,440
At all three crime scenes.

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,160
traces of this chili pepper were found.

48
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,920
So we need to.

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,160
thoroughly investigate the markets.

50
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,720
and shops.

51
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,320
that sell this chili pepper.

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,760
Bro,

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,200
Haven't we got money now?

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,920
Why don't we get a hotel room?

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,480
What hotel?

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,420
Aren't you afraid of getting caught?

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,680
Bro,

58
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,020
I haven't eaten anything all day.

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,280
It's too cold.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,860
There are two chili peppers left.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
One for each of us.

62
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:37,920
Here,

63
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,560
eat it.

64
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
How does it taste?

65
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,530
The spiciness will warm you up.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,060
(Goes to buy a pound of chili peppers)

67
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,520
Fermented black beans.

68
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,040
Douchi.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,520
Boss,

70
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,250
do you have any Huoshaoyun?

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,480
Devil's Spice,

72
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,610
how much do you want?

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,930
Give me a jin.

74
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:41,760
Alright.

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,480
Just a moment,

76
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll get it for you.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,730
It's inside.

78
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,530
Fermented black beans.

79
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:54,840
Locust tree fermented black beans.

80
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,640
Ghost fermented black beans.

81
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,960
Fermented black beans.

82
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,740
Ghost fermented black beans.

83
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,820
Is it ready?

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,690
It's ready, it's ready.

85
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,500
Sixty yuan.

86
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,370
Keep the change.

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,530
Thank you, boss.

88
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,840
Let's take a look here first.

89
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,300
Douchi.

90
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:15,920
Boss,

91
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,760
hello.

92
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,880
Police.

93
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
I have a question.

94
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,240
Has anyone recently

95
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,400
bought Devil's Spice from you?

96
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,260
Yes, they have.

97
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,970
Do you recognize these two people?

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,160
I investigated the main farmers' markets.

99
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
urban villages,

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,800
and surveillance around dried goods stores.

101
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,159
We found one of the suspects

102
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,520
appearing in an urban village.

103
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,920
The structure of urban villages is crowded,

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,880
with fewer surveillance cameras,

105
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,080
and a complex mix of people,

106
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,740
making it a good place to hide.

107
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,800
Yesterday at 4:25 PM,

108
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,540
the suspect

109
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,159
went to a dried goods store in the urban village called

110
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,240
Guangyuan Home

111
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,480
and bought a pound of ghost peppers.

112
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,210
At that time,

113
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,380
weren't you just in that area?

114
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,120
I

115
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,620
didn't come up empty-handed.

116
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,840
There are many

117
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,930
hair salons,

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,760
wellness centers,

119
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,880
and massage parlors in the urban village.

120
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,800
We unexpectedly discovered that

121
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,440
the suspect

122
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,160
frequently visits these types of establishments.

123
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,240
After the incident,

124
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,000
the suspect has only

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,320
appeared at one hair salon

126
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,980
and hasn't gone to any others.

127
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,440
Can you confirm the location?

128
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:11,960
It's confirmed.

129
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,220
We've already sent people to keep watch.

130
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,730
You've done well this time,

131
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,360
finding the crucial lead with the peppers.

132
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Yang Ming,

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,060
do you have any questions?

134
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,320
Although the suspect bought the peppers,

135
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,600
he didn't eat them.

136
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,920
We can't rule out that he bought them for someone else.

137
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,120
Whether he bought them for someone else

138
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,980
or for himself,

139
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
as long as we find him,

140
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
we can find leads.

141
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,490
Alright,

142
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,520
find him as soon as possible.

143
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,100
Little sister.

144
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,140
Third brother.

145
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,130
Did you miss me, little sister?

146
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,020
did you miss me?

147
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,480
Ah.

148
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,600
Are we washing the big head or the small head today?

149
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,800
We'll wash both the big and small heads.

150
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,500
Let's wash your small head first.

151
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Okay, okay, okay.

152
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,800
What's there to wash on a head?

153
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,280
You can wash it for half an hour.

154
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,740
Master.

155
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,340
Master.

156
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,380
Should we take action now?

157
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,890
Ah Feng, Ah Feng.

158
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,860
bring people here for backup.

159
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,440
Police!

160
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,500
Don't move!

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
The information comparison is complete.

162
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,320
We have the identities of both individuals here.

163
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,920
Wu Xianda.

164
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,680
Wu Xianda, Wu Xianming.

165
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,880
The two are brothers, Wu Xianming.

166
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,960
Their parents died early, and they never went to school.

167
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,080
The older one worked at a slaughterhouse.

168
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,720
He's mute.

169
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,920
The younger one is idle and lazy.

170
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,280
He's addicted to gambling and women.

171
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,520
Both have criminal records.

172
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,920
They were previously imprisoned for multiple robberies,

173
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,450
assault,

174
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,060
and organizing gambling.

175
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,240
Turn to the next page.

176
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,400
This one is love.

177
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,799
Someone who loves to eat spicy food, right?

178
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,650
Wu Xianming.

179
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,360
Tell me the truth.

180
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,080
Confess the details of the crime committed by you and your brother.

181
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,610
Haven't I already told you?

182
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,800
I did it alone.

183
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,160
My brother is an idiot.

184
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
He knows nothing about it.

185
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
We have already obtained

186
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,840
evidence of Wu Xianda's involvement in the murder.

187
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,280
Do you think

188
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,540
you can exonerate him?

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,730
Wu Xianming,

190
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,210
you'd better wise up

191
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,940
and tell the truth.

192
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,360
Sigh.

193
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,000
Do you know

194
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,760
what it feels like to have someone pee on your face?

195
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,560
what it feels like to have someone pee on your face?

196
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,720
When I was five years old,

197
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,120
my parents died from drug abuse.

198
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,820
My brother and I

199
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,600
were looked down upon by the villagers.

200
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,400
We were cursed wherever we went.

201
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
They despised us.

202
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,280
I remember

203
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
there was an adult

204
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,360
who not only beat me,

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,640
but also poured feces and urine on me.

206
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,680
He kept calling me 'junkie's son.'

207
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,480
Junkie's son.

208
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,960
I got so angry then.

209
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,560
I ran to his house

210
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,760
and stabbed him once.

211
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,240
You know, my mute brother,

212
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,700
do you know what he did?

213
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
He took me

214
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,530
and stabbed that man three more times.

215
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,960
Since then,

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,920
I swore

217
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,280
I would never touch drugs.

218
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,860
He doesn't seem right.

219
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,160
It does seem so.

220
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,920
Something's wrong.

221
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,450
Let's go.

222
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,520
Hurry!

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,400
Hurry!

224
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,800
Quick, quick, quick!

225
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,260
Come on.

226
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,250
He's been poisoned.

227
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,660
I'll go get the emetic.

228
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,410
Hurry up!

229
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,320
Phenobarbital.

230
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,120
Dad.

231
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,040
Dad.

232
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,480
What's wrong, Dad?

233
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:35,840
Dad.

234
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,010
Wu Xianming.

235
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Do you know what you've been taking?

236
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,120
I don't know.

237
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,020
Yes.

238
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,540
You should ask that massage girl.

239
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,520
She knows best.

240
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,040
That prostitute.

241
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,900
We've already interrogated her.

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,720
She told us.

243
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,530
You've killed someone.

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,530
I didn't.

245
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,640
She's talking nonsense.

246
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,840
She's slandering me.

247
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,280
Do you know what you've been taking?

248
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,480
It's a drug similar to

249
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,760
phenobarbital.

250
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,570
A lethal poison.

251
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,200
If the forensic expert wasn't here today,

252
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,330
you would have died.

253
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,250
Impossible.

254
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,730
That's just Viagra.

255
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,170
It's not poison.

256
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Who gave it to you?

257
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,530
Was it your brother?

258
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,680
Every time you come back,

259
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,920
does he force you to drink a lot of water?

260
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,480
Store degree.
