00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,780
Selected project for Guangdong Province's Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Library.

2
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,640
Yang Ming.

3
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,240
Yang Ming.

4
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,000
Yang Ming.

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,039
Dad.

6
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,410
Why are you here?

7
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,200
Yang Ming.

8
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,740
Are you thinking of giving up?

9
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,650
This isn't like you.

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,860
You've already found the answer.

11
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,380
I'm very happy.

12
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,760
I'm not happy.

13
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,280
Why?

14
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,560
Why do you have to

15
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,960
give me this kind of task?

16
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,240
Yes.

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,480
Father was wronged,

18
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,240
died under mysterious circumstances.

19
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,360
As a son,

20
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,610
I should seek the truth.

21
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
But do you know?

22
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,720
When I learned

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,760
that you placed all your last hopes

24
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,680
on me,

25
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,210
do you know how scared I was?

26
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,740
I'm afraid.

27
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,010
I'm afraid I won't find the answer.

28
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,579
I'm afraid I won't catch Wang Yue.

29
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,640
If all of this

30
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,720
is ruined by my hands,

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,640
what should I do?

32
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,040
Dad.

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,120
Yang Ming.

34
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,580
I didn't consider your feelings.

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,540
Dad apologizes to you.

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
You've endured so much,

37
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,490
do you regret it?

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,329
I can't hold on anymore.

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,160
I don't know

40
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,690
if I should continue being a forensic doctor.

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,380
We are night walkers in the darkness,

42
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
a force against evil.

43
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,760
As a forensic doctor,

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,360
we face death every day.

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,180
But the closer we get to death,

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,260
the more we see the preciousness of life.

47
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,530
So forensic doctors

48
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,120
not only need to find

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,320
the truth of the case,

50
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,820
more importantly,

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
we need to understand the meaning of life.

52
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,050
Darkness is a force,

53
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,440
and so is light.

54
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,360
Darkness pulls people into the abyss,

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,200
while light

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,240
can help us move towards the future.

57
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Walking at night,

58
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,300
facing those dark forces,

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,320
everyone will be afraid.

60
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,400
At times like this, we hope someone will appear

61
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
to light the way and lead us forward,

62
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,610
to find the path of justice.

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:15,960
Dad,

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,200
you were once my lighthouse,

65
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,560
but now you're gone.

66
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,170
I've lost my direction.

67
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,400
Son,

68
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,920
Dad also had these doubts before.

69
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,000
Later,

70
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,250
I figured it out.

71
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,540
Some things

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,130
must be done by someone.

73
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,440
I'm willing to light myself up

74
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,640
to do what I should do.

75
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,450
Dad can only show you the light,

76
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,170
but the one who truly walks out of darkness

77
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
is only yourself.

78
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:58,560
Dad.

79
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,480
Dad.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,760
Dad.

81
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,560
Dad.

82
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,400
Dad.

83
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,640
Dad.

84
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,320
Dad.

85
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,900
Which warehouses?

86
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,090
Warehouse No. 8.

87
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,920
Yang Ming is in Warehouse No. 8 in the southeast direction.

88
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,320
No. 8.

89
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,840
Where is Warehouse No. 8?

90
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,360
Fourth floor in the southeast corner.

91
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,080
Fourth floor.

92
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,880
fourth floor.

93
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:41,840
No. 8.

94
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,800
Yang Ming.

95
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,740
Captain Xu,

96
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,820
let's go together.

97
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,520
Three.

98
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,760
Yang Ming.

99
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,680
Wang Yue has been brought back to the station for questioning.

100
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
that chemistry book

101
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,960
has also been taken back for analysis.

102
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,840
if what you said, Youqi,

103
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
about the Caesar cipher rule

104
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,880
corresponds to the KSP symbols in the book,

105
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,600
which are the key chemical components

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,640
and decomposition formulas

107
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,440
related to drug manufacturing,

108
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,140
this would be crucial evidence to convict Wang Yue.

109
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,480
Don't worry too much.

110
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,320
The allergy medication he took

111
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,450
contains licorice,

112
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,690
which can delay the onset of toxicity.

113
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,410
We'll know the specific situation

114
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,760
soon enough.

115
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
I've known Yang Ming for many years.

116
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,960
We've been through thick and thin together,

117
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,020
both big and small.

118
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,680
I know.

119
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,580
You were good classmates,

120
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
good rivals,

121
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,659
and good brothers.

122
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,800
Yes,

123
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,300
good brothers.

124
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,900
No matter what difficulties we face,

125
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,740
we always face them together.

126
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,530
But this time, I can't help him.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,800
But you've already rescued him.

128
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,640
It's too late.

129
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
It's not too late.

130
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,570
As long as he's still alive, it's not too late.

131
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,400
As long as he's alive,

132
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,770
there's still hope.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,130
The surgery is over.

134
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,500
Doctor,

135
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,690
how is Yang Ming?

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,860
He inhaled the toxin from datura.

137
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,960
Fortunately, he had ingested some

138
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,400
medication containing licorice,

139
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,480
which slightly delayed the onset of the toxin.

140
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,760
Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

141
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,680
Post-operative recovery is crucial.

142
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,010
He needs plenty of rest.

143
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,240
Post-operative recovery...

144
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,800
Recovery...

145
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,760
Good, good, good.

146
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,320
Thank you, doctor.

147
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,520
It's nothing.

148
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,580
Thank you, doctor.

149
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,200
Yang Ming.

150
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,970
The doctor said the surgery was very successful.

151
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,800
but you need to rest.

152
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,480
That must be difficult for you.

153
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,560
Xu Da said,

154
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,850
Wang Yue has been arrested.

155
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,290
The incident from back then

156
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,940
has finally come to light.

157
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,280
Yang Ming,

158
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,760
why do you always make me worry?

159
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,799
You never tell me when you're facing difficulties.

160
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,260
You come back acting like nothing happened.

161
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,850
You once said

162
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,050
that life doesn't bully ordinary people,

163
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,170
it bullies cowards.

164
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,720
My dad said

165
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,360
that life doesn't bully ordinary people,

166
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,760
it only bullies cowards.

167
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,200
Yang Ming,

168
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,740
my parents have agreed to us being together.

169
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,940
She said she understands now.

170
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,680
It's not that you chose to be a forensic doctor,

171
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,780
but that forensic science chose you.

172
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,000
Yang Ming,

173
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,160
let's

174
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,520
get married.

175
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,640
Yang Ming.

176
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,520
The weather is really nice today.

177
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,320
It's good for you, the patient,

178
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,520
to get some sunlight.

179
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,480
It is nice,

180
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,200
just a bit hard to keep my eyes open.

181
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,920
It's good enough that we pushed you out here to get some sun.

182
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,560
Don't complain so much.

183
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,220
Captain Xu.

184
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,520
Captain Xu.

185
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,010
How are you feeling?

186
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,130
Just feeling a bit weak.

187
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
How's Wang Yue doing?

188
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,610
They all confessed.

189
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,920
He killed all of them.

190
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,840
Dishwashing liquid.

191
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,100
Car air conditioning.

192
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,520
He used everything he could.

193
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
All to make it look like an accident.

194
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,480
So,

195
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,940
what about Fang Ao?

196
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,080
Wang Yue specially made

197
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,410
a handkerchief laced with VX nerve agent.

198
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,970
During their struggle,

199
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,280
he covered Fang Ao's mouth.

200
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,810
Wang Yue,

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,840
you won't give me the money

202
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,360
and you're trying to harm me?

203
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,280
You're asking for death!

204
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Give me the money!

205
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,160
Calm down!

206
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,360
Don't do anything rash!

207
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,960
Step back!

208
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,500
Before we arrived,

209
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,400
he took advantage of the moment

210
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,000
and put it back in his pocket.

211
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,920
The method of crime is quite ordinary, huh?

212
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,930
The message Liu Yaohui sent you

213
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,060
was the other half of the data.

214
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,640
We found

215
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,160
their drug manufacturing lab.

216
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,680
The evidence is conclusive.

217
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,740
Your father's case is also resolved.

218
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,040
And the drug dealer Hu Fengxiang

219
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,500
was also killed by Fang Ao.

220
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,360
It was all to make you investigate the Wang Corporation

221
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,240
and find the data your father left behind.

222
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,600
Also, all those involved

223
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,360
in faking his son's

224
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,490
mental illness certificate back then

225
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,720
are under investigation.

226
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,920
Captain Peng, 10013,

227
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,880
was also involved back then.

228
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,720
Captain Peng,

229
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,320
the protective umbrella, huh?

230
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
Captain Peng killed Chen Qingqing.

231
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,330
Quick, let's go.

232
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,410
Not only that, 10013

233
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,360
was also tipping off

234
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,420
about all the cases

235
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,940
related to the Wang Corporation.

236
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,040
Back then, when Chief Qin

237
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,770
proposed to transfer him here,

238
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,280
I knew what he was up to.

239
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,100
I strongly disagreed.

240
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,440
You insisted it was a good thing.

241
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,280
Well, look now,

242
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,000
we've let the wolf into the house.

243
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,200
Justice may be delayed,

244
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
but it will not be absent.

245
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,130
There's one more thing.

246
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,520
The organization, in recognition of your father's

247
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,720
outstanding contribution to solving the case,

248
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
has specially issued

249
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,320
a second-class merit medal.

250
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,480
Diandu.
