00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,170
Dr. Yang,

3
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,280
we've found

4
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,840
the suspect who sold drugs to Wu Zongfan.

5
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,480
The suspect's name is Hu Fengxiang.

6
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,140
Take a look.

7
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,700
Thanks.

8
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,120
Thank you.

9
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,840
What's going on here?

10
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,040
Trying to curry favor, huh?

11
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,240
Don't talk so much when someone's treating.

12
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,700
Come on.

13
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,600
Cheers.

14
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Wu Zongfan

15
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,800
bought

16
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
so many special drugs

17
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,240
because he has a history of drug use.

18
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,700
The drug dealer introduced him to this drug.

19
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,560
I know.

20
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,920
We were all there when Captain Xu interrogated him.

21
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,650
He even gave up the drug dealer.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,120
He even gave up the drug dealer.

23
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,280
When the drug enforcement team arrived,

24
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,880
the dealer was already dead.

25
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
We've examined the body.

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,260
What are you trying to say?

27
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,340
I was there too.

28
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,760
I'd like to ask for your help.

29
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,360
You

30
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,770
Go ahead.

31
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,500
I need to do a

32
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,960
physicochemical analysis report on the drugs

33
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,480
found on the drug dealer.

34
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,760
What do you want that for?

35
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,420
I found that

36
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,440
the autopsy report of the drug dealer

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
is identical to my father's.

38
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,610
Your father?

39
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,720
So I need to figure out

40
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,380
the connection between them.

41
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,400
You know,

42
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,970
my father

43
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,320
had an incident in the physical and chemical analysis unit,

44
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
or died from accidental poisoning.

45
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,860
I can't help you with that.

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Yang Ming,

47
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,760
you don't want the superiors to know

48
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,820
that you're investigating your father's case, right?

49
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,280
I forbid you to do this.

50
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,920
But this is the only breakthrough.

51
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,050
What breakthrough?

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,920
You've been here for less than a month,

53
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,880
and you're already investigating your father's case.

54
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,440
Do you know

55
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,240
this will offend a lot of people?

56
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,839
You don't want to stay here anymore, do you?

57
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,920
You can just leave without a care in the world,

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,380
but what about Meng Youqi?

59
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,800
Have you thought about Old Qin and the rest of us?

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,640
Alright, alright,

61
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,680
if he won't help, I will.

62
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,480
It's just a pathology matter,

63
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:25,760
not a big deal.

64
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,920
Have you lost your mind?

65
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,520
Be careful not to bring trouble upon yourself.

66
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,290
Lan Jing.

67
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,060
Yes.

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,840
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
I didn't mean it just now.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,130
It's not your fault.

71
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,820
You've always wanted to know,

72
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,650
when facing burned bodies,

73
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
why I get so troubled, right?

74
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,560
I thought

75
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,560
I was brave enough to face it.

76
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,090
My father

77
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,000
was a firefighter.

78
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,680
During a major fire mission,

79
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,100
he sacrificed himself to save a girl.

80
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,650
When I arrived at the scene,

81
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,600
his body was completely burned,

82
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
beyond recognition.

83
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,160
I couldn't recognize him at all.

84
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,680
I kept telling myself,

85
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
That's not my father.

86
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,080
That's not my father.

87
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,520
That can't be my father.

88
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,320
His teammate told me

89
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,080
he insisted on saving that girl.

90
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,820
He only said one thing:

91
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,360
He said,

92
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
'That girl

93
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,920
is the same age as his daughter.'

94
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,240
My father once told me,

95
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,140
'It's not that I chose firefighting,

96
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,440
firefighting chose me.'

97
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,720
I didn't understand it then.

98
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,520
Later, I became a police officer

99
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
and became a forensic pathologist.

100
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,400
When I saw

101
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,240
those bodies,

102
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,320
one after another,

103
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,320
I finally understood

104
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
what he meant.

105
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:23,960
So,

106
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,360
it's not that I chose forensics,

107
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,160
forensics chose me.

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,560
Youqi.

109
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:54,960
Youqi.

110
00:07:59,159 --> 00:07:59,760
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,880
Did you call me for something?

112
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
It's nothing.

113
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,360
We haven't

114
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,160
gone out together in a long time.

115
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,360
I had to cancel our plans because of the last two cases.

117
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,820
I really feel bad about it.

118
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,440
It's okay.

119
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,640
I didn't say anything.

120
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,600
I'm happy that you can be so dedicated

121
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,440
to your work.

122
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,290
I know that when there are no cases,

123
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,200
you're like a

124
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,460
bird trapped in a cage.

125
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,320
The forensic scalpel

126
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,720
is your wings to soar.

127
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,700
Is there anything I can do for you?

128
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,480
Hello?

129
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,450
Okay.

130
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,650
I'll be right there.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,530
Alright,

132
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,360
you can go.

133
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:02,960
What case?

134
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,760
Why so urgent?

135
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,490
There's no case.

136
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,240
Did I say there was a case?

137
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,080
No.

138
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
What are you up to?

139
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,400
The thing you wanted.

140
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,580
I had my colleagues in the physical and chemical analysis group do it.

141
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,050
Thanks, man.

142
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,120
Don't mention it.

143
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,480
I'm not the type

144
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,160
who would make mistakes for a friend.

145
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,280
As a trace evidence examiner,

146
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm just curious about the results.

147
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,410
I didn't give you anything.

148
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,220
Captain Xu,

149
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
is there anything I can help you with?

150
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,720
It's nothing.

151
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,170
Please, have a seat.

152
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,700
No need.

153
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,610
I have something to attend to shortly.

154
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,320
Yang Ming.

155
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,840
You still won't give up, will you?

156
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,640
Of course not.

157
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,380
Haven't I told you before?

158
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,240
The case has already been concluded.

159
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,500
Why don't you let it go?

160
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,600
Let it go?

161
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,700
Captain Xu,

162
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,640
I'll say it again.

163
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,770
Do you really believe my father

164
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,600
died from accidental poisoning?

165
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,660
It was an accident.

166
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,640
Old Qin personally conducted the autopsy.

167
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,520
I didn't find anything unusual at the scene either.

168
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,720
All the evidence suggests

169
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,200
he accidentally poisoned himself at home.

170
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,880
Don't you trust me and your Uncle Qin?

171
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,040
I've gone through all the documents my father left behind.

172
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,640
Every experiment that was recorded,

173
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,040
I've tried to replicate.

174
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,320
But I can't find

175
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,280
the experiment that caused his poisoning.

176
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,080
I don't know why.

177
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,740
Captain Xu,

178
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,080
is this matter

179
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,880
related to someone else

180
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,900
in the department?

181
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,770
I'll keep these documents for now.

182
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,300
The files have been brought over.

183
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,700
He won't investigate.

184
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,220
Deputy Chief Peng.

185
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,560
Diandu.
