Selected project for Guangdong Province's Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Library.

2
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,200
This is 'Tracing the Case.' I'm reporter Xiao Yun.

3
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,760
This evening,

4
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,840
in the artificial lake behind me,

5
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,120
a female body was discovered.

6
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,160
The cause of death is currently unknown.

7
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,640
The police have cordoned off the crime scene.

8
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,400
Our forensic experts have arrived at the scene

9
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,640
and will begin their examination immediately.

10
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,760
As for the details of this case,

11
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,440
we will continue to follow up and report.

12
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,700
Please stay tuned to 'Tracing the Case.'

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,320
Listen,

14
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,220
what are you doing?

15
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,780
what are you doing?

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,490
Hurry up.

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,720
It's normal to be nervous for your first lead examination.

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,920
Just relax.

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Captain Xu.

20
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,680
At 5 p.m.

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,840
A couple was swimming

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,720
when they discovered a body and called the police.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,200
Female,

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,500
completely naked.

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,240
Possible sexual assault before death.

26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,160
Local police station received the report

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,200
and sealed off the scene.

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,960
Look,

29
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,400
there's an artificial lake ahead.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,200
People usually come here for fishing and camping.

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,960
The body has multiple stab wounds.

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,240
Deep strangulation marks on the neck.

33
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,800
The body has been soaked in water.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
The exact cause of death,

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,520
whether drowning or post-mortem disposal,

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,280
needs to be confirmed by diatom testing.

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,810
Alright,

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,560
let's go check the front.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:39,980
Police!

40
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,960
The victim has many stab wounds,

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,290
but I couldn't find any blood at the scene.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,800
Look,

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,610
there are drag marks ahead.

44
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,820
It's probably around this position.

45
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,800
The soil shows signs of disturbance.

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,329
The grass is flattened in the same direction.

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,640
This should be from the suspect

48
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,840
dragging the body.

49
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,690
The soil is still a bit damp.

50
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,480
It has

51
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,040
rained.

52
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,380
The crime scene environment will be severely damaged.

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,340
Captain Xu,

54
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
the suspect must have made

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,760
careful plans and scouted the location.

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,040
They deliberately disposed of the body here.

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,440
Unable to carry the body,

58
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,140
they resorted to dragging it.

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,760
Based on this partial footprint,

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,200
we can preliminarily deduce

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,460
that the suspect has a small, thin build.

62
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,170
The body was dumped right here.

63
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,160
Are you

64
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,120
scared?

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,860
I'm not scared,

66
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,200
I'm worried.

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
Once this incision is made,

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,890
what if we can't find any clues?

69
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,080
If we could preserve the victim's body,

70
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
I'd rather put down this scalpel

71
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,330
and give them their final dignity.

72
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
I understand you,

73
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,800
but from the moment they lay here,

74
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,930
from that moment on,

75
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,740
she became just evidence.

76
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,880
Our duty as forensic experts

77
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,360
is to find the truth,

78
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,159
speak for the dead,

79
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,220
and protect the rights of the living.

80
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,440
I know.

81
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,640
You reacted quite quickly during the autopsy.

82
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,080
I can't let my sweat

83
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,340
contaminate the body.

84
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
More importantly,

85
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,780
it's about respecting the deceased.

86
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,260
This is a basic quality of a forensic expert.

87
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,640
Guess what,

88
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,260
why are there so many stab wounds on the body?

89
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,560
Guess?

90
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,880
Every word a trace evidence examiner says

91
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,540
is a judgment based on scientific examination.

92
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,040
This is a fundamental skill for trace evidence examiners.

93
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,120
You're not being rigorous in your speech as a forensic expert.

94
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,920
Yes,

95
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,400
Director Yao.

96
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,010
Dr. Lan, please.

97
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,600
Victim of Case 1017.

98
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,760
Based on the location

99
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,160
of the stab wounds on the victim's body, we can deduce

100
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,560
The suspect most likely used their right hand to hold the knife.

101
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:25,960
No.

102
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,480
Faced with such dense stab wounds,

103
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
it's impossible to determine if the attacker used their left hand

104
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,520
or their right hand.

105
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,640
Why is that?

106
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,340
Because

107
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,690
when the victim is facing the suspect,

108
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,240
if the suspect stabs with the knife in their right hand,

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,900
the injuries will be on the left side of the body.

110
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,760
When the suspect stabs with a backhand grip,

111
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,440
the injuries will be distributed on the right side of the body.

112
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,080
There's another possibility.

113
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,610
When the victim's back is facing the suspect,

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,800
and they stab,

115
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:55,200
the injuries will be on the same side as the suspect's stabbing hand.

116
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,860
Therefore,

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,680
faced with such dense stab wounds,

118
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,840
it's even more impossible to determine if it was done with the left hand

119
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,200
or the right hand.

120
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,410
What are you doing here?

121
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,920
Shouldn't you be in Haimen City?

122
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Yang Ming has already been transferred to our bureau.

123
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,240
Old Qin just retired.

124
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,360
Lan Jing has limited experience.

125
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,760
The forensics department needs additional personnel.

126
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,320
So,

127
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,480
we transferred Yang Ming

128
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,520
from Haimen City.

129
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,000
You'll be colleagues from now on.

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,860
How come I didn't know about this?

131
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,039
Do I need to report everything to you?

132
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,840
Of course not.

133
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,169
Before Old Qin retired,

134
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,559
he was already thinking about building your team.

135
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,960
You should learn from this.

136
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,490
Alright.

137
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,840
Also,

138
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,240
the higher-ups have given instructions

139
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,680
to quickly solve the case of the female corpse by the lake,

140
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,940
apprehend the killer,

141
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and solve the case as soon as possible.

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,520
Yes,

143
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,340
Captain Xu.

144
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,850
I'd like to examine the body first.

145
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,360
The corneas are moderately cloudy.

146
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,120
There's no foam around the mouth and nose.

147
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,360
Livor mortis is settled on the back of the body.

148
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,160
There's a fatal wound on the neck.

149
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,320
The wound is approximately 4 centimeters in length.

150
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,480
It doesn't reach the internal cavity.

151
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,680
The edges of the wound are clean.

152
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,560
It's a single-edged incised wound.

153
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
The murder weapon

154
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,960
was likely a sharp instrument like a fruit knife.

155
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,280
Before death, the victim

156
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,010
suffered inhumane treatment.

157
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,280
There are no signs of vaginal tearing.

158
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,210
Rigor mortis hasn't yet subsided.

159
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,840
The backs of the hands and feet show white wrinkling.

160
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,640
So I estimate

161
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,810
the time of death

162
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,860
to be within the last 72 hours.

163
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,450
Yao Jiajian,

164
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,280
I'll give you one minute

165
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,840
to tell me about the crime scene.

166
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,680
It's all written down.

167
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,080
You can read it yourself.

168
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,920
The body was found in the north of the city.

169
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,480
I know.

170
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
I'll do it myself.

171
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,360
The crime scene investigation and preliminary autopsy

172
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,880
confirm

173
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,960
that the lakeside was not the primary crime scene.

174
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,920
Apart from the knife wounds on the victim's body,

175
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,760
there were no signs of struggle or resistance.

176
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,090
Each cut across the skin

177
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,720
was the suspect experiencing the process.

178
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,160
It seems the victim didn't resist.

179
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,490
Dispose far, bury near.

180
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,090
However,

181
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,240
the killer's cleverness backfired.

182
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,300
A clean crime scene

183
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,840
is actually the most suspicious.

184
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,700
In other words,

185
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,200
the suspect had meticulously planned before the murder,

186
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,440
including

187
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,360
the choice of time and place.

188
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,880
In short,

189
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,080
the body doesn't lie.

190
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,560
Even if what you say is true,

191
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,200
are you saying it was committed by a stranger

192
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,240
or someone the victim knew?

193
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,560
Whether it was committed by someone familiar or a stranger

194
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,820
cannot be determined.

195
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,360
The autopsy results show

196
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,000
the victim didn't die from asphyxiation,

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
but from excessive blood loss.

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,800
Is that right?

199
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,400
Yes.

200
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,640
That means

201
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,240
before dying,

202
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,280
the victim didn't call for help or struggle.

203
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,480
This is the key issue.

204
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,480
The victim

205
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
couldn't have been

206
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,250
mentally unstable, right?

207
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,010
Was the victim a masochist?

208
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,900
Even if they were a masochist,

209
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,240
when their life was in danger,

210
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,200
they should have instinctively fought back, right?

211
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,600
It's not that they didn't want to resist,

212
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,330
but that they couldn't resist.

213
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,860
Is the autopsy report out?

214
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,600
I suspect

215
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,640
the diatom test shows

216
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
that in the victim's body,

217
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,880
there were no diatoms from the lake water.

218
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,540
Therefore,

219
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,960
it's confirmed that the body was dumped after death.

220
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,490
Correct.

221
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
I've compressed the victim's lungs.

222
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,400
Only a small amount of foam entered the trachea.

223
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,000
There's no hydrostatic pulmonary edema.

224
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,130
and the lungs are in a state of atrophy.

225
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,500
It's not drowning.

226
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,360
The preliminary test for semen stains is negative.

227
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
There's no sign of sexual assault.

228
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,770
At least not a violent sexual assault.

229
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,680
The physicochemical examination of the gastric mucosa shows

230
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,880
in the deceased's body

231
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,560
there are drugs that can cause unconsciousness,

232
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,320
such as high concentration of alcohol.

233
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,120
She died in a state of paralysis,

234
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,520
without time to struggle or fight for survival.

235
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,180
Captain Xu,

236
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,240
I suggest we check the area around the bars,

237
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,760
investigate suspicious individuals,

238
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,120
examine surveillance footage,

239
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,880
and try to find the source of the body.

240
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,410
Alright.

241
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,240
You didn't secretly show him

242
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,220
the examination report, did you?

243
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,920
Didn't we both go

244
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,450
to get the report together?

245
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,240
Diandu.

246
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,600
Doctor Diandu.
