Selected project for Guangdong Province's Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,180
Why aren't you resting at this late hour?

3
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,200
and

4
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,920
it's related to the reason for standing you up.

5
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,320
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,360
It's okay.

7
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,480
I haven't seen

8
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,560
you so enthusiastically immersed in work for a long time.

9
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,620
So many documents.

10
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,840
You're just like Uncle Yang,

11
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,370
always bringing work home.

12
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,440
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,960
What are you looking for?

14
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Have you found it?

15
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,560
Not yet.

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
The information about alcohol.

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,930
I put it here before,

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,480
but I don't know where it went.

19
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,210
Then let me help you look for it.

20
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,320
Okay.

21
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,560
A few days ago,

22
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,960
I met a painter.

23
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,610
Very unique.

24
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,480
She likes to imitate

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,320
Zdzisław Beksiński.

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,600
Have you heard of him?

27
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,360
It's great that you're back.

28
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,440
Now we can be together every day.

29
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,840
That's it.

30
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,880
Thank you.

31
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,090
Get some rest early.

32
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,320
What are you doing?

33
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,080
As a forensic doctor,

34
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,520
don't pay too much attention to your hairstyle.

35
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,050
Be upright in your conduct.

36
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
Just focus on doing your job well.

37
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,660
Isn't that learning from you?

38
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,680
Setting up such a physical and chemical laboratory at home,

39
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,400
must have taken quite some effort, right?

40
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,460
You little rascal,

41
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,520
it's all for

42
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,610
helping you study more regularly.

43
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,240
I got it.

44
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,700
Let's take a photo.

45
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,800
Three.

46
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,680
Dad.

47
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,920
Please smile.

48
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,520
Okay.

49
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,040
Cheese!

50
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:38,840
Dad.

51
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,280
Dad.

52
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,090
It's solved.

53
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,290
it's solved.

54
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,090
it's solved.

55
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,370
it's solved.

56
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,810
it's solved.

57
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,960
What's wrong?

58
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,360
I've cracked the secret of the rose champagne.

59
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,600
After all these years,

60
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,130
you haven't changed at all.

61
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,720
What?

62
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,320
No wonder your colleagues always say you're inflexible.

63
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,920
you,

64
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,160
when you want to know something,

65
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,240
if you don't figure it out,

66
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,300
you won't let it go.

67
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you remember

68
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,060
that time in Paris?

69
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,500
The Louvre?

70
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,159
Yes,

71
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,880
to figure out

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,800
what secret

73
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,280
the Mona Lisa was hiding,

74
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,850
you stood there for a full three hours,

75
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
until the museum closed,

76
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,380
and you reluctantly left.

77
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,800
I was also deceived at that time.

78
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,210
Someone said

79
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
that the Mona Lisa contained

80
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,800
the key to decoding the human DNA sequence.

81
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,520
I happened to be interested in world-famous paintings,

82
00:07:59,520 --> 00:07:59,920
so

83
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,040
I specifically went there to study it.

84
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,440
Then,

85
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,770
I even hired a few painters to make copies,

86
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,240
trying to find the key

87
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,040
through comparison.

88
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,660
So you were scammed

89
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,660
out of two thousand euros.

90
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,280
Alright,

91
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,680
stop looking at that now.

92
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,610
Let's eat first.

93
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,880
Youqi,

94
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,280
you usually deal with

95
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,410
people who have mental illnesses.

96
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,480
You must be careful about your safety.

97
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,410
Wherever you go,

98
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,370
remember to send me photos.

99
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,159
Oh, right,

100
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,520
I recently

101
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
met a painter,

102
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,440
the one I told you about yesterday.

103
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
She might be able to

104
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,880
paint the picture you want.

105
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,480
Okay,

106
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,800
another day

107
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,660
we can meet her.

108
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,880
Slow down.

109
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,810
Are you done eating?

110
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,640
I'm going to work now.

111
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,240
Looking for you.

112
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,720
This is a glass of rose champagne.

113
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,580
This is a cocktail I mixed myself.

114
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,280
Try it.

115
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,760
It's very similar to rose champagne.

116
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,720
But the alcohol content is a bit high.

117
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
You mean to say...

118
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,800
The suspect used rose champagne...

119
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,160
...to drug the victim?

120
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,440
To be precise,

121
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,720
it was with their own specially mixed rose champagne.

122
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,480
The one used to knock out the victim

123
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,560
The suspect's drink

124
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,440
is very similar to the taste of rose champagne.

125
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,640
The taste is similar.

126
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,330
However,

127
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,920
they added

128
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,050
a key chemical component to the drink.

129
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,560
Do you all see this bottle of green liquor?

130
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,220
This bottle

131
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,130
is absinthe.

132
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,920
A small amount can affect one's mind

133
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,200
and spirit,

134
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,040
transporting one to a fantastical realm,

135
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,560
producing a hazy euphoria,

136
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,560
thus stimulating creative potential.

137
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,160
That's why

138
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,850
absinthe is banned in many countries,

139
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,400
but some artists still

140
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,720
use it to seek creative inspiration.

141
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,440
Some say

142
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,720
the difference between you and Van Gogh

143
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,320
is just a bottle of absinthe.

144
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,560
Thujone

145
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,840
inhibits the body's production of

146
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,040
neurotransmitters.

147
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,760
Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid

148
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,760
blocks or inhibits

149
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,820
the over-excitation of nerve cells,

150
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,200
thus making one's body and mind

151
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,720
calm,

152
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,520
peaceful,

153
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,440
and relaxed.

154
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,600
If there's a lack of

155
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,160
If there's a lack of gamma,

156
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,420
it can cause insomnia,

157
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
nervous tension,

158
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,400
hysteria, and other

159
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,730
mental abnormalities.

160
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,360
So I speculate

161
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,380
the suspect

162
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
used the thujone in absinthe

163
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,160
as a substitute for date rape drugs.

164
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,760
One glass is enough to render someone unconscious

165
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,290
and cause hallucinations of sexual arousal.

166
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,620
And this fragrance

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,200
should

168
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,320
also be related to absinthe.

169
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,560
But I didn't detect

170
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,490
any related chemical components.

171
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,480
I think

172
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,600
we can go to a third-party testing agency

173
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,730
or my university lab

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
for further testing.

175
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,170
The equipment there is better.

176
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,240
If you say that,

177
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,520
Captain Xu won't be happy.

178
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,050
Alright,

179
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,960
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

180
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,020
Yang Ming, tell me,

181
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,280
what kind of suspect

182
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,840
could make this kind of alcohol?

183
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
If the suspect is more knowledgeable about alcohol than the average person,

184
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,760
If the suspect is more knowledgeable about alcohol than the average person,

185
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,240
and understands alcohol better,

186
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,920
knows how to mix alcoholic drinks,

187
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,360
then

188
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,840
they could concoct this kind of alcoholic date rape drug.

189
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,720
You mean

190
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,320
the suspect has long-term exposure to alcohol,

191
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,760
knows how to mix drinks,

192
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,840
and frequently appears in the bar district.

193
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,700
In other words,

194
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,000
the suspect's identity

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,800
is very likely to be a bartender.

196
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,720
Li Xi,

197
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,360
go check the bar's surveillance footage immediately

198
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,040
and take a look.

199
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Did the victims have

200
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,640
any intimate contact with the bartender before they died?

201
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,370
Understood.

202
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,080
I've investigated the surveillance footage of the entire bar street

203
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,320
and found that the victims in both cases

204
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,600
on the day before their deaths,

205
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,720
seemingly had contact with this bartender.

206
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,320
Moreover,

207
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,800
they both drank cocktails he prepared.

208
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,420
So it was the bartender after all.

209
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,360
I've looked into this bartender.

210
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,420
He moves between various local bars,

211
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,960
his movement patterns are erratic,

212
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,240
and he can imitate other bartenders' drinks,

213
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,840
including

214
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,370
rose champagne.

215
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,400
Additionally,

216
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,600
he also sprinkles

217
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,000
countless gold flakes on his own creations.

218
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,160
This bartender has the conditions to commit the crime.

219
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,090
At least for now,

220
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,570
he's the prime suspect.

221
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,890
Lan Jing,

222
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,600
continue examining the bodies

223
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,760
to determine if there's any presence of Thuja orientalis.

224
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,360
Yes, sir.

225
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,240
Store degree
