Selected project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,160
This corpse

3
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,640
is the same as the previous one.

4
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,240
There's

5
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,200
a small amount of gold powder in the hair.

6
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,960
There are deep strangulation marks on the neck.

7
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,880
The wounds on the body

8
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,400
are about four centimeters long.

9
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,280
The wound surface doesn't reach the internal cavity.

10
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,410
The edges are clear,

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,440
indicating a single-edged cut wound.

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,280
It should be from the same sharp weapon.

13
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,160
There are

14
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,960
binding marks on both hands and feet.

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,479
Based on the length of the maggots in the wounds,

16
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,410
the time of death was four days ago.

17
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,120
Four days ago?

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
That's earlier than the first body.

19
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,680
So the body was dumped after being kept for four days.

20
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,740
Let's get started.

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,840
Oh, right.

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,800
Shouldn't you be celebrating with Meng Youqi?

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,729
Celebrate what?

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,520
The heart is normal.

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,120
Check what's in her stomach.

26
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,690
Dr. Lan knows what to do.

27
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,760
We don't need you to give orders.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,320
The deceased was in good health.

29
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,960
The food in the stomach is relatively intact.

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,640
Based on the state of digestion,

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,560
death likely occurred

32
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,620
within one to two hours after eating.

33
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,880
There are petechiae on the neck.

34
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,680
We can rule out mechanical asphyxiation as the cause of death.

35
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,520
There are no other fatal characteristics.

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,360
We can basically confirm that

37
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
the cause of death was excessive blood loss.

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,960
Just like the first body.

39
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
Killed four days ago,

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,020
but the body was dumped today.

41
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,700
What does he do?

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,960
The stomach examination report is out.

43
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
There's alcohol in the gastric mucus,

44
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,490
and gold powder too.

45
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,680
So,

46
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,960
they drank the same kind of alcohol

47
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,200
and went to the same bar.

48
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,360
However, throughout the city,

49
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,640
there are hundreds of bars,

50
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,240
many of which add gold powder

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,800
or gold leaf to their drinks

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
to attract customers.

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,840
If we search,

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,600
we might tip off the culprit.

55
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,490
What are you talking about?

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,330
Look.

57
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,250
This.

58
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,800
What are you doing with that wine?

59
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,560
Didn't I say last time I'd treat you to a drink?

60
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,760
I always keep my word.

61
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,930
Go ahead.

62
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,660
What have you discovered?

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,720
During the autopsy,

64
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,720
you missed a crucial point.

65
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,839
The smell.

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,959
Besides the odor of death,

67
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,360
there was another lingering scent on the victims.

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
Both victims

69
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,720
had the scent of rose champagne on them.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,330
This is rose champagne.

71
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,770
I've heard of this wine.

72
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,080
It's very popular among female customers.

73
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,640
They say

74
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,840
just a small sip

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,040
will make your body emit

76
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,320
the fragrance of roses.

77
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,120
That's right.

78
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,280
However,

79
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,740
four days after death,

80
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,850
would this scent still be present?

81
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,440
This particular rose champagne

82
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,970
is only sold at one bar in the north of the city.

83
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,280
Both victims

84
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,400
had this scent on them.

85
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,720
It's quite obvious, isn't it?

86
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
It means both victims

87
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,800
had been to this bar.

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
The killer must have been there too.

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,160
How do you know

90
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,520
Meng Youqi wanted to celebrate with me?

91
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,040
I'm not telling you.

92
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,850
Celebrate what?

93
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,240
Meng Youqi

94
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,960
has been waiting for you in Binhai City for so long.

95
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,040
You finally got transferred back,

96
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,600
and you didn't even bother to see her.

97
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,240
If I were Meng Youqi,

98
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
I would have broken up with you already.

99
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,020
Let me tell you.

100
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,600
Meng Youqi,

101
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,040
I recently saw some

102
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,000
news about her.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,330
It even trended online.

104
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,730
Look.

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,520
Meng Youqi

106
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,720
has been nominated for the New Era

107
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,400
Young Medical Doctor award.

108
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
And it's a doctorate in psychology.

109
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,370
It really is her.

110
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,290
Impressive.

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,290
That's amazing.

112
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,920
Who knows,

113
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,520
she might be

114
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,580
a future leader in our medical field.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,680
Dr. Yang,

116
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,460
could you introduce us to her?

117
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,680
Why are you so chatty?

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,060
Is Li Xi still here?

119
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,440
Probably.

120
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,450
Let's go.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,240
To the video analysis room.

122
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Let's take a look.

123
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,000
Li Xi.

124
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,640
How's the situation?

125
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,450
We haven't found anything yet.

126
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,920
Well,

127
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
Paradise Bar,

128
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,600
could you pull up the surveillance footage from the past couple of days

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
for me to take a look?

130
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,360
Without Captain Peng's instructions,

131
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
we can't show you.

132
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,280
Captain Peng?

133
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,840
It's just a phone call away,

134
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,770
isn't it? Just ask for permission.

135
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,480
Li Xi,

136
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,400
you're such a handsome guy,

137
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:21,800
Right.

138
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,560
and you're so capable at your job.

139
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,160
Can't you make an exception?

140
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,490
No, no, absolutely not.

141
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,360
We're just trying to solve the case.

142
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,320
The sooner you let us see it,

143
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,120
the sooner we can crack the case.

144
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,090
Please, please.

145
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,540
How about this?

146
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,800
Let's have a little competition between the four of us.

147
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,240
Look at the second row, third monitor.

148
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,040
I'll test you.

149
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,810
Five.

150
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,650
Four.

151
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,520
Three.

152
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,240
What's the license plate number

153
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,440
of the second to last car?

154
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:46,920
What?

155
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,520
This is too much.

156
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,040
Bin BQ2568.

157
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,120
Not bad.

158
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,850
What about the one in front?

159
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,200
Electric.

160
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,900
It's an electric bike.

161
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,220
What's the number?

162
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,810
I don't know either.

163
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,400
You're so funny, Li Xi.

164
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,000
Come on, come on,

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
let's take a look.

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,530
Peng Zhi.

167
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Everyone is here.

168
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,760
Let's begin.

169
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,080
After recent investigations

170
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,880
and comparisons of missing persons in the city,

171
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,409
as well as

172
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,360
screening of transient populations,

173
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,680
we have not yet identified

174
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,540
the identity of the first victim.

175
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
We will further expand our search

176
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,520
to determine the source of the body as soon as possible.

177
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,050
However,

178
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
we have confirmed

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,320
the identity of the body found in the abandoned factory.

180
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,880
The deceased,

181
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,610
Fu Xiaojing,

182
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,140
female,

183
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,970
28 years old,

184
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,600
was a white-collar worker living alone.

185
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,159
She had no close friends or family nearby

186
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,480
and had a relatively simple social network.

187
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,440
Apart from going to bars for entertainment,

188
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,400
she had nowhere else to go.

189
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,480
Neither the landlord nor neighbors saw

190
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,000
any suspicious individuals interacting with her.

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,920
This is the current situation.

192
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,120
We might all be wrong.

193
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,610
The first victim

194
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,200
was found in the artificial lake in the north of the city.

195
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
There were numerous wounds all over the body,

196
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
and deep strangulation marks on the neck.

197
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,000
However, the cause of death

198
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,400
was due to extensive injuries

199
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,260
leading to excessive blood loss.

200
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,420
The second victim,

201
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,160
although found in a different location,

202
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,640
was presented in a manner

203
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,880
almost identical to the first one.

204
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,160
The method of killing is consistent,

205
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,400
so we can basically confirm

206
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,840
it's the same perpetrator.

207
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,800
The alcohol content in both victims

208
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,600
was higher than average levels.

209
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,210
This is our current focus for investigation.

210
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,840
But here's where the problem lies.

211
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,039
If we follow our previous assumptions,

212
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,520
the suspect either picked up the bodies

213
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,850
or got the victims drunk

214
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,679
before committing rape and murder.

215
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,880
Then, the rose champagne

216
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,159
that Yao Jiajian brought back...

217
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,840
The alcohol content isn't high.

218
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,440
To get the victims drunk with this type of wine,

219
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
who knows how many glasses they would need to drink

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,080
to reach a state of unconsciousness

221
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,340
and be completely at the mercy of others.

222
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,280
Then perhaps the killer

223
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,680
used a different type of alcohol to intoxicate the victims.

224
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,520
How do we explain the rose champagne then?

225
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,980
Could it be a coincidence?

226
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,720
Unless

227
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,620
there's something special about this wine.

228
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,330
In such a short time,

229
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,480
two consecutive murder cases have occurred.

230
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
The public opinion is very intense.

231
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,640
Let's investigate the two cases as one.

232
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,320
We should strive

233
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,600
to solve the case quickly.

234
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,400
Yes.

235
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,290
Meeting adjourned.

236
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,480
Yang Ming,

237
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,530
stay behind.

238
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,920
Yang Ming,

239
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,380
I'm pleased

240
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,240
that you've adapted so quickly.

241
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,370
Seeing you just now,

242
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,120
analyzing the case so intently,

243
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,120
I feel reassured.

244
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,930
I hope you can

245
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,400
assist Xu Da and his team

246
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,640
solve the case as soon as possible.

247
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,080
Keep a calm mindset.

248
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,010
Alright.

249
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,080
Captain Peng,

250
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,880
I will do my job well.
