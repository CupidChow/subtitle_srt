Selected project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:32,920
Yang Ming.

3
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,520
Chief Qin is in critical condition.

4
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,920
Come to Binhai Hospital.

5
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:41,960
You.

6
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,360
Father.

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,600
was framed.

8
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,600
His death.

9
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,720
might.

10
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,320
have another reason.

11
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,180
I have also.

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,480
already applied to the leadership.

13
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,800
to have you.

14
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,680
transferred to.

15
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,520
Binhai City.

16
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,039
Do you want.

17
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,400
to find out the truth?

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,200
It's.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,280
It's.

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,360
up to your own.

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,840
choice.

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,079
Uncle Qin.

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,920
Dad.

24
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,200
Dad.

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,440
Wake up.

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,760
Doctor.

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,960
Doctor!

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,760
We are at the crime scene.

29
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,160
We only found this half footprint.

30
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,920
This is the mold.

31
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,240
Everyone can take a look.

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,800
We've investigated

33
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,960
all surveillance cameras within two kilometers of the crime scene.

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
Only the camera at the southeast intersection

35
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,480
captured a figure wearing a black hoodie,

36
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,740
possibly the suspect.

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,840
The deceased is female,

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,100
168 centimeters tall,

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,640
weighing approximately 55 kilograms.

40
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,160
The identity of the body is currently unknown.

41
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,080
As for the time of death,

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,560
it was approximately three days ago,

43
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
based on the examination of the victim's dental wear.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,800
The victim's age has been deduced.

45
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,160
approximately between 25 and 28 years old.

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,920
The victim's body contained a high concentration of alcohol

47
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,040
and traces of gold dust.

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,360
No bleeding in the respiratory muscles.

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,840
No hemorrhagic spots between the lung lobes either.

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,880
It's confirmed that drowning was not the cause of death.

51
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,880
The body has 13 stab wounds all over.

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,200
The cause of death was excessive blood loss.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,160
Case 510725 is classified as murder with body disposal.

54
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,680
So,

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,240
bars

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,480
are the key locations for our next investigation.

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,210
The next task

58
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,079
is to conduct undercover investigations

59
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,240
on the bar street.

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,640
Based on what we know so far,

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,960
the killer's methods are brutal,

62
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,520
and there's a possibility of further crimes.

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,320
So everyone needs to be careful.

64
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:38,960
Li Xi,

65
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,880
retrieve the surveillance footage from around the bar street

66
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,480
and conduct image analysis.

67
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll issue a joint investigation notice later.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,240
we'll investigate recent missing persons in the city.

69
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,440
Let's identify the body as soon as possible.

70
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,770
Okay.

71
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,480
That's all for now. Meeting adjourned.

72
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,840
Dr. Yang,

73
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,400
thank you for your previous analysis.

74
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,730
Please continue to guide me in the future.

75
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,570
Gold powder.

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,760
You deliberately hid it from me.

77
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,840
There's gold powder on the victim's hair.

78
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,600
You saw it yourself, didn't you?

79
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,880
Why are you pretending here?

80
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,080
These are my previous

81
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,250
research materials

82
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,140
about alcohol.

83
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,740
Take a look for reference.

84
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,580
No need.

85
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,329
Let's go.

86
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
According to the plan.

87
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,520
find your positions.

88
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,250
Move out.

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,560
Yes.

90
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,840
Captain,

91
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,240
Yes.

92
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,240
Ah Jin.

93
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,600
How's the situation on your end?

94
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:57,780
Master,

95
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,960
no suspicious individuals detected at the moment.

96
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,890
Keep observing.

97
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,400
Handsome.

98
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,240
Are you alone?

99
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
No.

100
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,450
Let's go.

101
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,080
I'll take you out to have some fun.

102
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,280
No, no, no.

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,040
No, thanks.

104
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,720
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,580
He has to stay with me tonight.

106
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,240
So this is your type.

107
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,420
You've got nothing going for you.

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,240
Just look at you.

109
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,170
Isn't it unfair?

110
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,480
You...

111
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,140
Hey, handsome.

112
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,140
What do you do for a living?

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,440
I'm a

114
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,200
doctor.

115
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,330
Oh, a doctor! That's great.

116
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,200
I feel like there's something wrong with me,

117
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,860
I'm not feeling well all over.

118
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,720
Why don't you come over to my place

119
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,200
and give me a thorough examination?

120
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,860
Guess what?

121
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,580
What kind of doctor only treats dead people?

122
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,120
A forensic doctor.

123
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
That sounds quite exciting!

124
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,800
I

125
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,170
would love to play the role of a corpse.

126
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,620
You're really a forensic doctor?

127
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,380
Oh my goodness!

128
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,200
Bro, you're so mean, you know that?

129
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,880
You should just stay home and keep the corpses company.

130
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,480
Why are you even out for dinner this late?

131
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,160
I wasted my Armani perfume for this.

132
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,040
Damn bastard.

133
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
What rotten luck.

134
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,140
Captain Xu,

135
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,400
Who told you to come here?

136
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,000
Well...

137
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,240
Lan Jing said she was hungry.

138
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,300
so we came out to get something to eat.

139
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,720
Don't give me that crap.

140
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,320
What are you up to, kid?

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,800
I know exactly what you're doing.

142
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,400
Did you just blow your cover?

143
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,290
We don't need you right now.

144
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:58,960
Um...

145
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,720
Captain Xu,

146
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,800
I...

147
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,920
just want to know

148
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,480
the victim's activities before death.

149
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,220
And then...

150
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,560
We don't need you now.

151
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,660
Finish eating and leave quickly.

152
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,200
What are you looking at?

153
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,680
Eat up.

154
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,880
I know the key to the problem now.

155
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,020
What are you smelling?

156
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,560
You're not still thinking about...

157
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,020
that beautiful woman from earlier, are you?

158
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,200
What are you thinking about?

159
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,040
Eat up.

160
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,900
The mask affects the judgment of smells.

161
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,880
Hey.

162
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,360
Youqi.

163
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,240
When will you arrive?

164
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,780
I'll wait for you at table six.

165
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,370
Okay.

166
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,780
Captain Xu.

167
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,240
Another female body has been found at the red brick house.

168
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,770
Alright.

169
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,280
I'll be there right away.

170
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,690
I saw a person wearing a hoodie.

171
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,780
Wearing a hood.

172
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,620
Yes.

173
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,360
He was dragging a body.

174
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,420
He dumped it there.

175
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,580
Then I shouted.

176
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
What are you doing?

177
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,540
And he ran away.

178
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,740
Captain Xu.

179
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,120
When the scavenger came back collecting trash,

180
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,580
they discovered the body.

181
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,560
The time of the incident was approximately

182
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,720
around 8:50 PM.

183
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,570
The killer dumped the body and ran.

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
They couldn't see his face clearly.

185
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,330
I'm here.

186
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,560
Any findings?

187
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,600
Looking at this situation,

188
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,060
our judgment was correct.

189
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,500
What are you doing?

190
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,280
Gold powder.

191
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,160
Hello.

192
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,810
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

193
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,250
