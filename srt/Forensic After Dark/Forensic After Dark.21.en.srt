00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,020
Captain Xu,

3
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,700
How are you?

4
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,440
are you alright?

5
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:23,970
I'm fine.

6
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,250
How's Ah Jin?

7
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,250
Still in emergency treatment.

8
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,800
Xu Da.

9
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,520
Was it you?

10
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,600
Were you behind this?

11
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,500
What nonsense are you talking about?

12
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
Get out of the way.

13
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,560
Why?

14
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,240
Why after Liu Yaohui's death,

15
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,170
did you tell me many more would die?

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,440
Why?

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,520
Why?

18
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,080
Fang Ao.

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,400
would someone die from drug poisoning

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,660
right under your nose?

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why didn't you arrest Chen Qingqing immediately?

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,920
Instead, you waited a whole night,

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,650
sending Ah Jin to death's door.

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,040
I don't want to argue with you.

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,640
Yang Ming,

26
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,180
this case no longer concerns you.

27
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,680
Wang Yue.

28
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,960
I will definitely find evidence of his crimes.

29
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,240
Stop right there.

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,160
Do you really want to find

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,290
the true cause of your father's death,

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,160
or do you simply enjoy

33
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,800
the sense of achievement

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,180
or pleasure from dissecting bodies?

35
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,680
When you dissected the painter Li Xiuna,

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,040
opened Zhao Dachuan's chest cavity,

37
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,280
cut open Wu Xianming's stomach,

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,610
boiled Zhu Shan's head,

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,720
and dissected those two bodies

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,850
from the Wang Group,

41
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,170
how did you feel?

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,050
What were you thinking?

43
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,360
I don't think you understand at all

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,840
what it means to speak for the dead

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,900
and protect the rights of the living.

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,880
Yang Ming,

47
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,340
you are not a qualified forensic expert.

48
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,680
Do you really want to find out

49
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,480
the true cause of your father's death,

50
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,360
or do you simply enjoy

51
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,159
the sense of achievement

52
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,980
or pleasure that comes from dissecting bodies?

53
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,960
When you dissected the painter Li Xiuna,

54
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,320
cut open Zhao Dachuan's chest cavity,

55
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,560
sliced open Wu Xianming's stomach,

56
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,890
boiled Zhu Shan's head,

57
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,000
and dissected those bodies

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,130
from the Wang Group,

59
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,450
how did you feel?

60
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,650
What were you thinking?

61
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,640
I don't think you understand at all

62
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,120
what it means to speak for the dead

63
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,120
and defend the rights of the living.

64
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,080
Yang Ming,

65
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,880
you are not a qualified forensic pathologist.

66
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,360
You,

67
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,720
you're exceptionally intelligent

68
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,050
and have great insight,

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,600
but

70
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,920
being a renowned forensic pathologist

71
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,040
is not the point.

72
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,760
Any technical skills

73
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,240
are just tools serving

74
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,700
the forensic profession,

75
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,800
not the essential core.

76
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,600
Then what is the core?

77
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,840
What is a forensic pathologist?

78
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,570
It's simple.

79
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,020
Speak for the dead,

80
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,080
defend the rights of the living.

81
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,740
You need to understand these principles first.

82
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,440
This is what I extracted

83
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,970
from Chen Qingqing's body.

84
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,640
Based on the digestion condition,

85
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,680
it seems she swallowed this piece of paper

86
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,140
shortly before her death.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,640
It says...

88
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,940
This must be some kind of code.

89
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
There's one more thing.

90
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,040
We found explosive residue

91
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,280
at the entrance.

92
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,960
Perhaps someone planted

93
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
a bomb at the door.

94
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,320
The front of the body

95
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,400
and the soles of the feet have the most severe burns.

96
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,360
Based on this,

97
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,400
Chen Qingqing

98
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,720
was likely killed

99
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,140
before the explosion.

100
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,420
If that's the case,

101
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
what was the killer's purpose

102
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,930
in setting the bomb?

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,000
Was it simply to disguise

104
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,960
Chen Qingqing's death as an accident?

105
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,360
They might be trying to cover up something.

106
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,460
Captain Xu,

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,159
all the evidence now

108
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,240
points to Wang Yue.

109
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,880
What should we do now?

110
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,340
Where's the evidence?

111
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,360
Do you expect me to personally

112
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,640
go and ask Wang Yue for it?

113
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,700
So what do we do now?

114
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,520
Our breakthrough now

115
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,140
lies in these eight mysterious numbers.

116
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,890
To decipher these numbers,

117
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,680
there's probably only one person who can help.

118
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,220
I'll go find Yang Ming.

119
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,930
Sit down.

120
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,170
I'll go instead.

121
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,020
It takes the one who tied the bell to untie it.

122
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,520
Hello,

123
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,840
the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

124
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,170
Please try again later.

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,120
Hello?

126
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,480
Hello?

127
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,080
Xiao Meng.

128
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,760
Is Yang Ming here?

129
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,560
He's not here.

130
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,130
Isn't he at work?

131
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,380
Never mind.

132
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,600
Ah, Jiao,

133
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,080
your skin

134
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,240
is so smooth.

135
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,450
And your figure,

136
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,800
you're truly beautiful.

137
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,120
Oh, stop it.

138
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,880
Later,

139
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,970
I have something important

140
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,080
to discuss with you in depth.

141
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,570
How deep are we talking?

142
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,540
Where's Yang Ming?

143
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,120
This is a company,

144
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,919
not a funeral home.

145
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,919
How should I know where he is?

146
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,690
Wang Yue,

147
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,980
let me tell you,

148
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,880
no matter who's backing you,

149
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,679
if you dare lay a finger on Yang Ming,

150
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,210
I won't let you off the hook.

151
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,520
Mr. Wang,

152
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,560
shall we discuss this matter more deeply then?

153
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,800
Come on, come on.

154
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,560
Bin B·E34Y9

155
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,420
Captain Xu,

156
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,200
Find Yang Ming for me quickly.

157
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,880
ensure his safety immediately.

158
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,760
If you really can't find him,

159
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,560
investigate!

160
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,160
Do I need to teach you how?

161
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,820
Captain Xu,

162
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,540
you're looking for me.

163
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,420
The car door isn't locked.

164
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,680
So,

165
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,880
you know that after my father was fired,

166
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,160
he went to work for the Wang Group.

167
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Not only do I know,

168
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,080
but your Uncle Qin knows too.

169
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
Before Old Qin retired, he was organizing documents

170
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,720
and came across your father's autopsy report.

171
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,280
He discovered there might have been a misjudgment.

172
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,760
It wasn't accidental poisoning,

173
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
but murder.

174
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,360
The traffic case that implicated your father three years ago,

175
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
the traffic case,

176
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,530
you might not know the details.

177
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,720
The suspect was driving under the influence of drugs,

178
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,440
hit someone and fled the scene.

179
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,120
He was caught three days later.

180
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,320
Your father was responsible for the physical and chemical tests,

181
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,920
examining the suspect's physical condition.

182
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,970
The test results

183
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,060
showed no traces of drugs.

184
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,080
The victim then produced

185
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,680
a photo of your father meeting with the suspect's family.

186
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Your father was suspected of dereliction of duty

187
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,240
and was fired from the organization.

188
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Two months later,

189
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,240
people from the Wang Group

190
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,720
were interested in your father's identity as a physical and chemical engineer

191
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,520
and invited him to work for them.

192
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,970
But your father thought

193
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,820
this matter wasn't so simple.

194
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,400
Brother Yang,

195
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,800
the Wang Group inviting you to work for them,

196
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,120
I think it's acceptable.

197
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,720
Gold

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,400
shines wherever it goes.

199
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,600
Yes.

200
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,240
It doesn't have to be within the system.

201
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,200
Anywhere works.

202
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,660
Indeed.

203
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,520
Moreover,

204
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,400
this time it's your old classmate

205
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,130
Liu Yaohui who introduced you.

206
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
I find this situation a bit strange.

207
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,210
It's not simple.

208
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,580
In our department,

209
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,480
there must be someone protecting them.

210
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,560
How come I was just fired

211
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,560
and they immediately came

212
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,720
to invite me to collaborate on drug development?

213
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,250
Chairman Wang of Wang Group

214
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,340
is a well-known local entrepreneur.

215
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,120
He has deep-rooted connections

216
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,520
and a wide sphere of influence.

217
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,200
In recent years, any case

218
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,520
related to Wang Group

219
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,440
in the end,

220
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,690
always ends up unresolved.

221
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,480
You mean...

222
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,450
It's hard to say.

223
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,360
We know your father went to work for Wang Group.

224
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,960
What for?

225
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,560
But we couldn't dissuade him.

226
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,680
Later, he told me

227
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,540
that the mistake he made last time

228
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,890
might have been a setup by Wang Yue.

229
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,500
Wang Yue's company

230
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,920
was in a hurry to develop new projects

231
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,980
and needed talent.

232
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Your father's classmate,

233
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,120
Liu Yaohui,

234
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,440
recommended your father, a physical chemistry engineer.

235
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,700
They wanted to use him,

236
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
but were wary of his police uniform.

237
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,320
They had to ruin your father's reputation,

238
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,200
make him unable to be a police officer,

239
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,060
then extend an olive branch to him

240
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,580
to use him for their purposes.

241
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,880
Unexpectedly, the person responsible for that traffic accident

242
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,680
was also part of Wang Yue's trap.

243
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
They left photos.

244
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Even with photos,

245
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,640
the blood test results shouldn't have been problematic.

246
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,720
Your father suspects

247
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,820
the blood samples were switched.

248
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,620
Someone in the department

249
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,600
Yes.

250
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,580
But specifically,

251
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,440
I don't know who's involved.

252
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,880
I didn't know my father went to Wang Group.

253
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,920
I always thought

254
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,660
after he was fired,

255
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,840
he just stayed at home alone

256
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,720
doing nothing.

257
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,480
He didn't want us to tell you,

258
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,920
fearing it would distract you from work

259
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
and also worried about your safety.

260
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Your father knows

261
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,200
you hate him

262
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
and don't want to see him.

263
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,280
This is actually good.

264
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,940
He can work with peace of mind.

265
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,640
Your father,

266
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,610
is a policeman at heart.

267
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,520
No matter where he goes,

268
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,320
he always says

269
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,860
he wants to do what a policeman should do.

270
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,080
Doctor
