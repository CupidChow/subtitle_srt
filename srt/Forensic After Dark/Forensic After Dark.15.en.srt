2
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,920
Does he make you drink a lot of water every time you come back?

3
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,920
and force you to drink a lot of water?

4
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,680
No wonder every time I go out,

5
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,160
he always gives me a

6
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
blue little pill,

7
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,930
saying it's Viagra,

8
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,060
and makes me come back on time.

9
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,759
I thought

10
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,570
he was caring for me.

11
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,000
This devil's spice.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,060
It's too devilish.

13
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,160
It's killing me with spice.

14
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,289
I'm all fired up now.

15
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,680
Bro,

16
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,920
I want to go exercise.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,039
(A leopard can't change its spots.)

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,570
Bro, don't scold me.

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,520
I know you care about me the most.

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,320
(Come back in an hour.)

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,050
(I'll kill you if you're late.)

22
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,120
Bro,

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,280
can you give me some more of that medicine?

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,680
Your medicine is strong.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,600
Thanks, bro.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,080
I'm off.

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,260
My brother is trying to poison me.

28
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,000
I can tell you

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,860
where they are.

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,290
However,

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,480
the details of how we killed them

32
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,600
will have to wait until we're all together.

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,440
You go that way.

34
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,920
Run this way.

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,160
Go!

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,460
Stay alert.

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,660
Master.

38
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,250
The person has escaped.

39
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,480
It's almost been 24 hours.

40
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,040
You don't have enough evidence.

41
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,370
You'll have to release me soon.

42
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,900
Where did he go?

43
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,040
Haven't I told you already?

44
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,220
Still pretending?

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,560
You said your brother told you to return on time.

46
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,760
Tell the truth quickly.

47
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,640
Are you deliberately

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,000
delaying to let them escape?

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,260
Where did he escape to?

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,690
Wu Xianming.

51
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,480
Did you know from the beginning

52
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,079
that you were taking poison?

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,050
You're his own brother.

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,880
He's trying to take your life,

55
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,210
his own brother's life.

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,360
Officer,

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,200
do you know

58
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
what it means to be brothers?

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,800
My life

60
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,050
was given by my brother.

61
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,480
If he wants it,

62
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,440
he can take it.

63
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
The test results are out.

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,680
The handwriting couldn't be confirmed,

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
but the sand does contain

66
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,450
traces of chili powder.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,860
Lieutenant Xu.

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,320
For now, we can only confirm

69
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,920
that what Wu Xianming said

70
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,850
about the hiding place is correct.

71
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,080
I remember

72
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,500
when the two brothers were young,

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,560
they didn't go to school.

74
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,050
One was a mute at a slaughterhouse,

75
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
the other was an idle troublemaker.

76
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,600
There's one more person.

77
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,800
He's been hiding behind the two brothers.

78
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,080
the one controlling everything.

79
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,480
The mastermind suspect.

80
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,800
Give me the money.

81
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,400
All of you, get out of the car.

82
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,200
If that's the case,

83
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,520
this person is not to be underestimated.

84
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,560
He can make the two brothers risk their lives for him.

85
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,020
They're already preparing to flee the city.

86
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,080
Notify the relevant departments.

87
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,920
Set up checkpoints

88
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,250
at every intersection.

89
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,860
Captain Xu,

90
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,340
let me give it a try.

91
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,210
What?

92
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,700
I'll interrogate him.

93
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,740
Wu Xianming

94
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,120
doesn't have much time left.

95
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,320
The drugs have already spread throughout his organs.

96
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,159
While you were on the mission,

98
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,090
Yao Jiajian and I

99
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,800
conducted a thorough examination

100
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,330
of his physical condition.

101
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
He really doesn't have long to live.

102
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,000
I suspect

103
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,440
they've already planned their escape.

104
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,840
If we don't get

105
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,640
some information out of him now,

106
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,970
it might be too late.

107
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,580
Why does your brother like to eat ghost peppers?

108
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,480
What are you talking about?

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
I'm very curious.

110
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,000
This kind of pepper,

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,930
even half a piece

112
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,400
is too much for most people to handle.

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,320
Does your brother have some kind of superpower?

114
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
I don't know.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,280
I believe your own brother

116
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,740
wouldn't give you poison.

117
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,760
To avenge you,

118
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,280
stabbing someone three times,

119
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,740
this is what a mute brother

120
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,010
can do for his younger brother.

121
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,640
What exactly are you trying to say?

122
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:40,620
The drug

123
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,800
was given to your brother by someone else.

124
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,159
Your brother knew the drug was poisoned,

125
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,620
yet he still gave it to you.

126
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,060
Do you know why?

127
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,090
Because in his eyes,

128
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,280
you're nothing but a burden.

129
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,480
From beginning to end,

130
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,760
from childhood to adulthood,

131
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,000
you've always been a burden.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,040
You made him mute.

133
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,320
You got him thrown in detention.

134
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,880
Because of you, he now

135
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,400
has to prematurely

136
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,480
flee from police pursuit.

137
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,560
You're talking nonsense.

138
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,240
You know it yourself,

139
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,600
you just don't dare to admit it.

140
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,200
I don't admit it.

141
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,520
You think you're considering their best interests

142
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,650
by ending your life,

143
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,120
but in reality, your death

144
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,240
is exactly the outcome they want.

145
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,840
Impossible.

146
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,560
They never wanted to take you with them.

147
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,290
Impossible.

148
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,400
They just wanted to get rid of you.

149
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,240
Impossible.

150
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,400
My brother has already arranged for a fishing boat.

151
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,600
He wouldn't lie to me.

152
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,450
Alright.

153
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,920
You're setting me up.

154
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,080
You're deceiving me.

155
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,210
you're tricking me,

156
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,480
you're fooling me.

157
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,000
You're here so early.

158
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,900
Come over here.

159
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,210
Hurry up.

160
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,720
Coming.

161
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,360
Hurry, hurry.

162
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Come on, let's go.

163
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,420
You're here early.

164
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,360
Let's go.

165
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,480
I'll pay you when we get there.

166
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,040
Alright.

167
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,660
Police!

168
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,900
Put the knife down.

169
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,900
put the knife down.

170
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,700
Don't move!

171
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,840
(Let me go.)

172
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,680
You have nowhere to run.

173
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,640
Cut the crap.

174
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
He needs medical treatment.

175
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,680
Let him go.

176
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,320
I'll be your hostage.

177
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,440
A cop's life is worth more than his.

178
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,320
Come here.

179
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Put your hands up.

180
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,200
Come here.

181
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,410
Get down.

182
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,360
Calm down.

183
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,810
Take it easy.

184
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,920
Stay calm.

185
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,420
Wu Zongfan.

186
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,880
What's your relationship with Wu Xianda and Wu Xianming?

187
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,680
what's your relationship with them?

188
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm their distant cousin.

189
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
you know, the very distant kind.

190
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,080
You're quite decisive in admitting that.

191
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,410
Well, we're relatives.

192
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,040
There's nothing to hide.

193
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,050
Alright.

194
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,260
No hiding then.

195
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,080
Then tell me about your criminal activities.

196
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,340
As their older cousin,

197
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
I failed to guide them properly.

198
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,890
I let them break the law.

199
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,330
So according to you,

200
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,440
these two murder cases

201
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,960
have nothing to do with you?

202
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,320
Of course they're related to me.

203
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,600
of course they're related to me.

204
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,560
The two of them robbed and killed people.

205
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,090
I didn't keep them in check.

206
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Three lives were lost because of it.

207
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,740
I can't escape responsibility for that.

208
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,160
You seem quite aware.

209
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,090
Officer,

210
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
where's my chili?

211
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,980
Can I have some?

212
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,690
What's the rush?

213
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,770
We're not done talking yet.

214
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,300
Haven't we finished talking?

215
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,800
I've already told you,

216
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,730
the two brothers

217
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,360
were addicted to gambling and short on money.

218
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,960
They heard

219
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,880
that Zhao Dachuan made a lot of money selling fish.

220
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,680
So they argued

221
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,740
about robbing him.

222
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,600
I tried my best to dissuade them,

223
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
but I couldn't stop them.

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,930
They committed such a heinous act.

225
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:43,920
Later,

226
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,010
the two brothers came to me.

227
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,120
At first,

228
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,980
I didn't agree.

229
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,880
They knelt down and begged me

230
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,180
to help them get a boat.

231
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Being relatives,

232
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,360
I softened

233
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,540
and agreed.

234
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,280
The forensic team examined your cleaver.

235
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,320
They found traces of

236
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,580
Zhu Shan's blood on it.

237
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,530
How do you explain that?

238
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,080
The cleaver belongs to the two brothers.

239
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,480
Their fingerprints should be on it, right?

240
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,400
Degree.
