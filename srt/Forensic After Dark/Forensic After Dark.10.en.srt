Selected project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,280
Based on the scene,

3
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,400
the license plate of the exploded vehicle,

4
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,520
and the characteristics of the deceased,

5
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
we conducted a door-to-door investigation in nearby villages.

6
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,320
We can confirm

7
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,240
that the two deceased

8
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,170
are fishermen from Dazha Village:

9
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,920
Zhao Dachuan,

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,360
male,

11
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,090
40 years old,

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,360
Li Dahai,

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:29,960
male,

14
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,880
35 years old.

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,160
They are cousins.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,039
And both of them are divorced.

17
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,240
They have no children.

18
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,280
No elderly relatives either.

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,400
No useful clues were found in their homes.

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,560
They run a deep-sea fishing business together.

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,840
It's been about ten years.

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,520
Recently,

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,200
they made a lot of money from fishing.

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,320
All the villagers know about this.

25
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,400
There's one more thing.

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,720
Both of them are gamblers by nature.

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,400
They spend money as fast as they earn it.

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
They prefer cash.

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,320
Besides that,

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,920
these two have hot tempers.

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,120
Fighting and brawling are common occurrences for them.

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,400
As for enemies,

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,920
according to the villagers,

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
the most likely ones

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
are their gambling buddies.

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,560
That's about it.

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,340
What about you?

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,560
At the scene, we

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,199
found footprints of five people.

40
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,729
However,

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,320
only two were unusual.

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,120
Suspect number one

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,360
has an uneven gait,

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,210
with one foot

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,840
only touching the ground with the front part.

46
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,320
We suspect this person might have been injured before.

47
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,520
The other suspect

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
has significant wear

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,560
on the front part of the right foot.

50
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,120
This is typically seen in people

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,180
who drive frequently, using the gas and clutch pedals.

52
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,040
These are the

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,240
plaster casts of the suspects' shoe prints.

54
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Based on our analysis of the body posture,

55
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,480
we believe there might have been a driver at the scene.

56
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,360
At the scene, we also

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,800
discovered tire tracks

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,960
from two vehicles.

59
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,720
One belongs to the exploded vehicle.

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,360
The other,

61
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,320
based on our comparison of the tire tracks,

62
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,200
appears to be from a Ruifeng van.

63
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,840
Let me share my thoughts.

64
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,740
My initial hypothesis is that

65
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,480
this is either a robbery-homicide

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,240
or a revenge killing

67
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,840
among gambling associates.

68
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,640
Due to their deep-sea fishing work,

69
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,300
they spend long periods at sea

70
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,280
and rarely interact with strangers.

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,960
Their gambling buddies are their most frequent social contacts.

72
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,480
Moreover, the victim's face was severely damaged,

73
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,960
making identification difficult.

74
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,890
This aligns with

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,360
the self-protective instinct of a suspect

76
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,760
who knows the victim.

77
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,340
Therefore,

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
this is likely a crime committed by someone familiar to the victim.

79
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,200
We need to focus our investigation on

80
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,200
the relationships among their gambling associates.

81
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,690
Li Dahai was in good health.

82
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,000
His internal organs show characteristics

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,860
consistent with blast injuries.

84
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,080
His ribs were fractured,

85
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,340
puncturing his heart.

86
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,040
The pelvic bones

87
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,500
were severely fractured,

88
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,960
which is consistent with

89
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,400
a bomb

90
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,159
exploding beneath him.

91
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,620
He died instantly.

92
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,280
As for the knife wound on his head,

93
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,640
it was inflicted after Li Dahai's death

94
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,240
by a sharp weapon.

95
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,640
Zhao Dachuan was in good health.

96
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,400
The blast wounds on the front of his body were quite extensive.

97
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,280
there were fewer wounds on his back.

98
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,440
Unlike Li Dahai,

99
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,040
he didn't die instantly.

100
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
The fatal injury was a skull trauma.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
The wound was linear,

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,280
with sharp and even edges.

103
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,610
There were signs of a dragging cut.

104
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,680
The skull showed signs of being chopped,

105
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,340
resulting in bone fractures.

106
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,720
Combined with the blood spatter found at the scene,

107
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,840
which occurred while he was still alive,

108
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,570
he was killed by a sharp weapon.

109
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,040
The murder weapon is believed to be

110
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,570
a cleaver-like tool used for chopping bones.

111
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,800
So, this suspect,

112
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,760
was he confident

113
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,840
or not confident?

114
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,720
He had to strike both of their heads

115
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,650
with a blow each.

116
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,960
The motive for revenge killing

117
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,290
is likely significant.

118
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,520
Let's stitch them up.

119
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,480
Today, we investigated

120
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,400
Zhao Dachuan and Li Dahai's

121
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,760
business network,

122
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,720
specifically those

123
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,880
along their business chain.

124
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
We found that these two

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,240
had offended quite a few people.

126
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,080
From the offshore fishing cooperative group

127
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,480
From competitors in the middle

128
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,000
down to supply chain transporters,

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,560
not a single person

130
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,600
spoke well of these two brothers.

131
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,400
I think

132
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,740
they all have motives for murder.

133
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
However,

134
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,040
most of them have solid alibis

135
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,560
for the day of the incident.

136
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,480
So I think

137
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,520
they...

138
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,610
Don't think,

139
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,050
get to the point.

140
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,200
I see the atmosphere is too tense,

141
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
let's lighten it up a bit.

142
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,240
During our investigation this time,

143
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,760
we mainly found six gambling buddies.

144
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,560
These people,

145
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,720
whenever they had free time,

146
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,240
would find Zhao Dachuan and his cousin

147
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,370
to gamble together.

148
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,720
According to their statements,

149
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,320
these two had poor gambling etiquette.

150
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,040
When losing, they would kick over tables,

151
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,480
and often threaten others with knives.

152
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,640
Not to mention after drinking,

153
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,560
they would beat people indiscriminately.

154
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,290
These people

155
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,920
have all been beaten by them.

156
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,560
Then why do they still gamble with them?

157
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,620
They're willing to

158
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
because these two

159
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,400
are indeed skilled fishermen.

160
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,320
Every deep-sea fishing trip brings a big harvest.

161
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,920
However,

162
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,720
they can earn money but also spend it quickly.

163
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Their home is in shambles,

164
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,960
with nothing of value.

165
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,080
Have these six people been investigated?

166
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,940
Yes, they have.

167
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,760
Most of them don't have the time to commit the crime.

168
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,320
However,

169
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,840
one of them named Zhu Shan

170
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,680
is still uncertain.

171
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,200
Because after the day of the incident,

172
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,240
he never appeared again at

173
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,570
the cold chain company.

174
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,860
He is the most suspicious.

175
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,480
I

176
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,160
We have an eyewitness now.

177
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,530
The next one,

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,360
the eyewitness is a fisherman

179
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
named Zhang Liansheng,

180
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,090
fifty years old,

181
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,800
who happens to live on a nearby fishing boat.

182
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,360
According to the information provided by Zhang Liansheng,

183
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,640
after he heard the explosion,

184
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,700
he went to the scene

185
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,780
and saw a figure

186
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,450
get into a car and leave.

187
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,800
According to the eyewitness,

188
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,320
he didn't see the person's face,

189
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,780
but he recognized the car.

190
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,280
The owner is Zhu Shan.

191
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,560
Moreover, Zhu Shan was previously

192
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,240
the employer of the two deceased,

193
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,000
specifically responsible for seafood transportation.

194
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They stopped cooperating half a year ago,

195
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
for reasons unknown.

196
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,880
Furthermore,

197
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,960
he is also a gambler.

198
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,600
But Zhu Shan once told others

199
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,640
that he would kill Zhao Dachuan sooner or later.

200
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,440
Could it be...

201
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,640
It's indeed the driver.

202
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,170
Things are becoming clear.

203
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,000
Zhu Shan

204
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,240
is indeed the prime suspect.

205
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,090
When will you give me the money?

206
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:49,800
Also,

207
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
What time is the boat scheduled for?

208
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,210
Brother,

209
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,080
I found the fish,

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,120
I set the hook,

211
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,120
look,

212
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,320
I've done all the dirty and hard work.

213
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,580
See what I've got here?

214
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,850
There's blood everywhere.

215
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,780
You're bleeding and still running home?

216
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,690
You think I want to run home?

217
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,640
Your brother told me to go back.

218
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,480
do I need to go back for this little injury?

219
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,640
My brother is mute.

220
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,700
How did he tell you?

221
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,210
What do you mean?

222
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,760
Do you know my ex-wife is at home?

223
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,020
Let me tell you,

224
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,780
if the police search my house,

225
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
we're all done for.

226
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,130
What?

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,280
There's someone at home.

228
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,679
Didn't you get divorced?

229
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,679
How should I know?

230
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,480
That damn woman

231
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,610
suddenly came back.

232
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,640
Damn it.

233
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,120
If she hadn't been out there

234
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,560
fooling around with someone else,

235
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,020
I wouldn't have gone with you to kill anyone.

236
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,040
You're the one who wanted to get rid of the cuckold and kill,

237
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,240
we just accompanied you in the killing.

238
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:57,960
Fine,

239
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
I did it all, okay?

240
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,640
Give me the money.

241
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,240
All of you, get out of the car.

242
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,050
Brother,

243
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,640
he's looking at me.

244
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,130
Brother,

245
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,330
none of us know how to drive.

246
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,480
Master.

247
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,080
This is it.

248
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,840
I heard from the neighboring village

249
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,680
that they saw Zhu Shan's car last night.

250
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,320
He came back in the middle of the night.

251
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,160
It seems he was injured.

252
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,690
Injured?

253
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,680
The suspect is

254
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,360
a dangerous individual who knows how to make bombs.

255
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,840
Everyone, stay alert.

256
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,520
Yes.

257
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,080
Shh.

258
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,900
Police.

259
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,400
Captain Xu.

260
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,960
No one.

261
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,360
Okay.

262
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,020
bring them.

263
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,180
Captain Xu.

264
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,720
There's no one inside.

265
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,250
Alright.

266
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Where's Zhu Shan?

267
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,050
I don't know.

268
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,820
Who are you?

269
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,240
I'm his wife.

270
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,000
Where did Zhu Shan go?

271
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,640
I really don't know.

272
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,440
Officer,

273
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,760
a few days ago,

274
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,220
I had an argument with him,

275
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,080
he ran away.

276
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,490
I called him,

277
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,800
but he didn't answer.

278
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,480
I really don't know.

279
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,160
Officer,

280
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,600
Let me tell you,

281
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,530
think carefully before you speak.

282
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,410
Yao Jiajian.

283
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,440
look.

284
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,970
Lan Jing.

285
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,570
Can I ask you a question?

286
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,060
What question?

287
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,200
Why are you so concerned

288
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,250
about this case?

289
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,800
Yang Ming.

290
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,380
Did you find anything?

291
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,040
The scene was obviously cleaned up.

292
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,360
It's clearly a guilty conscience.

293
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,840
And here,

294
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,800
we found blood.

295
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,730
Look.

296
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,850
And this.

297
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
But we can't confirm now

298
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
if it's Zhu Shan's.

299
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,760
We need to go back to the station for further DNA testing.

300
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,490
There are also two footprints.

301
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,280
There's another one over there.
