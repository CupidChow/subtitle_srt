Selected Project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,850
Lan Jing.

3
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,460
Tell me your thoughts.

4
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,039
Aren't you good at profiling?

5
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,840
Let's hear it.

6
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,090
This suspect...

7
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,039
First gets the victim drunk...

8
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,320
then uses abusive methods...

9
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,520
to injure the victim.

10
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,560
He also prepared in advance...

11
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:35,840
He also prepared in advance...

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,640
tools for disposing of the body.

13
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,080
It indeed fits the characteristics of criminal psychology.

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,120
This type of person usually...

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,479
has a strong sense of self-esteem...

16
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,240
is sensitive...

17
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,080
suspicious...

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
and has an extreme personality.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,660
They lack flexibility...

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,690
and in daily life...

21
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,200
they probably don't have much sense of humor.

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,800
They're easily provoked...

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,800
This type of person is very cunning...

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,120
This type of person is very cunning...

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,600
This type of person is very cunning...

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,440
They plan meticulously...

27
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,000
They plan meticulously...

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,039
and once they seek revenge...

29
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,320
they can be extremely cruel.

30
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,180
And usually...

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
they don't feel any remorse.

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,960
Well said.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,220
It's exactly what I was thinking.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,130
Look at this.

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,420
A major discovery.

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,000
A signature that appears to be in blood.

37
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,620
It seems to be painted with blood.

38
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
the brushstrokes are fluid.

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,980
The use of color is masterful.

40
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,600
This doesn't seem like the work of an ordinary person.

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,200
Is there

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,860
a place nearby that specializes in selling oil paintings?

43
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,720
Guliao Oil Painting Street.

44
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:13,980
Yes.

45
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
Guliao Oil Painting Street.

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,000
Many struggling artists

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,440
sell their paintings

48
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,570
there anonymously.

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Some artists with strong self-esteem

50
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,720
and distinctive personalities

51
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,600
will brand their names on their work.

52
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,130
Alright,

53
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
let's go to the Oil Painting Street.

54
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:43,760
Let's go.

55
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,290
This way.

56
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,770
Hello, boss.

57
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,640
Hello there.

58
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,160
Police.

59
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,410
Hello, officer.

60
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:55,520
I'd like to ask something.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:55,920
Look.

62
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,540
Have you seen this person?

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,930
I haven't seen them.

64
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,540
Please take a closer look.

65
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,280
I really haven't seen them.

66
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,880
Alright.

67
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,659
What are you doing?

68
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,080
Hello.

69
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,820
You two.

70
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
What are you up to?

71
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,180
Are you the owner here?

72
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,810
Yes, I am.

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,900
What's the matter?

74
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Police business.

75
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,560
Officer,

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,440
what brings you here?

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,080
I'd like to ask you something.

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,640
Go ahead.

79
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,200
Have you seen

80
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,260
someone dressed like this recently?

81
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,600
The brim of this person's hat

82
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,080
covers most of their face.

83
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,880
It's hard to see clearly.

84
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,720
I have a water delivery guy here

85
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,650
whose outfit looks a bit like this.

86
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,050
Water delivery guy?

87
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,440
Look.

88
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,240
Don't mess it up, you hear?

89
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,970
He'll buy it.

90
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,720
Boss,

91
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,570
who brought this painting?

92
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,920
It's a replica.

93
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,040
An artist left it here for consignment.

94
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,760
Do you have their contact information?

95
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,160
No.

96
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,720
Right,

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,040
it's that water delivery person I mentioned earlier.

98
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,240
They brought it here.

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,260
What do they look like?

100
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,720
A water delivery person.

101
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,960
I didn't pay much attention.

102
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Are they male or female?

103
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,480
Female.

104
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,960
She's here again.

105
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,760
Put it inside.

106
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,520
But when she comes,

107
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,320
she says she wants to learn painting from me.

108
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,720
Then every time, she just sits there and zones out.

109
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
But after a while,

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,520
she,

111
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,600
well, she said she wanted to leave her,

112
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,080
personal belongings here.

113
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,159
I mean, I barely know her.

114
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,890
This person,

115
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,440
did you keep them?

116
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,000
I did.

117
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,120
It's not easy to do anything these days.

118
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,200
It's not easy for you to paint,

119
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,480
it's not easy for me to sell paintings,

120
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,120
and it's even harder for her as a water delivery person.

121
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,000
So I kept them for her.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,200
Where are the things?

123
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,370
They're in my study.

124
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,280
How about I

125
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,650
take you to see them?

126
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,610
Let's go.

127
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,050
Is anyone there?

128
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,880
These...

129
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,080
Are all of these hers?

130
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,480
Some of them are hers.

131
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,920
This is also her painting.

132
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,040
That one was painted by me.

133
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,400
Look how bright and cheerful it is.

134
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
The ones below are painted by her.

135
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,410
Those dark, gloomy paintings.

136
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,000
Yang Ming.

137
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,880
Painting and signing with blood...

138
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,680
Isn't this perverted?

139
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,880
She couldn't possibly paint like this.

140
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,930
Who is it?

141
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,760
Meng Youqi sent me a message.

142
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
A couple of days ago,

143
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,880
I met a painter.

144
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,400
Very unique.

145
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,360
She also likes to imitate

146
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,040
Zdzisław Beksiński.

147
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,920
She might

148
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,680
be able to paint what you want.

149
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,360
Okay.

150
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,680
Some other time,

151
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,540
let's meet her.

152
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,159
In the photos she sent me,

153
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,159
there are paintings by the suspect.

154
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,440
Yang Ming,

155
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,809
calm down first.

156
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,600
Let me see

157
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
if there are any other clues.

158
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,280
Meng Youqi

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,420
might be with the suspect.

160
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,400
You're here.

161
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,440
Excuse me,

162
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
are you Li Xiuna?

163
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,160
Did you send the message?

164
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
You're not Li Xiuna.

165
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,440
I am.

166
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,840
You're not.

167
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
I am.

168
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,960
I've met Li Xiuna before.

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,170
Where did she go?

170
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,240
She's now

171
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,760
in my painting.

172
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,380
You killed her.

173
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,570
Yet you dare to come here alone.

174
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,680
I don't know what your relationship was,

175
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,000
but from your paintings,

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,920
I can see

177
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,120
you're imitating her style.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,330
Though similar in form,

179
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,160
there are many differences in the details.

180
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,560
You seem to know her well.

181
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,920
No one can truly understand

182
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,850
another person,

183
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
but I can see

184
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
you must have experienced the same

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,660
painful and dark encounters.

186
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,250
Acting all high and mighty,

187
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,560
so full of yourself.

188
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,290
I hate people like you the most.

189
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Li Xiunan also hated people like me.

190
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,000
From her paintings,

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,920
I can see

192
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,040
she was hardworking,

193
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,000
diligent,

194
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,560
eager to create

195
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,560
paintings recognized by the world.

196
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,860
But no one understood,

197
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,700
and no one bought them.

198
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,000
Even if someone was willing to spend money

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,320
to buy those paintings,

200
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,380
it was just to pretend to be cultured.

201
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,440
Li Xiunan endured loneliness

202
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,560
and the humiliation of being looked down upon.

203
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,360
But in this world,

204
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,960
there's too much injustice.

205
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,520
Some people are born

206
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,120
as the daughter of a painter.

207
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,440
Some people can easily

208
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,160
buy expensive paintings.

209
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,010
Some people struggle for over a decade

210
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,480
and still can't match others' work of a moment.

211
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,540
A mediocre work of just a few strokes.

212
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,360
We get angry,

213
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,120
we fight back,

214
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,730
we seek revenge,

215
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,960
we kill.

216
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Am I still myself

217
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,580
after having killed someone?

218
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,320
Everyone is looking for a lighthouse in the darkness,

219
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,560
but they often forget

220
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,840
that they themselves can be the light that illuminates others.

221
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,700
Li Xiunan is a special existence.

222
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,000
So are you.

223
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,420
She can become the sun.

224
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
So can you.

225
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,160
You're wrong.

226
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
Not everyone wants to be the sun.

227
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,040
I...

228
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,680
only like to be a shadow.

229
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,480
What do you want to do?

230
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,360
Do you know

231
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,400
what you're doing is a crime?

232
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,800
Shut your mouth.

233
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,120
This looks like an art studio.

234
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
She might be in the suspect's studio.

235
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,360
After committing the crime,

236
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,040
the suspect usually dumps the body in the wilderness.

237
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,370
The primary crime scene

238
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,100
might be at the suspect's residence.

239
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's see if there are any other photos.

240
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,440
Isn't this the Wang Wang Wang

241
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,120
Wang

242
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,340
Wang Mountain Villa abandoned construction site?

243
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:03,780
Diandu.

244
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,400
Diandu.
