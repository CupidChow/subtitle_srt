Selected Project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,880
Mom,

3
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,200
Youqi,

4
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,800
you're a female Ph.D.

5
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,200
your conditions are so good.

6
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,080
Why do you insist on marrying someone

7
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,010
who touches dead bodies every day?

8
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,400
Mom,

9
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,039
he's a forensic doctor.

10
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,080
He's a police officer.

11
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,160
What forensic doctor?

12
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,880
That Mr. Guo

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,640
He's a financial tycoon in the pharmaceutical industry.

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,640
You'd be so much better off with him.

15
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
Leave Yang Ming.

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,320
If it weren't for him,

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,200
I would be that

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,259
corpse sunk to the bottom of the lake.

19
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,680
Wait a second.

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,580
Hold on.

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,520
My dad says

22
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,200
life doesn't bully ordinary people,

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,530
it only bullies cowards

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,330
and those who are pessimistic about life.

25
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,370
Just because I had good grades,

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
all the girls in my class bullied me.

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,370
Old Yang,

28
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,079
what's up?

29
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,720
Any progress?

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,380
No progress so far.

31
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,880
How are things

32
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,810
between you and Meng Youqi lately?

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,850
Pretty good.

34
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,160
Stop looking at that for now.

35
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,400
Come on,

36
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,330
have some water.

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
I bought you a new cup.

38
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,340
That's quite thoughtful.

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,480
Old Yang,

40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,200
I've encountered something recently

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,960
and I'd like to consult you about it.

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,560
What is it?

43
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,880
I have a friend

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
who only focuses on his work

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,520
and completely neglects

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,000
his girlfriend.

47
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Later, I found out

48
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,530
that his girlfriend

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,360
seems to have cheated on him.

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,960
The third party

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,730
is a financial tycoon who returned from overseas

52
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,690
and his surname is also Guo.

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,360
Surname Guo?

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,360
Oh, right.

55
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,460
I just bought a new pot.

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,600
It works pretty well.

57
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,440
I'll recommend it to you sometime.

58
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,120
That's where the problem lies.

59
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,440
My friend is completely

60
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,920
unaware of this situation.

61
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,480
How do you think I should

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,320
tell him

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,020
about this?

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,570
Wait,

65
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,960
your friend got cheated on,

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,640
why are you so worked up about it?

67
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
You might as well tell him directly.

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,130
Alright,

69
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,160
Yang Ming,

70
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,440
No, no, no.

71
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,640
What if your friend

72
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,519
can't accept it

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,440
and commits suicide?

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,040
No, no,

75
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,890
we need to hint at it subtly.

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:30,930
Old Yang,

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,700
what do you think of this blotting paper?

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,460
This...

79
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,560
Don't we still have a whole box?

80
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,760
Why are you buying it?

81
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,300
What color is this?

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,020
Dark green.

83
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,159
And this one?

84
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,800
Matcha green.

85
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,060
Mat-

86
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:49,940
Mat-

87
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,000
Matcha green.

88
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, right.

89
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,159
Why aren't you wearing your police uniform today?

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,340
Because I have a green hat to wear.

91
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,380
I'll go buy one for you too,

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,480
matcha green.

93
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,720
I hate green the most.

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,600
Hello.

95
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,040
The user you are calling is temporarily unavailable.

96
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,560
Please try again later.

97
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,040
Overseas financial tycoon.

98
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,840
Overseas.

99
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,480
Who can see this?

100
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,880
This is the work of a genius.

101
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,000
This needs a chemist to explain.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,560
God knows what it is.

103
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,220
What's the reward for getting the right answer?

104
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,880
I think I've seen this kind of drug before.

105
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Wang Corporation

106
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,600
Wang Corporation

107
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,900
People-oriented, excellence in business, quality wins, service with sincerity.

108
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,120
Yang Ming,

109
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,840
Yes?

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,440
Youqi,

111
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,570
I have something to ask you.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,600
What is it?

113
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,280
I...

114
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,090
Why are you hesitating?

115
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,160
Oh, right.

116
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,330
Are you free now?

117
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,480
I want to take you somewhere.

118
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,240
Someone wants to see you.

119
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,520
Who?

120
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,240
What?

121
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,600
President Wang from Wang Corporation

122
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,530
wants to see you.

123
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Wang Corporation

124
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,330
Let's go.

125
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,360
Teacher Meng,

126
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,090
Mr. Wang,

127
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,180
My boyfriend has arrived.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,640
Yang Ming.

129
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,610
He's even more handsome than your dad.

130
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,340
This is your father's office.

131
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,250
Your father and I

132
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,180
were once business partners.

133
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,180
Back then, he came to my Wang Group

134
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,620
to help us with product development.

135
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,400
With his help,

136
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,040
our product development work

137
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,169
went very smoothly.

138
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,360
But later,

139
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,600
we discovered

140
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,039
someone was secretly taking the company's research results

141
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,169
for illegal profit.

142
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,559
And then?

143
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,280
That person

144
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,520
was Yang Qihua.

145
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,680
Mr. Wang,

146
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,600
how could Uncle Yang possibly...

147
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,200
Youqi,

148
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,960
let him speak.

149
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,680
It seems

150
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,160
that you all didn't know

151
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,930
about him working here.

152
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,080
To be precise,

153
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,160
he was the prime suspect.

154
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,040
Before we could

155
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,760
find complete evidence,

156
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,960
he had an accident.

157
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,810
Originally,

158
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,240
I wanted to tell you about this long ago.

159
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,730
However,

160
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
the truth was too cruel.

161
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,080
So...

162
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,960
Mr. Wang,

163
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,680
may I take a look?

164
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,520
Sure,

165
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,240
feel free to look around.

166
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,450
After Old Yang's accident,

167
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,620
no one has touched anything here.

168
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,250
As for me,

169
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,500
I've always wanted to clear his name.

170
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,890
That's why I left everything as it was.

171
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,680
This is your father's

172
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,720
research he was working on before he passed away.

173
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,400
It was in this project

174
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,120
that he gained benefits.

175
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,210
Back then, due to missing pages in this document,

176
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,960
we were unable to confirm

177
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
Yang Qihua's suspicion.

178
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,170
Mr. Wang,

179
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,560
I'd like to take these things back with me.

180
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,240
My dad always loved photography.

181
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,500
I want to develop the photos as a memento.

182
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,490
You can just call me Uncle Wang.

183
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
If you need anything in the future,

184
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,740
feel free to come to me.

185
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,560
Yang Ming,

186
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,440
our meeting this time

187
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,770
is all thanks to Meng Youqi.

188
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,440
Thank you.

189
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,760
I won't see you out then.

190
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,690
Let's go.

191
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,600
Lao Yang.

192
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,280
Who are you?

193
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,540
I'm his son.

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,660
And you are?

195
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,840
We're not very familiar.

196
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Just colleagues.

197
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,440
Let's go.

198
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,960
Yang Ming.

199
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,040
I don't know about the relationship between Mr. Wang and Uncle Yang.

200
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
I don't believe what he said either.

201
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,120
Uncle Yang treated me

202
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,560
like his own daughter.

203
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,380
I trust his character.

204
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,020
I don't believe it either.

205
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,020
How could my dad go to Wang's company?

206
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,640
And why would he suddenly

207
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,940
come to find me now?

208
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:56,920
I...

209
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,330
Go ahead,

210
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,840
I believe you.

211
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
It was my parents.

212
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,200
They didn't want you to be a forensic doctor.

213
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,860
So I had an argument with them.

214
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,640
But later,

215
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,700
I started to waver too.

216
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,680
Then I thought of Mr. Wang's company.

217
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,440
That Mr. Guo,

218
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,250
he's very close to Mr. Wang.

219
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,920
I wanted him to arrange a meeting with Mr. Wang,

220
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,840
hoping to find

221
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,180
a position for you at Mr. Wang's company.

222
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,010
But who knew,

223
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,160
as soon as he heard it was you,

224
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,220
he agreed readily.

225
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,400
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,760
I took matters into my own hands.

227
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,740
Are you hungry?

228
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,060
Let's have a meal together, my treat.

229
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,730
You're not mad at me?

230
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,540
No, I'm not.

231
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,080
Then, about Uncle Yang's matter,

232
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
what should we do?

233
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,050
Don't worry,

234
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,920
I'll take care of it.
