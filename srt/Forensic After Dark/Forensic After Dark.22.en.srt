Selected project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,960
Is it because

3
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,560
my father discovered something

4
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,620
that he was killed?

5
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,400
Yes.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,039
Your father discovered

7
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,440
that the drugs developed by Wang Corporation

8
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,570
had serious issues.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,200
They could easily be converted into narcotics.

10
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
Your father might have obtained evidence.

11
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,240
Then why didn't he just give it to you directly?

12
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,479
Your father

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,039
was worried that Wang Yue had protectors in the department.

14
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,700
Once the police took the case,

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,960
it would be like notifying Wang Yue

16
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,360
to destroy the evidence.

17
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,520
Besides, the evidence your father had

18
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,650
was all fragmented.

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,520
It couldn't really do much against him.

20
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,880
So your father chose to report to the police in another jurisdiction.

21
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,140
But things went wrong.

22
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,480
Old Xu,

23
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,000
I've found evidence of the Wang Group's crimes.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,520
I'm going to report it to the police in another jurisdiction.

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,450
for the details,

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,480
let's meet at the seaside release platform later.

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,650
Old Yang?

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,890
Old Yang?

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,640
Hello?

30
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:33,880
Hello?

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,340
Liu Yaohui,

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
your father's classmate.

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,240
His death

34
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,810
is also related to this matter.

35
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,140
Old Qin had long suspected

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,280
that your father's death was suspicious.

37
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,360
You think so too?

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,010
Because your father

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,520
told me and your Uncle Qin

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
about something.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,340
This matter

42
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,960
had been worrying your father for a long time.

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,720
Your kid is about to graduate from college, right?

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,080
A top student, huh?

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,240
I guess in the future...

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,640
And you'll be leading me?

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,560
Just kidding, just kidding.

48
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,120
That's Brother Yang.

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,079
Your child is so outstanding.

50
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,610
What are you worried about?

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,200
I remember the first time Yang Ming

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,520
dissected a frog,

53
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,340
he wasn't scared like the other kids.

54
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,090
Instead, he was laughing happily,

55
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,960
laughing so much it gave me the creeps.

56
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,360
What I'm worried about is

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
he doesn't really want to be a forensic doctor,

58
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,000
but rather

59
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,240
he just enjoys

60
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,610
the process of dissecting bodies.

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,079
One thought leads to enlightenment,

62
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,610
another leads to darkness.

63
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,520
So,

64
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,760
you were trying to protect me

65
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,820
by keeping me away from this case.

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,620
Wang Yue is a man

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,760
who is ruthless

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,680
and will stop at nothing

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,880
to achieve his goals.

70
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,240
Only with solid evidence

71
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,250
can we bring him to justice.

72
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,680
This was found in Chen Qingqing's body.

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,529
Now I understand

74
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,899
why Old Qin transferred you back.

75
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,579
In your father's eyes,

76
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,920
you are the key to bringing down the Wang Group.

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,400
Find the evidence your father left behind,

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,260
catch Wang Yue,

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,659
and clear your father's name.

80
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,280
Mom.

81
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,930
I've come to see you.

82
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,320
All along,

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,640
I've always thought you were

84
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,100
a very irresponsible man.

85
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,210
For the sake of work,

86
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,100
you didn't even take good care of Mom.

87
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
Mom's stomach cancer had reached the late stage,

88
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,490
and you didn't even notice.

89
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,780
You're not a good husband,

90
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
and you're an embarrassing father.

91
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,400
You're at retirement age,

92
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,210
yet you still make such a serious mistake.

93
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,560
Because of this,

94
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,100
I can't hold my head up in front of my colleagues.

95
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,800
Everything you told me before

96
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,530
about being a forensic expert,

97
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,820
I find it all so hypocritical and laughable now.

98
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,320
Dad.

99
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,880
You're really something, aren't you?

100
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,960
At your age,

101
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,970
you're still playing undercover detective?

102
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,280
What is this, Infernal Affairs?

103
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,820
Such a big deal,

104
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,570
and you didn't even tell me.

105
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,290
I could have given you some advice.

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Why did you have to bear it all alone?

107
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,890
Why did you have to carry this burden by yourself?

108
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,560
Dad.

109
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,120
I know.

110
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,570
What it means to speak for the dead.

111
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,560
For the rights of the living.

112
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,040
Mom.

113
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,280
I miss you all.

114
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,610
What is this?

115
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,920
This is my dad.

116
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,960
Found in the film he left behind.

117
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,040
In this photo,

118
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,900
there's a hidden code.

119
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,760
When I was organizing the film,

120
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,560
I discovered that in one of the frames,

121
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,160
there seemed to be tiny text.

122
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,860
Since it wasn't clear,

123
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,500
I took the negative

124
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,850
to be developed.

125
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,660
After processing,

126
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,080
I found it contained

127
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,860
a combination of numbers.

128
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,490
However, I don't know its purpose yet.

129
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,020
Let's take a break for now.

130
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,040
My dad,

131
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,850
why did he leave these numbers?

132
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,880
If

133
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,040
these numbers have any special meaning,

134
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,170
then for Uncle Yang,

135
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,120
it must be something very important.

136
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,000
And he believes

137
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,180
you must know about it too.

138
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,400
So,

139
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,400
you

140
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,100
try closing your eyes.

141
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,700
Take a deep breath.

142
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,960
Feel the air

143
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,840
entering your lungs.

144
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,920
Then slowly exhale.

145
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,480
You feel very relaxed now.

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,080
You're sitting at home now.

147
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,320
You feel

148
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
the sunlight is particularly warm.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,440
Mom

150
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,760
is carrying a plate of fragrant food

151
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,600
walking towards you.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,880
Your mindset

153
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,770
becomes especially peaceful.

154
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,880
Your thoughts

155
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,880
become very clear.

156
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,800
At this moment,

157
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,200
relax,

158
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,480
go deep into your heart,

159
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,120
and feel

160
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,730
the puzzle-solving game your dad taught you.

161
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:40,840
Mom,

162
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,700
I've solved it.

163
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,520
Come,

164
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,850
take a look, take a look.

165
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,520
Come,

166
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,840
let's check it.

167
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,240
It's really correct.

168
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,640
Son,

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,860
well done, son.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,640
Of course.

171
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,640
Yang Ming,

172
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,200
Yang Ming,

173
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,280
everything

174
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,360
has a code.

175
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,480
Our family is the same.

176
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,360
Do you know

177
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,620
what Caesar cipher is?

178
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,450
I don't know.

179
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
The Caesar cipher

180
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,800
is an ancient substitution cipher

181
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,760
used to transmit important information.

182
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
I'll teach you some simple ones now.

183
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,280
Okay.

184
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,130
For example,

185
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,520
I'll give you three sets of numbers now,

186
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,560
and you can find

187
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,040
the corresponding letters or symbols.

188
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,280
Six

189
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,920
represents the sixth page.

190
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,880
(2) FeCl solution reacts vigorously with NaOH, resulting in F.

191
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,240
Represents the eighth row.

192
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,640
First.

193
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,450
It represents the first character or symbol.

194
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,440
The first one is iron.

195
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,840
Now,

196
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,720
look it up.

197
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,410
these words.

198
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,680
Eighteen.

199
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,360
Seven.

200
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,240
seven.

201
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,400
That is

202
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,660
page eighteen,

203
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,640
seventh line,

204
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,770
seventh character.

205
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,680
Aluminum.

206
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,570
Lithium.

207
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,840
Now,

208
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,480
you've written it down.

209
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,000
If you

210
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,960
connect

211
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,600
the first capital letter

212
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,330
of each word,

213
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,170
that's the message I want to convey to you.

214
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,680
Try it.

215
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,680
This is

216
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,730
the English word

217
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,580
for 'home'.

218
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,720
I know this English word,

219
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,400
but

220
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,080
it's missing a 'Y'.

221
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,240
Yang.

222
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,000
By the way,

223
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,370
Five.

224
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,690
four.

225
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,580
You're making fast progress.

226
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,650
Not bad, kid.

227
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,610
What did you see?

228
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,040
I saw

229
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,920
the best of times.

230
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,240
Wang Group's server.

231
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,610
The password is incorrect.

232
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,920
Do you have any leads?

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,330
Earlier, Chen Qingqing

234
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,450
swallowed that piece of paper.

235
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,720
It's an eight-digit number.

236
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
We've succeeded.

237
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,370
There's still an encrypted document.

238
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,960
Fake.
