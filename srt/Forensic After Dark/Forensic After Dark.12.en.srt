00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,650
Selected project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Library.

2
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,640
Captain Peng,

3
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,039
We've analyzed the blood stains found in the car.

4
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,520
They belong to the suspect, Zhu Shan.

5
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,480
We've basically concluded that

6
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,120
Zhu Shan has fled to evade punishment.

7
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,720
I suggest

8
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,760
we issue a public wanted notice

9
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,039
and offer a reward for information.

10
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,560
Lao Xu,

11
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,880
I don't think that's necessary right now.

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,320
But-

13
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,160
Don't be hasty.

14
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,890
Listen to me.

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,729
I have two considerations.

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,440
First,

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,039
if we issue it now,

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,890
we might alert the suspect.

19
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,640
If we push this violent suspect too hard,

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,400
I'm worried

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,060
he might hurt more people.

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,120
Second,

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,360
you're an experienced detective.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,640
If you can't solve a case that's not too complicated,

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,840
if you can't solve it,

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,940
it could greatly affect your future.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
At the end of this year,

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,600
the province

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,440
will be selecting the top ten outstanding police officers.

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,840
I have high hopes for you.

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,120
I understand,

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,920
Captain Peng.

33
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,400
There's one more thing,

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Captain Peng.

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,400
Can Yang Ming be reassigned to a different position?

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Reassign him?

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,009
You don't trust him?

38
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,920
I'm concerned his abilities might be a bit lacking.

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,840
Could we possibly

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
transfer someone from elsewhere?

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,800
Transferring people isn't that easy.

42
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,329
Yang Ming

43
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,160
was transferred here after Old Qin spent

44
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,360
over two months requesting him before he passed away.

45
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,620
Yang Ming is a good kid.

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,770
You should mentor him more.

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,680
Captain Xu.

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,140
Coming.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,420
Around 8:30 this morning,

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,240
the police dogs found this severed head.

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,640
Look,

52
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,410
it's been hacked again.

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,580
Do you want to take a break?

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,040
POLICE

55
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,660
Come on.

56
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,090
POLICE POLICE POLICE POLICE PO

57
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,010
We've found out.

58
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,370
This is Zhu Shan's head.

59
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,520
The forensic team

60
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,200
conducted DNA tests on the head.

61
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,860
It's confirmed to be Zhu Shan.

62
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,760
We're still searching for the other body parts.

63
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,520
In other words,

64
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,480
the suspect of the first explosion case,

65
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,010
Zhu Shan,

66
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,280
has been murdered,

67
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,000
dismembered,

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,260
with unclear motives.

69
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,120
The suspect has become a victim.

70
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,040
On the night of the incident,

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,440
the two footprints found at Zhu Shan's house

72
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,760
are the most suspicious.

73
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,520
The elderly neighbor

74
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,120
saw

75
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,520
Zhu Shan's car return home in the middle of the night.

76
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,050
However,

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,720
the old lady's memory is poor.

78
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,480
She can't remember how many people there were.

79
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:55,920
Ah Jin.

80
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,650
I suggest

81
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,400
you take someone and go there again

82
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
to try to get

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,440
a side profile sketch of the suspect.

84
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:02,770
Okay.

85
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,440
I've already arranged for a sketch artist.

86
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,200
Lan Jing,

87
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,250
do you have anything to add?

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,530
Nothing for now.

89
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,160
No,

90
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,040
next we

91
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,200
still need to examine the victim's head.

92
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,600
We need to conduct an examination.

93
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
There are still some issues.

94
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,370
What issues?

95
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,080
The second murder weapon

96
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,800
hasn't been found yet.

97
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,160
No,

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,400
the suspect is still unclear.

99
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
How can we determine the murder weapon?

100
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,440
What I mean is

101
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,680
Zhu Shan didn't kill anyone,

102
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,280
or rather,

103
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,960
he killed one of them.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,600
Yang Ming,

105
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
the explosive materials we found

106
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,960
at Zhu Shan's house

107
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,090
are quite complete.

108
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,320
Even the murder weapon

109
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
was confirmed by you

110
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,159
to match the blade marks on the body.

111
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,480
It could also be a false accusation.

112
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
False accusation?

113
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,280
To be precise,

114
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,650
it's a frame-up.

115
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,520
Leading us to suspect

116
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,380
that Zhu Shan did all this.

117
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,320
Tweezers.

118
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,760
Here.

119
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,410
Are you okay?

120
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,040
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,330
She's pregnant.

122
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,440
No, no, no,

123
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,700
what nonsense are you talking about?

124
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,330
According to regulations,

125
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,690
one of you needs to be transferred.

126
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,930
Let's boil it directly.

127
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,840
I need to separate his

128
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,970
bones and muscles as soon as possible.

129
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,850
You should go check on Lan Jing.

130
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,610
I've got this

131
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,880
covered here.

132
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,360
You...

133
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,640
You didn't...

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,360
take advantage of me when I was drunk that day,

135
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,480
did you?

136
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,720
You wish.

137
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,460
Let me tell you,

138
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,679
this is a rite of passage for rookies.

139
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,440
You'll get used to it.

140
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,200
You really know how to comfort people, don't you?

141
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,460
I'm telling the truth.

142
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,320
The first time I saw

143
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,679
a charred corpse,

144
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,520
I cried like an idiot.

145
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,400
You're much stronger than I was.

146
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,100
I've heard about that.

147
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,320
You're paying such close attention to me, huh?

148
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,960
Dr. Yang Ming is still the most impressive.

149
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,280
Whether it's at the crime scene

150
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,540
or during the autopsy,

151
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,660
he can always stay focused

152
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,370
without even blinking.

153
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,360
Tell me

154
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,560
about your story with Yang Ming.

155
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,540
As for Yang Ming's father,

156
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,210
I suppose you've heard quite a bit.

157
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,720
He used to be

158
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,800
the head of our forensics department.

159
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,520
Yang Ming was influenced from an early age,

160
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,360
showing a natural talent for forensic medicine.

161
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,840
Later,

162
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,200
it was only natural that

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,720
he was admitted to the forensic medicine program at the Police University.

164
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,160
We became classmates.

165
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,620
Let me tell you,

166
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,120
at that time, the two of us

167
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,980
were key training targets of the organization.

168
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,320
We were called

169
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,720
the twin stars of

170
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,600
the criminal technology field.

171
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,360
He and I were

172
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,000
both competitors

173
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,640
and close friends.

174
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,580
Later, Yang Ming focused on forensic medicine,

175
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,960
and as his older brother,

176
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,640
I certainly couldn't compete with him in that field.

177
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,360
So,

178
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,930
I chose trace evidence analysis instead.

179
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,380
After graduation,

180
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,040
I

181
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,040
came here

182
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
and became colleagues with his father.

183
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,640
As for him,

184
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,680
he went to Haimen City to work as a forensic doctor.

185
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,380
Not long after,

186
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,840
his father made a mistake

187
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,300
and was expelled from the organization.

188
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,080
A year later,

189
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,200
he was found dead at home.

190
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
This was a double blow for Yang Ming.

191
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,820
Think about it,

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,440
his respected father

193
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,360
was expelled for helping a suspect

194
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,040
evade legal responsibility,

195
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,080
violating regulations.

196
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,160
He was expelled from the organization.

197
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,040
After that,

198
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,410
Yang Ming changed a lot.

199
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,840
Once,

200
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,100
I went to Haimen City for a study visit

201
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,210
and saw that he had become very depressed.

202
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,410
Alright,

203
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,120
let's talk about you.

204
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
What's going on with you?

205
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,280
What's wrong with me?

206
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,440
I'm a trace evidence analyst.

207
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,040
Nothing can escape

208
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,840
my eyes.

209
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,090
Every time you see a burned corpse,

210
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,880
you seem particularly disturbed.

211
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,810
What's going on?

212
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,400
If you don't want to talk about it now,

213
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,920
then we'll wait until

214
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,280
you're ready to talk.

215
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,520
It's okay,

216
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,600
I can wait.

217
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,900
Speak for the dead,

218
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,200
fight for the living.

219
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,280
Tell me,

220
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,400
who killed you?

221
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,370
Fine,

222
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,040
I did it all, okay?

223
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,160
Give me the money.

224
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,040
All of you, get out of the car.
