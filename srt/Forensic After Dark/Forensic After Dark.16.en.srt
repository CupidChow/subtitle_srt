2
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,160
This knife belongs to the two brothers.

3
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,200
Their fingerprints should be on it, right?

4
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,520
What does this have to do with me?

5
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,680
You really think you've done a perfect job?

6
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,610
Do you think you can fool everyone?

7
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,060
We have an eyewitness.

8
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,560
Who?

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,060
It's the boatman you're looking for.

10
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,240
On the night of the incident,

11
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,660
he heard an explosion,

12
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,080
and went to the scene.

13
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,800
I witnessed the entire process of your robbery and murder.

14
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,060
and your appearances.

15
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,700
We questioned him before.

16
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,600
He lied and said he didn't see anything.

17
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,259
Suddenly, I heard a loud bang.

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,160
That was it.

19
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,200
I just peed.

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
Got it on my hands.

21
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,880
Then I went to look.

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,250
went to look.

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
I saw the car explode.

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,340
That's all.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
Do you remember how many people there were?

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,400
I only saw the car.

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,050
I didn't see any people.

28
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,130
Is there anything else?

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,160
No, that's all.

30
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,320
I only saw the car.

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,650
I didn't see anyone.

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Quite cunning.

33
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,370
Even tried to rob me.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,420
Unexpectedly,

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,660
he's so bad even his own mother wouldn't recognize him.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
You think you're some kind of good person?

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,120
This boatman confessed.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,200
You called him

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,600
and only booked a spot for one person.

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,640
You even instructed him

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,240
to get rid of Wu Xianda at sea.

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,920
Robbery and murder,

43
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,280
plotting against your own brother.

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
You're the one who's unforgivable.

45
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,490
You're still laughing?

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,320
Wu Xianming is already dead.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,280
What?

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,660
Wu Xianda lost too much blood.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,080
He's still in the ICU now.

50
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,140
Wu Xianming

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,440
The poison reached his heart and lungs.

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,320
He just died.

53
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
Four lives.

54
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,080
Even if you're executed,

55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,970
your soul will still be guilty.

56
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,560
I found a penny on the street.

57
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,160
I'll hand it over to the police officer.

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,040
When I get some money,

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,900
I'll take you to a fancy dance hall

60
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,090
to have some fun.

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,240
Really?

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,640
Bro,

63
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,600
Really.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,320
Bro,

65
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,380
Big bro,

66
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,920
this Zhao Dachuan

67
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,520
has been selling fish recently

68
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,650
and made some money.

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,500
Do you want to get rich?

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,530
Ten days ago,

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,360
Wu Xianming met Zhu Shan at a gambling game.

72
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,880
He heard Zhu Shan mention Zhao Dachuan

73
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,000
who cuckolded him.

74
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,280
He also said Zhao Dachuan made a lot of money

75
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,320
selling fish.

76
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,770
So I instigated Wu Xianming

77
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,920
to have Zhu Shan kill Zhao Dachuan

78
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,250
and rob him for revenge.

79
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,010
Beautiful, oh so beautiful, how beautiful it is.

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,960
Hug, hug,

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,960
hug that girl onto the bridal sedan chair.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,840
That's a lot of money.

83
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,560
(Big Brother)

84
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,530
Big Brother has struck it rich.

85
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,450
Big Brother,

86
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,840
What are you doing here?

87
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,440
Who told you to come?

88
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:06,840
Honey,

89
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,810
what happened to your face?

90
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,940
Quick, get inside.

91
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,180
Don't make a sound.

92
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,400
A Shan,

93
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,130
Big Brother.

94
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,120
Big Brother,

95
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,650
sit down.

96
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,080
Your place is so shabby.

97
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,610
Sit down.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,530
Your wife is quite a looker.

99
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,050
Big Brother,

100
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,140
when are you going to give me my share?

101
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,600
What share? There's nothing to share.

102
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:32,930
Well,

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,560
this wound is quite serious.

104
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,420
My face is numb.

105
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,560
I need to go to the hospital.

106
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,960
Hospital? What hospital?

107
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,680
You'll get caught by the police if you go to the hospital.

108
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,600
Watch out for my brother.

109
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
He'll chop you up.

110
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,409
Then what about this wound?

111
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,159
It's alright, brother.

112
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,120
Don't worry, brother.

113
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,880
What about me?

114
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,810
I used to be a vet.

115
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,480
Find a needle and thread.

116
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
I'll stitch it up for you.

117
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,040
Really?

118
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,680
Yes, really.

119
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,810
Will it leave a scar?

120
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,880
Brother,

121
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,600
Big brother will give you your share of the money tomorrow.

122
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,460
How about that?

123
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,400
Once you have money,

124
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,560
you can get any woman you want.

125
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:10,880
Right.

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,530
Besides,

127
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,840
a man with a few scars

128
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,460
is even more handsome.

129
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,800
A Shan,

130
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,600
this is your house.

131
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,340
Why are you so nervous?

132
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,820
Sit down, sit down.

133
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,800
There's no

134
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,970
anesthetic at home.

135
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,720
Who needs anesthetic?

136
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Need anesthetic?

137
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,020
Are you a man or not?

138
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:32,960
Of course I am.

139
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,960
I'm a real man.

140
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,760
A true man.

141
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,080
Why are you still standing there?

142
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,159
Hurry up and get the needle and thread.

143
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,880
Okay, okay.

144
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,100
Alright, alright.

145
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Such a big needle.

146
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,250
Sew more gently.

147
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,680
Sew a little more gently.

148
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,600
Give me the money.

149
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
All of you, get out of the car.

150
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,780
On the road.

151
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
I originally intended to create

152
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,480
a scenario of fleeing from guilt

153
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,720
and accidentally falling off a cliff to death.

154
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,200
Who knew

155
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
I couldn't resist

156
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,320
and ended up killing him anyway.

157
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,840
The corpse?

158
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
Chopped it up and fed it to the dogs.

159
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,320
As for the head,

160
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,540
it was too hard.

161
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,850
Even the dogs couldn't chew it.

162
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,610
So I used fire

163
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,850
to burn the head.

164
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,840
After killing Zhu Shan in the morning,

165
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,500
I returned to his house again.

166
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,850
I threw the knife and explosive materials

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
into his kitchen.

168
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,610
This way,

169
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,960
I could divert your investigation

170
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,880
and frame Zhu Shan.

171
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,980
We three brothers came to the seaside

172
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,850
and spent a night in woven bags,

173
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,280
preparing to escape by boat.

174
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,380
Unexpectedly,

175
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,460
Wu Laosan didn't change his ways.

176
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,960
He kept making a fuss every day,

177
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,620
wanting to find prostitutes.

178
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,680
I had no choice

179
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,120
but to use drugs to control him.

180
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,400
Devil's spice

181
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,960
is just a personal habit of mine.

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,240
I add a bit to everything I eat.

183
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,370
Only when I eat it

184
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,480
can I keep my mind clear.

185
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
I'll tell you something.

186
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,300
Little sister,

187
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,080
the police are onto me.

188
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,770
They're right outside.

189
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,560
You should run away quickly.

190
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,420
I don't want to implicate you.

191
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,440
Third brother,

192
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,160
Wu Xianming deliberately gave up escaping

193
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,020
because he knew

194
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,560
that only if he was caught

195
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,840
would it be the signal for you to escape.

196
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,560
He revealed the hiding place

197
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,400
only because

198
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,200
he was sure you had already fled.

199
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,260
Police!

200
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,380
Don't move!

201
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,240
When Wu Xianda was inspecting

202
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,370
Zhu Shan's bedroom,

203
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,940
he actually

204
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,760
discovered Zhu Shan's wife.

205
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,760
She was spared.

206
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,080
Wu Xianming, until his death,

207
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,210
never revealed your escape location.

208
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,600
We found this

209
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,250
on Wu Xianda's body.

210
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,400
Until the end,

211
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,640
they were both thinking of you.

212
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,600
Impossible.

213
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,200
It can't be.

214
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
I'm the one who harmed them.

215
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,200
I...

216
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,880
I'll confess to everything.

217
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,540
I'm guilty.

218
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,680
I'm guilty.

219
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,080
I'm guilty.

220
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,720
I'm guilty.

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,860
I plead guilty.

222
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,040
I'm guilty.

223
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,080
I plead guilty.

224
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,660
For some, prison has physical walls,

225
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,520
for others, it's invisible.

226
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,280
Your favorite chicken butt,

227
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,800
Xianming.

228
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,880
And your favorite chicken head.

229
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,960
And there are two chili peppers.

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,400
One for each of you.

231
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,960
Take them.

232
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,800
Eat.

233
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,480
Come on, eat.

234
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,740
Why aren't you eating?

235
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,240
Is it good?

236
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,480
Is it tasty?

237
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,880
It's delicious, it's delicious.

238
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,600
Thank you, Brother Fan.
