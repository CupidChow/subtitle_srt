Selected project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Library.

2
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,720
Hello.

3
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,200
The user you are calling is temporarily unavailable.

4
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,360
Oh no.

5
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,479
Master,

6
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,130
how is it?

7
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,820
Lieutenant Xu,

8
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,039
we haven't found

9
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,300
any useful leads here.

10
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,759
Hello?

11
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,420
Lieutenant Xu,

12
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,320
Meng Youqi might be under the suspect's control.

13
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
We're heading to the abandoned villa in Wangshan now.

14
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:58,880
Okay.

15
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,010
We'll be there soon.

16
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,850
Let's go.

17
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,740
Let me tell you,

18
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,760
this suspect of ours

19
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,400
shows a lack of confidence in every way.

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,480
She has excellent painting skills,

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,840
but can't get recognition from others.

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,520
Out of desperation,

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,680
she had to choose to become a water delivery person.

24
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,560
Someone like her

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,280
who has a sense of ritual about killing

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,520
won't be in a rush to kill.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,250
Don't worry,

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,560
we'll make it in time.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,360
Look!

30
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,320
That's Youqi's car up ahead.

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,570
Let's go over there.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,970
It really is her car.

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,360
She's inside.

34
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,740
This scene looks a bit gloomy.

35
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,040
The space here is quite large.

36
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,900
Let's split up.

37
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,240
Okay.

38
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,880
Rose champagne.

39
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,920
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,680
Sister.

41
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,980
I need to borrow your blood

42
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,240
to help me complete my work.

43
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,960
I want to plant a soul

44
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,880
in each of my paintings.

45
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,840
Stop!

46
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,060
Don't come any closer,

47
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,330
or I'll kill her.

48
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,640
I'm a police officer.

49
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,090
Please calm down first.

50
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,010
Listen to me.

51
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,370
I know you're an artist.

52
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,130
But you're still young.

53
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,370
What's the problem?

54
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,940
Let's talk slowly.

55
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,600
I see.

56
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,290
You're the one who called earlier.

57
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,160
But I don't care who you are.

58
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,020
Let me tell you.

59
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,640
No one can stop me.

60
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,970
from finishing my work.

61
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,240
Wait a moment.

62
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,170
What's your purpose in completing this work?

63
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,780
My girlfriend is a psychologist.

64
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,240
She came here.

65
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,560
to treat you.

66
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,600
I don't know what kind of

67
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,060
pain you've been through,

68
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,370
but I want to tell you now

69
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,100
that life doesn't deceive ordinary people,

70
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,320
it deceives cowards.

71
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,180
Don't move!

72
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,060
Police!

73
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,840
Police!

74
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,400
Freeze!

75
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,760
You Qi.

76
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,560
You Qi.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,480
You Qi.

78
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,600
You Qi.

79
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,800
Yang Ming.

80
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,560
I just wanted to help them

81
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,760
overcome their psychological trauma.

82
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,360
You Qi.

83
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,960
Lin Wanyi.

84
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
The artificial lake in the north of the city

85
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,640
and the abandoned red brick house on the west embankment,

86
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,770
were the two victims

87
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,000
killed by you?

88
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,280
That's right.

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,440
I killed them all.

90
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
The thujone alcohol drug you used,

91
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,760
who helped you prepare it?

92
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,560
The bartender from Heaven, of course.

93
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,760
Haven't you already interrogated him?

94
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,240
Don't beat around the bush.

95
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Tell me the truth.

96
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,760
Just sleep,

97
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
and you'll have everything.

98
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,220
Are there any other accomplices?

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
Do you need accomplices to sleep?

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,720
Lin Wanyi,

101
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,480
my works

102
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,560
are all completed by myself.

103
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,620
I don't need any accomplices.

104
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,100
Why did you do all this?

105
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,160
Is killing people really that thrilling?

106
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,960
Thrilling?

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,760
That's right.

108
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,450
It is thrilling.

109
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,000
They like thrills, don't they?

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,800
So I satisfied them.

111
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,240
I gave them the thrill they wanted.

112
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,080
Is that

113
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,440
wrong?

114
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,290
What do you mean?

115
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,760
Do you know what these bastards

116
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
did to me in pursuit of their so-called thrill?

117
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,380
Do you know what they did to me?

118
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,240
They...

119
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,120
They had me gang-raped.

120
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,440
Every artist

121
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,760
has moments when inspiration runs dry.

122
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,760
That night,

123
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,600
I just wanted to go to a bar

124
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,000
to have a couple of drinks

125
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,250
and find some inspiration for my work.

126
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,120
They actually put

127
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,490
a date rape drug in my drink.

128
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,960
You filthy bitch!

129
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,120
Just for that crappy painting,

130
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,640
you swindled my boyfriend out of so much money.

131
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,880
We asked you to pay it back, but you refused.

132
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,360
Baby,

133
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,840
can you handle it?

134
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Let him take over.

135
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,010
Is it thrilling enough?

136
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,240
Scream again!

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,890
Is it thrilling?

138
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,900
What happened that day

139
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,440
lasted the entire night.

140
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,360
I passed out countless times

141
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,320
and woke up just as many.

142
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,410
I can't remember the faces of most of them,

143
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,720
they're all a blur.

144
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,700
The only one I remember

145
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,080
is the one called Fu Xiaojing.

146
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,770
And also,

147
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,919
rose champagne.

148
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,120
Rose champagne?

149
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,320
Why did you frame the bartender?

150
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,280
He put all my paintings in the bathroom.

151
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,730
He disrespected my art.

152
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,940
He deserved to die.

153
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,620
What about Meng Youqi?

154
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
That woman...

155
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,440
It's her own fault for being too clever.

156
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
she said things she shouldn't have.

157
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,280
What on earth did you draw?

158
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,320
It's so gloomy.

159
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,040
No, no, no!

160
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,600
Boss, please take another look.

161
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:08,930
Boss.

162
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,100
Did you paint this?

163
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,410
It was painted by my friend.

164
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,540
Do you like this kind of painting?

165
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,320
the style is gloomy,

166
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,120
dark, enclosed spaces,

167
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,120
seeking release.

168
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,440
Your friend might have psychological issues.

169
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,880
I am a painter,

170
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,920
a painter with dignity.

171
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,360
Those who don't like my paintings,

172
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,040
I turn them

173
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,560
into my artwork.

174
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,920
With paint,

175
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,040
I wipe away their filth.

176
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,930
With a brush,

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,240
I erase their sins.

178
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,080
I'm very satisfied,

179
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,400
very satisfied.

180
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,220
Captain Xu.

181
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,840
Master.

182
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,400
We've found something.

183
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,840
Lin Wanyi uploaded the photos to foreign websites.

184
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,120
and it's not just photos.

185
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,840
some paintings

186
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,960
are also being sold on foreign websites.

187
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,320
The account isn't hers either.

188
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,160
What about the paintings?

189
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,120
We've discovered that under Lin Wanyi's name,

190
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,520
there was an international package sent to France.

191
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
It has been intercepted and retrieved.

192
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:15,960
Good.

193
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:20,920
Yang Ming.

194
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,600
Youqi.

195
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,440
You're awake.

196
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,480
How are you feeling?

197
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,160
I'm fine.

198
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,680
That woman...

199
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,200
That woman...

200
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,400
What happened to her?

201
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,290
She has been arrested by us.

202
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,330
she's being interrogated now.

203
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,090
Don't worry.

204
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,060
Just rest well for now.

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,600
We've unlocked her account.

206
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,280
Based on the account,

207
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,290
we've recovered these paintings.

208
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,280
I'm certain

209
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,040
it's definitely another case of painting with blood.

210
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,500
Look at this painting.

211
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,640
The neck wounds

212
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,890
are very similar to Fu Xiaojing's.

213
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,800
It must be

214
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,680
the punishment inflicted on Fu Xiaojing

215
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,320
for artistic inspiration

216
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,120
that resulted in this painting.

217
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,440
Well, if that's the case,

218
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,960
looking at the wounds and strangulation marks in this painting,

219
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
it's very likely that this is

220
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,720
Li Xiuna.

221
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,720
The first painting is of Fu Xiaojing,

222
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,980
the second is Li Xiuna,

223
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,240
so the third one

224
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,860
must be Meng Youqi.

225
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,360
But in this painting,

226
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
there are no visible wounds.

227
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
The murder weapon we found at the scene

228
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,440
was a hammer.

229
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,200
It's very likely that the suspect

230
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,320
intended to use the hammer

231
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,880
to smash Meng Youqi's skull.

232
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,320
To seek creative inspiration.

233
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,720
It's too cruel.

234
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,180
Indeed.

235
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,400
It's too dark.

236
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,760
But this second painting,

237
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,160
I have a different perspective from yours.

238
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,170
Based on criminal psychology inference,

239
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,170
there's another interpretation.

240
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,280
Look at this area in the middle.

241
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,010
Doesn't it resemble an embryo?

242
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,580
She uses her body and blood

243
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,000
to nourish this land,

244
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,010
allowing this embryo to take root and sprout,

245
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
nurturing this tree of life.

246
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,800
Tree of life.

247
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,600
Despair.

248
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,680
Hope.

249
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,280
Extract DNA

250
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
from all the areas

251
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,680
with suspected blood stains

252
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,760
on the painting for identification.

253
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,290
Alright.

254
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,360
Medical shop degree.
