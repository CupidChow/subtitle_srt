00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,650
Selected project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Library.

2
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,479
Drug manufacturing.

3
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,170
President Wang.

4
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,440
Liu Yaohui just died.

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,820
Why has the office already been cleaned?

6
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,320
Old Liu.

7
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,240
He's always been a clean freak.

8
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,900
so I let them

9
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,720
clean up a bit.

10
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,580
Old Liu's case.

11
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,140
Do we have any results?

12
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,720
I just came to see

13
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,600
if my father left any other belongings.

14
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,930
Okay.

15
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,370
I'll take you there in a moment.

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,480
What's wrong?

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,400
Yang Ming.

18
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,480
You're a police officer.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,220
I don't know

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,490
if I should tell you.

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,170
However,

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,480
it's about your father.

23
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
About my father?

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,920
From the outside perspective,

25
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,380
Old Yang

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,260
was doing experiments at home

27
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,640
and accidentally died from inhaling harmful substances.

28
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,120
But

29
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,160
I've always suspected

30
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,760
that his death

31
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,090
might have hidden circumstances.

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,180
Do you think

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,240
my father was murdered?

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,160
It's possible.

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,120
Back then, the company

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
was developing a

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,200
new product

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,680
to replace ephedrine.

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,260
Later, we found out

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,410
someone was secretly using it to manufacture drugs.

41
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
The company at that time

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,690
had quite a bit of negative publicity.

43
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,320
All along,

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,040
I had the company conduct an internal investigation.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,560
We discovered that this matter

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,290
involved other people as well.

47
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:08,960
But

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,890
we couldn't identify the specific individuals.

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,800
Old Liu

50
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,000
was your father's classmate.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,640
Your father

52
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,700
was introduced to the company by him.

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,820
Yang Qihua and I were classmates.

54
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,520
He was a physical chemistry engineer.

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,600
Our university research group

56
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,280
focused on this type of research.

57
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,010
This project

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,490
was perfect for him.

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,400
Well,

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,480
the two of them

61
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,640
had a good relationship.

62
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,720
They developed pharmaceutical products together

63
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,579
and worked on backup protection for research data.

64
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm wondering

65
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
if Old Liu's death

66
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,640
might be

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,060
related to your father's situation.

68
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,079
He actually admitted to this

69
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,160
and even pushed

70
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,010
the blame

71
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,280
onto the recently deceased Liu Yaohui.

72
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,930
But isn't that too obvious?

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,200
I always feel

74
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,760
that he knows you're going to find him.

75
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,620
He's always one step ahead of you.

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,120
You're not suggesting

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,440
Well, I didn't say anything.

78
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,000
Is he confident

79
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,640
or is this his final madness?

80
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,640
Hello?

81
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:28,920
Hello?

82
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,720
The police have found us.

83
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
They've accessed the company's surveillance footage.

84
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,610
Understood.

85
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,180
Will he protect us?

86
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,800
Sir, please calm down.

87
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,600
It's crucial that you stay calm.

88
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,300
Put it down.

89
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,940
Fang Ao.

90
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,800
Calm down.

91
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,120
Stop right there.

92
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,720
Step back.

93
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,520
Fang Ao.

94
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,580
Put the knife down.

95
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,800
Step back.

96
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,920
Be careful.

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,280
You dare to call the police?

98
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,010
It wasn't me.

99
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,570
Wang Yue.

100
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,700
Let me tell you.

101
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,840
if I go down,

102
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,400
everything you've done,

103
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
I'll spill it all.

104
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,520
Help me.

105
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,280
Help me, help me!

106
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,320
Thank goodness you're here.

107
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,420
This...

108
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,840
What's going on here?

109
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,600
Master,

110
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,010
he's not breathing.

111
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,720
Death due to sudden cardiac arrest.

112
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,250
Continue the examination.

113
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,720
I think...

114
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,180
He must have come to silence someone.

115
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,200
You mean...

116
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,900
Since Liu Yaohui's death,

117
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,010
I've noticed

118
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,880
someone's been killing to cover their tracks.

119
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,020
The killer might have discovered

120
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,730
Yang Ming appeared at the company,

121
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,080
got nervous,

122
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,800
and panicked.

123
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,240
I'll...

124
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,520
From within the company,

125
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,780
start investigating.

126
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,580
As a result.

127
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,200
You mean...

128
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,760
That's right.

129
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,140
Old Yang's death back then

130
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,020
was not an accident at all.

131
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,220
The real killer of Old Yang

132
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,320
is Fang Ao.

133
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,840
Fang Ao has been secretly taking

134
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,760
the company's profits.

135
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,890
Drug manufacturing and trafficking.

136
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,200
Back then, Fang Ao discovered

137
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,120
Old Yang learned about his secret.

138
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,780
he then took

139
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
without permission

140
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,320
chemical drugs from the company to make poison.

141
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,650
He approached Old Yang.

142
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,370
At that time,

143
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,200
our company was developing a type of drug,

144
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
but it didn't meet the standards.

145
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,620
So we abandoned it.

146
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,880
Unexpectedly,

147
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,440
Fang Ao

148
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,340
seized the company's research results.

149
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,180
For the past few years,

150
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,680
the company has misunderstood your father

151
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,200
and Liu Yaohui as well.

152
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,610
We've wronged them.

153
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,160
Colleague.

154
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,520
Yuexin.

155
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,120
Tongfeng.

156
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,640
Colleague.

157
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,360
I never thought it would turn out like this.

158
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,250
This is just the beginning.

159
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,720
Yang Ming.

160
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,940
Things have become clear now.

161
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,060
Perhaps this is the best outcome.

162
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,280
My father was poisoned to death.

163
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,010
You think this is the best outcome?

164
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,600
You told me before

165
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,060
that this case was closed,

166
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,400
that it was an accidental death.

167
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,680
Now you're telling me

168
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,820
things have become clear?

169
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,680
Yang Ming,

170
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,930
you've misunderstood.

171
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,800
Do you know what I regret the most now?

172
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,400
What is it?

173
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,520
It's that I never believed

174
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,080
Fang Ao was the real mastermind.

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,400
I always firmly believed

176
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,120
Fang Ao was just a scapegoat.

177
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,890
But I hate myself

178
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,530
I hate myself

179
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,680
for not having evidence

180
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,740
to prove he wasn't.

181
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,800
Today at the company,

182
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,320
I watched Wang Yue

183
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,680
right under my nose,

184
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,960
performing one act after another

185
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,820
of a clumsy and ridiculous farce.

186
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,320
I understand you.

187
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,580
You don't understand.

188
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,200
You don't understand at all.

189
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,240
My father on October 1, 2028

190
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,370
about going to work for the Wang Group.

191
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,760
Did you know?

192
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,679
I didn't know.

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,330
Do you want to continue?

194
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,320
I will definitely continue.

195
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,850
The autopsy results

196
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,480
show that the cause of Fang Ao's death

197
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,810
was cardiac paralysis.

198
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,450
Cardiac paralysis?

199
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,520
But Fang Ao had no history of heart disease.

200
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,480
How could he suddenly suffer from cardiac paralysis?

201
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,560
Regarding Fang Ao's death,

202
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,240
we made some new discoveries

203
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,200
at the scene.

204
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,480
We extracted some unknown substances

205
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,680
from Fang Ao's mouth.

206
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,520
After examination,

207
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,960
it was identified as VX nerve agent.

208
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,090
This is a nerve agent

209
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,420
more toxic than sarin.

210
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,920
Inhalation causes nervous system disorders

211
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,040
and can also lead to death by cardiac paralysis.

212
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,720
VX nerve agent components

213
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,120
were also detected in the deceased's body.

214
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,050
I see.

215
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
It's another murder.

216
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,520
But with Fang Ao's death,

217
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,240
our investigation has lost its target

218
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,080
and reached a stage where we have no one to investigate.

219
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,540
There's still one person.

220
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,920
The secretary, Chen Qingqing.

221
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,520
She was very close to Fang Ao.

222
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,640
Perhaps

223
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,820
Fang Ao's death

224
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,500
is somehow related to her.

225
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,400
Are you suggesting

226
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
that Chen Qingqing was Fang Ao's accomplice,

227
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,320
or...

228
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,210
At this point, we don't know

229
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,900
what role Chen Qingqing plays

230
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,000
in this case.

231
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,760
But I feel that

232
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,600
for a chemistry Ph.D.

233
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,760
to be working as a secretary in this company

234
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,160
must be significant.

235
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,620
Perhaps

236
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,690
she is our last key witness.

237
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,330
Alright,

238
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,600
Ah Jin and I will investigate

239
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,200
Chen Qingqing's situation.

240
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,690
If you have any news,

241
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,410
report it immediately.

242
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,240
Yes, sir.

243
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,440
How's the situation?

244
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,260
Master,

245
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,080
I've been watching here all night.

246
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,740
This Chen Qingqing hasn't left the house at all.

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,040
Xiao Wang, Xiao Wang,

248
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,840
how's the situation on your end?

249
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,320
The view is blocked by curtains.

250
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,480
I can't see the specific situation clearly.

251
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:23,840
Alright.

252
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,170
Good.

253
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,760
Ah Jin.

254
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,320
Change your clothes.

255
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,050
go and do some reconnaissance.

256
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:38,960
Hello.

257
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,540
Your takeout has arrived.

258
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,560
Store degree
