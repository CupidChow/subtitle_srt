Selected project for Guangdong Province Original Online Audio-Visual Premium Project Database.

2
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,120
Come.

3
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,900
Master.

4
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,420
That's the one.

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,410
Alright.

6
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,800
It's quite crowded now.

7
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,400
Make sure to block all exits.

8
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,850
Understood.

9
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
I'll have a drink.

10
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,660
Make it strong.

11
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,600
Here's your drink.

12
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,460
I want the same drink as that girl.

13
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,760
This is a lady's drink.

14
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,480
I like it.

15
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,800
Since you like it, I'll mix another one for you.

16
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,130
This one's on the house.

17
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,400
Here's yours.

18
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,520
Team One.

19
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Stop the suspect.

20
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Just my luck.

21
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,730
You've got guts.

22
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,720
If you've got the skills,

23
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,180
come fight me one-on-one.

24
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,640
I, Biao Bao, am no stranger to the world.

25
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,500
Which one of you

26
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,760
wants to spar with me?

27
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,810
Criminal Investigation Unit.

28
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,800
Holy shit.

29
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,970
It can't be such a coincidence.

30
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:54,960
Speak.

31
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,000
What have you done?

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,060
Confess honestly.

33
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,960
Let me tell you,

34
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,460
I, Biao Bao, am not some country bumpkin.

35
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,760
behind these surveillance cameras,

36
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,520
I know exactly how many eyes are watching.

37
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,320
You think you can scare me?

38
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,840
I'm giving you a chance now.

39
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,680
Either you tell us yourself,

40
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,920
or we, the police, will reveal it.

41
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,480
The nature of the situation will be completely different.

42
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:10,810
Fine.

43
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,540
I admit defeat.

44
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,700
You reap what you sow in this life.

45
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,200
Running into a cop today,

46
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,320
I guess it's just my bad luck.

47
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,850
But let me say this upfront,

48
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,700
I've never done anything bad.

49
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,720
We're all one big family, police and citizens, right?

50
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,320
Do you want me to lock you up?

51
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,840
If your murder charge is confirmed,

52
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,280
you'll never see the light of day again.

53
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,340
Confess honestly.

54
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,840
Tell us about the murder you committed.

55
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,640
I didn't kill anyone.

56
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,200
I really didn't kill anyone!

57
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,800
Officer,

58
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,920
I just scammed some money from women.

59
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,400
I'm just a guy who lives off women.

60
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,280
Even if you gave me the courage,

61
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,010
I wouldn't dare to kill anyone.

62
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,240
Where did you get the thujone in your drink?

63
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,640
Speak.

64
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,100
I bought it online.

65
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,840
I thought that old man,

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
that police officer,

67
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,060
was that woman's husband.

68
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey, hey, hey!

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,440
Captain Xu.

70
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,100
The inspection report is out.

71
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,340
Captain Xu.

72
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480
You've come at the right time.

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,340
This bartender

74
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,320
regarding this case,

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,770
knows nothing about it.

76
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,090
Nothing matches up.

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,280
The gold powder fingerprints match.

78
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,410
I've been thinking,

79
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,920
being discovered in the abandoned factory,

80
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,800
the suspect would be worried about their tracks being exposed.

81
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,640
They probably wouldn't

82
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,170
brazenly appear at the bar.

83
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,020
Master,

84
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,200
I've checked.

85
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,280
On both days of the incidents,

86
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,200
this bartender didn't

87
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,080
have any contact with the victims.

88
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,400
He was bartending at the bar

89
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,040
after his shift,

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,760
he spent the whole night drinking with his colleagues.

91
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,520
The bar owner

92
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,560
and other staff members

93
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,760
can all vouch for him.

94
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,040
So he

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,360
has an alibi?

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,360
Yes.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
Alright, alright, alright.

98
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,760
Yours.

99
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,320
Yang Ming.

100
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,980
I did another physicochemical test.

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,800
in it,

102
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
there are indeed traces of thujone.

103
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,760
This time,

104
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
it was my mistake.

105
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,320
I'd like to toast you.

106
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,720
It's useless to find out.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,530
The bartender isn't the real culprit anyway.

108
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,520
Don't worry about it.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,130
I thought you couldn't drink alcohol?

110
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,440
This little bit of alcohol is nothing.

111
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,700
You underestimate me.

112
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,720
What kind of drink is this?

113
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,800
I can't feel a thing.

114
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,600
So expensive.

115
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,240
Why did you transfer here?

116
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,680
What?

117
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,880
I said, why did you transfer here?

118
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,280
Is it...

119
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,940
Do you have any other motives?

120
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,640
Go check if he's busy.

121
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,770
I'll go check on him.

122
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,780
Go ahead, go ahead.

123
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,320
If you don't want to talk, then don't.

124
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,120
Why are you hiding in the bathroom?

125
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,280
That's so petty.

126
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,760
I won't bring it up again.

127
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,080
I can't pee.

128
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,460
Look at this painting.

129
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,480
Oh my god.

130
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,680
This is terrifying.

131
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,960
No wonder I can't pee.

132
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,130
You're scared out of your wits.

133
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,320
This painting

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,130
foreshadows death.

135
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,320
The style of these paintings

136
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,300
is nihilistic.

137
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,480
Despair.

138
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,760
Darkness.

139
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,250
It's terrifying, isn't it?

140
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
All this time,

141
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,020
we've overlooked something.

142
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,360
The suspect.

143
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,400
Why did they leave

144
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
so many wounds on the victim's body?

145
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,680
Perhaps these wounds

146
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,240
weren't caused by abuse.

147
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,560
Instead, they reflect

148
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,980
the suspect's obsession.

149
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
These paintings are the obsession.

150
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,240
Wormwood.

151
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Thuja.

152
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,280
Van Gogh.

153
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,880
Obsession.

154
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,600
Yes.

155
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,780
It is indeed quite creepy.

156
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,800
But look at this front tooth.

157
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,120
This tooth

158
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,640
is exactly like yours.

159
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,330
It's not you.

160
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Wait for me!

161
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,400
Officer,

162
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,800
is there something wrong?

163
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,200
Boss.

164
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
Those paintings in the men's restroom,

165
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,200
who brought them here?

166
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,080
These paintings,

167
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,240
they're quite creative.

168
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,970
You can see the artist's skill.

169
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,840
However,

170
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
the style of these paintings

171
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,400
doesn't match our bar's atmosphere.

172
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,360
Customers might find them strange.

173
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm asking who brought them here.

174
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,360
A water delivery worker.

175
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,490
When he comes to deliver water,

176
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,600
he often brings some artworks to sell.

177
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,080
As for who specifically painted them,

178
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,810
I don't know.

179
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,040
They're not authentic anyway,

180
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,840
so who cares?

181
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,480
How many more paintings like these are there?

182
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,880
There are some in the women's restroom too.

183
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,120
Take us to see them.

184
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,650
Let's go.

185
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,280
Dad.

186
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,240
Dad.

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,280
The fingerprints on the paintings are chaotic,

188
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,680
impossible to identify.

189
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,240
I've investigated the surveillance around Paradise Bar,

190
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,200
I've investigated the surveillance around Paradise Bar,

191
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
trying to track

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,640
the water delivery worker's movements.

193
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,560
Unfortunately,

194
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,600
he has a strong anti-surveillance awareness.

195
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,960
Every time he leaves the bar,

196
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,440
he disappears into surveillance blind spots.

197
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,840
We can't see him anymore.

198
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,370
However,

199
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,720
the place where he vanishes

200
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,520
is in the southwestern suburbs,

201
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,840
which is consistent with Yang Ming's assessment.

202
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,080
Did this water delivery worker use the bartender,

203
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,520
or

204
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,100
did he just use his drinks?

205
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,400
That doesn't make sense either.

206
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,200
This kind of drink,

207
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,120
the bartender wouldn't casually tell others about it.

208
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,160
Analysis of surveillance footage shows

209
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,560
this water delivery worker

210
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,620
and this bartender

211
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
had a heated argument a few days ago.

212
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,890
This is someone with a strong desire for revenge.

213
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,610
510128 is just his tool.

214
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,040
From the discovery of the first body,

215
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,480
to the dumping of the second body,

216
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,440
I'm afraid the suspect

217
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,840
deliberately let someone discover and report it,

218
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,160
thus guiding the police

219
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,890
to investigate the bartender.

220
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,340
This series of actions

221
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,450
is all about leading us by the nose.

222
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,400
The key is,

223
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,380
what's the suspect's purpose in doing this?

224
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,930
Why expose the second body,

225
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,210
and why expose themselves?

226
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,450
Lan Jing,

227
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,560
share your thoughts.
