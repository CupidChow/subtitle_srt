Episode 1

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 2

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It seems that it was yesterday

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
that I came to the middle school of the experiment.

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But now,

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
the college entrance examination has urged us to graduate.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Jiang Qiaoxi didn't prepare for the college entrance examination

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
after returning to the school.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I even suspect that

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
the information that her cousin

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
has from the information in the Aosai information,

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
is probably already the range of the college entrance examination.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Because Jiang Qiaoxi's study time is too short,

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and her entrance examination speed is too fast.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No matter what I ask her,

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
she always answers me

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
what kind of question is normal,

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
what is strange,

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
what is used for school, what is used for reading comics.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
She answers me so quickly.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I understand.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Even Qin Yeyun asked her

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
if there was any news of Chen Jinghong's new film.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She would collect it.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's okay to take a picture and send an email.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She was so free and easy to buy magazines.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
She was doing very well at that time.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't think it's strange

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
what Jiang Qiaoxi does.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
When she was in the group business,

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
she was with us,

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
pretending not to know us at the middle school of the experiment.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Then she was with us again.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Now she doesn't send messages.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I tell you, Lin Qi,

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Jiang Qiaoxi is very careful.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
She can do whatever she wants.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can't do anything to her.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So later, Jiang Qiaoxi

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
almost never sends messages to others.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To be honest,

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm not so relieved.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm so relieved.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I like what mom said.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Your Uncle Cai told us

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
that Qiaoxi's study abroad test is very troublesome.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,200
Many of them are the

52
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
school's bad.

53
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
What architecture and psychology

54
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
are all strange subjects.

55
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Maybe she was too busy to talk to others.

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
She can't chat with others.

57
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Later I know

58
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
that Jiang Qiaoxi

59
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
was really in the bad.

60
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
But not the kind of bad

61
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
that we thought was too difficult to pass the test.

62
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
But another

63
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
adult

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
bad.

65
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
What are you looking at?

66
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
How many days has it been down?

67
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
It's all down like this.

68
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Mr. Liang asked me to sell the stock.

69
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
What happened to you?

70
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
I don't understand.

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
How much loss did she lose?

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
How to say

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
It's

74
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
one day one stock.

75
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
So much?

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
What's so urgent

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
that she needs money?

78
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
I don't know.

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
It's urgent.

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
No matter how much you lose, you have to pay first.

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Could it be that Jiang Qiaoxi has an accident?

82
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
I'm back.

83
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
You're back.

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm back.

85
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Uncle Cai.

86
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm in the house again.

87
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
How could you?

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,600
She was talking to me for a few days,

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
and said she wanted to find

90
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
a photo of Cai Fang Yuan and your childhood.

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
What's the photo?

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Here.

93
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
I was so cool when I was young.

94
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
The black is white.

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Was that high?

96
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
No, no, no.

97
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Give a teacup to uncle.

98
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
I forgot it.

99
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Okay.

100
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Right. There's rose tea,

101
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
orange tea and plum wine.

102
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,160
Go to have some tea.

103
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,200
Why drink in the daytime?

104
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,160
Go to have some tea.

105
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,840
Go.

106
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,680
This way.

107
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,480
Okay.

108
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,120
Is it...

109
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,000
I think it's not Jiang Xiaoxi.

110
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,680
If it's her,

111
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,200
President Yang will be so calm.

112
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,040
What do you think?

113
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,960
Right?

114
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,000
Uncle Cai.

115
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,840
Cai Fangyuan has been working hard recently.

116
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,080
He's been working hard at school.

117
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,080
So if he gets lazy at home,

118
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,120
don't scold him.

119
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,400
He has a good topic.

120
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,880
Jiang Xiaoxi will help him with it.

121
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,200
So don't worry.

122
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,240
Okay.

123
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Because I think

124
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,240
Jiang Xiaoxi has been to Hong Kong.

125
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,760
She's almost a prisoner.

126
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,400
She often has a cold and headache.

127
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,120
She keeps talking to me.

128
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,360
I think

129
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,840
she can talk less

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and have more rest.

131
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,360
It's good.

132
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,240
I want to be...

133
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,840
Jiang Xiaoxi is too lazy to talk to others.

134
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,360
But I can always

135
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,880
have the most conversation.

136
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,080
So I never thought

137
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,320
if she doesn't want to talk to me,

138
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,800
what will happen?

139
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,600
I wonder who wrote

140
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,120
the ideal man to be the first wife of the province.

141
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,480
Oh my god.

142
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,240
You can fulfill your dream.

143
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,480
Come on. Time to get off.

144
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,280
Take your ID card and pass the exam.

145
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,240
Jiang Xiaoxi.

146
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,360
You said yesterday that

147
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,560
you would tell me your score after I passed the exam.

148
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,440
Why didn't you tell me?

149
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,280
Jiang Xiaoxi.

150
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,560
Why haven't you replied me?

151
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,520
Did you go to buy food?

152
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,880
You're not in this car.

153
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
What a pity.

154
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,560
We're going to go to Zhouzhou's small restaurant by bus.

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,320
There are too many people this time.

156
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,400
Uncle Cai can't take the bus.

157
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
I will definitely order

158
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,080
your favorite garlic ribs.

159
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,360
I passed the exam.

160
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,840
I finally passed the exam, Jiang Xiaoxi.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Guess if I passed the exam or not.

162
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,360
Jiang Xiaoxi, what about you?

163
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,840
Did you stay in Hongyang

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,560
during your high school career?

165
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,760
It was over

166
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,000
when I moved to Hong Kong.

167
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,360
And I had to go to the school

168
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,720
in the afternoon.

169
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,920
My mom forced me to eat fish congee.

170
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,200
I can't finish it.

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
But my mom said

172
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,960
the rich people are very stubborn.

173
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,160
You must eat the food.

174
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,120
Jiang Xiaoxi.

175
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,840
We will finish the exam tomorrow.

176
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,360
When will you come back?

177
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,320
Yuqiao and Cai Fangyuan said

178
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,000
they want to have fun on summer vacation.

179
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,320
Will you come back and play with us?

180
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,200
What are we singing?

181
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,080
Everything is real.

182
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,720
What we are singing is real.

183
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,560
What are you saying?

184
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,320
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:17,800
Okay.

186
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,600
I'm sorry.

187
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,120
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,800
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,080
The moon is always warm.

190
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,720
What are we singing?

191
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,560
Everything is real.

192
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,160
Love is real.

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,600
Love is real.

194
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,560
Love is real.

195
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,840
Love is real.

196
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,280
Love is real.

197
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,240
Love is real.

198
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,960
Love is real.

199
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,640
Love is real.

200
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,600
Love is real.

201
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
Love is real.

202
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
Love is real.

203
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,040
Love is real.

204
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,520
You have finished the exam.

205
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,720
Go to start your college career.

206
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,600
Your life is endless.

207
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,320
Jiang Xiaoxi is back.

208
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,240
Jiang Xiaoxi is back.

209
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,840
Look.

210
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
Jiang Xiaoxi is back.

211
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,600
She is back.

212
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,280
Yes.

213
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,920
Okay.

214
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,360
I'll call her.

215
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,560
I want to tell her

216
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
we are eating spicy food here.

217
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,640
There is nothing in Hong Kong.

218
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,240
We are eating in Hong Kong.

219
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,800
Take your time.

220
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,120
You should eat.

221
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,360
Eat first.

222
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,120
The food is cold.

223
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,720
Yin Tao.

224
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
The food is cold.

225
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,280
Hello.

226
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,440
The number you dialed is currently unavailable.

227
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,000
Please try again later.

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,760
Sorry.

229
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,520
The subscriber you dialed is not available.

230
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,280
Please dial again later.

231
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,160
Are there any frich and foods left?

232
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,400
Your service is here.

233
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,240
Okay.

234
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,040
Keep eating.

235
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,600
Keep eating.

236
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,760
Eat first.

237
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,200
Eat first.

238
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,720
Look.

239
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,560
Would you like some sweet soup?

240
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,920
I have left a sweet soup set for you.

241
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,720
The same as regular meal.

242
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,400
You can pay for it.

243
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:03,860
Okay.

244
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,360
I'll be sick soon.

245
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,160
Yun Tao, are you not full yet?

246
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
You're full.

247
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,160
I'm having a mouthful.

248
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Yun Tao,

249
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,560
why are you squatting here in the middle of the night?

250
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,760
Come on, go home with me.

251
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,560
Sit down for a while.

252
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,960
No need, Mrs. Jia.

253
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,960
I'm waiting for Auntie Liang and Uncle Jiang.

254
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,160
Xiao Jiang?

255
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,960
Their family moved out.

256
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,760
They don't live here anymore.

257
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,760
Moved out?

258
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,560
What do you mean by moved out?

259
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,960
Xiao Liang seems to have gone abroad to work.

260
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,960
He said to earn more money and pay more.

261
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,760
Then Xiao Jiang moved out.

262
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,960
He doesn't live here anymore.

263
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
He's not here anymore.

264
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
He's not here anymore.

265
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
He's not here anymore.

266
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
They moved out.

267
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
They don't live here anymore.

268
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,760
They don't live here anymore?

269
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,760
How can that be?

270
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,160
If Jiang Nanxun comes back,

271
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,560
he'll have no home.

272
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,160
The house hasn't been sold yet.

273
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,360
Look at that kid.

274
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,560
He'll come back.

275
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,360
I'm going to the White House tomorrow to pack up.

276
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,760
Do you want to come with me?

277
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,160
No need.

278
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,560
Okay.

279
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,160
See you at the hotel tomorrow.

280
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,160
That day, I saw you in the clothes of the team.

281
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,760
You wore it from the playground.

282
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,360
I was shocked.

283
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
I didn't expect that

284
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
our school

285
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,560
has a team that looks like a team.

286
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
You're not like you anymore.

287
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,760
But you're like a new you.

288
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,560
A new me?

289
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,960
Is it because I wore clothes that day?

290
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
No.

291
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,360
When we were in Qunshan High School,

292
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,760
you didn't talk much in the first three years.

293
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,360
You didn't participate in the class.

294
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,160
You left right after school.

295
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,560
I thought you were introverted.

296
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,360
You always had no expression.

297
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,960
Just like Lu Xueqi.

298
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,560
Did you write too many novels

299
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,760
to look like a character?

300
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Later, I realized I was wrong.

301
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,760
You're not like that.

302
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,160
You in the first year of the experiment

303
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,560
is a new you.

304
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Or you in Qunshan High School

305
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,160
is a new you.

306
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,160
You're a new you.

307
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
You're a new you.

308
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
You are a new you.

309
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,960
You're a new you.

310
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,760
You're a new you.

311
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,760
You're a new you.

312
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,360
What's the difference

313
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,760
between a normal classroom

314
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,160
and this classroom?

315
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,560
Whether it's me or Jiang Qiaoxi

316
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,160
or everyone in this class,

317
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,160
we're no different from a normal human.

318
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,160
You've already done your cleaning, right?

319
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Yes, I've done it.

320
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Lin Qi Le.

321
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Brother Song.

322
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Can you look at me?

323
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,160
What do you mean?

324
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
We've just finished the college entrance examination.

325
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
The college entrance examination is over.

327
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Even if you're a college student,

328
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
in the days of the college entrance examination,

329
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
I've always had another countdown in my heart.

330
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
I've been waiting

331
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,160
to tell you my feelings at this time.

332
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
I hope to have a closer relationship with you

333
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
than in the sixth year of high school.

334
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Are you willing?

335
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,160
The cat and I are on the road.

336
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Monitor.

337
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
I'm sorry.

338
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Lin Qi Le.

339
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
You're not sorry for me.

340
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
I'm sorry for you.

341
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
I know your answer.

342
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
I have to ask you this question.

343
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
I must have made you feel uncomfortable.

344
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
But

345
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
you're here today

346
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
not to help me clean up, right?

347
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
You know.

348
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
I've known it long ago.

349
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
You want to take a look

350
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
at the location of Jiang Xiao Xi in this classroom, right?

351
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
Jiang Xiao Xi's location is there.

352
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
I've been thinking

353
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
that after May,

354
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
she'll come back to get these things.

355
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
You can take them back first.

356
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
I know.

357
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Jiang Xiao Xi.

358
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
That kind of natural mind and natural luck.

359
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
What can I compete with her?

360
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
What can I win with her?

361
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
She's not lucky.

362
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
She's hard-working.

363
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
She's not a woman.

364
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
She's just like a woman.

365
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
She's not like a woman.

366
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
She's not like a woman.

367
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
She's just like a woman.

368
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
It's been hard for her to come to this point.

369
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Is it heavy?

370
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Do you need me to help you?

371
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
No, I can do it myself.

372
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Ning Tao.

373
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
You don't have to worry.

374
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
She'll definitely come back.

375
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
A junior called Qi Le told me before

376
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
that they were very tired from the OZ.

377
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
They were doing the exam.

378
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
Some came out of the exam hall

379
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
and stayed outside until midnight.

380
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Some just didn't go back.

381
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
They went to the tourist attraction to relax.

382
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
But Jiang Xiao Xi doesn't know how.

383
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
She only calls you.

384
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
She's a man of her word.

385
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,160
She calls you every day after the exam and every game.

386
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
She's not a man at all.

387
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
How can I say that?

388
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
She's very selfish and crazy.

389
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
So don't worry.

390
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
She's going to school.

391
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
And I can't guarantee that

392
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,160
she'll be the first one to come back to you.

393
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
I'm sorry.

394
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
I'm sorry.

395
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
I'm sorry.

396
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
I'm sorry.

397
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
I'm sorry.

398
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
I'm sorry.

399
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
I'm sorry.

400
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
I'm sorry.

407
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
I'm sorry.

408
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
I'm sorry.

409
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
I'm sorry.

412
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
I'm sorry.

413
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
I'm sorry.

414
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
I'm sorry.

415
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
I'm sorry.

416
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
I'm sorry.

417
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
I'm sorry.

418
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
I'm sorry.

419
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,160
I'm sorry.

420
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,160
I'm sorry.

421
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,160
I'm sorry.

422
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
No.

423
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
I'm sorry.

424
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
No.

425
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
I'm sorry.

426
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Sorry, I'm sorry.

427
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
No.

428
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
No.

429
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

430
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
No.

431
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
No.

432
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

433
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
Sorry.

434
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,160
My love is even superior to Sc norm's

435
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
songs.

436
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
No.

437
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,160
No.

438
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
Sorry.

440
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Yichun.

441
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,440
I will be home soon.

442
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,580
I have to throw automatic

443
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,680
Want to try

444
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,960
Ming Tao.

446
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,840
What are you talking about?

447
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,520
You went back to your home.

448
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,880
Why are you acting like a thief?

449
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,120
Are you leaving your home again?

450
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,800
I hate it.

451
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,880
What do you think?

452
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,920
I mean Ming Tao.

453
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,480
I think...

454
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,320
I think

455
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,880
that...

456
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,840
you're here to see me.

457
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
should own you

458
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,600
and get the happiness

459
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Luo Fewiao

460
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,520
And

461
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,080
Miao Etian

462
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,080
line

463
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,720
yeah

464
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
I'm not going to study abroad

465
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:46,960
I want

466
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,480
Stay here

467
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,280
Stay here to accompany you

468
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
You don't study abroad

469
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,560
Your phone line must be cut off.

470
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,120
My heart must be broken again, right?

471
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,400
Jiang Xiaoxi.

472
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,600
You won't leave me on your own, right?

473
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,240
Of course.

474
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,760
I'm doing well in Hong Kong.

475
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,680
Tan Ge is doing well too.

476
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,320
She has a daughter.

477
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,200
I'm doing well in Hong Kong.

478
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,640
You know that.

479
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,560
I can always get a high score.

480
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,520
I can choose any university.

481
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,480
But I don't want to choose any.

482
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,440
Because those places

483
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,160
don't have your Lin Yintang.

484
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,400
And they don't have your aunt's breakfast.

485
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,160
I want...

486
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
I want to stay.

487
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,600
It's good that you don't go to study abroad.

488
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,840
It's so good to have you by my side.

489
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,920
Every time I take you to a place,

490
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,640
it's the best place.

491
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,760
Did you see me text you?

492
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,040
Did you know that I got a high score?

493
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,600
I know.

494
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,880
I'm a northeastern student.

495
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,000
I didn't expect you to get such a good score.

496
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,760
Well,

497
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,480
based on your Aosai score,

498
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,920
you can go to any university in Hongyang.

499
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,560
You know that

500
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,080
the best schools are close to the northeastern school.

501
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,600
I know.

502
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,600
I...

503
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,160
I'll choose a school

504
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,040
that's the closest to your school.

505
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,360
By then,

506
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,360
we can go to school together

507
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,840
and go to the canteen together.

508
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,120
And then we can be together every day.

509
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,760
Are you telling the truth?

510
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,440
Can we really

511
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,480
be together every day?

512
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,440
Of course.

513
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,080
When did I lie to you?

514
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,840
You...

515
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,840
You did.

516
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,840
You can do as much as you want.

517
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,160
But why

518
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,400
do I feel like crying

519
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,760
when you said that?

520
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,200
It's OK.

521
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
I think

522
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,080
I just feel

523
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,880
that I can see

524
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,160
a bright future

525
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,840
and feel happy.

526
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,600
I want evidence.

527
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,000
What evidence?

528
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,200
I'm worried about

529
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
that Si Tu won't be able to

530
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,800
have sex once I help her.

531
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,960
Why?

532
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,960
Why must I?

533
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
I can't bite his based on what I've shared

534
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,960
so I cannot get emotional.

535
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,760
An offer that planned by you

536
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,400
will bring me folk.

537
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,840
From now on,

538
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,880
Li Tao

539
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,360
Don't forget about my genteel

540
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,240
Li Tao

541
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,160
I want to eat

542
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,600
the food that your mother made.

543
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,640
You're so lucky.

544
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,520
My mother has

545
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,920
comforted me.

546
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,320
Let's go back and eat.

547
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,960
Jiang Xiaoxi.

548
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,600
Jiang Xiaoxi.

549
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,920
Jiang Xiaoxi.

550
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
Jiang Xiaoxi.

551
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,480
Wei Lai.

552
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,880
We've been together

553
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,560
for a long time.

554
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,680
Can you dress

555
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,520
more brightly?

556
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,760
Don't be so grey, okay?

557
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,840
Every time you wear

558
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,920
bright colors,

559
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,360
I feel happy.

560
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,640
You're happy too.

561
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,800
I look good in bright colors.

562
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,560
You do.

563
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,680
You do.

564
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:50,960
Okay.

565
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,040
I'll come out later.

566
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,840
Jiang Xiaoxi.

567
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Jiang Xiaoxi.

568
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,440
Jiang Xiaoxi.

569
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,920
Yinggang.

570
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,060
Lord changes

571
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,960
his persona.

572
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,680
Don't you think

573
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,120
there might be something lacking?

574
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,480
What's missing?

575
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,000
A suitcase.

576
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:45,840
Right.

577
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,280
Will I be taken away?

578
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,760
How about this?

579
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,560
Well,

580
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,320
go upstairs and get some steamed buns.

581
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,760
I'll get the suitcase.

582
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,840
When I come back,

583
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,960
I can eat something.

584
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,480
Okay.

585
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,560
Go.

586
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,600
Jiang Xiaoxi,

587
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,840
when you go upstairs and see my parents,

588
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,960
just tell them

589
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,760
you met me on the way.

590
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,120
I'm warning you.

591
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,160
Don't talk nonsense.

592
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:29,880
Okay.

593
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,120
I won't talk nonsense.

594
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,280
Jiang Xiaoxi.

595
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,480
I...

596
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,680
What's wrong?

597
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,800
I like you.

598
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,600
I like you very much.

599
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,080
Eat.

600
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,680
I love you.

601
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,680
What's wrong?

602
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,800
Who's that?

603
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,320
Who's that?

604
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,600
It's me.

605
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,680
Didn't you bring the key?

606
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,280
I forgot.

607
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,160
What are you doing?

608
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,280
I'm heating the steamed buns.

609
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,160
Jiang Xiaoxi is hungry.

610
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,920
She wants to eat.

611
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,480
Qiao Xin?

612
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,080
Yes.

613
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,120
Qiao Xin is back?

614
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,640
I...

615
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
I passed by her door.

616
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,640
I saw her

617
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,240
coming out of the house.

618
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,320
She's going home to get her luggage.

619
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
She'll be here soon.

620
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,480
Is it not so real?

621
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,000
Okay.

622
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,880
Let me do it.

623
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,000
Wait for me.

624
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,120
What are you doing?

625
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,200
I'm opening it.

626
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:46,920
Don't open it.

627
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,160
Later,

628
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,840
I'll fry it in the pan for you.

629
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,680
Don't pour it like this.

630
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,520
Don't worry.

631
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,520
I'll do it later.

632
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,760
Okay.

633
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,760
Come.

634
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,160
What are you doing, Yun Tao?

635
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,520
I...

636
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,680
why hasn't she come yet?

637
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,760
Who?

638
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,320
Jiang Xiaoxi.

639
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,120
I don't know him.

640
00:35:51,840 --> 00:36:00,080
ventional

641
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,560
but it doesn't matter that you step on it first

642
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,680
I believe you

643
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,900
Hello

644
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,120
The number you dial is currently not reachable

645
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,840
fruit

646
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,040
Please redialoup later

647
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,540
Where are you going

648
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,080
I just got back. Why are you out

649
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,040
Maple

650
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,020
Maple

651
00:36:44,280 --> 00:37:10,720
tell you

652
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
Jiang Qiao Xi!

653
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,280
If dreams don't leave a trace

654
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,280
I wish I could see a black boy with a hat

655
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
and a suitcase

656
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
and hit him in the door with a taxi

657
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
and go that way

658
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
Who is it?

659
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
Jiang Qiao Xi!

660
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
The color of the night is gentle

661
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
You walk away in the corner

662
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
The heart is silent

663
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
The night falls

664
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
We are in the same boat

665
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
Jiang Qiao Xi!

666
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,280
The ship is sinking

667
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,280
In the sea of love

668
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,280
You're the reason I still want

669
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,280
To hold you

670
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,280
I'm ready to go

671
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,280
I turn around and look at you

672
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
I smile and say I love you

673
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,280
You're the reason I still shine

674
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
Say it

675
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
Jiang Qiao Xi!

676
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,280
The sky is so deep

677
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:52,280
When I see you in my dream

678
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
Jiang Qiao Xi!

679
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
The night falls

680
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,280
We are in the same boat

681
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,280
The sky is so deep

682
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,280
When I see you in my dream

683
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,280
Jiang Qiao Xi!

684
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
Jiang Qiao Xi!

685
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,280
When I see you in my dream

686
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,280
I'm ready to go

687
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
The color of the night is gentle

688
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
You walk away in the corner

689
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
The heart is silent

690
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
The night falls

691
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
We are in the same boat

692
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,280
The sky is so deep

693
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,280
When I see you in my dream

694
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,280
You're the reason I still want

695
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
To hold you

696
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,280
I'm ready to go

697
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,280
I'm ready to go

698
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,280
You're the reason I still want

699
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,280
You're the reason I still shine

700
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,280
When I see you in my dream

701
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,280
I'm ready to go

702
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Say it

703
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,280
You're the reason I still find

704
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
The heart is silent

705
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
The night falls

706
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
We are in the same boat

707
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
The sky is so deep

708
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,280
When I see you in my dream

709
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,280
You're the reason I still want

710
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,280
To hold you

711
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,280
I'm ready to go

712
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,280
You're the reason I still want

713
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
To hold you

714
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
I'm ready to go

715
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
You're the reason I still find

716
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
I'm ready to go

717
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,280
You're the reason I still find

718
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
The heart is silent

719
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,280
The night falls

720
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,280
We are in the same boat

721
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
The sky is so deep

722
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,280
When I see you in my dream

723
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
You're the reason I still want

724
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
To hold you

725
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
I'm ready to go

726
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
You're the reason I still find

727
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,280
The heart is silent

728
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,280
The night falls

729
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
We are in the same boat

730
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
You're so cute

731
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Your carp is so cute

732
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,280
It's like a carp crossing the dragon gate

733
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
I've learned this dish

734
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
I just want to wait for the kids to go to college

735
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,280
I'll show you

736
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,280
You're so good

737
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,280
I feel like they're still kids

738
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,280
All of their major is in college

739
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
I didn't like studying when I was a kid

740
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
I played all day

741
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
I was afraid at that time

742
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Can you go to college when you grow up?

743
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280
Don't be afraid now

744
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,280
The score of Eagle is the highest

745
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,280
Among these kids

746
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,280
It's more than 17 points higher than our fish bridge

747
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,280
And Du Shang

748
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,280
He used to be a small one

749
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
He's still practicing dance every day

750
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
Now he's in medical school

751
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
He'll be a doctor in the future

752
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
The kid is also at ease

753
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,280
Suitable for being a doctor

754
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
I'm going to see a doctor in the future

755
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
What kind of disease is it?

756
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
We're thinking about something good

757
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,280
I'm thinking about going to the bridge together

758
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,280
Drive a plane

759
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,280
Northern Airlines Flight Academy

760
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,280
How difficult is it?

761
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,280
He said he would get it

762
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,280
All of us kids are working hard

763
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Yes

764
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,280
Isn't Fang Yuan the boss of your family?

765
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,280
Don't say yesterday

766
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
His dad and I took him to the mall

767
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
Want to buy him something to study

768
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
He's pretty good

769
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,280
Take his own money

770
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,280
Bought a suit for me and his dad

771
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,280
Really?

772
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,280
That's great

773
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,280
You said that

774
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,280
Your Fang Yuan always gets angry with you

775
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,280
What do you do?

776
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,280
Look at him now

777
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Make your own network

778
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,280
And made such a big name

779
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,280
Yes

780
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,280
Your Fang Yuan is so proud

781
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,280
Yes

782
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,280
This kid is just not talented in studying

783
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,280
But he can get into Shanghai's second grade

784
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
I'm satisfied

785
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,280
Can still be a partner with Du Shang

786
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,280
Eagle and fish bridge

787
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
Can also take care of each other in the breeding

788
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
It's Yunyuan

789
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,160
Obviously can go to the

790
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,280
Breeding

791
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
Must stay at home alone

792
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,280
That girl is sensible

793
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,280
Just want to get close to her dad

794
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,280
Still good girl

795
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,280
Kind

796
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,280
Not like a son

797
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,280
Our Cai Fang Yuan

798
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,280
Dream and say dreams

799
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,280
I want to go to Shanghai

800
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
Juan

801
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,280
How is the eagle and fish bridge?

802
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,280
It looks okay on the surface

803
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,280
But the ideas are all in the heart

804
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,280
Yesterday he also told me

805
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
Go to Hongyang

806
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,280
Don't let me and his dad

807
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,280
Send him to go by himself

808
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,280
I don't know what he's thinking

809
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,280
This is not like the eagle and fish bridge

810
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,280
I want to go to Shanghai

811
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
Don't let me and my dad

812
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,280
Send him to go by himself

813
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,280
I don't know what he's thinking

814
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,280
This is not like the eagle and fish bridge

815
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
Don't let me and my dad

816
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,280
Send him to go by himself

817
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,280
I don't know what he's thinking

818
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,280
This is not like the eagle and fish bridge

819
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,280
Don't let me and my dad

820
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,280
Send him to go by himself

821
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,280
I don't know what he's thinking

822
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,280
This is not like the eagle and fish bridge

823
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,280
Don't let me and my dad

824
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,280
Send him to go by himself

825
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,280
I don't know what he's thinking

826
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,280
This is not like the eagle and fish bridge

827
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,280
Don't let me and my dad

828
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,280
Send him to go by himself

829
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
I don't know what he's thinking

830
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,280
This is not like the eagle and fish bridge

831
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,280
Don't let me and my dad

832
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,280
Send him to go by himself

833
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,280
I don't know what he's thinking

834
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,280
This is not like the eagle and fish bridge

835
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,280
Don't let me and my dad

836
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,280
Send him to go by himself

837
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,280
I don't know what he's thinking

838
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:21,280
In the cloud, looking far away

839
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,280
Once in a dream

840
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,280
I smell

841
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,280
Like the white night sky in the morning

842
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,280
My fragrance

843
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,280
Pass through the darkness

844
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,280
The extraordinary power

845
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,280
My dream

846
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,280
I want to release

847
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
I want to let you see

848
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,280
My heart's shining lights

849
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,280
I want to sing

850
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,280
I want to sing for you

851
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,280
I want to forget the loneliness and the confusion

852
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,280
I want to forget

853
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,280
I want to forget the usual growth

854
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,280
I want to forget the usual growth

855
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
In the cloud

856
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,280
In the sky

857
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,280
Far away
