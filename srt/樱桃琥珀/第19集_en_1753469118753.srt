Episode 1

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 2

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
If you don't want to say it, I won't ask.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Do you think that you are like this now

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
because Ying Tao can't be with you?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's me.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What?

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The reason why I can't be with Ying Tao.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You think

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
you can't get out of this situation

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
so you can't be with Ying Tao.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Then how long do you want Ying Tao to wait for you?

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Wait ten years?

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Twenty years?

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wait until you think you can finally find Ying Tao.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Ying Tao is married.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
She has a child.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What are you going to do?

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You have to wish Ying Tao happiness.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You have to tell her in secret.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Actually, you always love her.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Jiang Cheng Xi.

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't you think the script you wrote

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
is very boring

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and narcissistic?

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yu Qiao.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Actually, sometimes

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I really envy you.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You should envy me

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
because I believe Ying Tao more than you.

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I also know more about Ying Tao.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Please don't tell Ying Tao

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
that I'm here.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why should I tell Ying Tao?

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What good is it to me?

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Then why are you looking for me?

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm looking for you

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
because you are my friend

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and the person Ying Tao likes.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You disappeared without saying anything.

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm also worried about you.

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But now I see you're fine,

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm relieved.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
for making you worry.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But I really

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
don't know

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
what else I can do.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I accept your apology.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
after I go back,

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I will tell Ying Tao that I like her.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You locked your heart

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
in the cloud

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You didn't leave any traces

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
in your dream

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We're so small

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
that we can't fly over our fingers

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But I'm willing

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to give up my light and fly into the stars

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm willing to give up my light and fly into the stars

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
for you

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The night is gentle

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You pretend to walk away

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Your hands are warm

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
and your breath is soft

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We are in a rush

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We go through the cycle

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and follow you

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're the reason I stop and

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
doubt

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm in the unknown land

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I turn around and see you

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You know, the one next to you

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
spent all the money

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
and his son took him home.

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't worry.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I won't waste your money.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You misunderstood me, young man.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I didn't mean that.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He's not good.

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Although he looks the same,

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
he saves money every day

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and works hard.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He says he will find you

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
no matter where you are.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do you think

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
you're the reason

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
why Ying Tao can't be with you?

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
How long do you want Ying Tao to wait for you?

97
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Ten years? Twenty years?

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Ying Tao is married

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and has a child.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You want to marry him?

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You want to marry him?

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You have a child?

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You want to live a happy life with Ying Tao?

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Tell him in your heart

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
that you love him all the time.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Be careful.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Are you tired?

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Go home and have a rest.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Is there something on your mind?

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I just think

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Tang can be a good man.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He can take care of my brother

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
for so long.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What's so great about that?

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
When something like this happens,

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
everyone will do it.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're not always with him, are you?

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm his brother.

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I should do this.

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I should do this.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I should do this.

123
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's not just about the time.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Go home and have a rest.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hurry up.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Go home and have a rest.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll go first.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I want to...

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll buy you some food.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Your favorite food is fish.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll cook it for you.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're so excited.

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm afraid

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll have something to eat

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
after I have been eating for years.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm afraid

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll get used to it

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
after I get better.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll have some chicken soup.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It hurts.

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're so funny.

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're not studying, Senior?

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm a senior.

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Of course I'm here to see you study.

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Study hard.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I haven't seen you study

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
so much in college.

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Then why is your class

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the only one that gives you a certificate of honor?

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Do you really want to know why?

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's because

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
you're too smart

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
to learn it.

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Really.

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You can't even study when you're older.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Today is the day off.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Why hasn't Fei Yuan and Xiao Shuai

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
arrived yet?

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Are you two fighting?

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why would I fight with him?

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He must be busy.

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And I've been

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
teaching him at home.

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We don't have to eat every week.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's not good.

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We have to maintain it.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Maintain what?

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Maintain what?

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Isn't it good

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
to be busy at home?

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's not good.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What should we do?

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're the only one

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
who's going to be left behind.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm worried about you.

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Senior,

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I know why you're insured.

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're ranked according to your words.

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Look, I'm insured.

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't be angry.

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm doing it for you.

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What's wrong?

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Why are you looking at your phone?

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Nothing.

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Geniuses always need some fun.

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Ying Tao,

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm waiting for you

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
at your school's grocery store.

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Come out.

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Come out.

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Help me return it.

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I have something to do.

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Where are you going?

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll go with you.

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yu Qiao.

197
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why are you so tired?

198
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You haven't slept for a long time.

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Ying Tao,

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
go buy me a bottle of water.

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Ying Tao.

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Use my money.

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Just a bottle of water.

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You even asked me to buy this.

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No.

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Buy it for me.

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Okay.

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Wait for me.

209
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll go with you.

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Ying Tao,

211
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I found Jiang Qiao Xi.

212
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I know where she is.

213
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
She lives at the rich manor.

214
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
When you arrive in Hong Kong,

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
you'll be able to see her.

216
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll go with you.

217
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll go with you.

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll go with you.

219
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll go with you.

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll go with you.

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll go with you.

222
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
When you arrive in Hong Kong,

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
remember to take the full-turn line to the central area.

224
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Get off at Jin Zhong station.

225
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Then change to the Hong Kong-island line in the Chai Wan direction.

226
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Then take the A-line at the back of the station.

227
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Then take the new line at the bus stop on the Ying Huang Road.

228
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Then you'll be able to reach the rich manor.

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
She lives at 1501.

230
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Of course,

231
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
if you can't remember so many lines,

232
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
you can just take a taxi.

233
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're going to Hong Kong?

234
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Ming Tao.

235
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I won't have time to eat with you anymore.

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We're going to Canada on our third day of the third year of college.

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I have to prepare for the exam.

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I have to prepare for the interview at the aviation school.

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I won't have time to see you anymore.

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You have to take good care of yourself.

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yu Xiang.

242
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yu Xiang.

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You don't want your wallet anymore?

244
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll leave it to you.

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Just treat it as a sponsor for you to go to Hong Kong.

246
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You want me to owe you a favor.

247
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't want it.

248
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Ming Tao.

249
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Do you know that I've done the worst thing

250
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
in my life?

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What?

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
When I knew about the news of the scholarship,

253
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I didn't tell you at once.

254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yu Xiang.

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Thank you.

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Thank you.

257
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Ming Tao.

258
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're going to Hong Kong.

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Have a safe trip.

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Thank you.

261
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm going to Hong Kong.

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'll bring you a pack of sunglasses.

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Madam Lwa!

264
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well,

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
disappu같.

266
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Hey,

267
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
andi 들 Plaza!

268
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The building on the ground ones us.

269
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Hold on a minute.

270
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Now that you've been name it as a charity Movement,

271
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
you think money is the solution?

272
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,160
this is again...

273
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
Brother Yan,

274
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,800
has it been easy for you

275
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,000
Great Tapir to live in Hong Kong?

276
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,000
Wow,

277
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,240
the apartment in Shui Security.

278
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,000
Creammond is smaller

279
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,000
than a rat nest in here now.

280
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,840
Don't ever say things like this

281
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,120
I don't think so.

282
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,840
Why?

283
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,080
It's not the first day

284
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
you know I have a building.

285
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,840
It's not the first day

286
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,840
you know you have to pay me.

287
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,440
Vincent.

288
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,040
What's your friend

289
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,080
like?

290
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,200
You look weird

291
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,400
when he comes.

292
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,000
He's a

293
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,240
man who looks like me.

294
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,640
Not like you.

295
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,920
You're tall and handsome.

296
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,720
What I expect from him

297
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,840
is the same.

298
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,240
But he still has a chance.

299
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I don't have a chance.

300
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,440
Why do you say that?

301
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't know.

302
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,760
What's wrong with you?

303
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,640
I used to think

304
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,000
life is like a cage.

305
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,000
For my freedom,

306
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,920
for the people I love,

307
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,480
I've been looking for the key to the cage.

308
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,280
At that time, I thought

309
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,840
I was smart enough

310
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,440
to open every cage.

311
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,360
But now I realize

312
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,360
in this world,

313
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,040
there are only those cages

314
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,960
that you can see

315
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,120
and those that you can't see.

316
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,440
In front of these cages,

317
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,560
I'm so stupid.

318
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,520
The man I love

319
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,480
can't get trapped

320
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,960
down into these cages like me.

321
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,640
You

322
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,880
usually

323
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,000
don't say anything.

324
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,200
Now you have a high speech

325
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,440
and speak symptoms another time.

326
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,240
My head isssa cak,

327
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,040
after hearing this for times.

328
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,200
Some cage

329
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,120
doesn't matter

330
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,960
whether you like something

331
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,120
or have feelings for it.

332
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,480
some cage doesn't matter

333
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
It's enough to have you as a good friend.

334
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
Don't make it so hard.

335
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Maybe the girl will come to you tomorrow.

336
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
What? You don't believe it?

337
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
I don't believe it.

338
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
I just think

339
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
she shouldn't see us like this.

340
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,480
I don't want her to see it either.

341
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Don't worry.

342
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
You're a different style

343
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,480
when you're down.

344
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Just like a dog in the water.

345
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
Many women like you.

346
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
You're so annoying.

347
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
You just got your driver's license this morning.

348
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
You're leaving this afternoon.

349
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Why are you in such a hurry?

350
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
If I don't go,

351
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
what if he suddenly goes to

352
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
California, London,

353
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Spain, and Jiangsu?

354
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
I'll take a few years' flight to Jiangsu.

355
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Luckily, it's Hong Kong.

356
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
It's a little closer.

357
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Oh my god.

358
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
You think you're getting a discount?

359
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Have you ever heard of a word called angry?

360
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
Why should I be angry?

361
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Why should you be angry?

362
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
He suddenly disappeared from the world.

363
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Let a girl like you go to him.

364
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,480
You should be asking for trouble.

365
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Why are you still happy here?

366
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
I'm happy to find him

367
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,480
and see him.

368
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,480
I'll talk to you when I see him.

369
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
I don't understand.

370
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,480
You said you were a princess.

371
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
You have to do it.

372
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
I'm not a princess.

373
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,480
He's a princess.

374
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Every woman is trapped in a high tower.

375
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
She asked me to save her.

376
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,480
I should say you're a princess.

377
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Or you're not going to eat or beat?

378
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
I'll do it.

379
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
I hope you have a good trip.

380
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480

Jiang Qiaoxi?

577
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
Yes.

578
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,160
It's him. Jiang Qiaoxi. You know him.

579
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
I just told this Ah Luo.

580
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,160
So many girls came to find Jiang Qiaoxi.

581
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,160
But I won't let any of them in.

582
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
No.

583
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
But I...

584
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Do you want to come in?

585
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,160
This way.

586
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Be careful.

587
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,160
Thank you.

588
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
This way.

589
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Be careful.

590
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Thank you.

591
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
This way.

592
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
This way.

593
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
I'll rent it to him.

594
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
Actually,

595
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
I've seen you before.

596
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
You'll know when you get in.

597
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Thank you.

598
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
You're welcome.

599
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
Thank you.

600
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,160
Thank you.

601
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Brother.

602
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
The goods are all out.

603
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
It's a big problem.

604
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Okay.

605
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Let's go.

606
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,160
Hey.

607
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
I'll be back.

608
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Wait.

609
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
I'm coming.

610
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
I can't hold it.

611
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
I'll hold it for you.

612
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Stop.

613
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Brother, what's wrong?

614
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
I'll lend you a room to watch a big movie.

615
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,160
A big movie?

616
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I'll be back.

617
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
I'll be back.

618
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,160
My memories are floating in the air.

619
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,160
Passing through the window of time.

620
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,160
The shade of summer is still bright.

621
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
I'm looking far away.

622
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,160
The wishes I didn't say that year.

623
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,160
The shadow of familiar is getting longer.

624
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,160
Your outline is so gentle beyond my sight.

625
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,160
The world is turning.

626
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,160
The breeze is in my mind.

627
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,160
The scenery in the window.

628
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Like yesterday, it's clear.

629
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
The reality is in front of me.

630
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,160
The future is in my hands.

631
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:26,160
You're the key to who I am.

632
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Be with me and become myself.

633
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,160
The sky is long.

634
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,160
My stubbornness grows wild.

635
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
I can't stop running.

636
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,160
The dream of the past is calling.

637
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:49,160
You're the key to all I dream.

638
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Be with you and become yourself.

639
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,160
The story is growing.

640
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,160
Loneliness will be melted by the embrace.

641
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,160
I'm always here.

642
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,160
The world is turning.

643
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,160
The breeze is in my mind.

644
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,160
The dream of the past is calling.

645
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,160
The scenery in the window.

646
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:49,160
The reality is in my hands.

647
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:54,160
You're the key to who I am.

648
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:00,160
Be with me and become myself.

649
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,160
The sky is long.

650
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,160
My stubbornness grows wild.

651
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
I can't stop running.

652
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,160
The dream of the past is calling.

653
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,160
You're the spark in all my dream.

654
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,160
Be with you and become yourself.

655
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,160
The story is growing.

656
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,160
Loneliness will be melted by the embrace.

657
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,160
I'm always here.

658
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I'm always here.

659
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,160
I'm always here.

660
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,160
I'm always here.

661
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,160
Vincent, you didn't go after the moon?

662
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
The moon is here to see you.

663
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Stop watching TV shows at night.

664
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,160
I'm sorry.

665
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
You're crazy.

666
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
Are you crazy?

667
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,160
Did you see the moon?

668
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,160
Why did you use Cantonese?

669
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,160
I'm afraid you can't understand.

670
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
You're crazy.

671
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,160
I've been helping you to block so many girls.

672
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,160
You're not even thankful.

673
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
You're now using a chance to scold me?

674
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
I'm just letting you go.

675
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,160
I've seen many girls in your room.

676
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
Stop it.

677
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,160
Captain.

678
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,160
She's a pretty girl.

679
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Vincent, you're so sweet.

680
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
Brother.

681
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,160
Why didn't you call me?

682
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Shut up.

683
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
It's none of your business.

684
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Qiao Qiao Xin.

685
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Is it you?

686
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,160
My outdoor elevator is broken.

687
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,160
You stay here and give me a night.

688
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,160
I'll stay at the beach.

689
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
I'll buy a ticket tomorrow

690
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
to go back with you for dinner.

691
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,160
I'm not coming to Hong Kong

692
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
to have dinner with you.

693
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
It's okay.

694
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
I'll book a hotel for you

695
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
a few more days in Hong Kong.

696
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
You'll like

697
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
Disneyland and the beach park.

698
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
I don't want to go to Disneyland

699
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
or the beach park.

700
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,160
I came to Hong Kong because you're here.

701
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,160
Qiao Qiao Xin.

702
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
You told me not to forget you.

703
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,160
I have a new life now.

704
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Your new life

705
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
is to have little contact

706
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
with the past.

707
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
So,

708
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,160
the past includes me, right?

709
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Yes.

710
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,160
I'm doing well now.

711
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,160
I'm living my life seriously.

712
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,160
You're the same, Ning Tao.

713
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Why did you tell me

714
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
what happened in the future?

715
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,160
Why did you tell me not to forget you?

716
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Then you left.

717
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
You didn't contact me at all.

718
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,160
I don't need you, Ning Tao.

719
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
What do you mean?

720
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
You're hiding in my room.

721
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160
Do you think you can

722
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
do this, Qiao Qiao Xin?

723
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
Why do you always

724
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,160
want to lock yourself up?

725
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Every time you encounter

726
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,160
something bad,

727
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
you're stuck in the corner

728
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
and stubborn.

729
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
You always make your own decisions

730
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
and want us

731
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,160
to follow your decisions.

732
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
I've tried my best

733
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,160
to understand why I'm here.

734
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
I won't leave.

735
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
Qiao Qiao Xin,

736
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
I've done so many things.

737
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
In my dreams,

738
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
it's like a different parallel universe.

739
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,160
There are so many you and me.

740
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,160
I can't forget you.

741
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
I can't forget you.

742
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
I can't forget you.

743
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,160
I can't forget you.

744
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,160
I can't forget you.

745
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,160
I can't forget you.

746
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,160
I can't forget you.

747
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,160
There are so many you and me.

748
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,160
Each of you has a different ending.

749
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,160
You're from the parallel universe.

750
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,160
You probably didn't expect

751
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,160
I'd be like this.

752
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:28,860
The White

753
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,360
The future is in your hands

754
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,760
You're the key to who I am

755
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,360
Be with me and become myself

756
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,760
The night sky is long

757
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,960
My strong wind blows

758
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,960
Can't stop the run

759
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,360
The call of dreams

760
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:32,360
You're the spark in all my dreams

761
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,960
Be with you and become yourself

762
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,960
The boundary is broken

763
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:55,340
The world will be melted by the

764
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,340
