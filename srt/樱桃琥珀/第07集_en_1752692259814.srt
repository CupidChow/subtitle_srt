1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
The pathways of art

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,340
Imperial College

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Love and Death

4
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 18

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yin Tao.

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yin Tao.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Change your clothes.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Uncle Yu called us

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to have breakfast at the breakfast shop.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Have breakfast?

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Here comes the buns.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Come on, sit down.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay, thank you.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yin Tao,

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
try the buns.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Here.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It tastes the same as

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Qingshan's buns.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It hasn't changed at all.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is it good?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How is it?

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's good.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Listen,

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yin Tao is still the same as

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
when he was a kid.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He's still so popular.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No wonder

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
someone would think

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
that we are his crush.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
When Cai Fang Yuan

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
was in the first grade,

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
he was bullied by a senior.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But Yin Tao took him

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
to the classroom

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and beat him up.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I was thinking

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
that Fang Yuan was lucky.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think she

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
has fallen in love

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
with our Cai Fang Yuan.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What?

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Kang Qi,

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
are you thinking too much?

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You always get bullied by others.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And you beat up Yin Tao.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No wonder you think too much.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
When we moved to Qingshan,

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yin Tao took Yu Qiao

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
to the classroom

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
every day.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He took her to the classroom

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and took her to the road.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't think

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yin Tao can fall in love with Yu Qiao.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But Yu Qiao likes Yin Tao.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Which one of you

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
doesn't like Yin Tao?

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What do you mean?

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You like

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
your good friends.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Your father and son like you.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We all know that.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can't be like

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
a bad guy.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's not talk about

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
whether you like or not.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We don't talk about it.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But Yin Tao

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
can't fall in love with him.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If anyone can find

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
evidence of Yin Tao falling in love with him,

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I guess I'll talk about it today.

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll invite all of our

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
staff to have breakfast

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
for a month.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Li, remember this.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, Mr. Fang.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll remember it.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll talk about it

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
when I'm free.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, no.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's not talk about it.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's over.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't get involved

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
in breakfast.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll treat you

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
to breakfast today.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll treat you to breakfast.

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Four.

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Four more.

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay.

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
More buns.

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay.

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Eat more buns.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
More buns.

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's delicious.

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Eat more buns.

104
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Mom, give you more buns.

105
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll give you more buns.

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You eat more.

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That was a great meal.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I ate four breads.

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My mom didn't even tell me.

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No one is going to

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
spread rumors with Li Shu around.

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They said

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
we were

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
blessed by Yin Tao

115
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
to live until today.

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Really.

117
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I have to remember it.

118
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What are you worrying about?

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't you think it's weird?

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What?

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Jiang Qiao Xi's mom

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
went on a business trip to Lai Shu.

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Why did she come back suddenly?

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Even if she came back suddenly,

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Jiang Qiao Xi

126
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
can't tell her

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
that she went to see me.

128
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why would she know?

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't think about it.

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There's a mole.

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's not me.

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What are you looking at?

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Is it me?

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Be gentle.

135
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Be gentle.

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Then there's only

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Qin Ye Yun left.

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What?

139
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why did you say that?

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What are you doing?

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're annoying.

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ms. Yin.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Ms. Yin.

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Bring it here.

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's not a mole.

146
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's a mole.

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How did you know?

148
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The mom who

149
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
made an appointment with the time and place

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
disappeared like this.

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I suspect

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
that she was taken away.

153
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Who do you suspect?

154
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Brother Wei Ning.

155
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
She cares about Jiang Qiao Xi more than anyone.

156
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The mole you wrote before

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
was also taken away by her.

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You mean

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
she already knows

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
that I'm Lin Dong Dao?

161
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm Lin Dong Dao.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But she didn't react.

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Maybe

164
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
she's trying to make things worse.

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How about this?

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's check it out.

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If it's really her,

168
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
let's count the money together.

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Of course.

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Did you notice that

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
everyone is looking at us

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and saying that we're weird?

173
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Are they crazy?

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let's go.

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Didn't you say that Jiang Qiao Xi

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
was in the second episode of the training camp?

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why did she go there in the first episode?

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
She left so suddenly

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and didn't tell us.

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Xiao Man, do you know why?

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How would I know?

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Maybe Ms. Liang has some other plans

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
for Jiang Qiao Xi.

184
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Jiang Qiao Xi is really

185
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
not answering the phone.

186
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I used to talk to her

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
about the phone.

188
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But she didn't answer.

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I was going to ask her

190
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
to copy some real questions.

191
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's go.

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What are you doing?

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I have something to do.

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Where are you going?

195
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Don't go.

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Open the door.

197
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm not going.

198
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You listen to her.

199
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's go.

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The teacher is calling you.

201
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She's calling you.

202
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

203
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll explain everything

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
you did

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
to her.

206
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Do you want to fight?

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Do you want to fight?

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you want to fight?

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Do you want to fight?

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Do you want to fight?

211
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Ying Tao,

212
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
are you really going to fight?

213
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Power.

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Can I play with my power?

215
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes.

216
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Who wants to fight?

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What?

218
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're so bold

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
to do a bullying

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
in the middle of the experiment.

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't talk nonsense.

222
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You knocked down the wall yourself.

223
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We didn't do anything.

224
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well,

225
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
we asked you to come here.

226
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You should know

227
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
what we're doing, right?

228
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You tell us.

229
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What did you do

230
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
to us?

231
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm not going to tell you.

232
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm not going to tell you.

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm not going to tell you.

234
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm not going to tell you.

235
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm not going to tell you.

236
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm not going to tell you.

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm not going to tell you.

238
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What did I do?

239
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You did it

240
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
to do it, right?

241
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Then you tell us.

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What did we do?

243
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You know

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
what you did.

245
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're so bold

246
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to do it.

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You're so mean.

248
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Beiling,

249
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
what are you doing?

250
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Xiaoman,

251
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
go tell Mr. He

252
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that they're in a relationship.

253
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm not in a relationship.

254
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No.

255
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You don't admit it, do you?

256
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I have evidence.

257
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Jiang Qiaoxi and I didn't have a relationship.

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't talk nonsense.

259
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You want to have a relationship with Jiang Qiaoxi?

260
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're so beautiful.

261
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Go.

262
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Tell me.

263
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When did you two

264
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
start to have a relationship?

265
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
When did we start to have a relationship?

266
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
When did we start?

267
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No one told me.

268
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You two

269
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
still want to laugh?

270
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mr. He,

271
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
they just don't know how to change.

272
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
All right,

273
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
let's not talk about anything else.

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You two

275
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
call your parents.

276
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Mr. He,

277
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
sorry to trouble you.

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
They went to the ocean museum.

279
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Our parents know about it.

280
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We paid the ticket.

281
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
How can your parents

282
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
laugh at you?

283
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
A child at their age

284
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
is so brave to go out and play.

285
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Look at that action.

286
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This action...

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This...

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mr. He,

289
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
this action...

290
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Is it okay?

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This is just touching your head.

292
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Their daughter

293
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
used to pat our Yuqiao's ass when she was a kid.

294
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No, I mean

295
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
their child

296
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
grew up together.

297
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This action is nothing, Mr. He.

298
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We are all electrician workers.

299
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
These two children

300
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
grew up together.

301
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Their relationship is like siblings.

302
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There's no problem.

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Mr. He, don't worry.

304
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But

305
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
even in this situation,

306
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
you parents

307
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
still need to be careful.

308
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's the youth period.

309
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You need to pay attention.

310
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Men and women have their own differences.

311
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't let it affect your life.

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes.

313
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Mr. He is right.

314
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

315
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

316
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Brother Ping.

317
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Your photo looks good.

318
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It has a composition.

319
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Can you give it to me?

320
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What?

321
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He said

322
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
it looks good.

323
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It has a composition.

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Give it to him.

325
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yuqiao.

326
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You and Lin Qi Le.

327
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Are you okay?

328
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No wonder

329
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you always look at us

330
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
with a wrong view.

331
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So you were

332
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
cheated by Feilin Pavilion.

333
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Did I

334
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
make it hard for you?

335
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Do you need me to make you a guarantee?

336
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's okay.

337
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's okay.

338
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This kind of rumor is so evil.

339
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Don't worry.

340
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I will help you to be fair.

341
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I will help you to be fair.

342
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Talk to Feilin Pavilion.

343
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No need, monitor.

344
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's all my fault.

345
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was a big man.

346
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Lin Qi Le.

347
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Did anyone tell you

348
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
that you are a very good girl?

349
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you, monitor.

350
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I know

351
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
about this.

352
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's okay.

353
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yuqiao is deaf.

354
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He will write it.

355
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You are right.

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yuqiao.

357
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Mom.

358
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Ying.

359
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Let me tell you.

360
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Ying Tao

361
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
is your younger sister.

362
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You should take good care of her.

363
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Did you hear that?

364
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Don't listen to others.

365
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I didn't say that.

366
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You

367
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
can't be in a relationship.

368
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Mom.

369
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Ying Tao.

370
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't be embarrassed.

371
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
No.

372
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You kids

373
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
are having fun together.

374
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We are happy

375
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
to be adults.

376
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We are happy too.

377
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Mom.

378
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Don't say that.

379
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
She is Ying Tao.

380
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Listen to me.

381
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Mom, are you okay?

382
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm fine.

383
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I just want to

384
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
let them know

385
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
that you are a girl

386
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
who is always

387
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
talking about

388
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the word.

389
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's a rumor.

390
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I didn't tell you

391
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
because I was afraid that

392
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
you would be angry.

393
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
How did you know?

394
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't ask me.

395
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I have

396
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
something important to give you.

397
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh my god.

398
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's great that he hid it.

399
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So, at that time,

400
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yu Qiao was covering for him.

401
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No wonder Jiang Qiao Xi

402
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
doesn't dare to come to school recently.

403
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
She was scared by him.

404
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Didn't Jiang Qiao Xi

405
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
say that she didn't know him?

406
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This sentence is not obvious enough.

407
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
She was giving him face.

408
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This time,

409
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
she came to the experimental middle school alone.

410
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This is too bold.

411
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Isn't it?

412
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But

413
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
she still hid it.

414
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
She even hid it.

415
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This kind of casual talk

416
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
will hurt others.

417
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Give me the thing.

418
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Monitor,

419
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
why are you taking care of this kind of person?

420
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Our class is going to be ruined.

421
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There must be a misunderstanding.

422
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Xing Tao.

423
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You don't know the rules.

424
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I...

425
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I have a language question.

426
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't know how to speak.

427
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Why don't you teach me?

428
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Come in, Xing Tao.

429
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't be outside.

430
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Xing Tao.

431
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Jiang Qiao Xi didn't say anything.

432
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You're still talking nonsense here.

433
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Before, you and Jiang Qiao Xi

434
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
were asked to meet

435
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
for that paper.

436
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They got it.

437
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
My paper?

438
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes.

439
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
They already know

440
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
that Xing Tao is the one.

441
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yu Qiao.

442
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yu Qiao, what are you doing?

443
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What are you doing?

444
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Give it back to me.

445
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
My paper is in your hands.

446
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What? You stole it?

447
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What's your paper?

448
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What evidence do you have?

449
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They wrote my name on it.

450
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't know.

451
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't know.

452
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't know.

453
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What evidence do you have?

454
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
They wrote my name on it.

455
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I didn't steal it.

456
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Do you think everyone

457
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
is like that Xing Tao

458
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
who does things secretly?

459
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If I had the paper,

460
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
the wind would have blown it out.

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're so mean.

462
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You stole it.

463
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You stole it.

464
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You stole it.

465
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You stole it.

466
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You stole it.

467
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You stole it.

468
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You stole it.

469
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Give it back to me.

470
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Give it back to me.

471
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I didn't steal it.

472
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I wish I could wake up

473
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and get rid of my sorrow.

474
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I wish I could turn around

475
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and see your eyes melt away.

476
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I wish I could look up

477
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and see your smiling face.

478
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I wish you could tell me

479
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
the happy ending.

480
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I wish we could be together

481
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and walk in the same direction.

482
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I wish you could be warm and considerate

483
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
on your way.

484
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I want to give up

485
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
and give you my dream.

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I want you to know

487
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
love is in my heart.

488
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Life should face the light.

489
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
We should be strong even if we fall.

490
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Counting the shooting stars falling on your shoulder.

491
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll always be by your side.

492
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Life should face the light.

493
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Embrace more hope after the dream.

494
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The end of the night is the sun.

495
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The happiness in my hand will bloom eventually.

496
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Why are you willing to go home with us today?

497
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Some people have problems.

498
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I have to come and help them.

499
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm here to help you.

500
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Do you think I'm afraid?

501
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
At least five people in this school

502
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
believe me and stand by me.

503
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I think anyone who has problems like mine

504
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
is not as reliable as me.

505
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You're so eager to

506
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
say the lines of the leading role.

507
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You're so clear-minded.

508
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why are you so unhappy?

509
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Tomorrow is Saturday.

510
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If you're free,

511
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
you can go to the Olympic Games with me.

512
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm not going.

513
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'll go with my dad to order tomorrow.

514
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Ying Tao, I have to go to my mom's house.

515
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'll be back the day after tomorrow.

516
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'll be there tomorrow.

517
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You're so mischievous.

518
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You have to go with me tomorrow.

519
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You've been to the Olympic Games before.

520
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You know the way.

521
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a waste of time.

522
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's a little difficult for me to help you alone.

523
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yue Xiao.

524
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't look at me.

525
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm not going.

526
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You...

527
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Lin Ying Tao, you...

528
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You're not going.

529
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Stop.

530
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
They're almost done with class.

531
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Jiang Qiao Xi will go to the canteen for snacks.

532
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You can go to the canteen and find her.

533
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I was training here.

534
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I got familiar with the teachers.

535
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll go in and expose myself.

536
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll stay outside and let you two go.

537
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Jiang Senior.

538
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Is there anyone here?

539
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No.

540
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Sit down.

541
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay.

542
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Jiang Senior.

543
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Jiang Xue Chen.

544
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Please.

545
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I heard you were in the next class.

546
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I didn't expect you to be in the same class as us.

547
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
This is so lucky.

548
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Thank you.

549
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Jiang Senior.

550
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You suddenly came to class this time

551
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
because you're avoiding that girl from Qianshan?

552
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What?

553
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
My classmate is also from the Academy of Sciences.

554
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
She just called me.

555
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
She said your Academy of Sciences

556
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
is very popular now.

557
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They're all discussing about that girl from Qianshan.

558
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
She said she came to the Academy of Sciences

559
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
to pursue you

560
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
and she's your classmate.

561
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
She hid her identity from the other students.

562
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
She said the Korean class also invited you.

563
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm sorry.

564
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The interviewer said

565
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
we should turn left when we get in.

566
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes, to the left.

567
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Those two students.

568
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's weird.

569
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't move.

570
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I saw you.

571
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Don't run.

572
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Hurry up.

573
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Is she your classmate?

574
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
This way.

575
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Don't run.

576
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Students, be gentle.

577
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Be gentle.

578
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Jiang Senior, don't run.

579
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Our school canteen

580
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
doesn't serve good food, right?

581
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There are always some students like you

582
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
who are eager to find food in the institution.

583
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Come with me.

584
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Let's go to the security room.

585
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Let's take the teachers and the neighbors.

586
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Hurry up.

587
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Don't run.

588
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Teacher, don't let them chase us.

589
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
We're not...

590
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We're not. Hurry up.

591
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I...

592
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm here to find my rabbit.

593
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
To find your rabbit?

594
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
My rabbit

595
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
sneaked in from your school gate.

596
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm here to find my rabbit.

597
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
My rabbit is very important to me.

598
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If you see my rabbit,

599
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
please tell him

600
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
not to worry about me.

601
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
No matter what happens,

602
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll be able to handle it.

603
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What are you thinking?

604
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
How can a rabbit worry about you?

605
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This...

606
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
My rabbit will worry about me.

607
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Students,

608
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
if you see my rabbit,

609
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
please tell him.

610
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Okay.

611
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Jiang Qiao Xi,

612
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
what are you doing here?

613
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Teacher,

614
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm here to find my kitten.

615
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
My kitten is missing.

616
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You're looking for a kitten?

617
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Yes.

618
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's a...

619
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes.

620
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's a very cute kitten.

621
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It has a snow-white fur,

622
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and a red brush like cherry blossoms.

623
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Have you seen it?

624
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I haven't seen it.

625
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
We have a training camp.

626
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I haven't seen it.

627
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes.

628
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We have a kitten in the training camp.

629
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Maybe it's not good these days

630
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and it's raining a lot.

631
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So my kitten

632
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
is hiding.

633
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm worried about him.

634
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm afraid he'll be in a bad condition

635
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and be wronged by others.

636
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But...

637
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But now I know

638
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
he's the strongest

639
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and bravest one.

640
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He can definitely

641
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
sleep under the sun

642
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and watch the sun

643
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
and the moon

644
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
at night.

645
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
He's a good boy.

646
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He's a good boy.

647
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
He can sleep under the sun

648
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and watch the wind at night.

649
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Even if I'm not by his side,

650
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
he can live his life

651
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
because he's the best

652
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and the best kitten.

653
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I see.

654
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You're under too much pressure.

655
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Mr. Ou,

656
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I forgot to tell you.

657
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well,

658
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
he's a classmate of our school.

659
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
He might come to visit us.

660
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Can we...

661
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You have to tell him

662
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
that we don't allow him to visit us.

663
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
All right.

664
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's late.

665
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Xiao Xi,

666
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
go back and have a rest.

667
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'll take them out.

668
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Go.

669
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Okay.

670
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's okay.

671
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm here.

672
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Go.

673
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Take care.

674
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Xiao Xi.

675
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll go.

676
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Cai Fang Yuan.

677
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Cai Fang Yuan.

678
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
We...

679
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Don't disturb me.

680
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
This is the power of love.

681
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It's here.

682
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I wish I could wake up

683
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and soothe my sorrow

684
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I wish I could turn around

685
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and see the ice

686
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I wish I could look up

687
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and see your smiling face

688
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I wish you could

689
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
make love to me

690
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I wish you could

691
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
make love to me

692
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I wish you could

693
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
make love to me

694
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I wish you could

695
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
walk towards the same direction

696
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I wish you could

697
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
embrace the warm sunshine

698
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I wish you could

699
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
let go of the world

700
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
and give it back to your dream

701
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I wish you could know

702
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
love is in my heart

703
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Life should always be bright

704
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and strong in every step

705
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'll be with you

706
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
while the shooting star

707
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
falls on your shoulder

708
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Life should always be bright

709
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and give you more hope

710
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
At the end of the night

711
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
the sunshine will bloom

712
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
in the happiness in your hands

713
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I wish I could wake up

714
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and soothe my sorrow

715
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I wish I could turn around

716
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and see the ice

717
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I wish I could look up

718
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and see your smiling face

719
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I wish you could

720
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
make love to me

721
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I wish you could

722
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
make love to me

723
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I wish you could

724
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
make love to me

725
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
If you dare to

726
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
have any contact with those people

727
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
in Qun Mountain

728
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'll make sure

729
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
they all leave

730
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and give it back to your dream

731
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'll be with you

732
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
while the shooting star

733
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
falls on your shoulder

734
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Life should always be bright

735
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and give you more hope

736
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
At the end of the night

737
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
the sunshine will bloom

738
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
in the happiness in your hands

739
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Ying Tao

740
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
will Jian Qiao Xi

741
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
know you're singing for her?

742
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
She knows

743
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
She knows

744
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Dismiss

745
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I...

746
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Go

747
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Go

748
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Go

749
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Go

750
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Go

751
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Go

752
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Go

753
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Go

754
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Go

755
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Go to the basketball court

756
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and watch me play

757
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm not going with you

758
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm going to the college entrance examination

759
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and go back for review

760
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Then

761
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
let Cai Fang Yuan go with you

762
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
No

763
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
He's studying

764
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and he's working all night

765
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm leaving

766
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'll go back for review

767
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You don't have to go back with me

768
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You play basketball

769
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I won't be eaten by you

770
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Where's Yu Xiao?

771
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yu Xiao

772
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Go

773
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Hurry up, don't waste time

774
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Go and clean up

775
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm going

776
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm going

777
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm going

778
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Hurry up, Yu Xiao

779
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I didn't expect that

780
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I've never been this big

781
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I've never been this big

782
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm so stupid

783
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'm so stupid

784
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm so stupid

785
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm so stupid

786
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
No

787
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Lin Qi Le

788
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I saw you were very tired

789
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
in class

790
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
This is my pencil in the room

791
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I said

792
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
this is my pencil in the room

793
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's full of content

794
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You can ask me any questions you have

795
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Our monitor is so happy

796
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Monitor

797
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I don't understand chemistry

798
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What's the problem?

799
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Can I ask you?

800
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
No

801
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Although I'm not good at chemistry

802
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
if you have any questions

803
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
you can ask me anytime

804
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Almost

805
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yes

806
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Physics is our monitor's forte

807
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Thank you, monitor

808
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'll ask the teacher if I have any questions

809
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I...

810
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Lin Yi Tao

811
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You're so sleepy

812
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You're a thief in the middle of the night

813
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm a thief

814
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Do you think I'm a thief?

815
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
You study late at night

816
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Why are you so diligent?

817
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You study late at night before the monthly exam

818
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You think you're diligent

819
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
At most, you're a temporary Buddhist

820
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's too difficult to do physics

821
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I remember the formula

822
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But when I did the question

823
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I found that I only remembered the formula

824
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Hurry up

825
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Coming

826
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Hurry up

827
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Hurry up

828
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Hurry up

829
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Hurry up

830
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Coming

831
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Why is Jiang Xiao Xi so good at everything?

832
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Lin Yi Tao

833
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Don't underestimate yourself

834
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Think about it

835
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You're good at

836
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
studying from Qunshan University to the experimental school

837
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Besides, physics

838
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
is not difficult as long as you can solve it

839
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Maybe when you took the exam today

840
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you'll know everything

841
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
when you open your eyes

842
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
When I was in the room

843
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
in the small room

844
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
who sang the double-bladed stick for ten minutes

845
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And then when I took the exam

846
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I was so confused

847
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I was so confused

848
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Don't worry

849
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I will never fail the monthly exam

850
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Besides, why do you have to

851
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
compete with Jiang Xiao Xi?

852
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
She is not as good as you

853
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
except for studying

854
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
There is always a short version of genius

855
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Students

856
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The most important thing to learn data

857
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
is the formula

858
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Remember the formula

859
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Remember it

860
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Remember it in your head

861
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Do you know?

862
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Yes

863
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
There are questions

864
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and questions

865
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Is there anything you don't know?

866
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
If you don't know, give me a hand

867
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
If you know, give me a hand

868
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Lin Qi Le

869
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You know it too

870
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Do you know it all?

871
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Then you come up

872
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You give me this question

873
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
If you do it wrong

874
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
we will stand and listen to it

875
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Come on

876
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Come on, sit down first

877
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Come on

878
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Teacher

879
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Did I do something wrong?

880
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
This is

881
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
the sun coming out from the west

882
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Our class's average score

883
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
is expected to increase

884
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Not bad

885
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Go ahead

886
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Are you all right?

887
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
We are right

888
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm right?

889
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
All good

890
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
All good

891
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
All good

892
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
All good

893
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Go, go, go

894
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You go and have a look

895
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'll do it myself

896
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
How's your test?

897
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The result of the test is out

898
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,080
Let's see what result

899
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,960
I can't say for sure

900
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,780
It's a misunderstanding

901
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,280
You have a great body.

902
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,080
The Yak 1420 urine gostomy

903
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,720
is found in all sources.

904
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,720
Check for a new dose of blood.

905
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,120
It would take another 9 days as within the condition has been revealed.

906
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,080
Check.

907
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,360
Thanks for your juiciness.

908
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,200
Check as well.

909
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,040
Sir,

910
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,440
can you give me one more long shot ofıyıayi?

911
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,360
Sure.

912
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,640
I'll turn around to defense myself.

913
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,520
Give some water and have a rest.

914
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,280
Sure.

915
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,680
I'm рeasonally in her shoe here.

916
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:04,720
OK.

917
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,600
How is it?

918
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,080
Did I do

919
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,960
poorly?

920
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,200
Lin Ying Tao.

921
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,400
You're amazing.

922
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,560
You got the fifth place in the whole class.

923
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,720
Are you serious?

924
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,960
Why would I lie to you?

925
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,840
I got the fifth place.

926
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,840
I'm leaving.

927
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,760
What about you?

928
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,720
How are you?

929
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,440
Are you going home to be beaten?

930
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,560
I...

931
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,240
I got the third place.

932
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,400
You got the third place?

933
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,480
When did you get such good grades?

934
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,360
I got them in the countdown.

935
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,720
Countdown?

936
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,600
Then I...

937
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
You want to get the real score?

938
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,640
Of course, just like me.

939
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,720
I got them all in the countdown.

940
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,560
You got two higher than me.

941
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,080
You got the same score?

942
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,400
Then my parents

943
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,680
won't be cruel to me.

944
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,240
I'm cruel to you?

945
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,200
Pan Yuan Fang, why did you lie to me?

946
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,040
Lin Ying Tao, don't be anxious.

947
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,320
Yu Qiao got the third place again.

948
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,400
What about him?

949
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,880
Yu Qiao got the 15th place in the countdown.

950
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,000
He's so poor?

951
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,440
Wait here.

952
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,960
He got such good grades

953
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,840
to come to our class.

954
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,920
Isn't he lucky?

955
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,080
That's us.

956
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,720
Who else is so lucky?

957
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,240
Lin Xi Le is with the people in the mountain all day.

958
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,640
He doesn't have time to study.

959
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,480
That's it.

960
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,080
Do you want cold water?

961
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,680
If you want water, just drink it.

962
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,320
Don't be so arrogant.

963
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,800
It's none of your business.

964
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,960
Yes, it's none of our business.

965
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,800
We don't have Lin Xi Le's ability.

966
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,200
It's Jiang Qiaoxi,

967
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,240
Feng Letian,

968
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,320
and you.

969
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,920
Why are you all talking for him?

970
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,760
That's right.

971
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,880
Didn't you see

972
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,440
Cai Fang Yuan

973
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,160
playing with his bag

974
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,280
on the playground?

975
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,600
You don't know that, do you?

976
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,520
Jia Sisi,

977
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,160
be quiet.

978
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,000
Am I the one who's not quiet?

979
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,840
Say it again.

980
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,880
What are you doing?

981
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,400
Why are you talking like that?

982
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,600
You're a girl.

983
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Why are you so fierce?

984
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,080
He hit me.

985
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,760
Yu Qiao,

986
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,160
you had good grades before.

987
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,920
How did you become like this

988
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,240
when you were with Lin Xi Le?

989
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,480
I'm not like that.

990
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,680
I'm willing to be like this.

991
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,320
I'm willing to take this name.

992
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,720
We played basketball together for so long.

993
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,680
I advise you

994
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,240
that Lin Xi Le is not Shen Le Deng.

995
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,040
I also advise you

996
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,120
not to talk nonsense.

997
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,520
This Lin Xi Le

998
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,960
is really capable.

999
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,400
Feng Letian takes care of him.

1000
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,760
Yu Qiao is his local fan.

1001
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,080
Now, because of him,

1002
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,680
the exam is so bad.

1003
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,560
Before, Jiang Qiao Xi

1004
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,080
asked him to help him to get the exam.

1005
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,960
I really don't understand.

1006
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,880
What's wrong with these boys?

1007
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,920
Are you ashamed?

1008
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,760
Huang Zhanjie,

1009
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,560
language is violent.

1010
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,880
It's more hurtful than body violence.

1011
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,640
Do you know that?

1012
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,160
Teacher He,

1013
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,240
I'm not talking to him alone.

1014
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,800
Everyone is saying this.

1015
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,640
Is it right that everyone is saying this?

1016
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,240
Don't listen to what people around you say.

1017
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,960
If you want to know someone,

1018
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,200
you should get close to him.

1019
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,200
Get to know him.

1020
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,280
You can't live a life without talking to him.

1021
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,760
From now on,

1022
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,200
I'll see who dares to

1023
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,160
pull the gang together.

1024
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,360
If you say bad things about your classmates,

1025
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,800
don't stay in Class 18 anymore.

1026
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,120
In your life,

1027
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,560
wherever you go,

1028
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,800
you will be followed by

1029
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,120
other people's eyes and comments.

1030
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,240
You in the eyes of others

1031
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,680
are not the real you.

1032
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,520
Even the self in your eyes

1033
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,720
is not the real you.

1034
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,760
But the other person in your eyes

1035
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,440
can be the real you.

1036
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,680
Laoshan is very angry.

1037
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,880
Let's go.

1038
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:24,960
No.

1039
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,000
Don't be nervous.

1040
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,280
When you get to Laoshan,

1041
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,240
tell him that

1042
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,160
the teacher is nice.

1043
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,120
He won't make things difficult for you.

1044
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,600
If you want to learn, I'll help you.

1045
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,480
I'll explain it to you.

1046
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,720
No, I can do it myself.

1047
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,480
Help me carry it up.

1048
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,600
As long as you can talk to him,

1049
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,000
I'm fine.

1050
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,640
Did the lines

1051
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,480
of the classmates

1052
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,240
have any influence on you?

1053
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,680
No?

1054
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,080
From now on,

1055
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,200
play with your female classmate more.

1056
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
It's not good to be hurt.

1057
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,040
Mr. He.

1058
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,080
Cai Fang Yuan,

1059
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,600
Yu Qiao and others

1060
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,200
are my good friends first.

1061
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,600
Then they are my male classmates.

1062
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,360
I don't think I did anything wrong.

1063
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,440
So I don't care what others think of me.

1064
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,560
But they are my good friends.

1065
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,800
I have no reason

1066
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,560
to distance myself from them.

1067
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,840
The most important thing for you

1068
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,720
is to study hard.

1069
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,040
The class of 18 in the experimental middle school

1070
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,200
is not easy to stay.

1071
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,000
If you take the low-ranking exam every month,

1072
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,400
you will be separated from class 18

1073
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,240
in the next semester.

1074
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,560
I'm a good friend.

1075
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,480
First, I don't violate my will.

1076
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,360
Secondly,

1077
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,040
I don't violate the school rules.

1078
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:22,960
But if

1079
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,960
I don't do well in the exam,

1080
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,360
I will be separated from class 18.

1081
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,800
It's the school's rule.

1082
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,880
I will obey it.

1083
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
I will study hard

1084
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,080
and try not to be separated.

1085
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,680
Facing difficulties,

1086
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,960
you can't just stop

1087
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,040
with a few words.

1088
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,400
The class has 15 students.

1089
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,600
The school will organize a half-day's study on Saturday.

1090
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,840
Work hard.

1091
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:09,600
The sun shines down,

1092
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,800
and the warm heart kisses it.

1093
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,200
Open your eyes and smile,

1094
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,600
looking at the white horse riding on its own.

1095
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,640
Look at the sky,

1096
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,760
and the distant clouds are not talking.

1097
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,800
The quiet spring is waiting for its answer.

1098
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,600
The night is green,

1099
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,000
and the gentle face is covered with a mask.

1100
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,000
It's shy,

1101
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,800
and it's been a long time.

1102
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,400
The sky is blue,

1103
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,000
and the years are passing by.

1104
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,800
Lying in the grass,

1105
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,200
it accidentally

1106
00:43:51,200 --> 00:44:01,200
stopped next to me.

1107
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,600
The sun will rise,

1108
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,600
and we will say goodbye.

1109
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Hey oh hey oh oh oh oh,

1110
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:26,600
you are a little cat and I am a wolf.

1111
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,200
Many years have passed,

1112
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,600
and the appearance has become blurred.

1113
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:38,600
I have a little hat on my finger

1114
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:44,200
and sing with you on the hill.

1115
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,600
We accidentally bled.

1116
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
The little town is so far away,

1117
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,600
and you are holding me like a mountain.

1118
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,600
The sunset is red.

1119
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
You are in my pain.

1120
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,000
I look at you,

1121
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,600
and you are the one who is not paying attention.

1122
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
At this moment,

1123
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:17,600
I have finally understood peace and freedom.
