00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,960
Love and Death

3
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,760
Episode 34

4
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,500
That was my wish.

5
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,900
I still can't lose you.

6
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,460
You are the person I should save for?

7
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,960
Did you

8
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,800
happen to see me late?

9
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,500
I knocked on your window by accident.

10
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,300
What did you knock on?

11
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,340
I saw that you said

12
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't want you to be hurt because of me anymore.

13
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But now,

14
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't want you to be hurt because of yourself.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Mi Da,

16
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
did I scare you today?

17
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Jiang Qiao Xin, you are...

18
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
very bad.

19
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I always make you cry, right?

20
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

21
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But I'm not crying.

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm not crying.

23
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But even so,

24
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I want to tell you,

25
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
knowing you

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
is the luckiest thing for me.

27
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Jiang Qiao Xin,

28
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
through your eyes,

29
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can only see Jiang Qiao Xin.

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Every time I call this name,

31
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I can only think of the sunset on the mountain.

32
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Jiang Qiao Xin,

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
these are all yours.

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I gave them to you.

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can't give them to me.

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Even if you want to give them to me,

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I won't take them.

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't worry, Mi Da.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I know now.

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I know

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
why you called me.

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay, it's done.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay, come.

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll go get some more.

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Coming.

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Mr. Jiang.

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Qiao Xin is inside.

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you.

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's go.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sit down.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Sit down.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sit down, Xiao Bao.

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Come.

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's eat together.

56
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Your hand.

57
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Hello?

58
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Did Ying Tao and Jiang Qiao Xin cry?

59
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No.

60
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Look at the way the actor looks.

61
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I think he's laughing at us.

62
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
If he wants to laugh, then laugh.

63
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If you want to laugh, you can laugh.

64
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
From this moment on,

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
you're like the Jiang Qiao Xin in the past.

66
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's gone.

67
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Now you

68
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
belong to the whole mountain.

69
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're also your own Jiang Qiao Xin.

70
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No one can stop you.

71
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No one can stop you.

72
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You have to live as Jiang Qiao Xin.

73
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But no matter what,

74
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
you can't hurt yourself.

75
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You can't hurt yourself again.

76
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I won't.

77
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Because

78
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I was seen by Ying Tao.

79
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I was seen by the whole mountain.

80
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Today,

81
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I

82
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
am free.

83
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
From now on,

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't want these things anymore.

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I have a name.

86
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
My name is Jiang Qiao Xin.

87
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
She just wants to find a place

88
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that can hide from you.

89
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What if she disappears

90
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
in a small hill so close to your home?

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Do you really believe that...

92
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You can't mention her like that.

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Then how can I mention her?

94
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can't.

95
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can't.

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You can't.

97
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You can't.

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can't.

99
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can't.

100
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You can't.

101
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You can't.

102
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You can't.

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You can't.

104
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can't.

105
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:35,160
Go to her

106
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,000
and ask her.

107
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Is there anyone who can hurt her?

108
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Then I will return the money to you today.

109
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I only want to be my Jiang Qiao Xin.

110
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Why?

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why?

112
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What's wrong?

113
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Feng,

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Qiao Xin's mother, Hong Fei,

115
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
has hit a car.

116
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I have to go there quickly.

117
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay.

118
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll go with you.

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Go quickly.

120
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay.

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yin Tao, come out for a while.

122
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Mom.

123
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Mom.

124
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What's wrong?

125
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yin Tao.

126
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Qiao Xin's mother has hit a car.

127
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Now,

128
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
mom and dad are going to the hospital with Uncle Jiang.

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You and Qiao Xin stay at home.

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Then I...

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't worry.

132
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Mom and dad are in the hospital.

133
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Look after Qiao Xin.

134
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Mom.

135
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Mom.

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The patient is very lucky.

137
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The injury is not serious.

138
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Most of them are soft tissue injuries.

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Also,

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
it's a bit of an old tremor.

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Recently,

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
there may be a cough and dizziness.

143
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The patient's main priority now is to rest.

144
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Don't have emotional changes.

145
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What happened to Qiao Xin?

147
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Why is she so...

148
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
She doesn't know where her place is.

149
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Jiang Qiao Xin,

150
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
you have to take good care of your chances.

151
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Director is right.

152
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You have to be careful when making decisions.

153
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Jiang Qiao Xin,

154
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
in my heart,

155
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you have always been a good student with a clear mind.

156
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We all know

157
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
that you are a traitor who didn't understand.

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We all understand.

159
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Think carefully.

160
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Think clearly.

161
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What do you mean by understanding?

162
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's such a simple matter.

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
How can she not understand?

164
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't say that the parents are cold-hearted.

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Don't say that the school has spent so much money on you.

166
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Let's talk about yourself.

167
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You are still a minor.

168
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Do you know what decision is good for you?

169
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Do you know what decision is responsible for you?

170
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Director,

171
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You can go first.

173
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Young people,

174
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
what are you doing here?

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you skipping class?

176
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No, it's lunch time.

177
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm here to bring food for Aunt Liang.

178
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Uncle Jiang,

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
this is my mother's stewed pigeon soup.

180
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's just cooked, so I put it in.

181
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's a little hot.

182
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If you want it tomorrow,

183
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
can you have the fish soup?

184
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay.

185
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Thank you.

186
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't bother your family.

187
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's okay.

188
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We are neighbors.

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We should bother each other.

190
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Jiang Qiao Xin,

191
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
my parents asked you to go home for dinner.

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You've been too tired lately.

193
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We don't ask you to eat.

194
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You don't eat anything.

195
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We have to keep an eye on you.

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Go home and eat.

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Teacher,

199
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
President,

200
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm leaving.

201
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Goodbye, Uncle Jiang.

202
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Goodbye, Aunt Liang.

203
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Goodbye, teachers.

204
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Look at your son.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He is so obedient.

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He's such a good boy.

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Were those teachers

208
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
very angry just now?

209
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yes.

210
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They all want to get Jiang Qiao Xin back.

211
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
They don't want to get the current Jiang Qiao Xin.

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What should we do, Ning Tang?

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It doesn't matter what others think.

214
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What Jiang Qiao Xin thinks is the most important.

215
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What about you?

216
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Which Jiang Qiao Xin do you like?

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Which Jiang Qiao Xin?

218
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I think

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
the one who makes me happy

220
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and likes me the most

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
is the best.

222
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yin Tao is indeed Yin Tao.

223
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Were you very tired these two days?

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Not bad.

225
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm not as tired as I used to be.

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's just

227
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I hear those

228
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
rambling words every day.

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's too boring.

230
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Then

231
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

232
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay.

233
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What about now?

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Now

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
it's a little better.

236
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Just a little?

237
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The scenery is so nice here.

238
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The sun is so warm.

239
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Aren't you satisfied?

240
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Indeed.

241
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Indeed.

242
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's not warmer than now.

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You'll fall down in this clothes.

244
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
No.

245
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
With you by my side

246
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I won't fall down.

247
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You trust me so much.

248
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yin Tao

249
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
why don't you ask me

250
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
what I want to do in the future?

251
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
These questions

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
are not for you.

253
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm not going to ask you.

254
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm not going to ask you.

255
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not going to ask you.

256
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm not going to ask you.

257
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm not going to ask you.

258
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's too tiring to answer.

259
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You've been tired for so long.

260
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You'd better take a rest.

261
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's useless for you to ask

262
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
whether Jiang Qiao Xi is coming or not.

263
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But she doesn't know it either.

264
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Only Lin Qi Le knows.

265
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Not only she knows.

266
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Her parents probably know.

267
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're talking nonsense.

268
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Jiang Qiao Xi doesn't know.

269
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
How can Lin Qi Le know?

270
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Cai Fang Yuan is not talking nonsense.

271
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Really.

272
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
When Jiang Qiao Xi was studying with us

273
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
in Qun Mountain

274
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
no one could find her

275
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
after she graduated from school.

276
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
If you want to find her

277
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
you can only go to Lin Qi Le's house.

278
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Jiang Qiao Xi just needs to buy a bed

279
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
in Lin's house

280
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and live in their house.

281
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
In this way

282
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
she is like

283
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Lin's biological son.

284
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Is it so good?

285
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Lin Qi Le

286
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
when will Jiang Qiao Xi

287
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
come back to school?

288
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't know either.

289
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When she

290
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
wants to come back.

291
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Lin Qi Le

292
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
so what is Jiang Qiao Xi

293
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
thinking about

294
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
when she wants to come back to school?

295
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
When she

296
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
comes back.

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Lin Qi Le

298
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
you answer the question with questions

299
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and answer the answer with answers.

300
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,600
Will the words of the car

301
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
be misinterpreted?

302
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I really don't know.

303
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And it's you

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
who asked me back and forth.

305
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I want to let you see

306
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
the light that shines in my heart

307
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I want to sing

308
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I want to sing for you

309
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
my loneliness and mystery

310
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I want to forget

311
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I want to forget

312
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
the ordinary life

313
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
in the clouds

314
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
in the distance

315
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
In the night

316
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I listen to the song

317
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
My soul is empty

318
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I feel the flow of blood

319
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
In the dream

320
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I feel the flow of blood

321
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
In the dream

322
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I feel the flow of blood

323
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
In the dream

324
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I feel the flow of blood

325
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
In the dream

326
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I smell the fragrance

327
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
like the white night on the way to the city

328
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I said Chen Ming

329
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
who let you on the boat?

330
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Get off, get off.

331
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
OK, slow down.

332
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Now the child

333
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
has a little time to think about you.

334
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What I lack most now

335
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
is time.

336
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
When is the time

337
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
that you lack?

338
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You are busy all day

339
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and don't go to school.

340
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You don't go to school.

341
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's good to find a factory to work.

342
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't have the light in my heart

343
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I want to sing

344
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I want to sing for you

345
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What does Jiang Qiangxi want?

346
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He doesn't go to the national training team.

347
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
He doesn't go to the national team.

348
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He doesn't want Baosong.

349
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He doesn't even come to school.

350
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What does he want?

351
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's his own decision.

352
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
He will say what he wants to say.

353
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What I can do

354
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
is to stand in the corner of my friend

355
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
to support him.

356
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If I'm really worried,

357
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm worried that

358
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
he has a good meal

359
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and a good sleep.

360
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Is he happy?

361
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If you ask these questions

362
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and make him unhappy,

363
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I won't ask you.

364
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Do you know that

365
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
his current state is very dangerous?

366
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He just wants to be himself.

367
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There is nothing dangerous.

368
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm not hungry.

369
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But

370
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Jiang Xin, eat a piece of ribs.

371
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Thank you, aunt.

372
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
There are still a few bowls.

373
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let me do it.

374
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll help you.

375
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
OK.

376
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Take this soup bowl with you.

377
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What are you?

378
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Egg flower soup.

379
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You're right.

380
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I just ate it.

381
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Thank you.

382
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Thank you, uncle.

383
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Qiao Xin, how about I do it?

384
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
No, I can do it alone.

385
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Together.

386
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's OK.

387
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
OK.

388
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You, you, you first.

389
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You first.

390
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll do it.

391
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You first.

392
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You first.

393
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You first.

394
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You first.

395
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You first.

396
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You first.

397
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You first.

398
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You first.

399
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You first.

400
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You first.

401
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You first.

402
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You first.

403
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You first.

404
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You first.

405
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Uncle,

406
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
if you

407
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
have any questions for me,

408
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
you can ask me.

409
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
No.

410
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Before,

411
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yin Tong

412
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
told us

413
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
that we should not ask him anything.

414
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So, I thought

415
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
if you want to say it,

416
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
you can do it.

417
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
If you don't want to say it,

418
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
it doesn't matter.

419
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,760
I...

420
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Well...

421
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,600
I'm just saying it.

422
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm just talking too much.

423
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,440
Mr. Sheng.

424
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,480
If you have anything to say,

425
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,280
just say it.

426
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,360
I'm willing to listen.

427
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,760
You're willing?

428
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,320
Yes.

429
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,760
You're so good at this.

430
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,720
You're even good at it.

431
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,600
What do you think?

432
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,160
Do you have any plans?

433
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Do you have any suggestions?

434
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,560
I think

435
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,440
what Mr. Li said

436
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,840
makes sense.

437
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,080
It's a waste of talent.

438
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,680
Dad.

439
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,320
Don't say that.

440
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,680
I've heard all these.

441
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
Don't worry.

442
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,840
I'll wash the dishes.

443
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,760
It's okay. I'm done.

444
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,840
I won't say it.

445
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,840
But

446
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,640
many people said

447
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,760
I should say it today.

448
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,120
Because...

449
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,800
Don't say it.

450
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,640
What dad said today

451
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,200
is different from what others said.

452
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,760
Dad.

453
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,240
I think

454
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,360
it's because you

455
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,120
brought this talent

456
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,200
to this world.

457
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,720
It's not because of the talent.

458
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,800
We shouldn't be

459
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,240
kidnapped by this talent.

460
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,320
We should be blown away.

461
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
Instead,

462
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,120
we should use this talent

463
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,800
to make ourselves rich.

464
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
You should be happy

465
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,760
and not waste it.

466
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,520
Anyway,

467
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,280
it's not the talent

468
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,280
that you waste.

469
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,560
It's your life.

470
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,640
I... I get it.

471
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,760
Do you understand?

472
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,040
I understand.

473
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,880
But

474
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,080
what Mr. Li said

475
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,360
doesn't seem to mean that.

476
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,320
I can't say that

477
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,120
when Mr. Li is here.

478
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,040
There's no one else here.

479
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,760
I can't say it secretly.

480
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,120
I...

481
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,360
That's what I mean.

482
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,120
Please take it as a reference.

483
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,120
Lin Tao.

484
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,440
I envy you.

485
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,120
Before,

486
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,480
everyone told me

487
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,800
not to waste my talent.

488
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,040
But no one really cared

489
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,360
what these talents

490
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,600
could bring to me.

491
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,680
But only you, Mr. Lin,

492
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,800
have seen me

493
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,920
through these talents.

494
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,760
Really?

495
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,880
Only I saw it?

496
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,440
No, no, no.

497
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
I saw it too.

498
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,080
And me.

499
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,120
I saw it too.

500
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,440
Everyone saw it.

501
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,280
Thank you.

502
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,920
I really

503
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,840
need these words.

504
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,840
They're very important to me.

505
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,840
Lin Tao.

506
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,760
Did you see that?

507
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,000
From now on,

508
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,520
listen to your father.

509
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,760
Your father

510
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,160
was recognized by the talent.

511
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,880
I'll listen to my father.

512
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,960
Why don't you say something to me too?

513
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,800
I'll listen to you now.

514
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,520
To you?

515
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,080
The following words are very important.

516
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,280
You have to listen carefully.

517
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,800
You

518
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,000
can't not eat carrots.

519
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,360
I won't eat it.

520
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,040
Come on.

521
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,240
Dad.

522
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,920
Are you

523
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,680
very happy now?

524
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,760
I always wanted to live

525
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,640
alone in this picture.

526
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,880
At that time, I thought

527
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,320
I would be very happy

528
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,440
if I did it.

529
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,600
But on this day,

530
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,000
I only feel calm.

531
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,680
You are calm.

532
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,400
But our family

533
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,680
has been working hard for so many years.

534
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,440
It's all considered trash.

535
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,000
Xiao Xi.

536
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,240
I've never

537
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
thought about it before.

538
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,720
Your heart is so hard.

539
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
There is really

540
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,560
no room for you.

541
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,040
Dad.

542
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,280
Do you want to keep it as a souvenir?

543
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,120
What about the meal?

544
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,960
I'll cook it for you.

545
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
How's your hand?

546
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,680
It's healed.

547
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
Your mother still can't get out.

548
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,560
Do you know that?

549
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,080
The champion of the Olympic Games

550
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,840
can enter the national team

551
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,040
and be sent to the north.

552
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,520
She wanted you to get all of this.

553
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,360
Now she doesn't want

554
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
all of this.

555
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,080
Dad.

556
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,760
I'll throw the trash away.

557
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,160
Mom, try this.

558
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
It's delicious.

559
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
I made it myself.

560
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,880
Am I

561
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,360
talented in cooking?

562
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,960
Wait a minute.

563
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,000
There's still food left.

564
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,400
I'll get you a cup of tea.

565
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,480
You're so talented and smart.

566
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,120
You're using all your talent

567
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,240
to do these things.

568
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,120
You're using all your talent

569
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,760
to do these things.

570
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Do you want to be a chef?

571
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,120
No.

572
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,560
When I cook,

573
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,560
I don't think about anything else.

574
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,000
You just want to ruin yourself.

575
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
There are thousands of ways

576
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,520
to get revenge on me.

577
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,960
Why did you choose math?

578
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Do you remember

579
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,160
how I started learning math?

580
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,120
Of course I remember.

581
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,240
You were only four years old when you went to kindergarten.

582
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,360
All the kids were playing toys.

583
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,600
Only you

584
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,840
focused on the game.

585
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
At that time,

586
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,560
I found out your math talent.

587
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,360
So I sent you to study math.

588
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,880
You got a lot of awards in less than a year.

589
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Everyone said that

590
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,240
I was a bad math teacher.

591
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,160
But I

592
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,720
became a genius again.

593
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,880
I remember

594
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
when I was in kindergarten,

595
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,360
I sent you a painting

596
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,320
when I was your mother.

597
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,080
It was a painting with your smile.

598
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,120
But after you got it, you told me

599
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,920
you wanted a medal in less than a year.

600
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
I got it too.

601
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,120
You were really happy.

602
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,040
You smiled like a painting.

603
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,520
You took me to the park.

604
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,440
You lied on the boat with me.

605
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,120
You watched the clouds in the sky drift.

606
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,640
That was the first time I felt

607
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,840
I was happier than the seagulls in the sky.

608
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,440
I remember.

609
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,160
I remember everything.

610
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
I was so happy.

611
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,640
I was so happy.

612
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
But then

613
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,640
I found a picture

614
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,320
of you and Jiang Meng Chu.

615
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
The same park,

616
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
the same boat,

617
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,960
and even the same smile.

618
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,120
I really hope

619
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,200
you're happy because of me.

620
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,560
I've always wanted to find

621
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,440
the shadow of Jiang Meng Chu in my eyes.

622
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,480
I've always wanted to have a mother,

623
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,240
not a school.

624
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,240
You want me to admit

625
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,200
I'm sorry, right?

626
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,040
You want me to admit

627
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,600
I'm sorry for the talent you gave me, right?

628
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,960
I tried my best.

629
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,720
Mom.

630
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,800
You've been trapped inoph diffuse as a mother.

631
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,200
You want me

632
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I've been trapped in the role of a talented girl

633
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,240
I want to resist you

634
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,560
to prove that I'm different from Jiang Mengchu

635
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,800
But mom

636
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,640
we hate each other all the time

637
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,600
It's meaningless

638
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,880
What do you want to say?

639
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,880
What do you want to say?

640
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,840
If we can't stop

641
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,800
hating each other

642
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,880
we won't stop

643
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,000
Why don't we find ourselves first?

644
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,000
A complete self

645
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,480
Maybe

646
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,560
when we look into each other's eyes

647
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,480
we won't have any grudges

648
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,000
Do you think you're amazing?

649
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,600
You can cook for me

650
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,480
and teach me these principles

651
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,000
I tell you

652
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,480
everything I do now

653
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,520
is for your future

654
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,160
You're going to face

655
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,440
this cruel world right now

656
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,640
I feel ridiculous

657
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
for you to know nothing about this world

658
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,000
and how it derives from my future

659
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,460
My future

660
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,080
my world

661
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,280
is in my hands.

662
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,080
I didn't expect things to go so smoothly.

663
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
Now, there are more and more readers

664
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,680
and more and more authors on my website.

665
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,080
The most important thing is that

666
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,480
someone paid 80,000 yuan some time ago.

667
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
80,000 yuan?

668
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,080
Why would he buy my website?

669
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,680
Wait, 80,000 yuan?

670
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,080
Cai Fang Yuan, if you want to pay 80,000 yuan,

671
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,480
then sell it.

672
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,080
Sell what?

673
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
I want to create a beautiful country

674
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,480
for Chinese literature.

675
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,080
I won't sell it for how much money?

676
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
I'll pay you.

677
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,480
I won't sell it for how much money?

678
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,880
This is a token.

679
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,480
One dollar.

680
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,680
What is this?

681
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
It's brain-saving.

682
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,080
It helps you build your brain and improve your memory.

683
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
Here.

684
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,080
What's wrong with your brain?

685
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,480
Excellent memory and sharp brain

686
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,680
are the basic elements of becoming a pilot.

687
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,680
Next month,

688
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
the third-year students will be flying in the air.

689
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,080
Tomorrow will be my turn.

690
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,080
At present,

691
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,080
it's not a problem to be strong.

692
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,280
But we need to follow the software.

693
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,680
We can't afford to lose everything.

694
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Director,

695
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
you need to eat more.

696
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,680
Don't you know how to do business?

697
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,880
An excellent businessman

698
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,680
needs to be smart.

699
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
Dr. Du,

700
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
don't you agree?

701
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
I found out

702
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,280
that our small team

703
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,880
is taking over all the industries

704
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,080
in the world.

705
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,480
Ni Yitao.

706
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,280
Don't ask me.

707
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
I'm still thinking about

708
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,480
the big business.

709
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,680
Who asked you?

710
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,280
I want to ask Tao Xi.

711
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
What does she think?

712
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,080
Right.

713
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,280
We're not putting pressure on her.

714
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,680
We just want to know

715
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,880
what she thinks.

716
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,880
Everyone is planning their future.

717
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,680
She cancelled the delivery.

718
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,080
She hasn't said what she wants to do in the future.

719
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,080
I don't know.

720
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,480
She hasn't even said you.

721
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,880
Jiang Xiaoqi is a little too much.

722
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,080
I really don't know.

723
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,480
Sometimes I think

724
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,880
she doesn't want to do anything in the future.

725
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Sometimes I think

726
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,280
she has already thought it through.

727
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Ni Yitao,

728
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,680
why didn't you ask her?

729
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
How can I ask her?

730
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,480
I'm putting pressure on her.

731
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,480
I'm telling you.

732
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,480
Jiang Xiaoqi

733
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,480
has always been very thoughtful.

734
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,480
I think she should think it through.

735
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
I think so too.

736
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,880
I think she has already thought it through.

737
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,080
She didn't tell you.

738
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,480
I think she wants to give you a surprise.

739
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
A surprise.

740
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
I don't think so.

741
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,480
I think she'll say it

742
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
when she's ready.

743
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Have you talked to

744
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
that girl, Sheng Lin?

745
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
What do you want to do?

746
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
No.

747
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,480
What should I say?

748
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,080
I found that

749
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,480
I'm quite timid in front of her.

750
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Are you scared?

751
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
If I tell her,

752
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
if she keeps me,

753
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
I don't know what to do.

754
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,480
If she tells me to go,

755
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,480
I don't know what to do.

756
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
It's simple.

757
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
It's simple.

758
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
You just tell her

759
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
to go with you.

760
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
No.

761
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,480
She's very good at home.

762
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
But I'm leaving.

763
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
You just think about what you want to do.

764
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
Okay?

765
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
Brother can't teach you.

766
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Think about it.

767
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Hey.

768
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Shi Wen.

769
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,480
You're back at school.

770
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,480
You don't give up math, do you?

771
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,480
I like math.

772
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
How could you?

773
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,480
My dad said that

774
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
your math sense is very good.

775
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
You're like a cow in the field.

776
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
You're so talented and hardworking.

777
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
You're giving up?

778
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
I'm going back to the classroom.

779
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Well, Jia.

780
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
You don't like math now

781
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
because of the chess game?

782
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
I heard from others that

783
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
you have a big wish

784
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
after your senior transferred to the experimental middle school.

785
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
I mean...

786
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
All the decisions I made

787
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
are my own thoughts.

788
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
It has nothing to do with Lingqile.

789
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
Senior.

790
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,480
I'm leaving.

791
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Why did you go back to school?

792
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,480
You didn't tell me in advance.

793
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
I came back as soon as I thought about it.

794
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
Well,

795
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,480
let's go to the vocational school.

796
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,480
You two?

797
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
What about us?

798
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
Yes.

799
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
You two eat by yourselves.

800
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
You two are always here.

801
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
Sit down.

802
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Jiang Xiaoxi.

803
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
You're back.

804
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,480
Jiang Xiaoxi, you're back.

805
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Jiang Xiaoxi is back.

806
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Jiang Xiaoxi.

807
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
You're back, Jiang Xiaoxi.

808
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
You're back, Jiang Xiaoxi.

809
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,480
Long time no see.

810
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
Long time no see.

811
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,480
Okay.

812
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
I helped you copy all the notes

813
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
when you were not there.

814
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,480
You helped me, right?

815
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,480
Yes.

816
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
I'll pay for it.

817
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
I thought you wouldn't come back.

818
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,480
I'll pay for it now.

819
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,480
I promise you.

820
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Okay.

821
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
I'll pay for it.

822
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,480
I'll pay for it.

823
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
I forgot to put the note.

824
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,480
Everyone, turn the book over to page 58.

825
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Is it like reading English in math class?

826
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Is it like that, Jiang Xiaoxi?

827
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Jiang Xiaoxi.

828
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Is it like that, principal?

829
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,480
Look at you, you're so angry.

830
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
You've been angry for more than two weeks.

831
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
Now you're in class.

832
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
Why are you suddenly

833
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
rebelling in your youth?

834
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,480
You read English in math class.

835
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,480
You read math in English class.

836
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480

838
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
You're so angry.

839
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
You're so angry.

840
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
You read math in English class.

841
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,480
Are you sure you read math in English class?

842
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
I remember.

843
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Which country is Jiang Xiaoxi going to study abroad?

844
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
What did you say?

845
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
You don't know?

846
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
I know.

847
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,480
Who said she was going to study abroad?

848
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
Who said that?

849
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
I went to the office to report my homework.

850
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Teacher Qu said that Jiang Xiaoxi

851
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
was reading the test materials

852
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
in the math class today.

853
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,480
She didn't tell you?

854
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
She doesn't need to tell anyone.

855
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
She has her own future.

856
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
She has her own future.

857
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,480
She has her own plans.

858
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Why did she leave?

966
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,480
I remember.

967
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,480
I remember.

968
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,480
I remember.

969
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,480
I remember.

970
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,480
I remember.

971
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,480
I remember.

972
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,480
I remember.

I remember.

974
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,480
I remember.

975
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,480
I want to forget the usual growth.

976
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,480
I'm looking up.

977
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:22,480
I'm looking far away.
