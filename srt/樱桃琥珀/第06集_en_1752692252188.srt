Episode 18

14
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,680
Lin Yiteng, are you crazy?

15
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,760
How could you do this for Jiang Xiaoqi?

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,960
I told you, I didn't do it for her.

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,040
I did it for the kitten.

18
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,320
The kitten is so cute, right?

19
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,960
Don't be stubborn.

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,360
Even if you have a heart,

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,600
do you dare to admit that

22
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,080
the kitten's meaning

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,120
has changed because of Jiang Xiaoqi's existence?

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,040
I...

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,240
I'm here to see you, not to be criticized.

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,880
Help me find a clean place.

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,600
Otherwise, my mom will be worried about me when she comes back.

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,720
I'm just looking for the same place

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,640
that I bought with my mom.

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,120
What's most important now is

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
to have a good attitude with Jiang Xiaoqi.

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,840
A clear attitude.

33
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,760
Does she still want to be your friend like when you were a kid?

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,880
If she keeps being so distant,

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,640
you'll let her go as far as possible.

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,640
You're not getting close to her.

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,840
I'm not getting close to her.

38
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm already far enough away from her.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,320
Why are you yelling at me?

40
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,840
If you have the guts,

41
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,040
go find Jiang Xiaoqi.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,240
You're useless.

43
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
Let's go.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,760
Ah Li, make me breakfast.

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,240
Go and find someone really interesting.

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,200
She's your girlfriend?

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,560
I don't understand what you mean.

48
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,920
Stop pretending yourself.

49
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,280
You and Ceng Xiao Fan

50
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,320
shouldn't be good friends

51
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,360
with Lin Yindao.

52
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,000
It couldn't be.

53
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,200
It's impossible.

54
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,520
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,600
Wait a minute.

56
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,000
Well,

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You should go now.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,560
It's hard to explain in school.

59
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,960
He hasn't gone far.

60
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,480
Little Qixi.

61
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,720
Little Qixi.

62
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,760
Uncle, we changed cars.

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,960
Changed cars?

64
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,520
Yes.

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Ying Tao.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,920
Ying Tao.

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,120
I haven't changed.

68
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,120
I want to be your good friend.

69
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Ying Tao.

70
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,960
Ying Tao.

71
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Ying Tao.

72
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,960
You are leaving.

73
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,600
Bud.

74
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
Produce requirement is good.

75
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
I think it's pencil ink.

76
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
Let me see your completing paper.

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,320
Then I'll...

78
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,200
It says yes.

79
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,120
My pen has already been pink in some points.

80
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,760
I'll take it to see it later.

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,080
Alan food.

82
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,360
I'll show theて.

83
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,340
ок 옏

84
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,680
It's perfect now.

85
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,300
Here.

86
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,640
Jiang Qiao同 risu.

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,560
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What are you doing?

89
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,160
Do you know that it was very dangerous just now?

90
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,720
It's very dangerous.

91
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
You're dying.

92
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,560
And you're laughing.

93
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,600
Are you silly?

94
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,040
It was really dangerous just now.

95
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,520
Stop laughing.

96
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,800
What are you doing?

97
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
I'm here.

99
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,960
Who wants to do your job?

100
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,040
Come on.

101
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,880
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,240
If you're ready,

103
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,160
just tell me

104
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,480
why you didn't contact me

105
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
during the New Year.

106
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,280
All of this

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,440
has to be said

108
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,800
after I went back to Shen Chen.

109
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,200
After I went back to Shen Chen,

110
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,560
I would be

111
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,840
sent to work at the police station.

112
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,040
I couldn't finish my homework every day.

113
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
But I studied very hard every day.

114
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,640
I thought

115
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,080
as long as I finished school early,

116
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,840
I could call you

117
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,960
and go to the mountains to see you.

118
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,360
But I found out when I got home

119
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,240
that my mom cut off her phone line.

120
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,920
Then on the New Year's day,

121
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
I asked my mom

122
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,600
if I could call Shen Chen

123
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
and tell him that

124
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,360
after I got home,

125
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,800
I would go back to work at the police station.

126
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
You lock your heart

127
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,200
and keep it in the clouds

128
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,080
if your dreams

129
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,240
don't leave traces.

130
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,200
We are small

131
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,200
and$ill retain the year that no wells home.

132
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,840
I want you

133
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,040
to forget that I'm desolate in the starlight

134
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,920
Jiang Xiang Si.

135
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,920
cicada colour is warm

136
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,960
I'm going to look through the Native Heat

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
the palm light is warm

138
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,120
ebd Huling

139
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,720
We'll retreat into the tide

140
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,040
And follow you

141
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,360
To the end of the cycle

142
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,200
You're the reason us to burn

143
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,600
Suspicion

144
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,080
Enter the unknown

145
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,080
Turn around and dive into your love

146
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,880
You're the reason us to shine

147
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,400
Suspicion

148
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,880
St45

149
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,360
Change into the first leaf in the wind

150
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,240
It's full of you

151
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,800
Stop

152
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,680
Go! Go home

153
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,600
Are you very fat?

154
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,120
You can't even stand on your own.

155
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,760
I'm almost fat.

156
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,360
I'm fine. It shouldn't hurt.

157
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,480
What should I do?

158
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,280
Are you stupid?

159
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,120
You did so many things,

160
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,840
but I didn't know anything.

161
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,680
I kept blaming you.

162
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,360
Even if you reply to me

163
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,680
and call me,

164
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,840
let me know you didn't forget me.

165
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,120
That would be great.

166
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,800
Let me go.

167
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,960
I want to go back to Mount Jun.

168
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,280
How can you be so selfish?

169
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,600
Your brother has never been like this.

170
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,520
Jiang Qiao Xi.

171
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,480
Why are you like this?

172
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,840
Because I'm Jiang Qiao Xi.

173
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,840
If you dare to have any contact with those people in Mount Jun,

174
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,240
I have a way to get them all out.

175
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,920
You can try it.

176
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,840
Okay.

177
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,440
Are you 2 not talking yet?

178
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,880
I don't want to disappoint you.

179
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,880
I want to give you the final answer.

180
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
What final answer?

181
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Don't give me the math answer.

182
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
I don't have it.

183
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,880
I promised you to come back during the winter vacation.

184
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
But I didn't do it.

185
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,880
I hope I can do everything you said.

186
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,880
Like my Hong Kong cousin, Peng.

187
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,880
He can do anything for me.

188
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,880
But I know that I have nothing now.

189
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,880
I have to listen to my mom.

190
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,880
And you are a relative.

191
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,880
I don't want you to do everything for me again.

192
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,880
I don't want to disappoint you.

193
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,880
I'm also very helpless.

194
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,880
I don't know what I can do for you.

195
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Why do I have to talk about you?

196
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Jiang Xiaoxi.

197
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Actually, I just wanted to help you.

198
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Why didn't you reply my letters?

199
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Why didn't you call me?

200
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Why did you disappear suddenly?

201
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,880
So what I want is not something you can return to me.

202
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,880
I just want to know your news.

203
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
I want to know if you are doing well.

204
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
I know.

205
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
I also want to send you a message.

206
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,880
But even if I send it to you,

207
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
you can't solve any problems.

208
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,880
It will only cause you trouble.

209
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
But what about you now?

210
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,880
You are sitting here and running after the car.

211
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
You are obviously throwing it at me.

212
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Isn't this a conflict of mind?

213
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
Not conflict of mind.

214
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
There is a change now.

215
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,880
I didn't expect you to come to me.

216
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
I didn't expect you to value me.

217
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,880
I didn't expect you to misunderstand me and Zeng Xia.

218
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
Then blame me.

219
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Blame me for being a bad person.

220
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Let's go.

221
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Be careful.

222
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
Did I make myself clear?

224
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,880
If you want to ask me if I forgive you,

225
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
I haven't thought about it yet.

226
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
So this is the way to get married.

227
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,880
So his mother didn't let him marry me.

228
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Does it still count that Jiang Qiao Xi is a little heartless?

229
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,880
I always think that Jiang Qiao Xi is not a heartless person.

230
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,880
But a little heartless coward.

231
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
What coward?

232
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
You don't understand their situation.

233
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
You change too fast.

234
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
You only know the truth for a few days.

235
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
You just protect her like this.

236
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
I'm not afraid of you.

237
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
I'm not afraid of you.

238
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
I'm protecting her.

239
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
Yu Qiao.

240
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Yu Qiao.

241
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
What are you laughing at?

242
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
What's wrong?

243
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
Why are you always laughing?

244
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
You look happier than Lin Yintao.

245
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
You have such a good relationship with Jiang Qiao Xi.

246
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
I...

247
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,880
And you're laughing so ugly.

248
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
No.

249
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
I just heard a joke.

250
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
It's so funny.

251
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
It's so funny.

252
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
It's so funny.

253
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,880
One day, the steamed bun was fighting with the noodles.

254
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
Then the noodles were beaten by the steamed bun.

255
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
The noodles were not convinced.

256
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
The next day, they found their good friends.

257
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
It's convenient to help them get their heads.

258
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
The next day, the steamed bun was beaten by the noodles.

259
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
Don't be so stubborn.

260
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
You can't recognize it by looking at my head.

261
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,880
I'll beat you.

262
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,880
It's really funny.

263
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,880
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Jiang Qiao Xi.

265
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
What's this?

266
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Why are you yelling?

267
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,680
Why is this you guys did,

268
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Why are you dressing like this?

269
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,760
Whose

270
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,880
clothes is that on?

271
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Mine.

272
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Although I had no idea if it's your clothes.

273
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Do you think it's all on your clothes?

274
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,880
But just look at this.

275
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
Is this really your clothes?

276
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Don't follow me.

277
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Do you think it's pins and needles?

278
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Do you know?

279
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
What?

280
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Once, the pain is gone,

281
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,480
Or, tonight.

282
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,480
You guys can discuss it.

283
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,640
Jin Yan Yun!

284
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,600
What are you doing?

285
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,080
How about this?

286
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,600
From now on,

287
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,400
let's have lunch together every noon.

288
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,600
Like this afternoon.

289
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,280
So boring.

290
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,840
Who wants to have lunch with you?

291
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,000
You just smiled so happily.

292
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,280
Yu Qiao.

293
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,440
From now on,

294
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,280
you'll be responsible for telling a joke to Qin Yan Yun every noon.

295
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,720
I just saw you two smiling so happily.

296
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:27,760
A

297
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,040
Can we Islam work with you for a few minutes?

298
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,480
Do you know how to do the這樣問題?

299
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,640
か

300
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:50,840
I told you.

301
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,360
Do you know how to do the things in this GDM?

302
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,000
Do you know how to do the things in this GDM?

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,040
Do you know how to do it?

304
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,680
So you can discuss it

305
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,000
by separated the two scenarios of government.

306
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,720
Then, solve the equation.

307
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,040
Let me help you write an example.

308
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,480
How is it?

309
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,600
Can you see it clearly?

310
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,600
I see.

311
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
This solution is quite clear.

312
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,360
Good.

313
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,860
If you have this, why did you copy my handwriting so bad?

314
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,940
I soPHOMAN O plein tree

315
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,160
What are you holding in your hands?

316
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,760
I'm listening to music.

317
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,960
Where's the other hand?

318
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,760
My diary.

319
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,360
It's all about Jiang Qiaoxi.

320
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,560
It's not about you.

321
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,160
You can't keep it.

322
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
What can I keep?

323
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,160
You can't keep it as a feeling.

324
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,960
If you keep it, you'll be the bottom.

325
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
What do you know?

326
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,960
I just want to tell him

327
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,560
when he misses me,

328
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,160
I miss him a lot

329
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,360
I miss everyone.

330
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
We miss him too.

331
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Are we the one?

332
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Or do you want to say

333
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,560
you miss him a lot

334
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,960
when he misses you?

335
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,360
I'll go.

336
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
I'll go.

337
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,760
Well,

338
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,760
look at my outfit.

339
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,160
Am I really not too short?

340
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,360
No, believe me.

341
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,560
It looks much better.

342
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,760
Don't forget.

343
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,360
I'm showing my belly.

344
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:17,960
It looks much better.

345
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,760
I'm showing my belly.

346
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
That's it.

347
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,360
Don't open it.

348
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,760
It's so late and someone is playing.

349
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,960
Who cares?

350
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,360
I guess he's a fool.

351
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Who?

352
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,360
Huh?

353
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,160
Are you going to see Jia Qiao Xi or not?

354
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,160
Huh?

355
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Hmm.

356
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Yu Qiao.

357
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Yu Qiao.

358
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,160
Why are you here?

359
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
Are you still up?

360
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,960
I couldn't sleep and I came out for a walk.

361
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,760
I didn't expect to meet you.

362
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,360
You're out for a walk in the middle of the night

363
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,960
and you're dressed so well.

364
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,360
You must have been in love with someone.

365
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,560
It's not funny at all.

366
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,560
Then, the joke I told you today

367
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,960
was made by you.

368
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,360
You're the same as me.

369
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,560
I think that joke is funny.

370
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
It's not funny.

371
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,560
You're laughing at me?

372
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,160
I think you're funny.

373
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,760
I think so.

374
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,160
I think so too.

375
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,760
So, what are you laughing at?

376
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,160
I think you're funny.

377
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,360
Really?

378
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,560
I think so too.

379
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,960
I think so too.

380
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,160
I wish you could wake up

381
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,960
and get rid of your sorrow.

382
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,160
I wish you could turn around

383
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,960
and melt the ice in your dreams.

384
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,960
I wish I could see your smiling face

385
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,960
from the other side of the stage.

386
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,160
I wish you could tell me

387
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,960
how much you love me.

388
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,960
I wish I could tell you how much I love you.

389
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,360
How many times have I told you

390
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,560
that red is not for you?

391
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,960
I like red.

392
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,560
You're still young.

393
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,560
You don't know what you really like.

394
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,560
I think I'm too young

395
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,960
to know what I like.

396
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,960
Do you want to talk to me

397
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,560
about this?

398
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,560
I've been on a business trip for a few days.

399
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,960
You're not at ease.

400
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Why are you so reluctant to let me go?

401
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,960
Are you on a business trip

402
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
or going to see your brother at the park?

403
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,960
Every time I get a good grade,

404
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,160
you'll notify me

405
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,560
about my brother

406
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,160
right away.

407
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,160
You want him to be my good brother.

408
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,760
I also want him to be your good son.

409
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,760
If you dare to go today,

410
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,360
if you dare to go today,

411
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
you're forcing me to go to Lin Haifeng's house

412
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,560
and ask them how they educate their daughter.

413
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,960
The boy they asked to meet in the evening

414
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,560
I want them to know

415
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
that something is wrong with their Jiafeng.

416
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,160
What's wrong is our family.

417
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,960
The construction site in Fujian

418
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,960
is also missing a engineer.

419
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Let them go to the place they should go.

420
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,560
You go to the place you should go.

421
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,760
Isn't that just right?

422
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,560
You think I'll never grow up?

423
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,760
You think you can trap me forever?

424
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,160
I hope you'll grow up soon.

425
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,360
Only when you grow up

426
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,560
will you understand my pain.

427
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,760
I'm tired.

428
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,760
I don't want to talk about these anymore.

429
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,160
Let's go.

430
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,160
Pack your things.

431
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,960
I'll send you to the training camp tonight.

432
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,960
You can't take part in business outside.

433
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,560
Math is the most important thing now.

434
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,560
I'm not going.

435
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,160
I want to get back to school.

436
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Qiao Xi!

437
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,720
I heard it outside.

438
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
Why are you yelling at Qiao Xi?

439
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,040
What's wrong with you?

440
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
What's wrong with me?

441
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,040
If it wasn't for your promotion,

442
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,120
and you took her to the mountains,

443
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,920
she wouldn't be like this.

444
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Liang Hong Fei,

445
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,680
why are you making up stories again?

446
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,200
What's wrong with me taking care of her?

447
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,040
I'm in trouble.

448
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,680
When Qiao Xi was little,

449
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,480
you didn't take care of her,

450
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,720
and you didn't want to take care of her.

451
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,040
If I had a job,

452
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,160
what would I do if I didn't take her to the mountains?

453
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,600
What do you mean I don't care about her?

454
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,920
I have a job, too.

455
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
Then I'll take her to the mountains.

456
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,120
Little girl,

457
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,760
you're so pitiful.

458
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,280
Put it here.

459
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,480
Since Qiao Xi was in grade five,

460
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,200
we rarely see

461
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,840
such a smile on Ying Tao's face.

462
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,920
Tonight,

463
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
she mentioned Qiao Xi.

464
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
I think

465
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
she's become

466
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,960
a child again.

467
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,800
You know what?

468
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,840
I thought you wouldn't let her go.

469
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,600
But look at her.

470
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,480
It's late.

471
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,680
She won't come back so late.

472
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,200
What a child.

473
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,560
Now,

474
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,080
even if you don't let her go,

475
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,720
she'll try her best to go.

476
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,880
Besides,

477
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,320
if she really has something to worry about,

478
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,720
she won't tell us.

479
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,800
The friendship between them at this age

480
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,240
is the cleanest

481
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,640
and most needed protection.

482
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,360
Yes.

483
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,040
Who is it?

484
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,240
Why is it so late?

485
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,440
Cai.

486
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,680
Manager Sun.

487
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,640
Why are you so late?

488
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,720
Li Na.

489
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,440
Mr. Jiang is fighting with Mr. Liang at home.

490
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,160
The cadres are all lost.

491
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,200
It seems that

492
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,880
it's because of Ying Tao and Qiao Xi.

493
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,160
What?

494
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,320
If you don't let her go,

495
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,880
when will you stop being so weak?

496
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,720
Do you want to

497
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,280
let both of them go back to their families?

498
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,640
This world is so strange.

499
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,360
You're not the only one.

500
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,480
You're the one who's wrong.

501
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,840
What do you want?

502
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,760
What do I want?

503
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,040
What do you want?

504
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,320
What do you want?

505
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,160
You're the one who's always

506
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,680
in the wrong.

507
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
I'll be with you

508
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,240
no matter what happens.

509
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,240
I'll be with you.

510
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,640
This is the end of the world.

511
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,520
Aunt Juan.

512
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,080
You're the one who's wrong.

513
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,760
You're the one who's wrong.

514
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,480
You're the one who's wrong.

515
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,760
You're the one who's wrong.

516
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,080
Li Na is still

517
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,920
the one who's not used to seeing her son.

518
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,360
If you want to go back to Zhengzhou,

519
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,560
you should go to your family first.

520
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,640
Tell them

521
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,240
to let their daughter

522
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,040
and Qiao Xi go to the capital.

523
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,840
If you want to go back,

524
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
just do it yourself.

525
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,200
No one will be with you.

526
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,720
Why are you here?

527
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
I...

528
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,520
I was just passing by.

529
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I saw

530
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,080
you're here alone.

531
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,040
Qiao Xi hasn't come here yet.

532
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,960
Did you tell her

533
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
what time it is?

534
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,520
I did.

535
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,440
I told her

536
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,160
that I'm here alone.

537
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,960
She's not here yet.

538
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,000
I told her

539
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,960
that I'm here alone.

540
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
I told her

541
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,960
that I'm here alone.

542
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,960
I told her

543
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
that I'm here alone.

544
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,960
I told her

545
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,520
that I'm here alone.

546
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,240
It's already such late.

547
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,680
She's not here yet?

548
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,480
So

549
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,800
why don't you go home?

550
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,360
Talk to you tomorrow.

551
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,880
Let's go.

552
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,040
I'll walk you back home.

553
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,840
If the family was still

554
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,200
one of us,

555
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:57,760
пон eye wouldthey not notice

556
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,360
how怕 andIouard

557
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,120
that we are

558
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,600
no one but each other.

559
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,720
Mm.

560
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,480
I'm sorry.

561
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,520
Jiang Taoxi.

562
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,560
I'm going to win the Taekwondo competition.

563
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,600
Well,

564
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,000
Lin, Shengjuan,

565
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,240
it's normal for kids to go to school

566
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,680
and communicate with each other.

567
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,720
It's late.

568
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,560
I'm sorry for making you come here

569
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,960
for our family matter.

570
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,680
Is it just our family matter?

571
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,200
Mom,

572
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,440
let's go now.

573
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,320
I'll do what I promised you.

574
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,960
I believe you for the last time.

575
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:07,960
Ying Tao.

576
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,480
What?

577
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,200
Ying Tao.

578
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,680
Ying Tao.

579
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,600
Don't lie to Ying Tao.

580
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,560
Ying Tao.

581
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,600
Where is Ying Tao?

582
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,720
Mom.

583
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,560
Aunt Juan, Uncle Haifeng.

584
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,520
Ying Tao didn't do anything wrong.

585
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,440
She didn't.

586
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,920
Thank you.

587
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,200
Yuqiang,

588
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,960
it's late.

589
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,080
Go back now.

590
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,320
You go back first.

591
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
I'm sorry.

592
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,600
I...

593
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,520
All right.

594
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,160
Don't worry.

595
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,760
Mom and Dad

596
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,120
didn't think you did anything wrong.

597
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,200
Go back.

598
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,320
Come on.

599
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:19,920
Go.

600
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,120
Go.

601
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,880
Go back.

602
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,120
Go.

603
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,360
It's...

604
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,360
It's getting cooler.

605
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:31,920
Right?

606
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,000
It's autumn.

607
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,960
It's autumn.

608
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,040
Wait for me to make some rock sugar water.

609
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,600
Take it to school and drink it, okay?

610
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,560
Mom.

611
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,920
Did Jiang Qiaoxi's mom

612
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,120
say anything bad to you?

613
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,920
Ying Tao.

614
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,400
Don't forget who your dad is.

615
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,480
I'm the owner of the shop.

616
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,160
No matter how big the job of Jiang Qiaoxi's mom is,

617
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,000
she's always

618
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,960
polite when she talks to me.

619
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,640
Right?

620
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,640
You...

621
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,120
But I've caused you a lot of trouble.

622
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,800
When you grow up

623
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,880
and become a parent,

624
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,280
you'll know

625
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,960
that a child

626
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,080
is born in trouble.

627
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,720
I...

628
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,480
Well...

629
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,920
Well...

630
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,200
Is Jiang Qiaoxi okay?

631
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,320
Ying Tao.

632
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,760
Qiaoxi is a good girl.

633
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,360
She cares about your love

634
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
as much as you do.

635
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,840
But people

636
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,680
are hard to change their attitude

637
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,280
especially when they're young

638
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,240
and rely on themselves.

639
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,360
He'll only like youت

640
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,640
but he'll always think that

641
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,320
he loves you.

642
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,880
I support your idea.

643
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,800
Although

644
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,840
people often can't change theirgrounds,

645
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,840
their friendship

646
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,640
can't be changed either.

647
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,440
Right?

648
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,960
Then you can blackmail me.

649
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,560
Goodbye.

650
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,080
We should fight together.

651
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,120
Yun Yue.

652
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,960
It's Jiang Zhengnuan.

653
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,920
Steaming hot HTML

654
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,580
Is there anything else you need?

655
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,580
Yes

656
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,120
Yuan yuan

657
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,760
You and children very familiar

658
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,740
You look

659
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,120
Can you tell him

660
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,520
that the most important thing

661
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,600
in your current stage

662
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,760
is learning?

663
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,080
Besides that,

664
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,440
you have to build

665
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,320
a healthy relationship.

666
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,560
Including the relationship between friends.

667
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
And the possible love relationship

668
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,320
that will happen in the future.

669
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,600
It all needs to be done in the right time.

670
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,760
It's a critical stage.

671
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,440
We'd better not affect each other.

672
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,840
Uncle Jiang,

673
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,080
if we really do,

674
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,480
it's also Jiang Qiaoxi who will affect Ling Yimang.

675
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,620
If I don't discuss it with Ling Yimang's family,

676
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,340
they won't write the mas Latinis' prepare notes.

677
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,740
So I have to hope that

678
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,320
Dad can interfere with the operation.

679
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,740
Well,

680
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,140
Ling Yimang's company

681
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,100
did put a lot of effort into the arrangement.

682
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,180
What is it then?

683
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:42,940
It's AZ.

684
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:43,980
You see.

685
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,100
It's AZ's places.

686
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,420
cuál?

687
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,300
Right now,

688
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,820
we streamrow movie together.

689
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:34,820
You're by my side

690
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:47,820
The sun will rise and set, we'll say goodbye

691
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:58,820
A little cat and I are walking on the road

692
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,820
Many years have passed, the appearance of the past has been blurred

693
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,820
I'm more than a dog that's been bitten by a dog

694
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:16,820
I'm going to sing with you on the hillside

695
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:22,820
We accidentally bled

696
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,820
I want to run to the top of the hill, holding you in my arms

697
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,820
The sun is about to turn red

698
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,820
You're in my eyes, I'm looking at you

699
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,820
You're the only one in my eyes

700
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:49,820
It's you that I finally understand peace and freedom
