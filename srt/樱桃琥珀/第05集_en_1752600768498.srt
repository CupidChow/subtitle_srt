Episode 18

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Lin Xi Le.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Are you feeling better?

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I... I'm feeling better.

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thank you.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Jiang Qiao Xi bought this for you.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What do you mean?

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I know about you and Jiang Qiao Xi.

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You were good friends before.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
When you were young,

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
you were good childhood friends.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You know everything?

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Jiang Qiao Xi told you?

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You and Jiang Qiao Xi...

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You two...

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I...

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I...

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In high school,

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
we could only encourage each other

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and learn from each other.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But now,

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
we can talk about more things

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
after we go to college.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Your business has nothing to do with me.

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But Jiang Qiao Xi values you as a friend.

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Her business is my business.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Her friend is my friend.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm worried about you too.

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Thank you.

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I have many friends.

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No need.

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How was your practice today?

35
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're still in the middle of the season.

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You'll feel bad again later.

37
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Did you just catch a cold?

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No.

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm feeling better.

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I just want to learn as soon as possible

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and get through the tough times.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I want to ride a bike with you guys

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
so that we won't be like today.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Did Jiang Qiao Xi

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
tell you that

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
you have a lot of friends?

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I have a lot of friends.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm not like this today.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Did Jiang Qiao Xi make you angry?

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
She's not capable of making trouble.

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You didn't tell the truth.

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Xing Yue.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Xing Yue.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Help me pay the bill.

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Be careful.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't fall for Jiang Qiao Xi.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hurry up.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
In high school,

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
we can only encourage each other

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and learn from each other.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We'll talk more

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
when we're in college.

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Here.

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm going to get a cold.

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Are you okay, Xing Yue?

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm fine.

67
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Take a deep breath.

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't worry.

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't hold me.

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm not holding you.

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're going to fall down.

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't...

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's okay.

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Don't worry about me.

75
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Be careful.

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,760
Are you okay?

77
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,720
No.

78
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,000
Your hand...

79
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,520
Jiang Xiaoxi, what are you doing?

80
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,920
I saw you riding a bike up there.

81
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,000
There's no one around.

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,240
I was afraid you'd fall down, so I...

83
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,320
I didn't mean that.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Didn't we agree?

85
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,800
Just pretend we don't know each other.

86
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,600
We're not friends anymore.

87
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,960
How can you show up in front of me

88
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,400
as if nothing happened?

89
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,880
I...

90
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,680
I want to start over with you.

91
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,840
Let's be friends again.

92
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,520
As Lin Qi Le.

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm Lin Qi Le.

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,200
Am I not Lin Yingtang?

95
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,560
That's not what I meant.

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,800
Fine. I got it.

97
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,880
Let me tell you this.

98
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
If I were Lin Qi Le,

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,960
I wouldn't want to know you.

100
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,920
If I were Lin Yingtang,

101
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,360
I'd also hope that I've never met you.

102
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,440
You're hurt.

103
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,200
Let me take you...

104
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,800
Don't come any closer!

105
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,240
Don't come any closer!

106
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,160
Every time you come any closer,

107
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,120
I'll get hurt.

108
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,560
I'll get hurt again and again.

109
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,080
You're doing well now.

110
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,520
I'm doing well too.

111
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,240
We don't need to get to know each other again.

112
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
Yingtang, I...

113
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,280
I didn't mean to...

114
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,240
Don't say that.

115
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,520
From now on,

116
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,680
we'll be just ordinary classmates.

117
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
I won't disturb you.

118
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,040
You shouldn't disturb me either.

119
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,480
Can you?

120
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,520
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,120
I really didn't expect

122
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,600
to bring you such a big problem.

123
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,640
If you feel sorry,

124
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,560
then you have to promise me

125
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,840
to forget Ethereality S struggles.

126
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,440
Then,

127
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,520
you should get over your head

128
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,200
and believe in yourself.

129
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,400
I...

130
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,400
You didn't do anything for me.

131
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,080
You don't distinguish between

132
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,520
your true feelings and truth.

133
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,360
However,

134
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,040
you did something wrong earlier.

135
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,160
Good night.

136
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,720
2009, February 9.

137
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,160
The internet is everywhere.

138
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
If you don't, you'll be lost.

139
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,760
I think Jiang Qiaoxi must have a computer at home.

140
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,560
They said you can chat online.

141
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,040
I want to chat with Jiang Qiaoxi.

142
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,640
But why didn't she even call me?

143
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,520
On October 26, 2001,

144
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,320
my dad gave me three Harry Potter books.

145
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,520
Harry Potter and Azkaban's Pursuit.

146
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,200
I couldn't bear to read it.

147
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,680
I wanted to read it with Jiang Qiaoxi.

148
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,200
On May 26, 2003,

149
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,240
the news said Shen Chen was in trouble.

150
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,080
A classmate's parents came back from Shen Chen.

151
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,200
She was taken home today.

152
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,160
On August 27, 2004,

153
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,720
Liu Xiang broke the Olympic record

154
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,040
and created a miracle.

155
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,120
I was so happy when I watched the game on TV.

156
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,960
Because I didn't think of Jiang Qiaoxi at that time.

157
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,680
On February 9, 2005,

158
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,040
I didn't think of Jiang Qiaoxi today.

159
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,600
Yin Tao.

160
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,680
I never forget the days we were in Qunshan.

161
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,200
I'll hand these letters to you one day.

162
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,080
Mom.

163
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,800
Mom.

164
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,600
Don't go.

165
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,240
Don't go.

166
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,280
Go away.

167
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,400
Go away.

168
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,280
On September 16, 2006,

169
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,560
I won't be hurt because of her again.

170
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,560
And

171
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,880
from now on,

172
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,680
or at least

173
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,360
or through my brain.

174
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,640
I'm not sure how to call this.

175
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,600
I might not be able to tell it because it's too loud.

176
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
until I don't.

177
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,760
It's said that

178
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,200
his talent

179
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,320
is more important to his future.

180
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,400
He's lives alone in the world,

181
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,400
but for his lovers

182
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Here.

183
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,640
He's not Qiao Xi.

184
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,520
Don't mention me when you're discussing him.

185
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,000
You three go to eat after you're done.

186
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,560
You don't have to help me.

187
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,200
I'm being merciful today.

188
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,600
I'm here to help you clean up.

189
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,200
Ming Tao, I'll help you too.

190
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,800
I think you two are enough.

191
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
I'll go eat first.

192
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,400
You two are being merciful.

193
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,800
Help me clean up.

194
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,600
I'll go eat first.

195
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
I'll go eat first.

196
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,400
I'll go eat first.

197
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,600
You three, go help me cook.

198
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,400
Let me finish my work and eat a meal.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,200
Can you do it by yourself?

200
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,800
That's so weird.

201
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,200
Why can't I do it by myself?

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,400
Let's go. I can do it by myself.

203
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,200
Go eat.

204
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,800
Go.

205
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,600
It's okay.

206
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,400
Hurry up.

207
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,000
Let's go.

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Go eat.

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I can do it by myself.

210
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
Let's go.

211
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
I know. I know.

212
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,200
We'll go help you clean up.

213
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,200
Ming Tao.

214
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,800
Ming Tao.

215
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,600
Ming Tao.

216
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Ming Tao.

217
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Ming Tao.

218
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,800
Ming Tao.

219
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Ming Tao.

220
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Ming Tao.

221
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Ming Tao.

222
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Ming Tao.

223
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Ming Tao.

224
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Ming Tao.

225
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Ming Tao.

226
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Ming Tao.

227
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Ming Tao.

228
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,400
Erm...

229
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Little.

230
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,400
Why are you stay here?

231
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,800
Stop point a reed.

232
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,200
You can touch her chin.

233
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,000
Show you up.

234
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Try her.

235
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
I'm going to the Olympic Games in a few days.

236
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,400
Liu Jilin may not be in school.

237
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Can you take care of him for me?

238
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Is this your cat?

239
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
I found it here last semester.

240
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,600
You hadn't transferred to another school.

241
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
It's small.

242
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,400
It's more like a rabbit than a cat.

243
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
It's like a cat.

244
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
It's like a rabbit.

245
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
It's like a rabbit.

246
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
It's like a rabbit.

247
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
It's like a rabbit.

248
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Don't mention it.

249
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Ming Dao.

250
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
I miss it a lot.

251
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,200
But you already have a cat.

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Jiang Qiaoqin.

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
You like cats.

254
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,400
It's because it can play with you.

255
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,600
It can meow.

256
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
It can catch rats.

257
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,600
But don't think it's like a rabbit.

258
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,200
It's easy to replace a rat.

259
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,200
Besides,

260
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,800
it's a cat, a rabbit, a rabbit.

261
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,800
It's not like...

262
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,400
I didn't replace it with a rat.

263
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,000
It's just that when I'm not happy,

264
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
it will accompany me.

265
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,600
It makes me feel better.

266
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,400
I miss rats is another thing.

267
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,000
Why do you miss rats?

268
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,800
I won't let you think about it.

269
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,600
Why can't I miss rats?

270
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,600
I'm not close to you anymore.

271
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm already very restrained.

272
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm even taking the initiative to stay away from you.

273
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,800
Why do I even want to

274
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,600
take away the right to miss rats?

275
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
Lin Qi Le, you're so arrogant.

276
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
You're shameless.

277
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
How am I shameless?

278
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Rats are also mine.

279
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I have a lot of good memories

280
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,200
that belong to me.

281
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Do whatever you want.

282
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,800
Don't break the rules.

283
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,200
But you already have a cat.

284
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,600
What's wrong with having a cat?

285
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,200
I really like it.

286
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
But I also love rats.

287
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,800
How can you say that?

288
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,600
I...

289
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Come here.

290
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Be careful.

291
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
What are you doing?

292
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,600
Back off.

293
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,600
Back off.

294
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,200
Why are you guys together?

295
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,000
Are you going to fight?

296
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Jiang Xiao Xi,

297
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
what's going on?

298
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,800
He hit me with a rock.

299
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Headmaster,

300
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,400
this kind of thing happened in school.

301
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
It's a kind of bullying.

302
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,000
Headmaster, we saw it.

303
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,600
Jiang Xiao Xi had a fight with Lin Qi Le.

304
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
When they had a fight,

305
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,000
Lin Qi Le hit him.

306
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,400
He just said a few words.

307
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,200
Can he use his fingers to hit him?

308
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
He said a few words?

309
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Why?

310
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
He's blocking me.

311
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,800
He's doing what I want.

312
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,600
Jiang Xiao Xi.

313
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Don't hit him.

314
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Go on.

315
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
He hit me.

316
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,800
What?

317
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,200
I didn't hit you.

318
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
I hit you.

319
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,800
How did you hit him?

320
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,000
What are you doing here?

321
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,200
I...

322
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,000
I...

323
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,200
clean up.

324
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,000
Then he came.

325
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,000
He cleaned up?

326
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
He hit you?

327
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:07,600
Yes.

328
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes.

329
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,200
Yes.

330
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Why did he hit you with ten pieces of rock?

331
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,000
To make him angry.

332
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,000
What angry words?

333
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
You scolded him?

334
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,000
He could hit me.

335
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,600
Student.

336
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,000
You should follow the rules of the school.

337
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No matter who he is,

338
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
no matter how good your study is,

339
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
it can't affect what you should do.

340
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,400
If you encounter such a thing,

341
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,200
come to my office directly.

342
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,600
Don't hit me.

343
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,400
Okay?

344
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,800
And you.

345
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,600
You're a man of high status.

346
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
But you three

347
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,800
should remember

348
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,000
to help me in such a situation.

349
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Jiang Xiao Xi.

350
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,800
No matter how good your study is,

351
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
you can't be self-reliant.

352
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
You did make a lot of money for the school.

353
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,800
But our school

354
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
is not a place for non-competitive study.

355
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
You said he cleaned up and disturbed you.

356
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,800
Okay.

357
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
I won't let him do it.

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
All the cleaning.

359
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,200
You continue to do it alone.

360
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Come to my office after the class is over.

361
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,400
No need, principal.

362
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
I can clean up myself.

363
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,000
I can do my own thing.

364
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,400
No need for help.

365
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,200
I...

366
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,800
I made a sound on purpose.

367
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,200
I made a noise and made Jiang Xiao Xi angry.

368
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200
I don't care about his business.

369
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,400
On purpose?

370
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes.

371
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
No, principal.

372
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,200
He didn't mean it.

373
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
It's the normal thing.

374
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,400
I was the one who made a noise.

375
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
It's not normal at all.

376
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
I did it on purpose.

377
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I just can't stand him.

378
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,000
I can't stand him who is good and hardworking.

379
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's not like that, principal.

380
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's like that, principal.

381
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,800
What's wrong with you two?

382
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
You can't clap.

383
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
We both made mistakes.

384
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,000
I made a mistake.

385
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm sorry, Jiang Xiao Xi.

386
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,600
I'm sorry, Lin Qi Le.

387
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,200
I shouldn't have made you angry.

388
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,000
Good.

389
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You are a student of our experimental middle school.

390
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,400
It's good to admit your mistake.

391
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
It's good for the unity.

392
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,600
Goodbye, principal.

393
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
The End

394
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,800
Do you think

395
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
since Li Ying Tao became like a girl,

396
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,800
she can't be understood?

397
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,000
Is it hard to understand?

398
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,600
She just wants to get away from it.

399
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,400
She doesn't want to have anything to do with Jiang Xiao Xi.

400
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
When did you know so much about girls?

401
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,200
You should

402
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
be quiet about the love story.

403
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
You should know

404
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,600
the other 50% of human thoughts in the world.

405
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
She has no sweetseat to date.

406
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,200
She's a girl.

407
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,600
Why isn't it fair?

408
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,600
Why isn't it fair?

409
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,800
Let me see.

410
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,060
How He hanya teo 이중 who he teo songe disinfection o

411
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,560
It may not be a love love story using this name.

412
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,400
The name is a bit strange.

413
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,000
But she's famous now.

414
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Lots of girls in our class will read that.

415
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:31,520
【Hear has a silver inscription on it, a

416
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,200
Yes.

417
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,760
This is his style.

418
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,520
Your computer is not working.

419
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,880
Poor kid.

420
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,440
He can read novels

421
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,520
and also read poems.

422
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,680
Well,

423
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,720
I'll give you

424
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,440
any books you want to read.

425
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,800
Really?

426
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,720
Yes.

427
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,720
Right here.

428
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,320
Use Yu Qiao's computer.

429
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,960
Brother,

430
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,840
don't use my computer

431
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,080
to read something so old.

432
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,600
Yu Jing is only nine years old.

433
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,840
Don't ruin his memory.

434
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,640
I don't need to

435
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,160
bring your Yu Jing.

436
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,800
Walk home.

437
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,520
Here you are.

438
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,040
Let him be.

439
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,480
Aunt Zhang Ping bought this hat.

440
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,400
The competition will start soon,

441
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,480
Coast Guard will come here later

442
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,320
and try the Eastern Fl只是ice ahead.

443
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,040
Qin Yu Ber,

444
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,000
we're talking to you.

445
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,120
No reason.

446
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,600
Yu Jing,

447
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,000
I'll give you an idol.

448
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,920
What idol?

449
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,000
I got a Hero Card,

450
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,440
something very important to me.

451
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,120
Yu Jing, thank you.

452
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,600
Let's go to your room.

453
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,680
As a friend,

454
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,880
I'll tell you a secret, okay?

455
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,720
This...

456
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,240
Let's go.

457
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,240
The competition is about to start.

458
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,160
You don't want to watch it?

459
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,160
Qian Yun.

460
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,560
Are you okay?

461
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
What did she say to you?

462
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,200
What's wrong with you?

463
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,400
I saw Qian Yun in the corridor.

464
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
She left in a fit of anger.

465
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,400
I don't want to talk to her anymore.

466
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,800
What's wrong?

467
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,400
Yu Jing,

468
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,600
you should eat a bag of dry noodles.

469
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
I don't want to talk to her anymore.

470
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,880
You want to stop Qian Yun from eating dry noodles.

471
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,960
When Qian Yun knew it,

472
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,120
she threw it into the room.

473
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,640
She came out shortly after.

474
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,440
Then,

475
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,480
Yu Jing was like this.

476
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,640
Okay, okay.

477
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,400
Don't cry.

478
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,320
Louder.

479
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,040
Is it okay?

480
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,840
Yes, yes.

481
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,160
You can put it down.

482
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,920
It's because its' finished.

483
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,400
Another vegetable!

484
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,360
Help me to level the well.

485
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,200
To make the

486
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,520
Pig's brain smarter.

487
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,160
So,

488
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,840
I'm not able to Melon City's

489
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,400
assessment director.

490
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,720
Go back.

491
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,080
Where is someone spicy?

492
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,720
I'm getting a little worried,

493
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,280
delivery can't start now.

494
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,240
My洗board is a little clean.

495
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,960
I'll get it done immediately.

496
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,880
What did you eat?

497
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,200
T curved noodles.

498
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,040
I didn't see it.

499
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,840
righteous?

500
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,040
What did you say to the head coach yesterday?

501
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,040
I saw you almost hit him.

502
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,560
I don't know why you still want to help him.

503
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,680
I know why Qin Ying is so cool.

504
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,200
I'll watch it. Get up.

505
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,440
No.

506
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,960
The game is not over yet.

507
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,640
Lin Hao.

508
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,240
So what did Qin Yiyun say to Yu Jing?

509
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,440
Why do you ask me?

510
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,280
Ask Qin Yiyun.

511
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,520
When did I hear you talking about it?

512
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
Why are you so nervous?

513
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,160
I'm not talking.

514
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,040
Mi Tao.

515
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,440
Yu Yun came to see you.

516
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,080
I think she's a little upset.

517
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,240
I think you should go in and chat with Mi Tao.

518
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,440
Leave it to me.

519
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,600
Jiang Qiao Xi is not a slow reaction.

520
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,160
I know what you mean.

521
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,120
She doesn't understand.

522
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
What do I mean?

523
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,160
I don't mean anything.

524
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,320
You actually want to say

525
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,560
that the rabbit is you and the cat is Chen Xiaoman.

526
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,920
I...

527
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,840
I said that the rabbit is you and the cat is Chen Xiaoman.

528
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,920
The cat is Chen Xiaoman.

529
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,400
You...

530
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:30,760
You...

531
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,560
You're so mean.

532
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,080
Stop it, Qin Yiyun.

533
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,280
The rabbit is you.

534
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,400
The cat is Chen Xiaoman.

535
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:35,880
You...

536
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,000
You're a rabbit.

537
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,160
What are you doing?

538
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,840
You're a rabbit.

539
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,240
Stop pretending.

540
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
I'm not playing with you.

541
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,400
You—

542
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,720
You tell Chen Xiaoman

543
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,140
to stop mentioning Jiang Qiao Xi

544
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,940
in front of me.

545
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,120
You're so bad.

546
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,120
You think he's the one?

547
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,500
I'm not thinking of him as being good.

548
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,600
No.

549
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,360
In recent since then For the past heartbeat

550
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,420
You've been the only one who tell me

551
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,980
I made a new song

552
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,420
You said

553
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,380
There is only one song

554
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,360
play

555
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,380
Just jump to it

556
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:43,860
Go

557
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,240
I told him that

558
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,160
if you like someone,

559
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,560
you should share your secrets with him.

560
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,520
But he told me the secret.

561
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,240
So I threatened him.

562
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,040
If he likes me,

563
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,600
I'll tell him the secret.

564
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,240
Are you serious?

565
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,440
He's just a kid.

566
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,040
You said that today.

567
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,880
He can't even eat at home today.

568
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,680
Besides,

569
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,640
even if he's not a kid,

570
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,760
he just likes you.

571
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,760
Is there anything wrong with that?

572
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,840
Yes, there is.

573
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,000
He just can't.

574
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,200
But he's a little bit strange to me.

575
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,200
I looks Catherine when she goes round.

576
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Like that.

577
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,440
Why do you know this?

578
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,520
Because I'm not your girlfriend.

579
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,160
Another...

580
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,600
What?

581
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,480
Style, after...

582
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,520
ons?!

583
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,880
Fine.

584
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,560
I'm sorry.

585
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,480
You like cats.

586
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,120
That's because they play with you.

587
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,440
They will scream and

588
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,800
catch rats.

589
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,080
But don't be like them

590
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,200
because they are like Chun Lu.

591
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,960
Is Chun Lu easy to replace?

592
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,840
I didn't ask her to replace Chun Lu.

593
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,360
It's just that when I'm unhappy,

594
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,520
she will be with me

595
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,960
to make me feel better.

596
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,440
She is unhappy.

597
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,520
It has nothing to do with me.

598
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,080
What to do?

599
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,000
You haven't spoken

600
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,960
for a whole day.

601
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,520
I asked him to to clear out 핵白.

602
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,680
He didn't even say anything.

603
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,680
Is he angry now?

604
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,040
Don't ask him.

605
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,720
We are not his instructing insect.

606
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,400
If he was angry,

607
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,400
would you immediately

608
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
read the receive note?

609
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,360
What?

610
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,160
Otherwise,

611
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,120
he would not make it so easy for us.

612
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,000
He must be dead.

613
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,120
Don't worry.

614
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,840
He's in this state.

615
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,120
He's afraid of people.

616
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't know what to say to him.

617
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,600
What are you doing?

618
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,240
Lin Qi Le.

619
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,560
He's writing a novel.

620
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,240
Cai Peng Yuan.

621
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
What are you talking about?

622
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,720
It's called Three Green and Five Green.

623
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,240
You can see it by searching.

624
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,200
Now we have a topic.

625
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,800
You're welcome.

626
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,840
Go away.

627
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,800
Cai Peng Yuan's netizen is called Guan Lan.

628
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,720
He has a website.

629
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,440
He's the leader.

630
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,040
The database is on his computer.

631
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,160
He said he's better than

632
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,720
Qing Yun, Hou Hua Yuan,

633
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,760
Qi Dian.

634
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,200
What do you mean by this expression?

635
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,840
The waves are pushing the waves.

636
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,840
What's so great about their website?

637
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,160
I'm definitely better than them.

638
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,280
I said I can't play games these days.

639
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,040
I'm playing it as a secret move.

640
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:41,800
Oh my god.

641
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,720
I'll help you.

642
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,320
You...

643
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,600
You actually hurt me.

644
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,520
Get out.

645
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,080
Chief.

646
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,520
Guan Lan.

647
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,160
How can Guan Lan talk?

648
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,520
There's a ghost.

649
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,840
Thank you.

650
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,640
I'll check it.

651
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,480
Ah...

652
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,240
Let me open it.

653
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,080
Chief.

654
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,200
will you help

655
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,480
me.

656
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,440
You Then ask finished.

657
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,960
You see,

658
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,400
I asked him to help me.

659
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,760
It was so easy.

660
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,240
��

661
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,120
I just met him.

662
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,320
But he even gave me

663
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,680
the ghost that I've given up.

664
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,360
What's wrong?

665
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,520
Nothing.

666
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,560
You're here.

667
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,040
Are you waiting for me?

668
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,440
I'm here to cook for you.

669
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,400
Good boy.

670
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,960
How are you today?

671
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,080
Are you happy when you're alone?

672
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,560
You...

673
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,840
You should take care of yourself when you're alone.

674
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,600
Eat well.

675
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,120
Be warm.

676
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,920
You're very important to me.

677
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,840
So,

678
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,120
you must be healthy

679
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,960
and happy.

680
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,320
Okay?

681
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,680
You must be happy and relaxed.

682
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,400
Be healthy and safe.

683
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,280
Do you know that?

684
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,040
Because

685
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,360
you're very important to me.

686
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,880
Hurry up.

687
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,280
It's all mud.

688
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,520
It's so hot.

689
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,880
It's so hot.

690
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
Hold it for me.

691
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,800
Hold it.

692
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,360
It's so annoying.

693
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,040
It's raining so hard.

694
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,920
It's so nice to be in the rain.

695
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,480
We can sleep, right, Yinghao?

696
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,840
You two can sleep well.

697
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,160
I can't sleep when it rains.

698
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,800
You're so kind.

699
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,320
You can't sleep in the rain?

700
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,880
It's not that I can't sleep when it rains.

701
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,520
There are always cats in the neighborhood when it rains.

702
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,400
How can I sleep in the late night?

703
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,760
There are cats.

704
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,720
Why didn't you hear me?

705
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,640
Get in the car.

706
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,800
Let's go.

707
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,320
Get in the car.

708
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,920
Hurry up.

709
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,240
Hurry up, Yinghao.

710
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,160
You can leave now.

711
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,280
I have something to take to school.

712
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,240
I'll go with you.

713
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,040
No.

714
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
Meow.

715
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,120
Meow.

716
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Meow.

717
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
Meow.

718
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
Meow.

719
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Meow.

720
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Meow.

721
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,240
Miao Miao.

722
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,480
Miao Miao, don't be afraid.

723
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,080
I'll save you right away.

724
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,200
Don't be afraid. I'm coming.

725
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Come on.

726
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,480
Miao Miao.

727
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
Don't be afraid.

728
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,640
Let's go.

729
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Let's go up.

730
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
Don't be afraid.

731
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,600
Don't be afraid. It's okay.

732
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,960
It's okay. It's okay.

733
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Let's go.

734
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Let's go.

735
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,280
Let's go. Hurry up.

736
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,120
Miao Miao is asking you to go up.

737
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Let's go.

738
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
You're awake.

739
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
Let's go up.

740
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
Let's go.

741
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Let's go.

742
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,360
Miao Miao.

743
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,360
Let's go.

744
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Let's go.

745
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,840
Lin Ying Tao.

746
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
Why are you here?

747
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Why are you here?

748
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,080
Shouldn't I be the one asking this question?

749
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,160
Don't ask.

750
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
You go up with me first.

751
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Hurry up.

752
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Didn't you say

753
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
we're normal students?

754
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
I don't think normal students

755
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
care about their cats

756
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,480
and take this kind of disease.

757
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Is it time for me to go up?

758
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,480
Can you go up with me first?

759
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,160
I should be the one to save my cat.

760
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Why are you here?

761
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,480
You're the only one who has love, right?

762
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Don't be so humble.

763
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,680
You and I can't be normal students.

764
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,480
Everything you've done to me

765
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,080
has already surpassed normal students.

766
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,480
Do you admit it?

767
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,880
I don't.

768
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,880
The more you deny it,

769
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,080
the more certain it is that this is the truth.

770
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
You're being modest.

771
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
I'm being modest?

772
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,480
Okay, I'll be modest.

773
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,480
I'll be modest.

774
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
I'm leaving.

775
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,880
Don't go!

776
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,480
Jiang Qiao Xin, don't go!

777
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Come back!

778
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,080
Fine.

779
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,080
You're Jiang Qiao Xin.

780
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
You're the best in the world.

781
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,680
You're a genius in the art of home-crafting.

782
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,880
You...

783
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
You're handsome.

784
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,080
You have a nice voice.

785
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
That's it?

786
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,680
I'm still tall?

787
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Yes.

788
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
You're tall.

789
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
Am I right?

790
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,880
That's why I'm a little special to you.

791
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,280
But most people will be special to you.

792
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,080
What's so special about you?

793
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,280
What's so gratifying about you?

794
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,680
You're special to me.

795
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,880
I'm just very happy.

796
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
You're happy now.

797
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,880
Can you help me get on the boat?

798
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
Here.

799
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
Give me your hand.

800
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,680
I can't get on it.

801
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
You get off.

802
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,480
I'll carry you up.

803
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,680
I get off?

804
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
Fine.

805
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,280
You're so tall. How can you get off?

806
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,480
Let's go.

807
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,480
You squat.

808
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,680
Be careful.

809
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,480
Here.

810
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,680
How do I get on?

811
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,680
I'll carry you.

812
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,880
Then I'll carry you.

813
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,680
Be careful.

814
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
Be careful.

815
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,080
Come on.

816
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
Pull me up.

817
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
Aren't you tall?

818
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,680
Get on it yourself.

819
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,680
And you're right.

820
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
That's your own business.

821
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,680
You should be in charge.

822
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,080
You don't need me to interfere.

823
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,680
I'm not a talker.

824
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
Lin Yiteng.

825
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,080
I'm Lin Hanchen.

826
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,680
Ning sembi.

827
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,880
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

828
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,880
The sun will rise and set, we'll say goodbye

829
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,880
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

830
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,880
A little cat and I are on the road

831
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:47,880
Many years have passed, the appearance of the past has been blurred

832
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,880
I hold a pen and draw a picture on my finger

833
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,880
I'm going down the hill and singing with you

834
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,880
We accidentally met each other

835
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:12,880
I'm holding the red light in my hand, you hold me like a mountain

836
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,880
The sun is about to turn red

837
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:24,880
You are in my pain, I look at you and say that you are the one

838
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:32,880
At this moment, I understand peace and freedom
