Episode 2

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
These days, you guys

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
will be leaving home

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and going to college.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Today,

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
we're here together

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
to make a small celebration for you guys.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And,

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
you're 18 years old.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Today,

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
you can have a drink.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We can't.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're still students.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't think I don't know.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Who was the one who

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
let us drink

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the five-spice meal in the cabinet?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You guys.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Do you want to drink?

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We want to drink.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We want to drink.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We want to drink.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come on.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're good.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Pour it on.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Forget it.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you don't want to drink, don't laugh.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Where's your cup?

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why didn't you bring it?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You usually don't bring it.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why didn't you bring it?

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
After Jiang Xiao Xie came back last time,

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
he's gone.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Come on.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You guys.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let me tell you.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Although you guys had a drink,

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you still won't drink.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll teach you.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When you drink,

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
your right hand holds the cup.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Your left hand is on the bottom of the cup.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But when you touch the cup,

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
the cup

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
should be lower than the other person's.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Why?

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's to show respect.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Respect.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Respect.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Come on.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Come on.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Cheers.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's drink.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Cheers.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Come on.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're so drunk.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What?

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yun Yun.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Ying Tao.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You can't drink outside.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Do you hear me?

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Girls

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
can't drink at any time.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Do you hear me?

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
When did you hear me?

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm here.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're drunk.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Uncle Cai, we're in.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
All the actors are drunk.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
They're almost as drunk as others.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're so funny.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm kidding.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You guys

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
can go out

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and do anything

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
on your own.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Learn to

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
watch and listen.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
When you encounter problems,

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
think more.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Think more.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Think more.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If you have any problems,

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you have to solve them yourself.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If you can't solve them,

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
come back.

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Tell us.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll say it.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You guys talk.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Talk.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Talk.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll say something too.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Uncle, I hope

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
you guys

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
eat well,

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
sleep well,

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and study well.

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Try to be

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
the best students.

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't worry

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
about your family.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We're here.

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll say it.

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll say it.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Here.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm born to be useful.

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can only rely on the clouds

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
and the sea.

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I wish you guys

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
a bright future.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm a good driver.

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Thank you.

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll say it.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You guys

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
are too serious.

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's fine.

122
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll give you a speech.

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't usually

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
talk much.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But I have to say something today.

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
From now on,

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
you have to take care of yourself

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and live your life.

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I hope you guys

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
meet all good things.

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Nothing bad, right?

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But think about it.

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
How can there be

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
only good things

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in your life

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and nothing bad?

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How can there be

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
nothing bad

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
in your life?

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How can there be

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
nothing bad

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
in your life?

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Right?

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You guys remember.

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The pain

146
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
you feel in your heart

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
will all pass.

148
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Those bad things

149
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
will all

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
pass.

151
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Lastly,

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll say something to you.

153
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The river of your life

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and the pain and joy

155
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
will all become

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
the scenery you want to see.

157
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You will become

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the best scenery in your life.

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Great.

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, now

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll take mom away.

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Wang Xue, say something.

163
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What should I say?

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Come on, get up.

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I won't say it.

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Be good.

167
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Wang Jingjing,

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
why are you crying?

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's a happy day.

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Happy, happy.

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Wait.

172
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Is it because

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
our voice is too loud?

174
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll go open the door.

175
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Ning, Ning,

176
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
your surprise is here.

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Wait.

178
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Surprise?

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Surprise?

180
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What surprise?

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What surprise?

182
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hello.

183
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You, you are...

184
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Come in.

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't leave.

186
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Come in.

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Brother Ming.

188
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You forgot.

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Brother Chen Minghao.

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Brother Minghao.

191
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You've grown up.

192
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Brother Chen Minghao.

193
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Uncle, auntie.

194
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Sit down.

195
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Come on.

196
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Sit down.

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Come on.

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Come on.

199
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You brought so many things.

200
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Brother Minghao.

201
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How are your parents?

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They are fine.

203
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
They are just too busy.

204
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Otherwise, they would have come back with me.

205
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
My parents always say that

206
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Uncle Cai and Aunt Kang

207
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
take special care of my grandparents.

208
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
They said it was not easy for me to come back.

209
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I must come and see you.

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You are always

211
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
always so polite.

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What are you talking about?

213
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Besides,

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you two have to take special care of us.

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If there is anything good,

216
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
we will think of you.

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Minghao.

218
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Where are you staying?

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Australia.

220
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You mean?

221
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Australia?

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Australia?

223
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
How much money

224
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
does it cost to study abroad?

225
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It depends on the school and the region.

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There is a big difference

227
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
between the different places.

228
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can apply for a scholarship

229
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
after finishing this course.

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Dad, don't be so nosy.

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Studying abroad is also going to school.

232
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm not interested.

233
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Brother Minghao.

234
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Have you been abroad

235
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
alone all these years?

236
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes, I have.

237
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes, I'm alone.

238
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Is it convenient to eat

239
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
when you are abroad alone?

240
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Can you make friends?

241
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Are you not used to

242
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
speaking other people's language?

243
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
My dad is actually fine.

244
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But those who study hard

245
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and study hard are more difficult.

246
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I have to work

247
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
to earn money to study.

248
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
My parents

249
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
forbid me from working.

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If I go out to study,

251
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I will study hard.

252
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They also rent me an apartment

253
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
outside the school.

254
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can take my friends

255
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to have a party on weekends.

256
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a lot of money.

257
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Your parents are so nice.

258
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yungang.

259
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I heard that you went to the north

260
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to study in college.

261
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You were so sweet when you were a kid.

262
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You wore a red glass bead

263
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and ran with a girl

264
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
behind me.

265
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Now you are in such a good college.

266
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You are really good.

267
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Thank you.

268
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But I'm not a glass bead.

269
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm a tiger.

270
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Minghao, eat more.

274
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Have some more.

275
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Here, eat more.

276
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm leaving.

277
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You can go back.

278
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Bye.

279
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Be careful.

280
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Bye.

281
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Bye.

282
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Why do you suddenly

283
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
want to call Minghao back?

284
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Is this the surprise

285
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
you gave to Li Yunhao?

286
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Du Shanhai, explain.

287
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why do we

288
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
prepare such a surprise?

289
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yuntao,

290
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
have you forgotten?

291
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
When we were young,

292
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
when we sent Minghao together,

293
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
when we were in the senior year,

294
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
your tears were about to dry.

295
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You were screaming.

296
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The whole mountain could hear you.

297
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But you saw him today.

298
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You couldn't recognize him either.

299
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So,

300
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
feel the college life.

301
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What if one day

302
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
you think of that person

303
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and his reaction is the same as now?

304
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Really?

305
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Of course.

306
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What?

307
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He's Jiang Xiaoxi.

308
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What?

309
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You two

310
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
really think you're smart enough to come home?

311
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No.

312
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's okay.

313
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What do you mean?

314
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why are you walking so fast?

315
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I just think

316
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
if it weren't for Jiang Xiaoxi,

317
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I wouldn't have

318
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
started studying so hard when I left the college.

319
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I wouldn't have gotten into the first year of the internship

320
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and the university entrance exam.

321
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Your topic

322
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
is a bit sudden.

323
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm afraid I'll forget.

324
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Where did she go?

325
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't know.

326
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's okay.

327
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll help you figure it out.

328
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Besides,

329
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
she has to go to school.

330
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There must be news about her.

331
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I agree.

332
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
By the way,

333
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Lin Yingtao,

334
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
the north air and the north city

335
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
are not more than three kilometers away.

336
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We only have one day difference in the report.

337
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why don't you want to go with me?

338
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I want to feel

339
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
that I'm going to a new place

340
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
after I leave my hometown.

341
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What kind of feeling is it?

342
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yingtao,

343
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think Jiang Xiaoxi

344
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
is quite a

345
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
lovely girl.

346
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Look,

347
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
before she went to Hong Kong,

348
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
she gave you lipstick

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and red high heels.

350
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
After you were eighteen,

351
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
you're not a girl anymore.

352
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You're slowly becoming a woman.

353
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Lipstick and high heels are all

354
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
a woman's standard.

355
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
She's going to take you

356
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
as a woman

357
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and take over you completely.

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
She's so cool.

359
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yes.

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
She wants you to remember her forever.

361
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Jiang Xiaoxi is a good girl.

362
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
She's very smart.

363
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yingtao,

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
don't forget me.

365
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Why do you all

366
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
want me to forget her?

367
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We want you to be happier.

368
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You should be happy.

369
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll be happy.

370
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
When?

371
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You and Yuqiao went to Hong Kong

372
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and didn't ask her

373
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
to go out with you.

374
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Actually, Yuqiao is quite good.

375
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He's better than Jiang Xiaoxi.

376
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What are you talking about?

377
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I can imagine.

378
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yuqiao is a pilot.

379
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He must be a woman

380
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
who has a lot of girls.

381
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You can't keep your beauty.

382
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's better to keep it for others

383
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
than for you.

384
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

385
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Don't worry about me.

386
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I look like this.

387
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You can pick whatever you want

388
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
when you go to college.

389
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Those who treat me well,

390
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
buy me high heels and lipstick,

391
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
they're all not under the picture.

392
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But you,

393
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
besides your grades,

394
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
appearance,

395
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
body, intelligence, EQ,

396
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and other conditions,

397
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't care.

398
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Why are you scolding me

399
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
when you sleep on my bed?

400
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why are you scolding me?

401
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Stop sleeping here.

402
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Go back.

403
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm going home.

404
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'll see if you don't sleep.

405
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay, I surrender.

406
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I surrender.

407
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm wrong.

408
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Jin Xiaoyu,

409
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
this time

410
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
only you stay.

411
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We're all leaving.

412
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Will you be sad?

413
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
All of you have left,

414
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
but I stay.

415
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What I'm sad about is not your mother.

416
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There's no one here.

417
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm really here.

418
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What are you doing here?

419
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm here.

420
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You shouldn't stay here.

421
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You shouldn't.

422
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,240
You're a person

423
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,960
who makes me feel bad.

424
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,320
Since you were a kid,

425
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,120
you seemed to be fearless

426
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,760
and carefree.

427
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,320
But the more you're like this,

428
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,920
the more we worry.

429
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,280
Let's go to sleep.

430
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,160
You have to catch a cold tomorrow.

431
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,760
Let's go.

432
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,040
I feel

433
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,400
I'll never like someone so much again.

434
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
You're 18 years old.

435
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,720
Don't say forever.

436
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,160
That's not true!

437
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,840
Jiang Jiangxin.

438
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,400
Will you call me

439
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
after we clear the city?

440
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I didn't hit you.

441
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,880
Ying Tao,

442
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,720
I'm sorry.

443
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,680
Jiang Jiang Xi!

444
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,640
Jiang Jiang Xi,

445
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,240
where are you going?

446
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,800
Come back.

447
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,400
Listen,

448
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm not that good.

449
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,520
I'll really forget you.

450
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,400
Jiang Jiang Xi!

451
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,220
He'll pick up before I left.

452
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,820
Fine, shoot.

453
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,020
Okay now.

454
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,580
Go on.

455
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,100
Again.

456
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,260
To the center.

457
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,940
Keep the contact.

458
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,860
Good.

459
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:12,760
Irene.

460
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,300
Excuse me.

461
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:33,640
Hmm...

462
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Help me please.

463
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,520
It'll help from the elevator.

464
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,560
Thank you.

465
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,840
You're in a good mood.

466
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,120
Who are you?

467
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
Sorry, senior.

468
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,400
I'm Lin Qi Le, a freshman in the 2008 grade.

469
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,840
Senior,

470
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,560
I woke you up.

471
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,200
Sorry.

472
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,600
Turn on the light first.

473
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,840
Hurry up.

474
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,920
Hurry up.

475
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,440
It's okay.

476
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,280
Let me help you.

477
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,640
Help me take it.

478
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,880
It's heavy.

479
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,080
Let me help you.

480
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,000
Whose is it?

481
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,800
I'll help you.

482
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,200
You take it.

483
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,960
I'll take it.

484
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,760
What are you taking?

485
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,680
Where are you from?

486
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,320
I'm from home.

487
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,120
I'm from home.

488
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,320
Let me help you.

489
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,680
I brought my property.

490
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Whose is it?

491
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,000
You spilled it.

492
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,480
Who didn't finish drinking?

493
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,320
Mo Li Jun.

494
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,920
Enough.

495
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,720
Stop arguing.

496
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,640
It's annoying.

497
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,560
Sit down.

498
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:08,880
Sit down.

499
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,560
Don't rush.

500
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,680
Why are you living with the senior?

501
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,720
Can you tell the counselor?

502
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,040
It's better to live with your classmate.

503
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,480
You can get used to it.

504
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,880
The senior

505
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,720
grew up with you.

506
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,840
You don't have to live with him.

507
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,560
It's okay.

508
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,080
I live with the senior.

509
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,000
It's good.

510
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,840
If I have any problems with my academic background,

511
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,280
I can ask them for help.

512
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,400
Yes.

513
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,760
That's right.

514
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,720
You can live with the seniors.

515
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,520
Get along with them.

516
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,400
Be more active.

517
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,960
If you feel uncomfortable,

518
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,800
you can call me.

519
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,120
I know.

520
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,720
And...

521
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,080
Did you buy the pens on the bed?

522
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,880
Remember.

523
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,720
The back.

524
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,160
The one with the quilt.

525
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
You must buy the good ones.

526
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,240
The quality is better.

527
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,920
You must see the cotton.

528
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,080
It can't be dark.

529
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,200
And the pillow.

530
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,080
You must buy the cheap ones.

531
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
The background is good.

532
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,320
And the first cup of water

533
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,480
is very important for your health.

534
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,280
It's for detoxification.

535
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,080
Have some water.

536
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,600
Did your mom tell you about it?

537
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,960
She knew it.

538
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,080
She knew it was a mistake.

539
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,160
She said I would pour her water in the morning.

540
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,520
If you don't tell her,

541
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,080
she won't put it on her chest.

542
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,720
She's full.

543
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,120
She's not a kid anymore.

544
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,440
That's because I didn't have time to pour it myself.

545
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,040
So you brought it to me.

546
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,920
Okay. I know.

547
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,360
Don't worry about me.

548
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,280
I can do it.

549
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,120
I...

550
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,000
I have to go to the training ground this afternoon.

551
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,200
I'll go and pack up.

552
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,480
Okay.

553
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,520
That's all. Bye.

554
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,680
Be safe.

555
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,440
Bye.

556
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,120
Bye.

557
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,520
Right turn.

558
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,640
Little Sui Fu.

559
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,800
Right turn.

560
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,240
Be careful.

561
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,360
Right turn.

562
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,840
Left turn.

563
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,680
Don't move.

564
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,800
Who told you to move?

565
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,240
What's wrong with you?

566
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,560
Sir.

567
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,720
I'm dizzy.

568
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,080
Are you really dizzy or are you pretending to be?

569
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,160
I've been feeling unwell these days.

570
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,240
My head hurts a lot.

571
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,600
Come on. Help her.

572
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,400
Shu Lie.

573
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,040
Take her to the infirmary.

574
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,800
Other staff.

575
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,000
Are you okay?

576
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,960
Listen to the order.

577
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,040
Right turn.

578
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,320
I'm fine.

579
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,160
I'm fine. Hold on.

580
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,600
I'm going to the infirmary.

581
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,920
Slow down.

582
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,040
Slow down.

583
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,800
Good.

584
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,920
One more time.

585
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,440
Right turn.

586
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,640
Let's go back, okay?

587
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
You're fine.

588
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
I'm dizzy.

589
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,640
You're dizzy too.

590
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,480
Right?

591
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,120
I'm not dizzy.

592
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,760
Don't move.

593
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,400
I'm dizzy.

594
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,680
I'm dizzy.

595
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,960
You're really not dizzy.

596
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,000
Hurry up.

597
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,960
Hurry up, okay?

598
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,720
Right turn.

599
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,120
Left turn.

600
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,920
Right turn.

601
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,640
Sir.

602
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,680
I'm back.

603
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,440
Good luck.

604
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Everyone.

605
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,760
Right turn.

606
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,920
Right turn.

607
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,760
One, two, one.

608
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,640
One, two, one.

609
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,080
Sir.

610
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,800
Yes.

611
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,120
I think I have a cold.

612
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
I'm dizzy.

613
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,880
Come out.

614
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,960
Look forward. Lift your head.

615
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,200
Sir.

616
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,800
Yes.

617
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,120
My stomach hurts.

618
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,640
Come out.

619
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,480
Right.

620
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,560
Each one of you.

621
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,880
Stand up or not.

622
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,320
Some of you.

623
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,560
Lies.

624
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
Steal.

625
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,000
But there are some examples in our team.

626
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
For example, Lin Qi Le.

627
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,520
Such a weak girl.

628
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,960
From the first day.

629
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,680
Stand until now.

630
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,400
This is the example you learned.

631
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,600
Lift your head.

632
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,040
Gosh.

633
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,920
Push, push, push.

634
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,360
Already want to die.

635
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,120
Push it really hard.

636
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,440
Beautiful.

637
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,880
Someone called.

638
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,440
Come with me.

639
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,740
You have to give us some advice.

640
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,840
I'm afraid you won't like the style.

641
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,380
After all, it's best to find a way.

642
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,760
So you see them now.

643
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,440
Since it's an acoustic,

644
00:25:52,700 --> 00:26:14,080
they can be both

645
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,740
smaller and presence moreever.

646
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,860
Are you also more cancelled?

647
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,540
Stop.

648
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,140
I can stop.

649
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,060
Have you heard

650
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,340
the story of the dormitory at the end of the corridor?

651
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,780
End of corridor?

652
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,060
We are at the end of corridor.

653
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,100
What do you mean?

654
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,260
I've never heard of it.

655
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,580
This is a real story.

656
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,980
About ten years ago,

657
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,460
the dormitory at the end of corridor

658
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,700
was never allowed to be lived in.

659
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,540
The door was always closed.

660
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,580
The teacher said it was a storage room.

661
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,940
It was summer vacation.

662
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,100
Xiao Heng was living in a dormitory

663
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,220
because of the poor conditions at home.

664
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,500
He was studying and working part-time.

665
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,940
One night, it was raining.

666
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,420
He went back to the dormitory.

667
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:22,420
He found the lights were on at the end of the corridor.

668
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,380
He thought

669
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,500
there was no one living in the dormitory.

670
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,020
So he walked slowly.

671
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,020
He looked inside and found

672
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,780
a mirror facing him.

673
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,820
He saw another person's face inside.

674
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,260
He was only one meter tall.

675
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,900
Only half of his body was there.

676
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,460
It turned out

677
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,380
he was cut off.

678
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,780
You scared me.

679
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,620
That was 준 killer.

680
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,700
Are you not scared?

681
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,580
Yes.

682
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,500
Please don't be afraid.

683
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,940
I'm not afraid.

684
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,140
You look Qué destroying.

685
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,540
Actually,

686
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,340
I can tell ghost stories, too.

687
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,540
Do you want to hear it?

688
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,940
Have you heard

689
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,300
the story of a good friend being abandoned?

690
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,060
Qiqi and Yueyue

691
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,540
are two good friends

692
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,220
living in the same dormitory.

693
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,060
They live in Shangxia Pu.

694
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,580
They talk to each other

695
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,700
until very late every night.

696
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,420
One day,

697
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,340
they talked about

698
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,300
the story of the school on July 15th.

699
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,740
It is said that on July 15th,

700
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,540
a good friend

701
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,180
killed each other

702
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,860
for a small matter.

703
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,100
Since then,

704
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,100
every year on July 15th,

705
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,380
everyone will hear

706
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,820
the noise in the dormitory.

707
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,180
Qiqi and Yueyue decided

708
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,660
to go to the dormitory

709
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,420
to have a look.

710
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,100
However,

711
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,540
a few days before July 15th,

712
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,260
Yueyue suddenly disappeared.

713
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,780
Qiqi waited for her for a long time.

714
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,300
By midnight,

715
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,700
Yueyue hadn't come back.

716
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,020
Suddenly, the phone rang.

717
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,980
There was no sound on the phone.

718
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,860
Qiqi said,

719
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,260
Hello, Yueyue.

720
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,420
Yueyue.

721
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,580
Say something.

722
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,020
The sound of Youyou was heard on the phone.

723
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,180
I'm so cold.

724
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,860
Qiqi thought it was a prank

725
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,020
and hung up.

726
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,820
However, the next day,

727
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,380
at midnight,

728
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,940
Yueyue called again.

729
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,780
I'm so cold.

730
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,860
The third day,

731
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,060
the fourth day,

732
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,300
and the seventh day.

733
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,380
On July 15th,

734
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,300
Yueyue called again.

735
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,820
Qiqi couldn't help saying,

736
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,900
Yueyue, come back.

737
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,780
Stop playing tricks on me.

738
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,020
At that time, Yueyue said,

739
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,620
I've been here all the time.

740
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,500
My good friend,

741
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,060
I'm sorry.

742
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,100
Qiqi was so scared.

743
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,940
She quickly sent it back to the quilt.

744
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,620
But she couldn't fall asleep.

745
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,260
She turned around.

746
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,700
She turned around.

747
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,540
Suddenly, she saw Yueyue.

748
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,340
But it wasn't Yueyue.

749
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,060
It was Yueyue's

750
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,820
skin.

751
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,180
At that time, the sound came from the ear.

752
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,100
I said I've been here all the time.

753
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,180
My good friend,

754
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,060
I'm sorry.

755
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,780
My good friend,

756
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,620
look at me.

757
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,140
Xunmei,

758
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,740
your story is pretty good.

759
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,220
It's better than mine.

760
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,300
I remember,

761
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,060
tell it to my boyfriend next time.

762
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,620
I'm going to sleep.

763
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,660
Go to sleep.

764
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,980
I've heard this kind of story a lot.

765
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,180
It's boring.

766
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:57,820
Yes, yes.

767
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,540
I have class tomorrow.

768
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,380
Today is the first day I live in the dorm.

769
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,900
But the students in the dorm want to drive me away.

770
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,580
They told a ghost story in the afternoon.

771
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,820
I'm not only not afraid,

772
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,740
I was also scared.

773
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,740
Jiang Xiaoxi,

774
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,100
are you okay?

775
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,220
Is the person around you good to you?

776
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,900
What are you doing?

777
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,700
I want him to go to the bathroom with me.

778
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,420
Hello, Xunmei.

779
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,780
Go to the bathroom with me.

780
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,420
What, Xun?

781
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,740
Go to the bathroom.

782
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,980
I'm fine.

783
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,300
I'm fine.

784
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,460
I'm fine.

785
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,260
I'm fine.

786
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,060
I'm fine.

787
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,940
I'm fine.

788
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,820
I'm fine.

789
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,700
I'm fine.

790
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,980
I'm fine.

791
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,060
I'm fine, Senior.

792
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,980
Hurry up.

793
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,860
Hurry up.

794
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,420
Hurry up.

795
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,340
No, no, no.

796
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,020
I'm so scared.

797
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,100
I'm so scared.

798
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,780
No.

799
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,860
Lin Xunfei.

800
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,060
Let's sleep together today.

801
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,100
It's not impossible.

802
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
Let's sleep.

803
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,860
Are you very, very afraid?

804
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,220
Very afraid.

805
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,100
But I found that you

806
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,740
are not afraid of telling a ghost story at all.

807
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,260
I actually have a curse.

808
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
What curse?

809
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,340
Ghost.

810
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,180
If you're here,

811
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,220
please turn on the light for me.

812
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,940
What kind of curse?

813
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,380
A ghost curse.

814
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,740
No.

815
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,980
Think about it.

816
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,100
If the ghost can turn on the light for you,

817
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,300
it means that he is a kind ghost.

818
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,500
He won't harm you.

819
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,860
If he didn't turn on the light,

820
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,020
it means that he is a little ghost who is incapable.

821
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,340
He won't harm you.

822
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,100
Where did you hear that?

823
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,740
My dad told me.

824
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,500
To be honest,

825
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,780
it's just psychological comfort.

826
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,580
Then you're also afraid, right?

827
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,340
It's not really related to the world.

828
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,660
It seems to make sense.

829
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,060
I'll try it.

830
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,820
Ghost.

831
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,260
If you're here,

832
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,380
turn on the light for me.

833
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,300
You two.

834
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,220
You're on the same bed.

835
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,540
I'm afraid you won't sleep at night.

836
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,580
You're a ghost. Why are you talking to me?

837
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,700
Who is talking to me?

838
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,220
Get up.

839
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,620
You ghosts are also a few cowardly ghosts.

840
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,700
You said you wanted to scare others and scared yourself like this.

841
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
You're speechless.

842
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,780
Come on.

843
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,180
Sisters.

844
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,700
I was scared of you.

845
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,860
I should apologize to you.

846
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,740
But you were wrong first.

847
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,180
You scared me by telling a ghost story first.

848
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,300
See?

849
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,940
This kid is so stubborn.

850
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,500
You have to scare us

851
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,940
if we don't scare you.

852
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,660
I want to tell you this attitude.

853
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,340
I'm not easy to make trouble.

854
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,540
You can't drive me away.

855
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,260
Drive you away?

856
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,540
Why would we chase you away?

857
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,500
Yeah.

858
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,940
You're so cute.

859
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,940
You're so fun.

860
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,500
We can't even love you.

861
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,580
Why would we chase you away?

862
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,740
How could you...

863
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,060
I heard it.

864
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,860
I heard it outside the door.

865
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,980
You said you didn't like such a roommate.

866
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,500
You didn't want such a roommate.

867
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,860
You said you wanted to find a way to chase me away.

868
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,860
Then I didn't dare to come back.

869
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,980
I stayed downstairs alone.

870
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,180
I stayed in the dorm and closed the door.

871
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,140
That's why I came up.

872
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,820
I thought you were asleep.

873
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,820
So I went to bed.

874
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,940
But when I lay down,

875
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,820
you started telling me ghost stories.

876
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,620
What are you laughing at?

877
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,060
So,

878
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,580
you broke the promise and hurt me.

879
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,900
Is it the end of the military training today?

880
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,900
Is Lin Xuanmei coming back?

881
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,580
Listen.

882
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,740
We shouldn't have

883
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,740
been so noisy in front of people that day.

884
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,020
Don't be a little girl.

885
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,660
We didn't drink on that day.

886
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,380
We were drunk.

887
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,700
I think he's always quiet.

888
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,660
He won't be afraid of us in the future.

889
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,860
He doesn't want to move out, does he?

890
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,820
It's not impossible.

891
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,980
If it were me,

892
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,780
I wouldn't want such a roommate.

893
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,700
Then,

894
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,220
think of something.

895
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,380
Do you want to do something interesting?

896
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,340
Something that will make you feel better?

897
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,980
What do you mean?

898
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,180
The effect of hanging the bridge

899
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,260
is also called

900
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,020
the effect of pulling the bridge.

901
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,420
It's a psychological effect.

902
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,780
Its principle is

903
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,700
when people experience fear

904
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,380
or excitement,

905
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,460
when they are in a strong state of emotion,

906
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,620
their body will produce

907
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,300
something like a heart beat faster,

908
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,340
blood pressure rises,

909
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
breathing accelerates.

910
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,700
This kind of physiological emotional reaction

911
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,620
will be misunderstood by all objects

912
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,420
as a attraction for the current companion.

913
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,500
This is not difficult.

914
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,460
Let's tell him a ghost story.

915
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,900
When his heart beats faster,

916
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,180
his blood pressure rises,

917
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,500
Meng Li Xun, you,

918
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,340
you should be his close senior.

919
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,780
Let him sleep with you.

920
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,500
After one night,

921
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,020
you two have slept together.

922
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,780
You must have made up your mind.

923
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,980
What?

924
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,860
Why are you like this?

925
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,500
You...

926
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,780
You are all senior sisters.

927
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,340
How can you be so childish?

928
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,220
So what?

929
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,380
But you are a good person.

930
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,980
You think we are going to drive you away

931
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,940
and sleep with me

932
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,540
in the bathroom?

933
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,220
Senior,

934
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,620
do you like me?

935
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,020
Do you like me?

936
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,180
I think you like me.

937
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,860
I think this bridge-hanging effect

938
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,340
is pretty stupid.

939
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,380
Right?

940
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,540
Yes.

941
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,500
It makes sense.

942
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,420
I tell you.

943
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,420
Next time I will find someone

944
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,740
who can use this trick

945
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,580
to take it down.

946
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,340
You are so silly.

947
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,180
Really.

948
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,700
Lin Tao, look.

949
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,540
You are watching the show again.

950
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,740
It's more lively than the Spring Festival Gala every night.

951
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,260
What's wrong?

952
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:13,940
Let's go.

953
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:15,980
What's wrong?

954
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,780
Let's go.

955
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,380
Li Jun,

956
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,700
call Sisi for me.

957
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,180
You can't take boys when you are in the show.

958
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:21,860
Okay.

959
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,660
Li Jun,

960
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,820
you are not looking for me.

961
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,060
Then who are you looking for?

962
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,500
Sisi's boyfriend.

963
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,300
He is a show-off.

964
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,780
He had a fight with Sisi.

965
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,060
Did he come to apologize?

966
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,500
It's not that simple.

967
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,700
It's a big deal.

968
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,540
Shi Zhan wants to go back to Shandong

969
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,580
to take the exam.

970
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,540
Sisi wants to go back to Suzhou

971
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,940
to take the civil service exam.

972
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,540
Shi Zhan wants Sisi

973
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,060
to marry him.

974
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,900
Sisi wants to break up with Shi Zhan.

975
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,820
I haven't heard Sisi mention it.

976
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,420
She doesn't want to mention it.

977
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,540
I can't tell her.

978
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,740
Didn't we drink too much

979
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,900
on the day you came?

980
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,740
It's just a second.

981
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,900
Is he still downstairs?

982
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,020
Yes.

983
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,540
Come here.

984
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,860
Hurry up.

985
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:51,940
Sisi.

986
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,300
Sisi.

987
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,820
What do you mean?

988
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,020
Love is a matter of two people.

989
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,060
It's not up to you to decide.

990
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,140
Shanshan.

991
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,900
This is...

992
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,260
This is...

993
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,500
It's okay.

994
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,740
I'll tell him

995
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,300
not to be moved by it.

996
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,100
Anyway,

997
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,900
I've thought about it

998
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,020
when I was with him.

999
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,020
We must break up after graduation.

1000
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,420
It's only been a year.

1001
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,860
You guys can go ahead.

1002
00:42:59,300 --> 00:42:59,900
I...

1003
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,380
I'll stay here for a while.

1004
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,220
Here.

1005
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:36,500
Wand

1006
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:42,220
The north wind blows and I can't find where I want to go

1007
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,700
Once in a dream

1008
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,220
I think of the sea and look at it

1009
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,820
But I hear the sound of the dream

1010
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,780
Pass through the darkness

1011
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,420
Unusual power

1012
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,660
My dream

1013
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,380
I want to release

1014
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,740
I want to let you see

1015
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,740
The light that shines in my heart

1016
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,420
I want to sing

1017
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,660
I want to sing for you

1018
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,500
My loneliness and confusion

1019
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,180
I want to forget

1020
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:31,380
I want to forget the ordinary growth of the past

1021
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,860
One more time

1022
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:40,220
Moving연

1023
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:43,020
A memory

1024
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:49,180
In theично

1025
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:57,580
I'm looking to the side

1026
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:05,580
Through the darkness, the extraordinary power

1027
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:12,580
My dream, I want to let go

1028
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:19,580
I want to let you see my heart's shining light

1029
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,580
I want to sing, I want to sing for you

1030
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,580
My loneliness and confusion

1031
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:33,580
I want to forget, I want to forget the usual growth

1032
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:43,580
In the clouds, in the distance
