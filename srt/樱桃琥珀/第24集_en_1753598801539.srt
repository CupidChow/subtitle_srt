00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
canonical

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you okay?

61
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,380
Miss à la Shouldn't know

62
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,920
Miss à la Shouldn't know

63
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,300
Miss à la Shouldn't know

64
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,800
Shota

65
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,100
Hurry up

66
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,600
Can you

67
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,240
No.

68
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,360
Then,

69
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,760
if you need anything,

70
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,080
I won't ask you.

71
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,760
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

72
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,720
Wait.

73
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,680
It's fine.

74
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,720
I'm on my way.

75
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,040
I'll call you if need me.

76
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,240
You've been preparing

77
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,880
for your internship at the college.

78
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,120
How's it going?

79
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,720
Not bad.

80
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,280
I told you

81
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm taking a 11-year-old class.

82
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,960
I think

83
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,200
they must still like

84
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
I'm old enough to listen to fairy tales.

85
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,200
So today, I'm going to watch a fairy tale episode from different countries.

86
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,200
I want to find something interesting and fresh to listen to.

87
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Did you see anything interesting today?

88
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Can you tell me about it first?

89
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Do you have to listen to fairy tales with your friends?

90
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Yes.

91
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,200
I read a book called The Window of the Fox.

92
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,200
If you put your hand together into a fox's window,

93
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,200
you can see anything you want through this window.

94
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Anything I want?

95
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Yes.

96
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
How should I compare this window?

97
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
It's a bit complicated.

98
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Left hand on the back of the hand, right hand on the heart.

99
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,200
The middle finger of the right hand and the ring finger of the left hand are pressing the index finger.

100
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
It's a bit like a tongue twister.

101
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
You have to put your fingers together, and there's a window in the middle.

102
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
It's really complicated.

103
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,200
I'll teach you when we meet again.

104
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Okay.

105
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Are you sure you can see what I want to see most?

106
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Of course.

107
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Do you believe in Mr. Lin?

108
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
I believe.

109
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
What about you?

110
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
What do you want to see most now?

111
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Do I have to ask?

112
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Jiang Qiaoxi.

113
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Jiang Qiaoxi.

114
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Come to the balcony.

115
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,200
With your fox's window,

116
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,200
you may see what you want to see.

117
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
The wish you said

118
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
The shadow of familiar is getting longer

119
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Your outline is so gentle beyond the sight

120
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,200
The world is turning

121
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,200
The breeze is blowing

122
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,200
The scenery in the window

123
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Is like yesterday's morning

124
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
The past is in front of you

125
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,200
The future is in your hands

126
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,200
You're the key to who I am

127
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Be with me and become myself

128
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,200
The night sky is long

129
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,200
My strong wind is so loud

130
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I can't stop running

131
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,200
The dream in my heart is calling

132
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,200
You're the spark in all my dreams

133
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Be with you and become yourself

134
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,200
The wind is blowing

135
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,200
The future is in your hands

136
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,200
The past is in your hands

137
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm going to dance.

138
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
Jiang Qiaoxi.

139
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,200
You scared me.

140
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
You're up so early.

141
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
I smell the fragrance.

142
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
You're not getting thinner, are you?

143
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I feel like you've lost weight.

144
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Really?

145
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Yes.

146
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
I didn't feed you well.

147
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
I didn't feed you well?

148
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Look at what you ate.

149
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
I'm full.

150
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
I'll go first.

151
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
How is it?

152
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Okay, you eat first.

153
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
I have to go to the office.

154
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
You're going to the office again?

155
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
The market is better these two days.

156
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,200
So the boss wants to steal more companies.

157
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I happened to meet a small company this morning.

158
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
I have to go over and talk.

159
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
I'm a little tired.

160
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
You remember to tell me when you slept last night.

161
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,200
4.30 p.m. last night.

162
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Now? 8.30 p.m.

163
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
You slept for four hours.

164
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Hello.

165
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
I read the email. I know everything.

166
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
OK.

167
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I'll come over when I'm done.

168
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
I understand.

169
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,200
If their founders are all college students,

170
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
don't make the atmosphere very serious.

171
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Listen to their ideas.

172
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Yin Tao, I'm going out.

173
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Wait, wait, wait.

174
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,200
You just graduated and you say you're a college student.

175
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
When will you come back?

176
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
At night.

177
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
I'll come back as early as possible.

178
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
At night?

179
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Bye.

180
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Qi Yue.

181
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Yin Tao, you're 25 years old.

182
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Aren't you ashamed?

183
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
You and Jiang Qiaoxin are in the same place.

184
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Jiang Qiaoxin didn't come.

185
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
We're on the same boat.

186
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Don't mention it.

187
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,200
She said that the investment market is good recently.

188
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Her company asked her to go to meetings every day.

189
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Now she's with Mr. Shang.

190
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
She's so focused on the financial market.

191
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
She has no time to care about that.

192
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Jiang Qiaoxin doesn't even care about her own wedding.

193
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
She doesn't come home every day.

194
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Is she in trouble?

195
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
What are you talking about?

196
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Yes.

197
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
You called me for the first time four years ago.

198
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Four years ago?

199
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Four years.

200
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
It's time.

201
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
What are you talking about, Qin Yeyun?

202
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
What?

203
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
The truth.

204
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
A man.

205
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Thank you.

206
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Don't you know what kind of person he is?

207
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Every time he comes home late from work,

208
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
he comes back to make breakfast for me.

209
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Sometimes he comes to work before I wake up.

210
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
But the food in the pot is hot.

211
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
What are you talking about?

212
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
What did he say?

213
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
He said you like to cook.

214
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Who would he cook for when he made you breakfast?

215
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
You can't talk about it, can you?

216
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
I'll throw it away.

217
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I don't believe it either.

218
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
You actually started to do the game industry.

219
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I know that this financing is a great risk for our company.

220
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
But once I succeed,

221
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
I can turn all the impossible in my mind into possible.

222
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
If we fail,

223
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
I won't give up anything.

224
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
You've read the contract with Mr. Yang.

225
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Have you read it carefully?

226
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Contract?

227
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Actually, I don't know much about contracts.

228
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
My colleagues are reading our contracts.

229
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,200
But they said they wanted to make an agreement.

230
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,200
You mean we have to sign a contract with them

231
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,200
to lower their sales price by providing us with discounts.

232
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,200
As an exchange, the company will increase their investment.

233
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
If we really do that,

234
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,200
their shares will be overestimated.

235
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
That's what they should consider.

236
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
I think it's important.

237
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
A small company with core technology

238
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
and a new game industry

239
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
can also make a lot of topics.

240
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,200
In the future, we can be the first to sell high-end.

241
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
These companies are here to cooperate with us.

242
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,200
It must be a better development in the future.

243
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
If we really do that,

244
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
will it be unfair?

245
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,200
It's the best result at all costs.

246
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
As a financial person,

247
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
this is the simplest rule.

248
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Winson,

249
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
you should know what's most important.

250
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
It's good for you and me.

251
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,200
He forgot about the wedding venue.

252
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
He went to work overtime today.

253
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Jiang Xiaoxi is so insensible.

254
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Ning Tao, wait for him.

255
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
When I see him,

256
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I'll teach him a good lesson.

257
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Okay, you can talk to him.

258
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Xing, I'm back.

259
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Come here.

260
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Come here.

261
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm talking to Jiang Xiaoxi.

262
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Hurry up.

263
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
What are you doing?

264
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Come here.

265
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
I bought vegetables.

266
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm talking to Jiang Xiaoxi.

267
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Dad.

268
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
You're back?

269
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Yes, I just got off work.

270
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Dad,

271
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
how are you in Africa?

272
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm fine.

273
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
I'm fine, too.

274
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
You're fine, too, right?

275
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
I'm fine, too.

276
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Dad, I'm going to cook.

277
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Hurry up and cook.

278
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Make some delicious food for Ning Tao.

279
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Take care of yourself.

280
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Okay, I got it.

281
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
What are you in a hurry to cook?

282
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
I'm not hungry.

283
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Hello, your flowers are here.

284
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
I didn't buy you flowers.

285
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,200
This is my favorite cherry blossom.

286
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I'm not happy with the flowers I gave you.

287
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
I know what day it is today.

288
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Today is the sixth day we met.

289
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Sixteen years.

290
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Let's eat.

291
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Ning Tao, what's wrong with you?

292
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Actually, I'm not in a hurry to get married.

293
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
You've been saying that

294
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Aunt Juan's breakfast is only for the family.

295
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Is it the family that calls the aunt Juan's mother?

296
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
She forced me to get the certificate at my age.

297
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Then she asked me to hold a wedding.

298
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
But it's too late.

299
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
You forgot it yourself.

300
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Oh, sorry, I forgot.

301
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Today is the day we choose the wedding venue.

302
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I really forgot.

303
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm too busy.

304
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

305
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
I remember now.

306
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I promise you that if there is such a thing next time,

307
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
I will definitely not forget.

308
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,200
I'll come back and sing with you as long as I have time.

309
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
You have time to come back and sing with me.

310
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
You're not going to work.

311
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Isn't this deeply reflecting your own mistakes?

312
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Big powder water.

313
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Is it sensitive again?

314
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,200
If you want to make a good moisturizing, you can use it to reduce the redness.

315
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
This big bottle can handle it.

316
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Okay.

317
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Blue button, all-new big powder water.

318
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Pink water, white red rice.

319
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Hello, Mr. Li.

320
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Hello, Mr. Li.

321
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Hello, Mr. Li.

322
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Slow down.

323
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Hello, Mr. Li.

324
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Hello, Mr. Li.

325
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Hello, Mr. Li.

326
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Ready for class.

327
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Hello, Mr. Li.

328
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Hello, Mr. Li.

329
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Mr. Li, where did you go on the weekend?

330
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
I went to the castle.

331
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
I went to my good friend on the weekend.

332
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
The teacher said you were getting married.

333
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Is that true?

334
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Mr. Li, look.

335
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
This is the new gift box my mom gave me.

336
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
It's so pretty.

337
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
It's beautiful.

338
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Teacher, I remember the big green one.

339
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I remember the big green one.

340
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I remember the big green one.

341
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Okay, okay.

342
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
Hurry up and get ready.

343
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
We're going to class in a minute.

344
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
We're going to class in a minute.

345
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
What are we doing here?

346
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Mr. Fan is here with you.

347
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Tell me if you want to do it.

348
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Do you want me to protect you from the chair?

349
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
But look around us.

350
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,200
There are our classmates and the sun.

351
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,200
The teacher will teach you in a moment.

352
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Do you want to come out and listen to the story?

353
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Have you done your homework?

354
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Come to school tomorrow.

355
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Don't forget to bring your textbook.

356
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Goodbye, Mr. Li.

357
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Goodbye.

358
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
You're up.

359
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Chen Xiaoman.

360
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
You're here to pick up the kids?

361
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
No, no, no.

362
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I'm here to pick up my boss's kids.

363
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
You don't know yet, do you?

364
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
I worked at a magazine after I came back from school.

365
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
That's great. It suits you.

366
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
I didn't expect to meet you today.

367
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
What's your boss's name?

368
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
I'll help you find it.

369
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Xu Hao.

370
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,200
I'll help you find it.

371
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Xu Haolei.

372
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Class one, Class one.

373
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Our class.

374
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Lei Lei.

375
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
I'm here to pick you up. Let's go.

376
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Lei Lei.

377
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Let's go. It's snowing.

378
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Actually, I haven't seen Lei Lei a few times.

379
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
But every time I see him, he's like this.

380
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
My boss is a career-oriented woman.

381
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
He doesn't usually stay with the kids.

382
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
It's normal for him to be introverted.

383
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
He may not be introverted.

384
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
I think he's sensitive.

385
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
And he's very imaginative.

386
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Sometimes he imagines himself as a little mushroom in the corner.

387
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,200
I think you can pretend to be a mushroom.

388
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
And chat with him more.

389
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Is that how you got Jiang Xiaoxi?

390
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Actually, there weren't any of those things.

391
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,200
I think we were good friends in high school.

392
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Lei Lei.

393
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Let's go. I'll buy you some candy.

394
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
See you with Mr. Lei.

395
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Bye. See you tomorrow.

396
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Bye.

397
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
See you tomorrow.

398
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Bye.

399
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Bye.

400
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
Bye.

401
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Bye.

402
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Look at the news.

403
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Something happened to Yu Qiao.

404
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,200
A black bird hit her plane's engine.

405
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Yu Qiao.

406
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
A flight from Hongyang Airport

407
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
was hit by a flying bird during the takeoff.

408
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
It only took a few seconds for the plane to take off.

409
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
The lights went out immediately.

410
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Yu Qiao.

411
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Qin Yeyuan.

412
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Are you scared to death?

413
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
Why didn't you make it clear?

414
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Why are you running?

415
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
I'm not going to eat you.

416
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Don't eat. It's getting late.

417
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
I'm fine.

418
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm so hungry.

419
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I'm so full.

420
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
I'm fine.

421
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Let me see you in person.

422
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Don't hide.

423
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I'm fine.

424
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Can't you make it clear?

425
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Why are you scaring me?

426
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
You're back.

427
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Drink some water.

428
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Don't be angry.

429
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
You're young.

430
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
Find something else to do.

431
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Qin Yeyuan.

432
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Let's not talk about this kind of

433
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
unspoken words.

434
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Think about it from another angle.

435
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I've accumulated valuable flight experience

436
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
through this sudden situation.

437
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,200
How many pilots can have such flying experience?

438
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Besides,

439
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
pilots like me who are awarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

440
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,200
leaving the position is a loss to our private bank.

441
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
You're right.

442
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
You made the decision yourself.

443
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
You won't change no matter what others say.

444
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
I heard Qin Yeyuan say

445
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
that the anti-cancer drug you're studying

446
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
has been reduced to a substance of cancer.

447
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
How is it?

448
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Is it going well recently?

449
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
It's still the same.

450
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,200
I've known since I decided to be a doctor.

451
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Being a doctor must be a difficult thing.

452
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Especially now I've decided to study the anti-cancer drug.

453
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
If it's not difficult,

454
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
then it will be a problem.

455
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Moreover,

456
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Yuqiang has been struggling in the sky.

457
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
I can't overcome such a small problem.

458
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
It's so embarrassing.

459
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Right, Yuqiang?

460
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Yes.

461
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
This is the role of the front-line internet.

462
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
When my pre-medical design came out,

463
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
the pattern of this meal was pulled up.

464
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
You're good.

465
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Come on, the role of the front-line internet.

466
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Cheers.

467
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Cheers.

468
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
The role of the front-line internet.

469
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Today,

470
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
we finally get to meet here.

471
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Do you remember

472
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,200
that we didn't do anything before?

473
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,200
I think today is a good opportunity.

474
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
What?

475
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Help me.

476
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Okay.

477
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
You're so heavy.

478
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Yes.

479
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Suddenly I feel

480
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
that I'm waiting for this moment

481
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
to buy this car.

482
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Okay, let's go.

483
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Get in the car.

484
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Qianyue, are you driving?

485
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Of course.

486
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Okay, I'll be the assistant driver.

487
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
We can be the guide.

488
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
I want to hold the steering wheel

489
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
in my own hands.

490
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Listen to my favorite songs,

491
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
and I'll show you

492
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
many beautiful scenery.

493
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
I want to sit on the cherry blossoms

494
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
on my assistant driver's seat,

495
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
sit on the roadside of the vegetable garden,

496
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
and also sit on the bridge.

497
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Who wants to get off the bus?

498
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
The plane is taking off.

499
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
The sun is setting.

500
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Come on.

501
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,200
I'm not afraid to say

502
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,200
that the next year will be better.

503
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
We just got married half a year ago.

504
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Now we're giving the money to the fans.

505
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
It's too early.

506
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
This is not the money from the fans.

507
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
This is the letter.

508
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
I wrote it to you when I was in the first grade.

509
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
The letter I took down.

510
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
I sent it to you.

511
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Don't worry.

512
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
You've got the correct message.

513
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
It's not up to me

514
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
whether I believe it or not.

515
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
I've kept this letter

516
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
for so many years.

517
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
I've always wanted to open it.

518
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
But I never opened it.

519
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
It's enough to test my moral level.

520
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Now it's good.

521
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
I finally threw this stone egg to you.

522
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Thank you.

523
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Lin.

524
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
What else do you want to play?

525
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I want to play that.

526
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Are you done?

527
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Yes, I'm done.

528
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Yuqiao.

529
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Yuqiao.

530
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
I thought

531
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
I couldn't tell you

532
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
something for the rest of my life.

533
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
But after you got out of the interview,

534
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I'm afraid I'll regret not telling you.

535
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I don't want to regret it.

536
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Tell me.

537
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
I don't know

538
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
which class you're in every day.

539
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Every time I look up

540
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
and see some flying objects in the sky,

541
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
I'll think

542
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
that's you.

543
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Okay.

544
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,200
But when I look up

545
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
in the sky,

546
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I'll think

547
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
that's you.

548
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
I'm done.

549
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Let's go and play.

550
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Let's go.

551
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Run, run.

552
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Be careful.

553
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Go.

554
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Go.

555
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
So beautiful.

556
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Today,

557
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
there are major adjustments

558
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
in the food supply.

559
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
The main point is the decline in the stock price.

560
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
The market is moving more.

561
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
The supervision department said

562
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
they will continue to pay attention to the market

563
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
and maintain the market steady operation.

564
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
This is the market steady operation.

565
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,200
The market is going up to 3000.

566
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I even misjudged my eyes.

567
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
Isn't this a beautiful woman?

568
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
I and my wife

569
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
have been living well.

570
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,200
We've been saving a lot of money.

571
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
We've been earning a lot of money.

572
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Teacher Chen, this...

573
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
You don't know about the stock price.

574
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Today is the day of the moon.

575
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
The stock price has fallen.

576
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
The main point has fallen to 3000.

577
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
The stock price has fallen by 40%.

578
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
You know it.

579
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Why are you here?

580
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Have you contacted Jiang Qiao Xi?

581
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
No. What's wrong?

582
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Her boss was taken away for investigation.

583
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Feiling just told me.

584
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Jiang Qiao Xi told Feiling

585
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
that the contract given by Simu is very problematic.

586
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
They are at risk of being caught up in the market.

587
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
After Feiling knew it,

588
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
she didn't cooperate with Simu anymore.

589
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Today, the stock price has fallen.

590
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
Her boss was taken away.

591
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Feiling called her but she couldn't get through.

592
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,200
I've been thinking about it.

593
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
I have to come to you.

594
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,200
I have to come to you.

595
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
I'll call her first.

596
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
I'll go home to see her.

597
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Go ahead.

598
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Thank you.

599
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Stop talking nonsense.

600
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Go ahead.

601
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Jiang Qiao Xi,

602
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
I've told you so much.

603
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
But I forgot to ask.

604
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Do you still remember Chun Lu?

605
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
Do you still remember that you are Chun Lu's father?

606
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Do you still remember me?

607
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
I always remember you.

608
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
When I think of you,

609
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
I think of our childhood.

610
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
At that time,

611
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,200
time flies so fast.

612
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
It was almost the time when the ice cream was just in my hand.

613
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
It started to melt.

614
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
It was almost the time when I started climbing the mountain.

615
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
When I saw the sunset,

616
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
the night came and it was dark.

617
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
I was about to go down the mountain.

618
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
But without you,

619
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
without my friends,

620
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
time flies so slowly.

621
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
It's like a sleepless afternoon.

622
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
What about you?

623
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,200
Are you living a fast or slow life?

624
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Is it because you have new friends

625
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
that you like them more?

626
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Did they make your time go faster?

627
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
If that's the case,

628
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,200
I would be a little sad.

629
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
But only a little.

630
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
You are doing well.

631
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
I would also feel that I am doing well.

632
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
But

633
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
you have to tell your new friend

634
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
that your name is Jiang Qiaoxi.

635
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Your name is the most beautiful sunset in Qunshan Mountain.

636
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
Jiang Qiaoxi wrote you this letter.

637
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
I used a lot of courage.

638
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
I was afraid that you had forgotten me.

639
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,200
But I also felt that if it was you,

640
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
you wouldn't forget me.

641
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Can you tell me the answer?

642
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
I know you are busy.

643
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
You have to do a lot of math.

644
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,200
But if you are not that busy one day,

645
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
can you go back to Qunshan Mountain?

646
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,200
I want to see the sunset of Qunshan Mountain with you.

647
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
I want to hear you tell me

648
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
how are you these five years?

649
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Is your time fast or slow?

650
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I want to go to Qunshan Mountain with you

651
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,200
to see the sunset of Lingyin Tower.

652
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Jing Shang.

653
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
It's okay, Jiang Qiaoxi.

654
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
It's okay.

655
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
As long as you are okay.

656
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
I am fine.

657
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Why did you say that I am fine?

658
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
I know it.

659
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Chen Xiaoman just came to me

660
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,200
and said that your boss was taken away for investigation.

661
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
You didn't make a mistake.

662
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
Don't worry.

663
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Sit.

664
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,200
I resigned before I made a mistake.

665
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Why are you crying?

666
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
I...

667
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Are you crying because of the stock market?

668
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
It's okay.

669
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
You can make money again.

670
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
As long as you are fine.

671
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
It's okay, Jiang Qiaoxi.

672
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
It's because of the stock market.

673
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,200
I have sold all the stocks.

674
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
You have sold them?

675
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Why didn't you tell me that you sold them?

676
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
You didn't tell me that you resigned.

677
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
You didn't tell me that you sold the stocks.

678
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
You didn't tell me anything, right?

679
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Come.

680
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
What are you doing?

681
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
I am crying.

682
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,200
What?

683
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Did you buy the ring with the money from the stock?

684
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
What?

685
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Jiang Qiaoxi, what are you doing?

686
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Don't worry.

687
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
It's enough.

688
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Director Lin.

689
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,200
I know it's a little unnecessary for me to say this now.

690
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,200
But I want to ask you again.

691
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Would you like to live with me?

692
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,200
I have lived with you before.

693
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
That's different.

694
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Would you like to?

695
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Hurry up.

696
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Hurry up.

697
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
I'm so embarrassed.

698
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Enough.

699
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Don't show off.

700
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
You are so beautiful.

701
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
No.

702
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Close your eyes.

703
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Jiang Qiaoxi.

704
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,200
How long are you going to stay this time?

705
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
We will stay for a weekend.

706
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
I have to go to school.

707
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
I have to go back.

708
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Okay.

709
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
You are busy.

710
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
You are promoting.

711
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
It's okay.

712
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
It's okay.

713
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
They both grew up.

714
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
They have their own career.

715
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
You can stay for two days.

716
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Just stay for two days.

717
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Qiaoxi.

718
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,200
I will make you more steamed buns and lotus root this time.

719
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
You two can take it back and eat it.

720
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Don't bother.

721
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
You can leave it to me.

722
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,200
When I go back to Hongyang, I can make a cherry.

723
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
No.

724
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Leave it to me.

725
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
He is cooking now.

726
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,200
If he is bored and wants to play with me,

727
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
I will have a sister.

728
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
You are so smart.

729
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Uncle, aunt.

730
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
I want to say something.

731
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Although I haven't had a wedding ceremony with Ying Tao,

732
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,200
I want to call you dad and mom from today.

733
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Call me if you want.

734
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Dad.

735
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,200
We have been looking at you as a son since you were a child.

736
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,200
It depends on how you behave.

737
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Dad.

738
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
Dad.

739
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
They will agree.

740
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,960
Okay.

741
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,520
Dad.

742
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
We will live trauma-free.

743
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,080
Not anymore.

744
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,380
Actually,

745
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,520
my relationship with Jiang Xiaoxi

746
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,900
is not that serious.

747
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,360
I've always been.

748
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,000
I was kind of necessary.

749
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,740
Now,

750
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,900
I'm very expected

751
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,020
to be a professional both wholesale andatures.

752
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,560
That's great.

753
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,400
You're a little stingy.

754
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,280
Ping Tong,

755
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,520
you'll be living with Qiang Xi in the future.

756
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,120
You two are a family.

757
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,040
You have to make more plans for your little family.

758
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,200
No.

759
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,680
Even if I have a little family,

760
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,480
I still love my parents the most.

761
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,840
How can you two be happy?

762
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,040
You two will live together in the future.

763
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,320
You have to take good care of each other.

764
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,760
If you need anything,

765
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,040
remember to call me.

766
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,560
What did you ask?

767
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,600
Do you understand what I mean?

768
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Let me explain.

769
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,880
My dad means

770
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,280
you must not bully me.

771
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,320
If you bully me,

772
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,640
call my dad.

773
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,600
My dad will go.

774
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,600
You're so good at it.

775
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,000
You ruined it.

776
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,960
You're in pain.

777
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,600
Of course.

778
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,920
You broke it.

779
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,240
I broke it.

780
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,560
Let me see.

781
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,760
Let me see.

782
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,480
Okay, it's fine.

783
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,400
It's fine.

784
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,240
This one looks good.

785
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,280
It's pretty.

786
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,560
You'll get used to it.

787
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,200
Thanks.

788
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,320
Ming Tao.

789
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,080
Does Qiao Xi still

790
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,280
contact her parents often?

791
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,880
I guess so.

792
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,840
You know about her family.

793
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,880
She can talk to Uncle Jiang

794
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,720
for a while now.

795
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,280
But she can't help it.

796
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,800
Aunt Liang

797
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,680
will call her

798
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,560
and ask about the situation.

799
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,200
But she'll hang up in less than a minute.

800
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,120
There's something

801
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,880
her mom didn't let me tell you.

802
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,120
But now you're married to Qiao Xi.

803
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,120
I think

804
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,520
I should tell you.

805
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,640
What is it?

806
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,760
Two years ago,

807
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,560
Qiao Xi's mom came to our house

808
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,880
after she was sent back

809
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,680
from Nigeria.

810
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,640
Do you know what she came here for?

811
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,360
What?

812
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,280
She did

813
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,160
the same thing

814
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,480
you're doing now.

815
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,880
No one can change Industrial Council

816
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
so easily.

817
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,680
When I saw her back then emails,

818
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,280
you know where I got myắp.

819
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
That kind of encounter

820
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,320
no matter who you choose to work for,

821
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,880
nobody can get through it.

822
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,680
I still can't live without you.

823
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,680
You...

824
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,440
You're so nice.

825
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,360
Yin Tao.

826
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,120
You're the best daughter in the world.

827
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,760
You're also the best mother in the world.

828
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,240
You're so nice that

829
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
I don't want to be separated from Jiang Qiaoxi.

830
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,680
What?

831
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,320
What do you mean by that?

832
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,320
The End

833
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,520
I'm 16 years old, Lin Yin Tao.

834
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,480
Hello.

835
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm 25 years old, Jiang Qiaoxi.

836
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm sorry.

837
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,360
My letter has been returned to you for nine years.

838
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,040
But I still hope you can receive it.

839
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,240
It's a good thing to return the letter.

840
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,200
I can tell you

841
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,960
about our nine years of life.

842
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,840
Would you like to hear the ending first?

843
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,080
That's a good ending.

844
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,400
We're getting married soon.

845
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,560
Now we have the same parents

846
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,360
and live in the same house.

847
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,800
We eat the same food

848
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,640
and use the same bath.

849
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,280
I really want to know

850
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,440
what kind of words you would like.

851
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,320
But you

852
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,440
wouldn't think so much at that time.

853
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,600
In these nine years,

854
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,600
those times when I was alone,

855
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,320
I was dreaming

856
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,080
and I was with you.

857
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
We were looking at the sunset of Qun Mountain

858
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,440
and I could bear it.

859
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,600
I was also dreaming

860
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,800
about everything that happened in life.

861
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,040
So I could feel

862
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,240
that there was a future.

863
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,080
When I just left Qun Mountain

864
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,440
and couldn't find you,

865
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,480
I would dream

866
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,160
that I was still with you.

867
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,680
I would leave the chocolate

868
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,560
that my teacher gave you.

869
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,640
I would bring your favorite peanut milk.

870
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,480
I would go to see the sunset with you and Chunru.

871
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,120
Yun Tao,

872
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,520
do you remember

873
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
when we were kids,

874
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,400
we used to

875
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,280
watch Harry Potter together?

876
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,720
You're talking nonsense.

877
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,200
You didn't even watch Harry Potter when you were a kid.

878
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,960
I had to tell you.

879
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,600
Besides,

880
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,440
we never watched Harry Potter

881
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,480
on the mountain top.

882
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,480
Did you remember it wrong?

883
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,800
Of course I did.

884
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,760
But you didn't know.

885
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
When we were in middle school,

886
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,080
I would imagine

887
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,680
that we never separated.

888
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,520
We were still in school

889
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,000
and watched Harry Potter together.

890
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,640
But Yun Tao,

891
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,960
I don't have to

892
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,680
imagine anymore.

893
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,840
At this moment,

894
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,720
you're by my side.

895
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,640
The sunset today is beautiful.

896
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,040
I really want to

897
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,520
give you the sunset

898
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,160
and let you wear it with you.

899
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,560
Just like

900
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,520
you gave me

901
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,840
the broken heart you've been carrying.

902
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,600
But what can I do, Yun Tao?

903
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,800
I can't give you the sunset.

904
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,400
Besides, I'm more greedy

905
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,920
to eat the early steamed buns

906
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,520
you made yourself.

907
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,640
Do you think

908
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,640
Yun Tao will make it for me

909
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,520
nine years later?

910
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,360
I think

911
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,800
you'll agree

912
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,560
nine years later.

913
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,840
I'm watching the sunset with you

914
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,360
on the bridge of the evening sunset.

915
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,160
Be careful.

916
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,520
Yun Tao.

917
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,920
Yun Tao.

918
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,120
Yun Tao.

919
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,320
Yun Tao.

920
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,320
Yun Tao.

921
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,440
Yun Tao.

922
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,320
Yun Tao.

923
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,240
Yun Tao.

924
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,160
Yun Tao.

925
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,160
Yun Tao.

926
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,080
Yun Tao.

927
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,040
Yun Tao.

928
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,920
Yun Tao.

929
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,880
Yun Tao.

930
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,760
Yun Tao.

931
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:02,600
Yun Tao.

932
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,440
Yun Tao.

933
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,320
Yun Tao.

934
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,120
Yun Tao.

935
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,040
Yun Tao.

936
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,920
Yun Tao.

937
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,800
Yun Tao.

938
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,640
Yun Tao.

939
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,400
Yun Tao.

940
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,240
Yun Tao.

941
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,120
Yun Tao.

942
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,920
Yun Tao.

943
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,880
Yun Tao.

944
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,760
Yun Tao.

945
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,600
Yun Tao.

946
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,520
Yun Tao.

947
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,320
Yun Tao.

948
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,560
You've grown up.

949
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,680
Today,

950
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,720
you're going to be a bride.

951
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,240
Yes.

952
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,480
I'm going to be a bride.

953
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,920
Is it the same as you imagined?

954
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,560
I've never imagined

955
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,080
I'd be a bride.

956
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,240
I've never thought about it

957
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,760
when I was growing up.

958
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,560
Do you feel satisfied

959
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,480
now?

960
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,240
Are you not afraid of anything

961
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,560
like before?

962
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,680
Of course.

963
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,080
But

964
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,000
when I was an adult,

965
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,640
I sometimes

966
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,560
had to pretend to be a coward.

967
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,520
Do you like people who marry you?

968
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,200
I don't have to like the one I like.

969
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,480
I like the one you like.

970
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,840
The one you like.

971
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,360
How do I look?

972
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,680
Am I handsome?

973
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,280
Are you really me?

974
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,000
Why can't I be you?

975
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,920
You're a laughing stock.

976
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,240
You're a laughing stock.

977
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,320
The real you

978
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,040
has been awakened.

979
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,680
Is the person who woke you up

980
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,840
a eagle?

981
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,560
Who else

982
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,360
can it be?

983
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,480
In the fairy tale,

984
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,280
it's the princess and the prince who get married.

985
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,720
From then on,

986
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,840
they live happily together.

987
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,240
But the story is over.

988
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Is it true?

989
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,920
Is it true?

990
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,040
Will their lives

991
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,680
continue to be happy?

992
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,440
Are you asking

993
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,880
whether Jiang Qiao Xi and I

994
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,520
will be like this forever?

995
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,400
Always be happy

996
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,920
is a difficult thing.

997
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,240
In the future,

998
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,760
we will face many difficulties.

999
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,200
We will face

1000
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,240
the bad weather

1001
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,760
and the rain.

1002
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,000
But as long as I'm by her side,

1003
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,720
she's by my side,

1004
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

1005
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,000
What I want to do most now

1006
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,960
is to be by her side.

1007
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,920
Let you

1008
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,360
be my guide forever.

1009
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,600
Then you have to work hard.

1010
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,120
Don't worry.

1011
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,520
I will.

1012
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,520
I'm very satisfied.

1013
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,640
Very satisfied.

1014
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,840
I like you when you grow up.

1015
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,080
You're not afraid of anything.

1016
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,880
Look.

1017
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,040
This pair of shoes.

1018
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:38,920
Look.

1019
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,160
Why are you wearing this pair of shoes?

1020
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,480
Aren't white sand red shoes

1021
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,800
just for jumping?

1022
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,360
I like to jump.

1023
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,640
I just want to wear this pair of shoes

1024
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,160
and walk into the life with you.

1025
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,840
Jiang Xiaoxi.

1026
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,440
Now you can marry your bride.
