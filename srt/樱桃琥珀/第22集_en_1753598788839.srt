00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 18

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,520
I'm here.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,760
I saw the sunset.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,920
It's my first time praying in my heart.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,240
The red sun that day

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,120
must be a cloudy day without a sunset.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,240
Dandelion must not see the sunset.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,680
So it won't think of me.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,400
It can be happier.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,120
Even if it's a day.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,880
Maybe you're right.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,680
Maybe that day,

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,600
I didn't see the sunset.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,240
In fact, many times,

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,960
when I was in the library or in the evening class,

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,360
I couldn't see the sunset.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,840
I know I'm lying to myself.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,760
You don't think of me because you saw the sunset.

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,040
You think of me.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,200
You think of me

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,560
and then you go back to see me.

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,960
As your sadness,

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,040
what does it have to do with the sunset?

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,520
I'm the one who deserves it.

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,680
In fact, sometimes I hate myself.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,400
I don't know why.

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,920
When I left,

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,960
I told you

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,960
not to forget me.

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,480
The people I care about,

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,200
whether it's near or far,

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,000
I've never lost my strength.

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,960
All my emotions are in my chest.

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,120
It's about to explode.

35
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,200
It's the first time in my life

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,600
I want to find a place to cry.

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,160
I hide behind the pillar.

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,800
One day I'm taking pictures.

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,840
I walk down the stairs.

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,840
A green light is picking me up.

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,440
Then I held it in.

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,560
It was about ten o'clock in the evening.

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,440
I drank very little.

44
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,800
I bought a ticket to the sunset.

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,440
I sat in the seat of no one

46
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,040
and cried a lot.

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,280
That was September 6, 2008.

48
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,960
Jiang Jiangxi was very poor that day.

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,120
Because she didn't know

50
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,120
the golden day after 639 days

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,120
I would come here again.

52
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,480
The cherry cherry is standing next to me.

53
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,480
Jiang Jiangxi, you idiot!

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,960
Call Lin Yintao!

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Tell him

56
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,240
you're sad.

57
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,440
He'll fight with you.

58
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,560
It doesn't matter if you don't call him.

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,680
Because after 639 days,

60
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,480
Lin Yintao

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,000
will come to you to fight.

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,000
He'll fight with you.

63
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,960
He'll fight with you.

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,880
He'll fight with you.

65
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,120
I'm here to find you.

66
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,520
No matter where you are,

67
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,520
I'll find you.

68
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,640
You can't underestimate yourself.

69
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,280
Because you've done a great thing.

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,880
And from now on,

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,760
I'll be with you.

72
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,960
You can't escape.

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,960
You can't escape again.

74
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,200
If only I could be there at that time.

75
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,560
Then,

76
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,160
if you come down from the Ferris wheel,

77
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,280
I can hold you.

78
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,520
You're not late.

79
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
I...

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,240
I didn't find a way to go home.

81
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Jiang Jiangxi.

82
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,360
Where can we start to fight in Hong Kong?

83
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,640
We can start from the sunrise.

84
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,240
Let's go to the sunrise.

85
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,640
It's so beautiful.

86
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,360
Let's go.

87
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Come on.

88
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,840
The sky is in front of me.

89
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
The old man is in a hurry.

90
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,120
He wants to say goodbye.

91
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Jiang Jiangxi.

92
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
You told me at the dock.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,480
You hate yourself.

94
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
You told me not to forget you.

95
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
Don't think like that.

96
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,000
Although I don't have your news these years,

97
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,360
at least this sentence

98
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,960
let me know that you need me.

99
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,720
This is the reason I've been insisting.

100
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,040
So you didn't do anything wrong.

101
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,280
Your masochist,

102
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,280
first,

103
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:34,320
uzhou population is OH%

104
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,520
Two liang,

105
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,280
Nuitou.

106
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,920
You heard about the Temporary Conception, right?

107
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,960
Sometimes the person is called Weisheng,

108
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,040
I didn't expect her to come.

109
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,120
Not long after,

110
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,240
the mountain was in a storm.

111
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,480
I was in a daze.

112
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,640
But she never forgot

113
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,840
her promise to me.

114
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,960
She held the bridge

115
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,920
until she found out

116
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,440
she was drowned.

117
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,880
She didn't let go.

118
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
I didn't mean to hurt you.

119
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,720
I can't wait for her.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,120
I'll find her.

121
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,280
If she runs away,

122
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,840
I'll chase her.

123
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,000
If I can't catch up,

124
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,960
I'll hide.

125
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,840
You can't escape anyway.

126
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,640
As long as I find a trace of your love,

127
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,440
I'll act.

128
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,960
You can't escape anyway.

129
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,880
I'll be there.

130
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,800
I'll be there.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,880
I'll be there.

132
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,200
I'll be there.

133
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,160
Your hair,

134
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,960
your eyebrows,

135
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,480
your eyes,

136
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,480
your nose,

137
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,520
your mouth,

138
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,320
and your whole body

139
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,480
are all mine.

140
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,520
The scenery here

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,320
is like yesterday.

142
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,760
The past is in front of me.

143
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,960
The future is in my hands.

144
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,520
You're the key to who I am.

145
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,200
Be with me and become myself.

146
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,200
The night sky is long.

147
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,600
My stubbornness grows wild.

148
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,200
I can't wait for you.

149
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,360
I'll call you when I'm in my dream.

150
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,800
You're the key to who I dream.

151
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,200
Be with me and become yourself.

152
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,000
The story is so long.

153
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,760
Loneliness will be embraced.

154
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,800
I'm always here.

155
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,200
You know,

156
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
why I'm here to watch the sunrise?

157
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,840
Three years ago,

158
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
when you gave me the dress,

159
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,600
you said

160
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,600
the sunset won't disappear.

161
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,080
It's just on the way back.

162
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,400
When we see it again,

163
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,280
it'll become the sunset.

164
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,440
Welcome home,

165
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,720
Jiang Xiaoxi.

166
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm back.

167
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,440
I won't leave again.

168
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,400
Say that again.

169
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,280
I'll record it for you.

170
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,160
I want to let Zhao Xia witness it.

171
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,280
I'm back.

172
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,080
I won't leave again.

173
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,960
I want to make sure

174
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,960
nothing can stop me

175
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,600
from staying with Lin Yintao.

176
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,920
The financial storm can't be stopped.

177
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,160
The volcano can't explode.

178
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,920
The ocean can't be stopped.

179
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,800
Heavy suitcases can't be moved.

180
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,440
The water on the walls can't be replaced.

181
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,480
The air conditioning can't be replaced.

182
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,200
The sky can't be changed.

183
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,760
We can't be self-esteem.

184
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,800
We can't be ashamed.

185
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,680
We can't be proud.

186
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,880
We can't be at work.

187
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,960
We can't be in the dark.

188
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,840
And we can't be the dew at dawn.

189
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,040
We can't be the rock road at the top of Zhang Qingtai.

190
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,160
We can't be the ant's nest.

191
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,440
We can't be the plastic bottle

192
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,200
that nobody threw in the trash can.

193
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm here for you

194
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Maybe the world is a little annoying

195
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Always eliminate expectations

196
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Jiang Jiaxi

197
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
But dear friend

198
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,600
I think I shouldn't take you to see Wanxia

199
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Wanxia is very beautiful

200
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
But it will disappear soon

201
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
I should take you to see Zhao Xia

202
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Facing the silence

203
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
If that's the case

204
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
I won't call Jiang Jiaxi anymore

205
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
I should call Jiang Chengdu

206
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
The sea of ​​blessing

207
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
No regrets can come out

208
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,600
This is the most precious and most firm

209
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,600
I'm here for you

210
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,600
I'm here for you

211
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
I'm here for you

212
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Hello, Mrs. Teng

213
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Wifen, you go to the company

214
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Yang Yang Yang Yang Yang Yang Yang

215
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Hurry up and use 999 skin salt bottle to enjoy the gel

216
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Just be quick

217
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
999 skin salt bottle gel

218
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Hello, where is my sister-in-law?

219
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Xiaojun

220
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Let's go

221
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
What are you doing? She just ran

222
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Can go down

223
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,600
I'm afraid she'll do something wrong

224
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Don't worry, I'll find her right away

225
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Let's go

226
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Where will Brother Tan go?

227
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Jiang Jiaxi

228
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Jiang Jiaxi

229
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Brother

230
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Brother

231
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Is it Brother Tan?

232
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Zhang Rongcheng

233
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Brother Tan

234
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
Oh my god

235
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I'm just here to eat ice cream

236
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Do you need so many people to catch us?

237
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
No

238
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Let's go

239
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Let's go

240
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm in the hospital

241
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
A patient is missing

242
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Wait, 37 years old

243
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
About 1.78 meters

244
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Inpatient uniform

245
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
About an hour ago

246
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Yes, I am a patient's family

247
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Is the patient okay?

248
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Okay, thank you

249
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
I'm sorry

250
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
I'm so worried

251
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Brother Tan seems to be home

252
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Sorry

253
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
I think we found it

254
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm sorry

255
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
You asked him, you know we're worried about him

256
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,600
It's so far away, it's so hot

257
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Come back so late

258
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Come on

259
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
How did you find this place?

260
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,600
I've been in the hospital for so long

261
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Most of the time I just lay in bed

262
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
I can't even get out of bed

263
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I can only look at the ceiling every day

264
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Sometimes I think

265
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
How can you survive without me

266
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
But I never thought

267
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
You have to live like this

268
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
No matter what day it is

269
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
We can get through it

270
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Is that what you call living?

271
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
If you knew it was like this

272
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Why don't you just let me die that day?

273
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Let me die

274
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
What are you talking about?

275
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
What are you talking about?

276
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
You know, these two years

277
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
It's not easy for him

278
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,600
You don't know how people come over

279
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
You're half a year old now

280
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
You're talking like this

281
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Mom, I just know it's not easy

282
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,600
You see how we're doing now

283
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Everything is gone

284
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Our money is gone

285
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
My family is gone

286
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,600
My school teacher's money is gone

287
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
We have no money now

288
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Nothing is left

289
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Just because of me

290
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Save me from living in such a place

291
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
I've got you like this

292
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
You know

293
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Mom, don't say that

294
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
You don't drag me down

295
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
I just look at you

296
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,600
If the doctor said you would get better

297
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
I can't get it today

298
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,600
You're so capable today

299
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
You're no different from before

300
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
I'm not capable now

301
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,600
You can look at me when I'm capable

302
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Everything is gone now

303
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I can't even look at my daughter

304
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Look at my heart

305
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
When I come back and see my dad

306
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
I'll be back to see my husband

307
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm not busy now

308
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
What are you doing?

309
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Look at me now

310
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
I'm just a loser now

311
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Look at me

312
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Shut up

313
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
I've been waiting for you for so long

314
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
I've been taking care of you for so long

315
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I didn't want to see you get better

316
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
You said such a hurtful thing

317
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
If you're like this

318
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
I'll have to leave the hospital

319
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I have no hope

320
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
You're like this now

321
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
I have no hope

322
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm sorry

323
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Don't be like this

324
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
I'm sorry

325
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
I don't know if I'm right

326
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
I'm sorry

327
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm sorry

328
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
I didn't want to be like this

329
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
It's okay

330
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Boss

331
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,360
One

332
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,600
I want two bottles of beer

333
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Okay, wait a minute

334
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
I don't like you drinking

335
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
But I think today

336
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
We can drink together

337
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
I think

338
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
I think

339
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I think

340
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
I think

341
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I think

342
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
I think

343
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
I think

344
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
I think

345
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
I think

346
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
I think

347
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
I think

348
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
I think

349
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
We can drink

350
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Come on, two of you

351
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Come on, two of you

352
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
Come on, two of you

353
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Come on, two of you

354
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Thank you

355
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Thank you

356
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Drink slowly

357
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Drink slowly

358
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Today is the first time I see you, Brother Qiang

359
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Actually, it's the same as I imagined

360
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
The temperament is not annoying

361
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
People also look good

362
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
If you are at this age

363
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
If you are at this age

364
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
It's good that people look so good

365
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
You haven't seen her before

366
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,600
You just have to look at her eyes

367
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
You will feel

368
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,600
There is nothing she can't do in this world

369
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
She can make her career very successful

370
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Can take care of the family very well

371
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Even

372
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Even because of her

373
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Unknowingly hidden place

374
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,600
I know you have admired her since childhood

375
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
The coat she gave you when you were a kid

376
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
You can't bear to paint it dirty

377
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
I want to be like her

378
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Responsible, responsible and smart

379
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
But

380
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
It's just such a person

381
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
A person who is not wrong at all

382
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Within a day

383
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Lost everything

384
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Are you afraid

385
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
You are afraid

386
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
You will experience the same thing as her

387
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
No

388
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
When my mom had a car accident

389
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
When lying on the bed

390
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
She told me

391
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Jiang Xiaoxi

392
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
You don't understand this world at all

393
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
At that time, I didn't believe what she said

394
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
But after half a year

395
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
My brother had an accident

396
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I just knew

397
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
My mom was right

398
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
People have no choice

399
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
The real choice

400
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Just look at the world

401
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
I'm not on your side

402
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Jiang Xiaoxi

403
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Don't get into this

404
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Hypocrisy

405
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Why don't people have a choice

406
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
We make choices every day

407
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Look, we chose to drink porridge today

408
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
We didn't go out to eat stuffed bun

409
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
We chose to drink beer

410
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
We didn't drink the winter tea

411
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

412
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
I'm sorry

413
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
I'll give you five cups

414
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Five cups

415
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
It's okay

416
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
I'm sorry

417
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
This is really cool

418
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Come on

419
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Come on

420
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
You drink mine

421
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
I have

422
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
I have

423
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
I should have come earlier to see the manager

424
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
But the previous market was too bad

425
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
I spent a lot of time to recover

426
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
I'll have time to change the two shops

427
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
Don't say that

428
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
If you didn't visit me before

429
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
I should have stayed in the hospital

430
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
To be a water princess

431
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Brother Tang, sister-in-law

432
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Sister-in-law

433
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
I'll send you the flowers

434
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Brother Tang

435
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Hello

436
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Hello

437
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
I don't know

438
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
I don't know

439
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
You are Ying Tao, right?

440
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Yes

441
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Actually today

442
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
It's our first meeting

443
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
I don't feel like I've known you for a long time

444
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Because this kid has been talking about you since childhood

445
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,600
Jiang Qiaoxi always mentions Brother Tang

446
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Really?

447
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
Really

448
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Really

449
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I bought a snack for Brother Tang

450
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
It's not very expensive

451
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
But I think you're in the hospital

452
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
You may want to eat something with flavor

453
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
I bought a little more

454
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600
You are too polite

455
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
So good

456
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
This

457
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Qiaoxi often praises you

458
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Jiang Qiaoxi

459
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Cherry is really sweet

460
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Manager, this is the little genius you are, right?

461
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
I didn't expect

462
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
How tall and handsome

463
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
They are all like this

464
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
Good luck

465
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
No way

466
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,600
My cousin is now studying at Hong Kong University

467
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,600
He is studying finance and mathematics

468
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
His grades are good

469
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Isn't this the same as the previous academic ability of the manager?

470
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,600
In the future, the UCF will enter the financial market

471
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
He is not going to be a big shot

472
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
I'm sorry

473
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
It must be beyond me

474
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
I never worry about him

475
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Brother Tang

476
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
If there are any good stocks in the future

477
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
You have to tell me

478
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
If you can make a fortune

479
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
I can't be angry

480
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
I'm not worried

481
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Manager

482
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
I'm here

483
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
At that time, you told me

484
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
There is a new financial car stock

485
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Thank you

486
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
At that time, you told me

487
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
This stock must have potential

488
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
So I convinced my wife

489
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Directly transfer to Anli

490
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,600
In two years, it will be 14 times

491
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
That's good

492
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Good boy

493
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
I'm so miserable now

494
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm lying in bed

495
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Like a loser

496
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
I still remember we used to work in a printing factory

497
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
I forgot one word

498
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
It's been a whole night

499
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Now it's not so glorious

500
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
I heard I was going to Singapore

501
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,600
His eyes are like a water dog

502
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,600
His wife is the same as before

503
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
I'm so miserable now

504
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
I'm so miserable now

505
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
His wife is the same as before

506
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
Xiao Qi

507
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
I'm so miserable now

508
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Xiao Qi

509
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
What are you talking about

510
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Let go

511
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Don't hit me, Qin Xiao Qi

512
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Come here

513
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Xiao Qi

514
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
Don't hit me

515
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Let go

516
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Let go

517
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Xiao Qi

518
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Let go

519
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Don't hit people

520
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Let go

521
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
How did he treat you

522
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,600
I've seen him for so many years

523
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
How did he help you

524
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Did he see you again

525
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Hello

526
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Hello

527
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
What's wrong

528
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Is there blood on your side

529
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
You bastard

530
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Director Tao

531
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Are you okay

532
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
I'm fine

533
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Are you okay

534
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
I'm fine

535
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Don't hit people

536
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Are you okay

537
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
Are you okay

538
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Gao Mei scared you, right

539
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
How could it

540
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
What personality you are

541
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
I knew it a long time ago

542
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm just surprised

543
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Sister-in-law will be like that

544
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Feel like a

545
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Women's hero

546
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,440
I'm sorry.

547
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,120
Yin Tao.

548
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,120
Do you think

549
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm different

550
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,240
from before in Hong Kong?

551
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,080
You're indeed different.

552
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,760
What can I do, Yin Tao?

553
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,480
You're so wise.

554
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,200
Don't say that

555
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,480
I'm different from let bygones be bygones.

556
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,680
I think

557
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,840
you're just

558
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,980
an

559
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,320
impulsive boy.

560
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,140
You're an inconspicuous girl

561
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,960
who can control herself

562
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,040
so much,

563
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,840
brush her eyebrows,

564
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,240
give her compliments,

565
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
I've told you before.

566
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,040
I won't do those things

567
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,440
that are good for us

568
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,240
without any hesitation.

569
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,400
Just like you

570
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,680
didn't like it.

571
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,280
Anyway,

572
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,000
I like you more now.

573
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,640
Yes.

574
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,080
Hello, Ms. Tang.

575
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,120
Okay.

576
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,240
What's wrong?

577
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Did she ask us to go up?

578
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,120
No.

579
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,960
She said

580
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,440
she wanted to take us out.

581
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,640
Out?

582
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,640
Yes.

583
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,280
Hello, Ms. Tang.

584
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,520
Hello, I've booked a room.

585
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,280
This way, please.

586
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,200
Follow the stairs.

587
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,120
Don't worry.

588
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,440
Mr. Tang has a card here.

589
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,320
There's money in the account.

590
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,520
Three pieces of Australian lobster.

591
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,000
Fresh crabs.

592
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,160
One box of Chinese

593
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:13,920
Okay.

594
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,040
Frankfurt-style cejoles.

595
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,280
Then there's y Bright sake,

596
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,280
martini,

597
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
and dessert.

598
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,000
Menu, one pancake.

599
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,240
Do you like sweetq滋looks,

600
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
or have black truffle chocolate cake?

601
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,160
Also, dessert here

602
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,560
is well-done.

603
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,840
I'm fine with anything.

604
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,400
Ms. Tang.

605
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,120
We're all here.

606
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,800
Okay.

607
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:34,880
Thanks.

608
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,600
Just follow me.

609
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,040
Okay.

610
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,760
I'm gonna hug her.

611
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:40,840
Okay.

612
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,680
Okay.

613
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,560
Lin,

614
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,840
I've been busy with business with you these days

615
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,160
and I didn't have meals with you.

616
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,320
They're really an� Troubled Talk.

617
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,840
No, you're right.

618
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,080
So this meal

619
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,280
is considered a physical meeting.

620
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,160
Ruocheng should come here,

621
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,520
but he stole before and

622
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,480
the doctor didn't let him out

623
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,120
no matter how.

624
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,360
I'm sorry.

625
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,760
No, Mrs. Tang. Please don't say so.

626
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,960
I'm honoured to welcome both of you.

627
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,960
I forgot to order.

628
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Do you usually drink?

629
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
I don't drink much.

630
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,960
I drink a little beer at home or school meals.

631
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Red wine. Do you drink red wine?

632
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
Is there any red wine you like?

633
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
I don't drink red wine.

634
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
That's right.

635
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Uncle,

636
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,960
there are many opportunities for expensive red wine and expensive restaurants.

637
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Little Master,

638
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,960
is it time for us to drink expensive red wine and expensive restaurants?

639
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Is it time for us to stand up and be a man?

640
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Let's listen to Tang.

641
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
We drink expensive.

642
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Let's drink expensive.

643
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,960
When I was so young, I often read novels.

644
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,960
There is a book called The Business of Art.

645
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,960
I couldn't understand the ending of the book.

646
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,960
But today, I seem to understand it.

647
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,960
But today, I seem to understand it.

648
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,960
I read that novel and know the story.

649
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
What story?

650
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
Tell me.

651
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
It means that

652
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
there is a man who has a sword on his waist.

653
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Then he always wears the sword.

654
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
When others ask him if it hurts,

655
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
he says that

656
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,960
it hurts only when I think of the sword on my waist.

657
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,960
I brought you out for dinner today.

658
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
I wanted to give you a breath.

659
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
I hope you don't forget the good days we had together.

660
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Who can see these good days we had together

661
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
and think of this sword?

662
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Tang is in such a bad situation.

663
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
I didn't think it was hard.

664
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
But the most important thing is you.

665
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
You can't go to study abroad.

666
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Now you have to pay for Tang's medical bills.

667
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
You are a man.

668
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
You have done so much work.

669
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Tang.

670
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
Tang has done such a big thing.

671
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Even if you let me go,

672
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
I won't go.

673
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
But not only because of the family matter,

674
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,960
that Yin Tao won't be separated for so many years.

675
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Seeing you guys like this,

676
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
I feel sorry for you.

677
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
No, Tang.

678
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
Don't think so.

679
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,960
Actually, when I met Jiang Qiao Xin,

680
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,960
I knew that Tang was the most important person to her.

681
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,960
So if she didn't stay at that time,

682
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
it wasn't really a good thing.

683
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Don't feel sorry for her.

684
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,960
Yes, Tang.

685
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
Thank you.

686
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Jiang Ruo Cheng.

687
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
If there is a weakness,

688
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
it's a matter of sincerity.

689
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Meng.

690
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
I'm sorry.

691
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
I'm sorry.

692
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
Tang.

693
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
I'm sorry.

694
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
We changed the boss on the way.

695
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
And there are some problems today.

696
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
We can check your number tomorrow.

697
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Meng.

698
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
We have to wait until tomorrow, right?

699
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Sorry, I'm sorry.

700
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Okay.

701
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,960
I have cash.

702
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
4510.

703
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
Can I use the bank account?

704
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,960
The bank account...

705
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,960
I have a card.

706
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
I have money.

707
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,960
And I want to invite Tang to dinner.

708
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Don't move.

709
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
Thank you.

710
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
Are you done?

711
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
I'm done, Tang.

712
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Thank you for inviting me to dinner.

713
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
It's delicious.

714
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
The wine is delicious.

715
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
I'm full.

716
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
Let's go for a walk.

717
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Let me do it.

718
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Welcome to Haji Guang Lang.

719
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
Thank you.

720
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
Welcome to Haji Guang Lang.

721
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Xiao Xu.

722
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Xiao Xu.

723
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Wait a minute.

724
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
I'm going to buy something.

725
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,960
Hurry up.

726
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,960
Go by yourself.

727
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
Brother Me.

728
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
I'm buying them all.

729
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,960
Akira, when do you make peanuts?

730
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Okay.

731
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,960
I'm speaking to you on my behalf.

732
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
This is money.

733
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
I have a제�ichtetism.

734
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,960
Did you say she bought peanuts with you?

735
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
She is not listed above the bad news.

736
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
We need her on today's list.

737
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
No problem.

738
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,720
Let's open it.

739
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
We'll each have one.

740
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,320
Why did you suddenly want to buy a ticket?

741
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,680
For the past two years,

742
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,560
I've felt that life is very difficult.

743
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,960
I will buy Zhizhi a six-color card

744
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,920
and give myself an expectation.

745
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,040
Hello,

746
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,000
you'll be paid tonight.

747
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,400
But I can only

748
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,520
give you a six-color card.

749
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,960
You can draw first.

750
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,640
I'll choose first?

751
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,400
I'll just choose one.

752
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,080
This one.

753
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,840
If the lottery is really a prize,

754
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,920
the probability of a six-color card being a prize

755
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,720
is smaller than that of a Bel-Ap.

756
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,800
What are you doing?

757
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,240
Why do you say such a mean thing?

758
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,760
Don't break the cold water between Tang and me, okay?

759
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,880
I think Tang is right.

760
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,520
This is not a six-color card.

761
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,160
This is an expectation.

762
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,680
Tang,

763
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,200
I remember that

764
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,040
Jiang Qiao Xi told me two days ago

765
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,040
that she thought that

766
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,640
people have no choice.

767
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,520
The real choice

768
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,080
is to see if the world is on your side.

769
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,200
This may have a certain reason.

770
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,640
But I think

771
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,720
even if the world is not on our side,

772
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,920
we still have a choice.

773
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,360
We can choose

774
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,640
to look forward to it.

775
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,520
Because no one can steal the expectation.

776
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,480
So thank you for giving me the expectation.

777
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,640
Thank you.

778
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,720
Jiang,

779
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,800
I'm listening to your last words.

780
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,280
Tang,

781
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
don't worry.

782
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,160
All the pain will pass.

783
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,880
All the bad things will always be good.

784
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,240
My father told me that.

785
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,280
And Tang's body

786
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,800
has started to recover.

787
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,160
So it will get better and better in the future.

788
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,720
Thank you.

789
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,840
Tang.

790
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,480
It's still incredible.

791
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,960
Just a six-color card

792
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,960
can bring such a big expectation.

793
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
If it doesn't win,

794
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,880
it will be a waste of one card.

795
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,200
But before nine thirty,

796
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,680
this is the evidence of expectation.

797
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,640
What if after nine thirty,

798
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,360
I didn't win and the expectation was empty?

799
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,400
Wouldn't it be more uncomfortable?

800
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,200
Then

801
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,360
buy another one.

802
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,800
Wait for the prize to be opened.

803
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,800
Wait for the day to come.

804
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,680
You're really not curious at all.

805
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,760
Can your six-color card win the prize?

806
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,680
Even if it's just a little bit.

807
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,040
The probability of winning the six-color card

808
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,440
is one thousandth of a million.

809
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,800
But the probability of me meeting Lin Yintao

810
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,120
is one thousandth of a million.

811
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,640
So I already have my own six-color card.

812
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,800
Jiang Xiaoxi.

813
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,480
Why are you so embarrassed

814
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,800
when you suddenly talk?

815
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,920
Say it again.

816
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,800
No, I can't. It's the first time.

817
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,240
Say it again.

818
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:17,760
No.

819
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,880
I'll just watch it.

820
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,640
식철이.

821
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,640
covenant

822
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,560
It's forty-five I took.

823
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,320
Can I start ambassadors now?

824
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,440
Let me see.

825
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,040
YouTiming me first.

826
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,280
Here you go.

827
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,440
Hold this and then I'll count.

828
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,200
Levi, twenty-nine,

829
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,640
zero six,

830
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,840
two, two,

831
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,600
Wait.

832
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,080
Levi, twenty-nine,

833
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,040
two, two,

834
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:47,760
zero six,

835
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,400
zero six,

836
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,040
Seven.

837
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,600
Twenty-seven.

838
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,080
Thirty-six.

839
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,640
Thirty-six?

840
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,200
Only two left.

841
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,960
Five?

842
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,440
Two more to go.

843
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,480
What a pity.

844
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,960
Are five too much?

845
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,240
I don't know.

846
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,680
Enough.

847
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,480
As long as you have money.

848
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,720
How many times have you counted?

849
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,920
Stop counting.

850
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,400
Five basic numbers are all the same.

851
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,800
The fourth prize is 9600 Hong Kong dollars.

852
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,880
I also counted wrong.

853
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,880
I told you.

854
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,720
Even God loves me.

855
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,800
You don't believe me?

856
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,680
God loves you.

857
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,680
Even if you count like this,

858
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,880
even God

859
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,320
can't protect you from being robbed.

860
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,640
Jiang Xiaoxi.

861
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,560
My mom said

862
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,760
the money you get from playing cards

863
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,640
or playing cards

864
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,040
is not from the right way.

865
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,640
You have to spend it quickly.

866
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,240
We spent it in Hong Kong.

867
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,160
Okay.

868
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,960
What do you want to buy?

869
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,800
I really want to buy

870
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,800
a pair of sunglasses.

871
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,040
Buy one for Yuqiao.

872
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,640
What else?

873
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:05,960
Let's go.

874
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,800
Take me there.
