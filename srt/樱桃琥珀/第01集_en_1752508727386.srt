00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 2

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,760
Run!

3
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,200
Don't lose to that cloud!

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,800
Just throw it here.

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,960
There's no way.

6
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,880
Listen to me.

7
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,400
The white geese can't see us.

8
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,920
Let's go back and play games.

9
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,560
I can fly over.

10
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,120
I read in the book that

11
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,200
if you jump hard

12
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,560
and jump far enough,

13
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,360
you'll have wings on your back.

14
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,280
And then...

15
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,040
Let's go.

16
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,000
What are you doing?

17
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,520
Lin Yikao,

18
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,640
if you don't go back,

19
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,280
I won't copy your homework anymore.

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,640
My dad told me

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,680
that our construction site

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,760
will send a good student.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,240
Their dormitory is right next to mine.

24
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,320
If you don't copy mine,

25
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,640
I can copy others.

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,040
Son,

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,840
we'll be in Qunshan soon.

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,160
Don't draw.

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
You ate something

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,560
on the way, didn't you?

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,720
Take a rest.

32
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,880
You'll have to take the final exam

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,160
when you get there.

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,280
Why are you taking that dirty coat?

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,720
If you like it,

36
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,240
I'll buy you a new one.

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
Lin Yikao, slow down.

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,280
Let's go find the coffin.

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,560
The car is about to get hit.

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Why is it higher

41
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,320
than the horse?

42
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,520
That's right.

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,560
Lin Yikao,

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,960
you should grow up.

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,320
Even a snake can't be higher than you.

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm done.

47
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,240
I'm done.

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Lin Yikao.

49
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
I need to hurry up

50
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,200
and do something meaningful.

51
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Lin Yikao, stop.

52
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,720
What's the meaning of

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
studying?

54
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,960
Why is it meaningless?

55
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,520
I was my own child when I was young.

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,520
Have you had enough?

57
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm going to the toilet.

58
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm going to the toilet.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,800
What?

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm going to the toilet.

61
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going to the toilet.

62
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm going to the toilet.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,400
I'm going to the toilet.

64
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm going to the toilet.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
I'm going to the toilet.

66
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm going to the toilet.

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
I'm going to the toilet.

69
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,720
I'm going to the toilet.

70
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I'm going to the toilet.

71
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm going to the toilet.

72
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
I'm going to the toilet.

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm going to the toilet.

74
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
I'm going to the toilet.

75
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
I'm going to the toilet.

76
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I'm going to the toilet.

77
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm going to the toilet.

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
I'm going to the toilet.

79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,680
I'm going to the toilet.

80
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
I'm going to the toilet.

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
I'm going to the toilet.

82
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm going to the toilet.

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Hello.

84
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,800
Yikao, I lost.

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Run.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,100
if she got taken away into another life.

87
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,920
Don't worry.

88
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,120
Even if she takes me into another life,

89
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,040
I won't be okay with her.

90
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,680
Li Dan,

91
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,760
you can do it!

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,000
I promise you!

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,880
Do not stop me!

94
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,260
This is good, just do it.

95
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,100
That's good?

96
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,260
This is rolling.

97
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,400
Do you understand STD?

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,520
I don't give up.

99
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Don't worry.

100
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,320
No one will take you away.

101
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,960
Jiang Er.

102
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,760
Add some more dishes tonight.

103
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,800
Manager Jiang is here.

104
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I can smell the smell.

105
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,680
Who is this?

106
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,560
Excuse me.

107
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,080
Manager Jiang.

108
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,920
I'll go get the clothes.

109
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,360
Let me see.

110
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,960
I didn't hit it.

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,680
Be careful.

112
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,480
Where is the owner?

113
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,680
Manager Jiang.

114
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,120
You can't drink alone.

115
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,680
What's wrong with you?

116
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,920
I can't.

117
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,560
It's okay.

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,080
Take it easy.

119
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,040
It's okay.

120
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,080
Xiao Xi.

121
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
Why are you still carrying your backpack?

122
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,200
Take it off.

123
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,640
Xiao Xi.

124
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,920
Take off your backpack, okay?

125
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,480
What's wrong?

126
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,840
The backpack is

127
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,360
a jacket bought by his Hong Kong cousin.

128
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,280
It got dirty on the way here.

129
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,120
I told him

130
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,240
to throw away my clothes.

131
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
He didn't want to.

132
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,040
So I put my clothes in the backpack

133
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,640
and carried it.

134
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,560
It's okay, Xiao Xi.

135
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,080
Or I'll wash it for you.

136
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,760
You can wear it again when it's dry tomorrow.

137
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,040
Tang.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,360
Wash the clothes at home.

139
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,280
Help me

140
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,400
to ask Uncle Qin

141
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,800
to buy a pack of washing liquid, okay?

142
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,320
Okay.

143
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,080
Uncle Qin.

144
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,640
I want a pack of washing liquid.

145
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,400
My dad hasn't come back yet.

146
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,600
Tang.

147
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,280
I heard that you were scared by the snake today.

148
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,360
And you said that a few dogs ate shit.

149
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,120
Wash the clothes.

150
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,840
You don't look like a bear.

151
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,720
Why?

152
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,920
reducing pump fired energy.

153
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,920
No, I don't.

154
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,320
They're!!!!

155
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,640
I think they have an ring to automatically

156
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,320
increase the operating power of their body.

157
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,360
Hey, Veddhi.

158
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
I told you,

159
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,500
don't try to save me.

160
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,200
It's your territory.

161
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,920
Tell Hanz highlighted.

162
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,800
Look.

163
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,960
org,

164
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,240
You lost this.

165
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,200
Tianyu, look over there.

166
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,520
I stepped on your shadow.

167
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,120
I won't lose to you again.

168
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,120
Lin Yingda.

169
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,040
Sit here.

170
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,520
Do you want candy?

171
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,680
Do you have Da promises?

172
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,360
Give me a cup of tea.

173
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,520
doświadчення

174
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
As if you weren't interested.

175
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,800
Chun Lu.

176
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,880
You've been in this little hut for a long time.

177
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,560
Don't run around.

178
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,240
I'm protecting you.

179
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,480
Chun Lu!

180
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,160
Chun Lu.

181
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,120
You should hug...

182
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,240
this way.

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,320
After this.

184
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,880
Touch it.

185
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,920
Touch it.

186
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,720
Poison viable to kill!

187
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,320
Poison viable to kill!

188
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,800
Poison viable to kill!

189
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,320
I can be a manager.

190
00:09:50,600 --> 00:10:09,640
But inside there are only

191
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,920
me and my husband.

192
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,920
We won't mention it in the future.

193
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Manager Jiang is busy with work.

194
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Let's just do our best to help him.

195
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Okay.

196
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
That's enough.

197
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
It's not normal for a child to throw up

198
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,920
when he eats something bad.

199
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Now he's fine.

200
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,920
He had dinner at the neighbor's house.

201
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,920
He even played for a while after eating.

202
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Okay, I won't eat this.

203
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,320
Hu Yiming

204
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,920
Is Jinso avez that star easily to be alive?

205
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,920
He said he would visit his parents.

206
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,360
I have to explain to you.

207
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,800
What?

208
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,360
That new student,

209
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,960
you must treat him well.

210
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,760
You must make him feel that

211
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,120
our Xunshan Primary School

212
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,600
is very kind.

213
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,680
Lin Yitang, you're exaggerating.

214
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,840
He just came.

215
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,000
You're so enthusiastic.

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,080
You don't understand.

217
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,000
He leaves, I have to leave.

218
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,160
Where to?

219
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,800
Son,

220
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,360
the principal

221
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,680
has finally agreed.

222
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,600
You can enter the alcohol lowered class before the exam.

223
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,280
You must take this course.

224
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,040
By then,

225
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,880
you can't continue with your sugar-coated course either.

226
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,760
Pull the flute tonight for two times.

227
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,680
Do something exciting.

228
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,520
Everyone,

229
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,800
one day we won't be enforceable.

230
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,040
Another day we're going to be illegal.

231
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,840
Be forced to do nothing.

232
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm a teacher!

233
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,760
I'm a teacher!

234
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,720
What are you doing?

235
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,360
Who?

236
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,320
How dare you!

237
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,640
Li Qi Le!

238
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,840
Stop playing!

239
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,480
It's time for class.

240
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Back to your seat.

241
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,880
You're now called Qi Le.

242
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,480
Why can't you make me happy?

243
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,680
It's the first day of school.

244
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,280
This is the old Liji Geng dormitory.

245
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,560
Our dorm is the same.

246
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,320
Du Shuang's family lives in a single dormitory.

247
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,520
He lives with his mother.

248
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,120
Du Shuang's father is a beggar.

249
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,840
He's been to Pucheng Palace.

250
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,920
Every time he comes back,

251
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,080
Du Shuang will be unhappy.

252
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,120
Maybe it's because Du Shuang didn't bring him a gift.

253
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,760
Qi Yan Yun's family lives there.

254
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,400
Qi Yan Yun is the most annoying person in the world.

255
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,680
He's the leader.

256
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,840
He's very popular.

257
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,800
But he's so beautiful.

258
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,200
Yu Qiao said we're half a catty and half a catty.

259
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,920
I think he's half a catty.

260
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,160
I'm half a catty.

261
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,280
He lives with his father.

262
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,960
Have you seen his father?

263
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,960
He's Uncle Qin of the Xia Dai Bu.

264
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,680
Qi Yan Yun's father was injured in the palace.

265
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,560
He has a leg that can't walk.

266
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,960
Cai Fang Yuan's father

267
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,160
is the Xia Dai Bu of the palace.

268
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,080
Uncle Qin is amazing.

269
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,280
He practices qigong and zhi leg every day.

270
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,560
This is Yu Qiao's house.

271
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,160
It's your deskmate.

272
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,400
Beautiful kowloon.

273
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,920
He lives with his father,

274
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,720
mother,

275
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,760
grandma,

276
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,920
and little cousin Yu Jin.

277
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,520
Yu Jin's mother is sick.

278
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,320
So she sent Yu Jin to their house.

279
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,720
But Yu Qiao's house is very poor.

280
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,080
It's not good for him.

281
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,400
But Yu Qiao is a labor demon.

282
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,000
He's the eldest brother in the palace.

283
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,240
He'll agree to everything.

284
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,800
Next to Yu Qiao's house is Cai Fang Yuan's house.

285
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,720
Cai Fang Yuan lives with his parents.

286
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,960
Cai Fang Yuan likes to eat

287
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,800
and play.

288
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,840
He likes to watch.

289
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,680
He likes to cook.

290
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,400
He likes to cook.

291
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,000
They hope Cai Fang Yuan can study hard

292
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,440
and get into a famous university.

293
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
There's a bird on the big tree.

294
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,680
There was a bird that fell from the tree the year before.

295
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,960
When he got home,

296
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,960
his father was amazing.

297
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,360
He saved the bird.

298
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,680
Oh, right.

299
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,080
The big tree will bloom in the spring.

300
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,200
The rice cooked by mom is the best.

301
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,040
There will be many pheasants in the summer.

302
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,960
But I don't like pheasants.

303
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,240
They'll be gone as soon as I catch them.

304
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,080
I heard that

305
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,520
when you go to another world alone,

306
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,720
you'll forget the world when you're alive.

307
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,120
I don't want to forget you.

308
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,560
I don't want to forget everything about Xu Shan.

309
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,280
Can you remember it for me?

310
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
If I forget it,

311
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,320
tell me.

312
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,360
I can remember it.

313
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,560
Isn't it more painful?

314
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,800
I'm not afraid of pain.

315
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,440
I don't cry when I hit people.

316
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,640
I just...

317
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,080
I just know that after I die,

318
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,720
your parents will love me.

319
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,680
They will.

320
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,920
They will remember you all the time.

321
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,480
They only like you.

322
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
How do you know?

323
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,240
People who die

324
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,720
will always be loved.

325
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,840
I'm not afraid of death.

326
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,000
You changed your mind.

327
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
You won't take me away?

328
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm not the person you said.

329
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,920
I can't take you away.

330
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,720
What about you?

331
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,040
Are you leaving?

332
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,880
I'll leave one day.

333
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,720
I love my friends.

334
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,080
Even Qi Yan Yun has become cute recently.

335
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,680
If possible,

336
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,280
I hope to be his good friend one day.

337
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
I really hope

338
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,880
I can be a student in the power plant school forever.

339
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
It's a pity

340
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,760
that I'm going to die soon.

341
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,160
Lin Tao.

342
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,320
Lin Tao.

343
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,320
Lin Tao.

344
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,040
Lin Tao.

345
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,240
You don't want them?

346
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,200
Give them to me.

347
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,120
They're your favorite.

348
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,080
You don't want them?

349
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,400
This...

350
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,040
This...

351
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,480
I have to keep them.

352
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,760
Oh my god.

353
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,800
Xiaoxi.

354
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,680
Do you know what happened?

355
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,360
She doesn't want them.

356
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,200
Lin Tao.

357
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,440
Lin Tao.

358
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,680
Mr. Jiang.

359
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,840
Lin Tao's mom.

360
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,720
Look what Lin Tao wrote.

361
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,680
Where is she?

362
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,640
In the room.

363
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,600
Mr. Jiang.

364
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,680
I'm sorry.

365
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,480
You...

366
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,000
Are you okay?

367
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,480
What's wrong?

368
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,320
Lin Tao.

369
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,680
What's wrong with Lin Tao?

370
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,600
Why are you dying?

371
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,920
You're going to die soon.

372
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,520
I really...

373
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,760
I really...

374
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,840
I really...

375
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,760
I really...

376
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,760
I really...

377
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,720
I really...

378
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,680
I really...

379
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,640
I really...

380
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I really want to die.

381
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
What's wrong?

382
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,760
Take it easy.

383
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,040
Don't cry.

384
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,400
Don't worry.

385
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,200
Go.

386
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,080
They all said

387
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,720
if Lu Zhen met a snake

388
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,480
and competed with you,

389
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,320
he would run away.

390
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,560
Because if you lost,

391
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,200
you would die.

392
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,720
If I lose,

393
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,880
you would be much taller than me.

394
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,640
You little girl.

395
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,680
You scared me.

396
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,080
Mr. Jiang, I'm telling the truth.

397
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,800
I think you can ask Cai Fang Yuan.

398
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,600
They all saw it.

399
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,200
So Cai Fang Yuan told you

400
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,600
if you compete with Gao Ai, you will die.

401
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,440
No.

402
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,880
Cai Fang Yuan is so stupid.

403
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,160
Chen Minghao told me that.

404
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,760
Chen Minghao used to live next door.

405
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,080
He used to steal from his family.

406
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,480
But he moved away

407
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,760
because he was admitted to the school.

408
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,560
Look at you.

409
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,920
You little girl.

410
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,720
Ying Tao, do you believe me?

411
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,040
Lin Qi Le will never die.

412
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,160
It's a fake.

413
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,240
It's not true.

414
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,160
Okay?

415
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,840
Okay.

416
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,320
It's okay.

417
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
The teacher said

418
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,040
I need to sign the transfer form again.

419
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,960
You have signed it before.

420
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,280
September 32nd is not my birthday.

421
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,760
I'll write another one.

422
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,000
Hello?

423
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,160
Hello?

424
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,440
Hello?

425
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Hello?

426
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,120
Uncle.

427
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,640
What's the matter?

428
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,920
Thank you.

429
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,480
은

430
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,440
Hello.

431
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,560
We can steam things now.

432
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,360
Your mom came by.

433
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,440
She wanted to come here this afternoon to have lunch with you two.

434
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,380
I'll pick you up after school.

435
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,600
Son, go get it yourself.

436
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Lin Yintang,

437
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,840
I know I won't die.

438
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,120
Why did you help Cai Fang Yuan steal the book?

439
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,280
You can't take the responsibility.

440
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,040
Ying Tao helped me steal the book.

441
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,840
It's his loyalty to his friends.

442
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,560
It has nothing to do with whether he dies or not.

443
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,120
Do something, Ying Tao.

444
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,320
You're my hero.

445
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,120
Do something, hero.

446
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,400
Yesterday, you took Ning Xin to the park with me.

447
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,760
Didn't you say you wanted to be nice to her?

448
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,360
If she leaves, you'll leave with her.

449
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,920
You're so annoying.

450
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,760
Yu Xiao, you're so mean.

451
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,160
She's nice.

452
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,440
Dad, what happens when niece turns shesåndempty würdemax.

453
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,520
I'll go with you.

454
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,500
The

455
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,520
it should be

456
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,080
stop

457
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,520
I can't

458
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:56,980
dare to

459
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,980
If it wasn't for my mom's shift today,

460
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,420
I wouldn't want you to tell me.

461
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,660
I'm almost there.

462
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,780
The

463
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,780
The

464
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,780
The

465
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,780
The

466
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,780
The

467
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,380
This is a good work.

468
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,380
My original name is Lin Yingtao.

469
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,780
When my mom was pregnant with me,

470
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,580
she really wanted to eat cherry tomatoes.

471
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,780
Later, when I went to school,

472
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,180
she said it couldn't be that simple

473
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,380
and meaningful.

474
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,780
So she changed it to Lin Qile.

475
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,780
Luckily, your mom

476
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,380
didn't like garlic or sweet potatoes.

477
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,580
Otherwise, you would be called Lin Di Gua

478
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,580
and Lin Da Suan.

479
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,380
You're crazy.

480
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,780
Lin Yingtao is crazy again.

481
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,380
I'm the fish bridge

482
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,780
and the fish bridge that blocks the river.

483
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,180
My dad read a financial novel

484
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:46,980
and got it for me.

485
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,180
My square is that square.

486
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,380
I want to make a lot of money in the future.

487
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,380
There's an artist called Zhu Shang.

488
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,180
My mom thinks

489
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,180
that's Du.

490
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,980
So I'll be Du Shang.

491
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,180
Jiang Qiaoxi,

492
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,780
what do you mean by your name?

493
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,780
I don't mean anything.

494
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,980
Your name is so cool.

495
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,380
I don't mean anything.

496
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,580
I don't mean anything.

497
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:22,980
I'm out of energy.

498
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,580
Sheng Juan, don't be busy.

499
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,980
There's enough food.

500
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
It's okay.

501
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,380
Here.

502
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,780
Okay.

503
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,580
Look.

504
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,180
I was supposed to

505
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,380
entrust Qiaoxi to you.

506
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,380
Now it's good.

507
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,980
But I entrust myself to you.

508
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,580
Manager Jiang, don't be polite.

509
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,180
We just sit around.

510
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,980
It's not casual.

511
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,780
It's too rich.

512
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,580
But what do you mean?

513
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,380
It's okay.

514
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:43,780
It's delicious.

515
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,580
It's really delicious.

516
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,780
It's better than the one in Guanjian.

517
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,980
Uncle Jiang,

518
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,180
what does Qiaoxi mean by Jiang Qiaoxi?

519
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,580
You're asking me.

520
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,580
I really don't know

521
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,580
what Qiaoxi means.

522
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,380
When Hong Fei and I were born,

523
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,180
we hadn't prepared ourselves.

524
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,180
Later,

525
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,380
we had to write our birth certificate

526
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,780
and a name.

527
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,380
I was so anxious.

528
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,180
Then I saw a poem

529
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,180
in the newspaper.

530
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,180
It said

531
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,180
Jiang Qiaoxi is the one

532
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,980
who is the most important person in the family.

533
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,380
It's a coincidence.

534
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,780
You're right.

535
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,380
It's really not a big deal.

536
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,380
It's hard to write it.

537
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,180
You can eat it as you like.

538
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:23,780
Come on.

539
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,580
Thank you.

540
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,180
Do you drink coke?

541
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,380
What about jianli Bao?

542
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,580
What about peanut milk?

543
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,380
My favorite.

544
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,380
It's delicious.

545
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,180
Don't you need to study?

546
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,780
Do you want to hug Chun Lu?

547
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,720
P 컬러� Etude House

548
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,880
I heard that

549
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,820
Jiang Jinzhi didn't have

550
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,780
that one child

551
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,880
named Jiang Meng Chu before,

552
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,380
but when she named him,

553
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,780
she thought about it for two to three months.

554
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,380
After she just reached the final boys class at the Institute of Mal HP,

555
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,580
everyone Alas,

556
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,380
called him a god Southern Dong.

557
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,580
The thin skin on his appearance

558
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,580
aimed at a really rich boy.

559
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,620
I told you, I'm not in the report.

560
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,860
I thought maybe when I have a child,

561
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,940
I hope I can be able to

562
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,460
take care of him like father.

563
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,900
It's a good thing.

564
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,820
This child is nine years old now.

565
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,580
He's still so mature.

566
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,020
How can they be so good?

567
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,860
Baby,

568
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,540
we've seen our mother get married.

569
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,580
The Little Rabbit

570
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,500
The little rabbit is so good.

571
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,940
Open the door.

572
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,020
I want to come in.

573
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,980
Why are you so stupid?

574
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,260
You can open the door if I ask you to.

575
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,980
What if I say you're a bad boy?

576
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,460
I'm going to do homework.

577
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,260
What's there to write about homework?

578
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,820
I'll take you to a place.

579
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,860
I'm sorry.

580
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,300
It's raining.

581
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,420
It's all my fault.

582
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,020
I didn't see the weather forecast.

583
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,100
Yin Yin Tao,

584
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,940
what do you want to say?

585
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,500
Look.

586
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,980
Chinese characters.

587
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,620
The 795th page.

588
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,860
The 24th.

589
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,060
Mount Gu Shou.

590
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,220
The 9th.

591
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,540
The 4th.

592
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,940
The 4th.

593
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,540
It means the mountain path.

594
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,420
The bridge means the high mountain.

595
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,900
The west.

596
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,820
It's the highest and most steepest mountain in Qun Mountain.

597
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,500
I've seen the most beautiful sunset here.

598
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,900
It's so bright and bright.

599
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,620
I think that means the name of the bridge.

600
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,620
But...

601
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,300
But it's raining now.

602
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,500
I can't see anything.

603
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,980
Then...

604
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,940
Tell me the sunset you saw here.

605
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,740
I'll tell you.

606
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,060
The sunset was like a fire.

607
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,180
The shape and color were changing.

608
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,740
I never know what it will look like in the next minute.

609
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,500
Does it look like a rabbit?

610
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,660
Yes.

611
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,420
That rabbit was running beside the sun.

612
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,860
That rabbit was wearing a tiger's tail.

613
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,260
Did you see it?

614
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,620
You're right.

615
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,780
There was a rabbit running.

616
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,660
I didn't lie, right?

617
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,980
The name Jiang Qiaoxi is meaningful.

618
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,540
It's nice to laugh.

619
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,500
Jiang Qiaoxi!

620
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,700
Look.

621
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,340
I'm calling my name and Jiang Qiaoxi will smile.

622
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,900
Jiang Qiaoxi!

623
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,780
Jiang Qiaoxi!

624
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,780
Jiang Qiaoxi!

625
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,420
Senior and sister-in-law, let me introduce to you.

626
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,380
There's a test report.

627
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,060
The most important thing is that he is harmless.

628
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,100
Our baby is still so young.

629
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,820
He eats a lot of vegetables and fruits.

630
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,580
There are pesticides, that's amazing

631
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,540
amazing

632
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,380
I didn't remember the one behind

633
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,980
But they said this can be drunk

634
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,020
I'll give you half a bottle

635
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
I promise it's harmless

636
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,020
I'm really confident

637
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,780
Then you don't need this

638
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,500
It's okay, it's okay

639
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,220
Don't kill him, don't kill him

640
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,380
Wang Yu, no need

641
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,900
This thing is not only harmless

642
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,860
And its cleaning ability is very

643
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,780
Xiaoying, you're back

644
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,700
Uncle Mao, where are you going

645
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,420
No one plays with me if you're not here

646
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,100
There are bulls on the high mountains

647
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,900
Let's play

648
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,500
Come on

649
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,060
There is a bull on the high mountains

650
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,700
Two chickens, one head

651
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,220
Four hens are divided into two halves

652
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,500
The tail is on the back of the head

653
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,660
Give, give, back of the head

654
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,860
Give, give, back of the head

655
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,100
Dingdang, don't be so old-fashioned

656
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,260
Hurry up and wash your hands and eat

657
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,420
Yes, uncle

658
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,060
Uncle

659
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,300
Are you eating at our house today

660
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,180
I must eat faster than you this time

661
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,500
Of course

662
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,780
Uncle Wang is eating at our house today

663
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,420
Eat

664
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,580
I'm not here to eat with my brother and sister-in-law

665
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,260
I have a lot of things to do, but I'm busy

666
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,540
Wang Yu

667
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,700
Wang Yu, let's buy three bottles

668
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,500
Don't eat

669
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,660
Okay, eat

670
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,460
Let's try

671
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,260
This one

672
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,580
This one

673
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:16,860
Okay

674
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,860
You stay here for lunch

675
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,660
Let's eat together

676
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,300
Come on

677
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,260
This one can read Chinese characters

678
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,100
What about the bulls on the high mountains

679
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,180
They're not coming

680
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,820
Didn't they say

681
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,580
Go to the mountains together

682
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,220
Give Jiang Zhengxi a birthday gift in advance

683
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,460
Give him a gift

684
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,980
The surprise on the way is that he's not coming

685
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,940
Good brother

686
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,980
What do they mean

687
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,820
Why are you so good

688
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,340
Let's make a good living together

689
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,340
I'll be a pig

690
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,700
The pig's feet are not hot

691
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,180
You're so lucky to let me come back

692
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,980
Isn't that stupid man out of breath

693
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,980
Why are you back

694
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
All this time

695
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,780
This man is out of breath

696
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,580
He's out of breath, too

697
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,300
Don't you know the words

698
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,420
Can you talk so well

699
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,220
Don't be afraid

700
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,580
I'm not going to

701
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,660
You're still laughing at him

702
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,100
Do you know who raised you like money

703
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,180
You're talking to me

704
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,020
Get out of the way

705
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,820
Who wants to kill him

706
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,180
What are you doing

707
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,340
What are you doing

708
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,420
You're so stubborn

709
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,300
Your medical bills

710
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,940
I'll take his bonus

711
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,020
Don't worry

712
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,300
Du Yuchun, you explain

713
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,740
Why did you hit your wife

714
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,300
What did she do wrong

715
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,540
I'm drunk

716
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,860
I'm sorry

717
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,340
So

718
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,780
You split Du Yuchun's salary

719
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,860
into three parts

720
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,380
Send him two home

721
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,340
One more

722
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,300
Leave it to him

723
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,020
You go to the construction site

724
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:51,940
Say hello

725
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,540
You just say I said it

726
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,500
Okay, that's it

727
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,340
Be careful

728
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,660
Come

729
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,740
You're going to celebrate your birthday

730
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,820
Dad prepared a birthday gift for you

731
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,260
Do you like it

732
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,660
Black again

733
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,540
My mom chose

734
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,900
Or you

735
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,700
I discussed it with your mother

736
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,820
Black suits you better

737
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,820
Boys

738
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,660
Black is also better

739
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,420
Xiaoxi

740
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,220
Dad is busy recently

741
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,740
Can't send you

742
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,260
The day after tomorrow

743
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,540
Let mom pick you back to the provincial city

744
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,100
Happy birthday to you

745
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,460
Happy birthday to you

746
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,580
Happy birthday to you

747
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,780
Happy birthday to you

748
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,860
Happy birthday to you

749
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,580
Jiang Xiaoxi

750
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,020
Happy birthday to you

751
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,660
These flowers

752
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,900
Started to be collected before winter

753
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,420
Mom dried them for me

754
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,900
Made a deep flower

755
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,500
The kind that will never fall

756
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,620
But you like black

757
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,780
I have never seen black flowers in Qingshan

758
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,620
Just dye it black with ink

759
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,260
Do you think black is good

760
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,820
We don't like so many black

761
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,300
But you wear black every day

762
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,860
Wenju River, steel pen, water cup

763
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,020
Even the elephant skin is black

764
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,660
We have never seen so many black

765
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,740
At the same time on one person

766
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,580
But Lin Yitong said

767
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,380
Like a person

768
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,100
You have to like him according to his original appearance

769
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,500
I'm not that kind of like

770
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,660
Which kind of like

771
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,180
you

772
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,260
I like it very much

773
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,100
Then you say your speech

774
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,140
Thank you all

775
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,340
Jiang Xiaoxi, try it

776
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,700
Jiang Xiaoxi

777
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,660
Happy birthday

778
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,980
Du Shang, you didn't miss it

779
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,740
We are at the wedding ceremony

780
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,500
Come on

781
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,620
I've been waiting for you for a long time

782
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,900
How can you wash it

783
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,140
Jiang Xiaoxi, happy birthday

784
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,020
Du Shang

785
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,700
I want to give you this wish

786
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,300
You make a wish

787
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,700
Happy birthday

788
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,580
Du Shang

789
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,940
Happy birthday

790
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,900
Du Shang

791
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,320
Take care

792
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,300
Yiłam

793
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,100
Happy birthday

794
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,260
Happy birthday

795
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,260
Happy birthday

796
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,420
Du Sha

797
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,180
Happy birthday

798
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,300
costing

799
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,140
I'm so happy

800
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:22,980
after every birthday

801
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,060
Happy birthday

802
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,060
Jiang Jiaxi, remember,

803
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,660
this is your home.

804
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,460
You have to come back earlier.

805
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,660
Ying Tao, thank you.

806
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,860
Thank you for what? You're very nice too.

807
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,660
You even gave your birthday wishes to Du Shan.

808
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,260
Who would give out birthday wishes?

809
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:49,460
Anyway, my wishes have never been fulfilled.

810
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,260
Then what wish do you have?

811
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,660
I'll help you fulfill it.

812
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,860
Actually,

813
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,660
I don't like black.

814
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,260
But I like the gifts you gave me.

815
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,260
Today, it's my first time liking black.

816
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,260
You don't like black?

817
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:12,660
But why is everything you have in your body black?

818
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,260
The one who likes black is my brother.

819
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,060
These are the things they bought for me.

820
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:22,260
If I like black,

821
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,260
I can only like black.

822
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,860
They won't love me the way I used to.

823
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,060
Then what color do you like?

824
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,860
I never thought about it.

825
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,260
But I'm starting to like black.

826
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,260
What about the others? Think about the others.

827
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,260
You'll like it in the future.

828
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,460
Red, I guess.

829
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,660
I like red.

830
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,660
Jiang Jiaxi, next time when I celebrate my birthday,

831
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,260
I'll choose for you.

832
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:05,860
I'll choose for your parents to love you the way you used to.

833
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
What about your wish?

834
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,660
What is your wish?

835
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,260
My wish

836
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,060
is to have all of us together.

837
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,860
We shouldn't be separated.

838
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,660
Then you can have your wish.

839
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,660
For me, this is more important.

840
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,060
I don't know.

841
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,460
Wait a minute.

842
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,860
Why do you buy that?

843
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,460
Jiaxi, open the door.

844
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,700
Thank you.

845
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,100
Ying Tao, take it in.

846
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,060
Come in.

847
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,540
Take it in and eat it.

848
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,620
You know

849
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,980
what the buns are made of.

850
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,100
Miss, thank you.

851
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,020
We don't eat buns from outside.

852
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,940
Qiao Xi, close the door.

853
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,380
The air conditioner is on.

854
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,500
Come in.

855
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,460
Don't let Ying Tao know about this.

856
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,660
Wait until after school.

857
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,260
Maybe he will be better

858
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,620
after he hears this news

859
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,580
after he doesn't see the winter vacation.

860
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,460
It may not be better

861
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,140
after the winter vacation.

862
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,020
What should we do?

863
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,940
The baby is...

864
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,940
He is so different.

865
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,260
He is so different.

866
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,980
Come on, eat.

867
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,300
Dad, mom,

868
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,740
you mean

869
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,500
who is going to transfer the money?

870
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,820
It's not Jiang Qiao Xi, right?

871
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,180
She said she will come back after the winter vacation.

872
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,220
She is not a liar.

873
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,660
He said he'll be back after he's done with his work.

874
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,660
Why did he lie to me?

875
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,460
Ming Tao, after handling the matter at Auntie's office,

876
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,460
he wants to stay in the provincial city

877
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,060
and be able to take good care of Qiao Xi.

878
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,860
That...

879
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,260
I'll see you next time.

880
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,060
Take care.

881
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,460
Okay. See you next time.

882
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,660
Uncle Wang!

883
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,860
Ming Tao, study hard.

884
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,460
Uncle Wang said

885
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,660
don't laugh at me in the future.

886
00:42:48,660 --> 00:43:11,620
Building Whoa

887
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,260
Jiang Qiao Xi!

888
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,140
Jiang Qiao Xi!

889
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,100
Jiang Zhaoxi! Jiang Zhaoxi!

890
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,620
Write a letter to me!

891
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:27,340
Ying Tao! Come back when I'm home!

892
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,140
Ying Tao! Come back when I'm home!

893
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,620
I know.

894
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,780
Even if I'm brave,

895
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,620
I won't grow out of this.

896
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,620
I can't find the right one.

897
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,620
Dad said

898
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,620
people are like silkworms,

899
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,620
snakes and crabs when they're alive.

900
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,620
We must start to retreat when the time comes.

901
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,620
Only by letting go of something

902
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,620
and forget it,

903
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,620
we can pretend to be real

904
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,620
and live a better life.

905
00:45:45,620 --> 00:46:15,620
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

906
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:19,660
There's enough on paper, just like a magic

907
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,080
Thank you on the hillside

908
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:30,340
A little bit but we lost our eyes

909
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,780
Don't be too bad

910
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:43,020
My looks are not good

911
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,580
I can begin

912
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,260
In the pain, I look at you

913
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,860
You are the one who is the most beautiful

914
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:59,860
At this moment, I understand peace and freedom
