Episode 2

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't go.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't know where to find you if you leave.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll go find you.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Come here.

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Lie down.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Lie down.

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Lie down.

14
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll go find you.

15
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You weren't here yesterday.

16
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I didn't dare to sleep.

17
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Now it's fine.

18
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You take me home.

19
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is not home.

20
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is a rented house.

21
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Then in your heart,

22
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
what is home?

23
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Anyway, this is not home.

24
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Jiang Qiao Xi.

25
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The place that makes people feel at ease

26
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
is home.

27
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I want to sleep.

28
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can't leave.

29
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
When I wake up and open my eyes,

30
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll see you.

31
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you know that?

32
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can't leave.

33
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll go.

34
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Looking at the sky,

35
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
the bright clouds are not speaking.

36
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The quiet boat is waiting for an answer.

37
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The moonlight is soft and soft.

38
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It covers my face.

39
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's shy and it's like it's been there before.

40
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The blue sky is like a broken glass.

41
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In the grass,

42
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
all of a sudden,

43
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
it stops by my side.

44
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Jiang Qiao Xi.

45
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
These long and hard times,

46
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
are they over?

47
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm tired.

48
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm tired.

49
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm tired.

50
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't be like this.

51
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Wake up.

52
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Every time I think of you,

53
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm in a daze.

54
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Isn't this a dream?

55
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is the story going to end?

56
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We'll meet again.

57
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Maybe we'll have a regret next time.

58
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The sun is about to set.

59
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How many days are left until we meet?

60
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Why are you so nervous?

61
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If I'm not nervous,

62
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll be nervous.

63
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm not nervous.

64
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm not nervous.

65
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If I'm not nervous,

66
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm just a nightmare.

67
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You're not a nightmare.

68
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Did you dream of me?

69
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Are you the same as me?

70
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
When you can't see me,

71
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
you always dream of me.

72
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No.

73
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're lying now.

74
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm not lying.

75
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Jiang Qiao Xi.

76
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Two years ago,

77
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
you told me not to forget you.

78
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I kept my promise.

79
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So now,

80
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
you don't have any reason to reject me.

81
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Jiang Xiaoxi.

173
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'll visit you tomorrow morning.

174
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,840
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,240
Go back and sleep.

176
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,120
You should leave tomorrow.

177
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,840
You don't have to see them.

178
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,360
Why not?

179
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,440
The lipstick and high heels you gave me

180
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,800
were picked by Tang.

181
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,320
I'm in Hong Kong now.

182
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,720
I must visit them.

183
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You should thank them.

184
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,960
I haven't contacted them.

185
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,040
Jiang Qiang Xin, what are you afraid of?

186
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,000
Why can't you tell me the truth?

187
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
It's not the time yet.

188
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't have the right to tell you what I'm afraid of.

189
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,280
When will you stop?

190
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,560
When do you think you have the right?

191
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,640
Why do you always hesitate at this time?

192
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,120
You did it when you were young.

193
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
You have to wait.

194
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,840
You have to hold on. You have to endure.

195
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,280
You have to be patient to negotiate with your mother.

196
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,640
You think you have to get through the Olympics to be able to play.

197
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,760
You think you can only be independent after you graduate.

198
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,440
Now you push me away again when you encounter such a thing.

199
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,840
You think you have to be prepared for everything

200
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,440
to take the next step, right?

201
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,680
But this world is not a math problem.

202
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,400
You can't write the answer

203
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,920
after you prepare everything.

204
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,840
Anyway, I don't do it.

205
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,600
Our family doesn't do it either.

206
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Then tell me.

207
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,280
What did your Lin family do?

208
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,320
Our family

209
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,360
is all facing difficulties together.

210
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,840
Jiang Qiang Xin,

211
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,200
there is no need to be perfect.

212
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,000
Because it's impossible

213
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,520
for humans to be always top.

214
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,560
It's impossible to be always top.

215
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,840
It's impossible to be always excellent.

216
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,600
I can be imperfect.

217
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
I know that

218
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,880
I can't be perfect in this life.

219
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,520
Don't you know that I'm here?

220
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,280
I don't want you to suffer with me.

221
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,440
And I know that

222
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,440
if I'm enjoying myself now,

223
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,120
I may not be with me.

224
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,160
But if I'm suffering today,

225
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,040
you will come to spend time with me.

226
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Then you

227
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,280
are not afraid that I really forget you?

228
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,800
Now I'm like this.

229
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,520
Is there anything worth remembering?

230
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,920
What you should remember

231
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,280
is not how Jiang Qiang Xin is now.

232
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,520
You see, you're back again.

233
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,680
You still want me to remember

234
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,880
the excellent you,

235
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,560
the top you.

236
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,640
Lingde, I'm different from you.

237
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,760
I'm very lacking.

238
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,160
If I don't have any excellence,

239
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,160
what else is worth your love?

240
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Jiang Qiang Xin,

241
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,640
do you think you won the battle

242
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,800
with your mother when you were a kid?

243
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,280
You're just a fake victory on the surface.

244
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
You've always wanted us to love you

245
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,760
as you were.

246
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,440
But do you really know

247
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,600
what you were like?

248
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,440
Do you accept him?

249
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,120
Do you love him?

250
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,840
You just want to add a halo

251
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,120
to your original appearance.

252
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,360
Then you feel

253
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,760
you deserve to be loved.

254
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,640
This is the only root of your life.

255
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,880
He's hurting you.

256
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,320
He's hurting us too.

257
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,320
You're so good.

258
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,200
Can you accept me

259
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,720
who's not worth anything?

260
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,440
I'm not that good in your heart.

261
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,720
You're underestimating me, Jiang Qiang Xin.

262
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,360
You think my love for you

263
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,240
is something you need to win with excellence.

264
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,960
But let me tell you.

265
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,760
As long as I decide to love you,

266
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,240
I'll always love you.

267
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,840
No matter how excellent you are,

268
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,040
you won't let me love you more.

269
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,520
No matter how ordinary you are,

270
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
you won't let me

271
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,720
love you less.

272
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,160
Wait for me.

273
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,560
I'll come to you.

274
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,880
Jiang Qiang Xin, I want to date too.

275
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,200
I want to be with someone.

276
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,120
I don't want to keep calling

277
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,440
and sending messages

278
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,320
that no one has ever replied.

279
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,560
It's okay.

280
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,560
I've been in love with you

281
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,440
not only when I was a kid.

282
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,120
I can love someone else too.

283
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,680
I couldn't fall in love with you when I was in school.

284
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,640
Now you say you have nothing.

285
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,000
What about in the future?

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,280
What else is there to ask?

287
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,400
Even if I wait for you,

288
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,960
how long do I have to wait?

289
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,800
When it rains in Hongyang,

290
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I always wonder

291
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,520
where you are and if you have an umbrella.

292
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,840
When it's windy, I always wonder

293
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,880
if you are safe.

294
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,160
When someone has a car accident,

295
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,680
I also wonder where you are.

296
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,080
If you encounter something,

297
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,040
how do you handle it?

298
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,880
But I don't know.

299
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,040
I really don't know.

300
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,320
I don't want to be like this anymore.

301
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,680
I miss you like this alone.

302
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,840
And then...

303
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,360
And then I don't even have your phone number.

304
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
I don't want to.

305
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,560
You also said

306
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,520
I should always remember you.

307
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,160
But what's the use of remembering you?

308
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
I can miss you when I'm ten.

309
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,360
I'll wait for you.

310
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,640
But I'm twenty years old.

311
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,160
I can't be a kid forever.

312
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,600
I can't do something stupid all the time.

313
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,440
When will I wait for you?

314
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,760
Wait until I fall in love?

315
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,000
Wait until I get married?

316
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Or do I have my own family?

317
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
I still remember you at that time.

318
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,480
Remember the excellent Jiang Qiao Xi.

319
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
Is there any meaning?

320
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
Jiang Qiao Xi.

321
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,200
I decided not to love you anymore.

322
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,680
You don't need to

323
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,640
use excellence and care to win my love.

324
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,120
If you really need care,

325
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
you can fight for yourself.

326
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,520
I'm leaving.

327
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,320
Yes.

328
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,040
Qu invented this.

329
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,520
You lock up your heart

330
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,780
Like click on the bottom of the Phillips

331
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,120
After you Czy

332
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,320
You left only the geology

333
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,080
I quit playing

334
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,440
No one will answer my call.

335
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,360
He won't be worried.

336
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,000
You're the reason I still can't

337
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
doubt

338
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,440
I'm in the unknown

339
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,920
I turn around and see your love

340
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,720
You're the reason I still shine

341
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,680
Missing you

342
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,200
The light of the morning

343
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,080
You appear in my dreams

344
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,520
You populations can be figured out

345
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,220
come

346
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,860
back

347
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:28,780
Ladies

348
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:41,240
や

349
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,020
Then get down

350
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,820
what

351
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,780
I'm going

352
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,980
Why take me

353
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:53,980
This

354
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,180
Wait

355
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Like a tide,

356
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
it flows down.

357
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,520
I follow you.

358
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,520
You're the reason I still run.

359
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,520
My heart beats for your smile.

360
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,520
I want to drift to your shoreline.

361
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,520
You're the reason I still shine.

362
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,520
I want to drift to your shoreline.

363
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,520
I want to drift to your shoreline.

364
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,520
I want to drift to your shoreline.

365
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,520
I want to drift to your shoreline.

366
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Jiang.

367
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Qiao.

368
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
Xin.

369
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
I saw you chasing me.

370
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
But I let the driver

371
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
come back.

372
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,520
I want you to taste

373
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,520
the taste of chasing people.

374
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Thank you.

375
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Two years ago,

376
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
you told me not to forget you.

377
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Then you ran away.

378
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
I left just now.

379
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
You came to chase me again.

380
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
What do you mean?

381
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,360
I'm sorry.

382
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,640
Ming Tao.

383
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,880
Don't not love me.

384
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,600
I can't bear to leave you.

385
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,480
What do you mean?

386
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,480
If I had to give you the right answer,

387
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,440
I hate the two of us.

388
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,520
I...

389
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,160
I...

390
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,200
I can't live without you.

391
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,240
Can you not leave?

392
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,240
I don't want to see you dating anyone else.

393
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,560
I don't want to see you marry anyone else either.

394
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,600
I can't accept everything.

395
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,800
It's meaningless.

396
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,040
I...

397
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,960
Lin Ying Tao.

398
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,640
Thank you for not forgetting me.

399
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
I love you.

400
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,840
I, Jiang Qiao Xi, want to be your boyfriend.

401
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,000
If you put it that way,

402
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,840
it's not bad at all.

403
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,360
Lin Ying Tao.

404
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,440
Thank you for not forgetting me.

405
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,320
I love you.

406
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,080
I, Jiang Qiao Xi,

407
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,320
from now on,

408
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,280
am your boyfriend.

409
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,840
I...

410
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,840
Let me think.

411
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,840
If you want to be my boyfriend, be my boyfriend.

412
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:38,920
Then...

413
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,120
Then, Ying Tao,

414
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,720
can you be my girlfriend?

415
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,320
Let me think.

416
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,680
Have you thought it through?

417
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,440
Actually, I'm still very remorseful.

418
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,760
I've thought about it many times.

419
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,280
If one day you appear in front of me

420
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,840
and talk to me like this,

421
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,320
I'll really have to remember for a long time

422
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,840
and be angry for a long time before I forgive you.

423
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,800
I know you'll be angry with me.

424
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,320
I also know

425
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,400
you'll forgive me after a long time.

426
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,080
Because I'm also very hard to forgive myself.

427
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,120
Are you stupid?

428
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,920
Why did you say that to me?

429
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,000
At this time, shouldn't you

430
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,200
come and hug me?

431
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,120
Then I'll push you away and hit you a few times.

432
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,640
Then you hug me

433
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,400
and don't let go.

434
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,720
I'm your girlfriend.

435
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,120
Don't hug me. Don't hug me.

436
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,800
I want to go.

437
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,760
I want to go.

438
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,520
No.

439
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:06,960
No.

440
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:07,800
Why are you afraid?

441
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,240
Let's go back to the hotel.

442
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:14,880
Let's go back to the capital of Shanghai.

443
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,240
OK.

444
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Come back, let's take a ride, and regenerate our bodies.

445
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,480
Is that okay?

446
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,080
Come back.

447
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,640
I'll wait for you, then I'll come back to the castle.

448
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,640
Then...

449
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Then I'm your girlfriend.

450
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
This...

451
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
What?

452
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,640
Go back first.

453
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
It's late. You should go to bed.

454
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
I don't want to sleep.

455
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
The weather is so nice.

456
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
I want to do something else.

457
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,640
No. You just got sick.

458
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,640
You have to rest quickly.

459
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
I took medicine.

460
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
And I slept all afternoon.

461
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
I'm very strong now.

462
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
You were in the construction site during the day.

463
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
You didn't sleep.

464
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,640
You can't, right?

465
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
I can.

466
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Then...

467
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,640
Then it's a deal.

468
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Tonight is our first date.

469
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
You have to take me around Hong Kong more.

470
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
To make up for my injury.

471
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
Okay.

472
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,640
Let's go on a date.

473
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
You can leave the luggage here.

474
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
I forgot.

475
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,640
You will see the feeling of hurt.

476
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Every minute, every second, I will be with you.

477
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,640
I have been through the hard times.

478
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:46,640
No regrets can stop me.

479
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,640
This is the most sincere and firmest thing I can do for you.

480
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,640
I'm just a little bit far away from you.

481
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,640
I always have hope.

482
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,640
But my dear friend, I have you.

483
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,640
You are my crossroads.

484
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Are you laughing?

485
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
I think you are laughing.

486
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,640
I'm not laughing.

487
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
What are you thinking?

488
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
I just suddenly thought of it.

489
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,640
When we were seventeen, we had breakfast at school.

490
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
We hid in the alley.

491
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
We were almost found.

492
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Now we are eating snacks on the street.

493
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:44,640
On the street, every minute, I will be with you.

494
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
Like a TV series.

495
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,640
From now on, there will be no one to stop us.

496
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,640
This is the most sincere and firmest thing I can do for you.

497
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,640
There will be no distance that I can't cross.

498
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,640
I'm a girl.

499
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
That's right.

500
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
Nothing can stop us.

501
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
I've grown up.

502
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
That's not because you've grown up.

503
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,640
It's because of your courage that you've broken all the obstacles.

504
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
Of course.

505
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
I'm good, right?

506
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
All men are equal.

507
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Jiang Xiaoxi.

508
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,640
I'm full.

509
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,640
I feel good.

510
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,640
I'm in a good mood.

511
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,640
Do you want to tell me what happened to you these years?

512
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
Do you remember

513
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
when you first knew I was going to study abroad,

514
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,640
you told me

515
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
that the Great Pond is huge.

516
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
It's a huge city.

517
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,640
You can do great things.

518
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:18,640
But I didn't even do the little things.

519
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
I just arrived in Hong Kong.

520
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,640
The 4th generation crisis broke out.

521
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,640
My parents broke up with the stock market and divorced.

522
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,640
They didn't care about me.

523
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
My cousin's business is finance.

524
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,640
Of course, it's very vulnerable.

525
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,640
But at the beginning,

526
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,640
he still wanted to bear all my living expenses abroad.

527
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Can you keep your eyes on me?

528
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,640
This is the same as the several financial tycoons in Hong Kong.

529
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,640
So I'm sure my father has been through this.

530
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
He's not worried about his health.

531
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
I'm your brother.

532
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
I have a school.

533
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,640
I have money. Don't worry.

534
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
You're a kid.

535
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
You're young.

536
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
Don't worry about the adult things.

537
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
Get up early and study well.

538
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
No, Tang, don't say that.

539
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,640
You can't stop your insurance for the parents' pension.

540
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
What if you...

541
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
Tang, I think you should...

542
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Your cousin and I are in good health now.

543
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
We're healthier than you.

544
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,640
If you lose everything,

545
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,640
you'll be a loser.

546
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
What's wrong with losing your life?

547
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Anyway, don't think about leaving school.

548
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
We won't do that.

549
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,640
And your exam.

550
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,640
You can get the school's president.

551
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,640
You got the president.

552
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,640
This will be a income in the future.

553
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
You should work harder and graduate earlier.

554
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
Then you can work for the society.

555
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,640
Maybe my cousin will fire me.

556
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
I'll have to work for him.

557
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
Don't laugh.

558
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,640
Anyway, study well.

559
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,640
After graduation,

560
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
we'll have double insurance.

561
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Think about it.

562
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,640
Okay.

563
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,640
Tang, I'll work hard

564
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,640
to graduate earlier and help you.

565
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,640
That's right, you bastard.

566
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,640
You're talking too much.

567
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
I'll tell the security.

568
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Zhang Youcheng.

569
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
The security won't let me go upstairs.

570
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
They said I'm not a member of the company.

571
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,640
I just want to ask why you fired me.

572
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Don't say that.

573
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
Don't be impulsive.

574
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
I'll talk to them.

575
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
Please continue eating.

576
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,640
My cousin is older than me.

577
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
He took me to the kindergarten

578
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,640
and taught me how to write.

579
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
When he was in trouble,

580
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
he still saved me money to study abroad.

581
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
It's because he understood

582
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,640
that my parents and I

583
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
couldn't live on.

584
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,640
But

585
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
he was pushed down.

586
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
Tang.

587
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
Tang.

588
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,640
Tang.

589
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,640
Tang is living in ICU.

590
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,640
He doesn't know how much money he spent.

591
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
The compensation is not enough.

592
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
It would be great if he didn't hear about the insurance.

593
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,640
Tang can only sell the house.

594
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,640
I'll go to the hospital.

595
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
I'll go to the hospital.

596
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
I'll go to the hospital.

597
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
I'll go to the hospital.

598
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
The financial turmoil was great.

599
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,640
It was cheap and cheap.

600
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,640
But there was no way.

601
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,640
If I didn't sell it,

602
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
I wouldn't have money to go to the hospital.

603
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
He cried and said to me,

604
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,640
I'm sorry.

605
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
You have to pay my tuition.

606
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,640
I told him

607
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
I wouldn't go to study abroad.

608
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
He didn't agree.

609
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
I sat in Hong Kong and didn't want to go.

610
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
I'd rather stay in Hong Kong

611
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
and make all my offers in Hong Kong.

612
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
I didn't want to go.

613
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,640
Because I didn't have money,

614
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,640
I couldn't live in a good nursing home.

615
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,640
My uncle was in a hurry to retire in the past few months.

616
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,640
He almost forgot everyone

617
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
and everything.

618
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
He forgot everything.

619
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,640
Finally,

620
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,640
he went to beg his senior.

621
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,640
My brother's good friend Xu Wenzhou

622
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,640
also graduated from Hong Kong University.

623
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,640
Be careful.

624
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,640
Xu took me to the campus

625
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
and used all my grades

626
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
to beg the principal

627
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
for money.

628
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
He hoped to allow me to stay in Hong Kong University

629
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640
for a year.

630
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,640
He wanted me to earn the money I had at home.

631
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,640
When I was young,

632
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
everything I had

633
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,640
was like a dream to me.

634
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,640
I often don't know

635
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
where I am

636
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,640
when I'm half awake.

637
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Take an apple and eat it.

638
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
You take it.

639
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
You must eat it yourself.

640
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,640
I don't care about your news anymore.

641
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
It's because

642
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
I don't even have the courage

643
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
to read your news.

644
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
I'm sorry.

645
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
I'm sorry.

646
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
I'm sorry.

647
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
I'm sorry.

648
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,640
I'm sorry.

649
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
I'm sorry.

650
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,640
I'm sorry.

651
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
I'm sorry.

652
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,640
I'm sorry.

653
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
I'm sorry.

654
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,640
I'm sorry.

655
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
I'm sorry.

656
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
I'm sorry.

657
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
I'm sorry.

658
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,640
I'm sorry.

659
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
I'm sorry.

660
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
I'm sorry.

661
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
I'm sorry.

662
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,640
I'm sorry.

663
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
I'm sorry.

664
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
I'm sorry.

665
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
I'm sorry.

666
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
I'm sorry.

667
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
I'm sorry.

668
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
I'm sorry.

669
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
I'm sorry.

671
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
I'm sorry.

672
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,640
I'm sorry.

673
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
I'm sorry.

674
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
I'm sorry.

675
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
I'm sorry.

676
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
I'm sorry.

677
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
It's all my fault.

678
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Try again.

679
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
It's all my fault.

680
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
I should be thankful.

681
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
I ought to be.

682
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
I really need to be thankful.

683
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,080
The event

684
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,880
and the most stable way.

685
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,400
Besides,

686
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,800
it's not good.

687
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,160
How can you say that

688
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,480
you can't even do small things?

689
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,920
What you did

690
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,800
is much more powerful than the city of Peng.

691
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,640
These are all the things I should do.

692
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,960
And

693
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,360
you're not that good in the end.

694
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
It was the same day

695
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,560
when I was kicked out by my landlord.

696
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,240
He was a official.

697
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,200
He could only

698
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,800
fall to the wall with his hands.

699
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,040
It was because of the cheap price

700
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,920
that I settled down quickly.

701
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,640
I found out when I was the landlord's ex-boyfriend

702
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,040
that I was cheated by this landlord since the beginning.

703
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
Do you think it's funny?

704
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,360
I always thought I was smart.

705
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,840
But in the end,

706
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,520
I was always

707
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,280
helpless in most of the problems.

708
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,640
What did you do

709
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,040
after that day?

710
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,840
Then...

711
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,200
Then I put on my schoolbag

712
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,360
and walked here.

713
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,840
I was here

714
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,080
and saw the sunset.

715
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,800
It was the first time I prayed in my heart.

716
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,040
The red sun that day

717
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,000
must be a cloudy day without the sunset.

718
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,120
The cherry blossoms must not see the sunset.

719
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,520
So that she won't think of me

720
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,240
and be happier.

721
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,960
Even if it's just for a day.

优优独播剧场——YoYo Television Series Exclusive

724
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,080
Memories float in the air

725
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,920
and travel through time

726
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,080
The shade of summer is still bright

727
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,560
I look far away

728
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,160
The wishes that were unsaid that year

729
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,240
The shadow of the familiar becomes longer

730
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,800
Your outline is so gentle

731
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,960
beyond the sight

732
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,640
The world is turning

733
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,160
The breeze is blowing

734
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,840
The scenery in the waterfall

735
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,880
is like yesterday

736
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,960
The reality is in front of you

737
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,160
The future is in your hands

738
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,560
You're the key to who I am

739
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,160
Be with me and become myself

740
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,360
The night sky is long

741
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,680
My strong wind is noisy

742
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,760
Can't stop the bustling

743
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,960
The call of dreams

744
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,240
You're the spark in all my dreams

745
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,640
Be with you and become yourself

746
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,040
The

747
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,040
universe will be embraced and melted

748
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:10,040
I've been here all the time

749
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,840
The time that spins in the palm of my hand

750
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,920
lights up your face

751
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,920
The smile that runs too fast

752
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,920
is also accidentally kept
