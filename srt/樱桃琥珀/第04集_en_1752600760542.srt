1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Twist of F possa

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,200
next time

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
To love To heal

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 18

5
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,000
Hey,

6
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,480
I forgot to take my water card.

7
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,200
Can I borrow yours?

8
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,040
Are we close?

9
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,040
I forgot to introduce myself

10
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,320
when I was practicing English.

11
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,120
My name is Jiang Qiao Xi.

12
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,560
Nice to meet you.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
I'm not too happy.

14
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,480
And I don't want to borrow your water card.

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,720
Okay.

16
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,600
Why did she do that to Jiang Qiao Xi?

17
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
I think she's a little bit grumpy.

18
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,880
Jiang Qiao Xi, use mine.

19
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,280
Mine is fine too.

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,440
No, thanks.

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,520
The new school is a little bit slow.

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,920
Let's be more enthusiastic to her.

23
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,280
It's true.

24
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,960
It's the first time I've seen someone

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,160
treat Jiang Qiao Xi like this.

26
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,520
It's too much.

27
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,360
But she seems to be very polite.

28
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,000
She didn't offend me.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,920
Jiang Qiao Xi should be like that.

30
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,840
That's true.

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,880
But why did she treat Jiang Qiao Xi like that?

32
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,480
She just borrowed a water card.

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,280
Her reaction is like

34
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,080
Jiang Qiao Xi is having a grudge with her.

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,320
Do you think

36
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,040
it's because of the English class?

37
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,640
She didn't understand what Jiang Qiao Xi said.

38
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,080
She was embarrassed when she first came to our class.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
That's right.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,640
Think about it.

41
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,200
She came to the experimental middle school from Qunshan.

42
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,840
She must be very good in her previous class.

43
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,880
But she met Jiang Qiao Xi just now.

44
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,160
Her self-esteem must be hit.

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
Teacher He said

46
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,600
Jiang Qiao Xi's sentence is too high.

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,680
Most of our classmates in our class

48
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,120
don't know what it means.

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
She wouldn't be angry because of that.

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,680
I think

51
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,120
it should be your problem.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
My problem?

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,240
That's right. Think about it.

54
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,000
You didn't know anything before.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,960
You just said it in front of so many classmates.

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,440
Then you and Jiang Qiao Xi are friends.

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,760
She just put the blame on Jiang Qiao Xi.

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,400
What should I do?

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,840
Go apologize to Lin Qi Le.

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,280
But to be honest, it's not your fault.

61
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,440
It's the fault of the person who wrote the letter to Jiang Qiao Xi.

62
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,880
I heard that someone didn't know

63
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,400
and borrowed your card.

64
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
You robbed it.

65
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,760
If I can, I want to splash water on her.

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
I'll ask her what she means.

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,360
What does she mean?

68
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,920
We're not...

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,160
Lin Qi Le, someone is looking for you.

70
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,760
The stairs on the fourth floor.

71
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,360
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
Who's looking for me?

75
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,680
You'll know when you get there.

76
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,680
Did she say anything?

77
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,880
She said she wanted to tell you in person.

78
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,880
Let's go. I'll go with you.

79
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,880
She wants to find Lin Qi Le.

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,680
I'll go by myself.

81
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Lin Qi Le, we met before.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,200
Do you remember before you transferred to the experimental middle school?

83
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,080
You got such a high score from Qun Shan

85
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,600
and got into the experimental middle school.

86
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,080
We all think you're amazing.

87
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,000
We'll help each other in our future studies

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,400
and grow up together.

89
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,000
What on earth do you want to say?

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
I'm here to apologize.

91
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,200
I was wrong before.

92
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
I got the wrong person

93
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,520
and said something really mean to you.

94
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,920
Even if you didn't get the wrong person,

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,600
you don't have to say that.

97
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,120
Do you hate us

98
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
and Jiang Qiao Xi?

99
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,320
I won't tell you the truth.

100
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,720
Lin Qi Le,

101
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,920
it's a misunderstanding.

102
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,720
You and Jiang Qiao Xi are both victims of this.

103
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,240
Don't say that.

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,840
Don't blame Jiang Qiao Xi.

105
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,120
She's excellent.

106
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,320
She's a role model for our class.

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,120
If you want to blame her,

108
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,640
blame that cherry on top.

109
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,640
She's not good enough to write a letter to Jiang Qiao Xi.

110
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,840
Don't say that.

111
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,520
You don't know what she wrote.

112
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
It's disgusting.

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,640
I'll go first.

114
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,240
I told you to stop talking nonsense.

115
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,640
Yu Qiao.

116
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,120
I let you go last time.

117
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,920
You want to go to the toilet?

118
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Go in.

119
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,440
What's going on?

120
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,520
You dare to do that?

121
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,640
Let's wait and see.

122
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,320
Go to the office.

123
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,040
Brother Fei Lin,

124
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,640
you can't talk to her.

125
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,240
What's there to talk about?

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
Oh, no.

127
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,120
We're going to have a big problem.

128
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,640
Lin Qi Le who just got a new job

129
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,240
hit someone.

130
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,440
It's a fight.

131
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,040
He hit someone.

132
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,840
Go.

133
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Take a look.

134
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,640
Brother Fei Lin has a good relationship with the teacher.

135
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
You're afraid of being in trouble in front of the teacher.

136
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,440
Yes.

137
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
What's going on?

138
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,240
It's okay.

139
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,640
I know your position.

140
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
I'll talk for you.

141
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,040
I didn't hit anyone.

142
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,440
But you hit someone.

143
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,840
I was defending myself.

144
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,840
But I hit someone first.

145
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,440
He hit someone first.

146
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Then he can only blame himself.

147
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Blame himself.

148
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,960
He hit me first.

149
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,360
I believe the teachers in the experiment

150
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,560
will know what's right and what's wrong.

151
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,960
So we're not afraid.

152
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Are you really okay?

153
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,760
With him,

154
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,160
the black can be white.

155
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,960
Don't worry.

156
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,040
Okay.

157
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,560
Brother Fei Lin, they're all bad-mouthed.

158
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,360
We'll have a lot of adults in the future.

159
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,040
Don't mind him.

160
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,960
You're right about the class monitor.

161
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
You don't have to worry.

162
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
What are you looking at?

163
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,760
Go back.

164
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
What should I do?

165
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,960
I just got into trouble.

166
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
It's okay. I'm here.

167
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
And you.

168
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,560
My father got into trouble.

169
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,960
I'm still here with you.

170
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,560
It's reasonable.

171
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
We were like this when we were kids.

172
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,160
Jiang Qiao Xi.

173
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm going somewhere else.

174
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Where are we going?

175
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Let's go.

176
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Let's go.

177
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,160
Why did they fight with you?

178
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,560
I saw Lin Qi Le

179
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
didn't take you seriously.

180
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,240
You weren't annoyed with him.

181
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,040
I thought

182
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,240
it was because I

183
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,840
regarded him as the cherry on top.

184
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,040
He hates me.

185
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,560
He even hated you.

186
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,840
So I went to apologize to him.

187
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,560
They were too wild.

188
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,760
I didn't say anything.

189
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,240
They pushed me.

190
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Lin Qi Le even gave me a kick.

191
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,560
So I couldn't reason with him.

192
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,040
I forgive him.

193
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,640
I couldn't do anything wrong.

194
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,640
If I were Karma 비wen left,

195
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,440
I would probably Monday setups.

196
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,360
I wasn't punished in advance.

197
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
That's prèsaly to call a belated apology.

198
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,040
That's why advantage company

199
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,440
tends to get helping hand unusual.

200
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
It's disgusting.

201
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,360
Who else can you beat up?

202
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,880
Jiang Xiao Xin, you're helping them.

203
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,680
Alright.

204
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,400
From now on,

205
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,440
don't meddle in my business.

206
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,960
Especially Lin Qi Le's.

207
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,200
Lin Qi Le?

208
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,880
You and him...

209
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
We two...

210
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,040
will be friends.

211
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,320
This is not right.

212
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,440
The teacher hasn't come to me yet.

213
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,400
And that Fei Lin

214
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,040
didn't seem to give you any advice.

215
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,480
I think you're too mean.

216
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
I guess he doesn't dare to offend you.

217
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,480
It's good to give him some advice.

218
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,840
I'll hang up. I'm a newbie.

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,040
You'd better be low-key.

220
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,680
Your test paper has arrived.

221
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,600
How about she be a Марğiniay

222
00:10:42,720 --> 00:11:01,820
or a

223
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,920
flying bowler?

224
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm just looking.

225
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,160
Let me tell you.

226
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
The strategy to be hard on the books

227
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
is already out.

228
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,560
Let me, Cai Bo Wen, tell you

229
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,360
how to become a master in three days.

230
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,760
I promise you that after you hear it,

231
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,520
you'll beg me to play games with you.

232
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,160
Don't brag.

233
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,040
Your strategy is just to burn money.

234
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,480
Who do you want to play?

235
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,720
Ping Tao.

236
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,960
Let me tell you.

237
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,040
The world of the beast

238
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,720
is definitely not just a game.

239
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,320
Its meaning is very important.

240
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,560
Let me tell you. Watch this game.

241
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,080
Okay?

242
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,040
What are you thinking about?

243
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,760
I'm thinking about

244
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,080
what to do.

245
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,800
So many things.

246
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,840
I'm sitting here

247
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,000
and you don't talk to me.

248
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,760
What's there to talk about?

249
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,560
Actress Qin.

250
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,080
Why are you still here?

251
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,160
Tell me about you.

252
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,640
We're all from the Qun Mountain Squad.

253
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,240
Why didn't you open the door?

254
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,640
Why don't you play with us all the time?

255
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,800
You didn't go to the dancing machine last time.

256
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,680
You didn't see Lin Ying Tao.

257
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,760
She danced very well.

258
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,000
What's so fun about dancing machines?

259
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,520
Then you say one.

260
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,400
We'll play with you.

261
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,960
I'm so good at it.

262
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,920
Ocean Hall.

263
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,760
Do you want to go with me?

264
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,680
Sure.

265
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,760
Of course I can go with you.

266
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,240
Lin Ying.

267
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,320
You're here.

268
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,520
Let's go to the Ocean Hall together this weekend.

269
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,280
Ocean Hall?

270
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't want to.

271
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,760
But Qin Yanyun wants to go.

272
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,960
We have to go with her.

273
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,040
Qin Yanyun is not happy.

274
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,920
Hurry up and say yes.

275
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,760
Okay, okay.

276
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,680
I'll go.

277
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,800
I'll go.

278
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,280
Ying Tao.

279
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,840
Why don't you want to go to the Ocean Hall?

280
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Why do you want to go to the Ocean Hall so urgently?

281
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,560
So I went by myself.

282
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,920
Can you let the others have their say?

283
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,240
Ke,

284
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,200
this is great.

285
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,320
Really?

286
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,080
CHEN terrifying.

287
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,400
Can you make over some of this river,

288
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,760
if it'sesti足?

289
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,920
I really never remember what this is.

290
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,400
I've never ever seen anything like it,

291
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
do you remember it?

292
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,080
Don't come back.

293
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,840
I'm so tired.

294
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,120
Then do we take a break?

295
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
I'm not a good girl.

296
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
How could it be?

297
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
So pretty.

298
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
The prettier, the more poisonous.

299
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
What are you doing?

300
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
I'm done.

301
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Jiang Jiang Xin, I know you're poisonous.

302
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Help.

303
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
Help.

304
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Ying Tao, do you like to see jellyfish?

305
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Let's go see it together in the future.

306
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
But there's no aquarium in the mountain.

307
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
There's a provincial city.

308
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
But I don't like provincial cities.

309
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Then I won't go.

310
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,400
If you're here, I'll like it.

311
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Then we'll go.

312
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Okay.

313
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Where are Lu Shang and them?

314
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
They went to the toilet.

315
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
I was too focused on the fish.

316
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I forgot to tell him.

317
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Look at the fish?

318
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Yes.

319
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
It's not jellyfish.

320
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Ying Tao,

321
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
when you look at jellyfish,

322
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
it doesn't look like jellyfish.

323
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Qi Yanyuan is really...

324
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
She wants to come to the aquarium.

325
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
She won't come even if she's tired.

326
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
You two are the same.

327
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
What you say and think

328
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
are all confusing.

329
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
You're a little better to Qi Yanyuan.

330
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Why am I not good to her?

331
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
She can't come today.

332
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
You can come with her another day.

333
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Why don't you come with her?

334
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I...

335
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
I've thought about too many things in my head.

336
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
I don't have time.

337
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
I'm going to the aquarium.

338
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I'll come to the aquarium.

339
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Okay.

340
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
I'm going to the aquarium.

341
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Okay.

342
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
I'll go.

343
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Okay.

344
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Bye.

345
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
Bye.

346
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
The 60-year-old gang.

347
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Who?

348
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Yanyuan and Lu Shang.

349
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
What are you doing?

350
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
I want to hear

351
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
what's in the good brain of the 60-year-old gang.

352
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Is it like a good watermelon?

353
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
It sounds different.

354
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Watermelon is watermelon.

355
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
The brain is the same as the brain.

356
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Are you scolding me?

357
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
No way.

358
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Come here.

359
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm kidding.

360
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Are you serious?

361
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
I'm kidding.

362
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
You're so pretty.

363
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Tonight's clouds.

364
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Tonight's clouds.

365
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
The little bee is tonight's clouds.

366
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
What's wrong with you?

367
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
What's the expression when you watch TV?

368
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm not the TV actor.

369
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Then you take a good look.

370
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
I'll pick this for you.

371
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
I'll give it to you.

372
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Let me see.

373
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm laughing at it.

374
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
You two are quite alike.

375
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Tonight's clouds.

376
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
What are you looking at?

377
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Yin Tao is here.

378
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Yin Tao.

379
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Uncle Qi.

380
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
I heard your parents say

381
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
that you went to the aquarium today.

382
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Yes.

383
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Ye Yun.

384
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
You don't study at home.

385
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Why don't you go out

386
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
and play with Yin Tao?

387
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
You only know to watch TV.

388
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
You've been watching it for a day.

389
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
What's so good about watching TV?

390
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
You watch TV.

391
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Didn't you say you had something to do today?

392
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Is watching TV not a thing?

393
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Move aside.

394
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
You're so smart, Qian Yuan.

395
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Forget it.

396
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
I won't bother you.

397
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
You've finished watching TV.

398
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Go to your house and play.

399
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Who told you to go to my house?

400
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
My house is not a vegetable market.

401
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
I'm just giving you face.

402
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Dad, I'm leaving.

403
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
How much is your face?

404
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
I'm so good-looking.

405
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Of course it's worth it.

406
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Give me the money.

407
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Where are my shoes?

408
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
I'll play first.

409
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Go ahead.

410
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Yi Qing.

411
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Hello, uncle.

412
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Uncle.

413
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Shan'er.

414
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Fang Yuan, you go in first.

415
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
You come here.

416
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Okay.

417
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I'll go get it.

418
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
I'll help you.

419
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
It's 16th of this year.

420
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
17th.

421
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Good.

422
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
It's quite big.

423
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
There are some things

424
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
we should talk about at night.

425
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Dad.

426
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
What's wrong?

427
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Did something happen to our family?

428
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Yi Qing.

429
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Yi Qing.

430
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Do you have a girl you like?

431
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
I've experienced it

432
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
from your age.

433
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
I understand your mood.

434
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
It's normal to have a girl

435
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
who likes to be with her.

436
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
But we need to rely on our character

437
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,400
and ability to move people.

438
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
We shouldn't find the answer

439
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
in our phones.

440
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Besides,

441
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
you're studying now.

442
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
You can't fall in love with her.

443
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Dad, I don't understand

444
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
what you mean.

445
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Are you

446
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
pursuing Yun Yue?

447
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Yun Yue?

448
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
The actress?

449
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
I'm pursuing her?

450
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
I...

451
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
If I didn't see the phone

452
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
being charged for 200 years,

453
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
I wouldn't know

454
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
that there's a love affair in our family.

455
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
What?

456
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Yu Jie.

457
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Who told you to steal my phone?

458
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I fell asleep.

459
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
Is it that funny?

460
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Isn't it funny?

461
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Yu Jie

462
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
is testing the love TV ad.

463
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
You're different.

464
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
You're addicted to it.

465
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Qin Ye Yun is so beautiful.

466
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
If she knew it,

467
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
she'd be very happy.

468
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
What does it have to do with me?

469
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Qin Ye Yun, why are you running?

470
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Stop it.

471
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
You're so happy

472
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
that you can't see anything.

473
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
What's so funny?

474
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
And you.

475
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
You're the most ugly one.

476
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Go away.

477
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
It's me.

478
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
It's you, Lin Tao.

479
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
I don't want to see you.

480
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
We're on the same side.

481
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
I just scolded them for you.

482
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Who told you to scold them?

483
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
I'm just annoyed with you.

484
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
I'm annoyed with him too.

485
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
It's all Yu Qiao's fault.

486
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
He's a fool.

487
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
He doesn't understand anything.

488
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
How about this?

489
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Let's go find him

490
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
and make it clear to him.

491
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Make it clear?

492
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
What do you want to say?

493
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
At least let him know.

494
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Is there any problem between you two?

495
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Let's go.

496
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
You're the problem.

497
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
If you tell him

498
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
that I can't even be his friend anymore,

499
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
isn't that a problem?

500
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
I think it's good now.

501
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
I didn't expect too much.

502
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
At least we can meet every day.

503
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
We can be like friends.

504
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Oh, no.

505
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
I was so ugly just now.

506
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
You're ugly.

507
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
You're ugly.

508
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
You're even prettier than you look.

509
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Did you take that photo?

510
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Did you take it well?

511
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
I'm not sure.

512
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
I'm not sure.

513
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
Did you take it well?

514
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
You're so pretty.

515
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
You're his friend.

516
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
Jiang Qiao Xi.

517
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
This is taken by Chen Xiao Man and me

518
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
at the ocean.

519
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
It takes time to see the photos.

520
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
I've finished the topic I told you.

521
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
No.

522
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Jiang Qiao Xi.

523
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
There's one more thing I want to tell you.

524
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
But don't be angry.

525
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
I'm telling you this

526
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
because I really want to be your friend.

527
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Go ahead.

528
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
We met Yu Qiao and Lin Qi Le

529
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
at the ocean.

530
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Lin Qi Le

531
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
came here from Qun Shan.

532
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
It's probably for Yu Qiao.

533
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
No wonder he was so cold to you before.

534
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Stop talking.

535
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Impossible.

536
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
It's true.

537
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
We have...

538
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
Okay.

539
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Okay.

540
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
I won't talk.

541
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Take your time.

542
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
Okay.

543
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
A, B, C, D, V, X, Y.

544
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
X, Y.

545
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
A, B, C, D, V, Y.

546
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
I know.

547
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
A, E, V, Z.

548
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
It's not high school.

549
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,400
A, Z, V, Z.

550
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
A, Z, V, X, Z.

551
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
A, Z, V, X, Z.

552
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
A, D, X, Z.

553
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
D, X, Z.

554
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Is there a better solution?

555
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
No.

556
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Little Qiao Xi.

557
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Come up and solve it.

558
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
This problem is more complicated.

559
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
For Lin Qi Le,

560
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
it's more difficult and easy to make mistakes.

561
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
But we can do the auxiliary line

562
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
to make it easier.

563
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
First, take the end of E, B.

564
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
N, connect N, N.

565
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
Then connect N, C.

566
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
So,

567
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,880
using the

568
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,400
linear equation,

569
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
it can make the problem easier.

570
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Of course.

571
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
The problem is easier

572
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
under Qiao Xi.

573
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Very good.

574
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Two ways to solve the problem.

575
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Let's take a look.

576
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Here.

577
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Cai Meng Yuan.

578
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Cai Meng Yuan.

579
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Let's go.

580
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Give me a warm one.

581
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
Give me a hot one.

582
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Let's go.

583
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
Water card.

584
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
Water card.

585
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
You're using my card again.

586
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Here.

587
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Let's go.

588
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Here.

589
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
I don't have a card.

590
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
You can take it.

591
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Here.

592
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Here.

593
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,400
You're still helping Cai Fang Yuan?

594
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
This is Yu Qiao's cup?

595
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,400
Yes. This is Jiang Qiao Xi's.

596
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Lin Qi Le asked you to help Jiang Qiao Xi fetch water?

597
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
She has something to do.

598
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
I'm going to help her

599
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
to get the water for her friends.

600
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,400
It's all a favor.

601
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Who is her friend?

602
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Can't you tell that we have a festival?

603
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
If Lin Qi Le knows,

604
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
she will be so mad at you.

605
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
I'm going to the festival.

606
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I'm going to the festival.

607
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
I'm going to the festival.

608
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
I'm going to the festival.

609
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
I'm going to the festival.

610
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
I'm going to the festival.

611
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
I'm going to the festival.

612
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm going to the festival.

613
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
I'm going to the festival.

614
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
I'm going to the festival.

615
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
I'm going to the festival.

616
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
I'm going to the festival.

617
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I'm going to the festival.

618
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
I'm going to the festival.

619
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
I'm going to the festival.

620
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm going to the festival.

621
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm going to the festival.

622
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
I'm going to the festival.

623
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,400
I'm going to the festival.

624
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
I'm going to the festival.

625
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
I'm going to the festival.

626
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
I'm going to the festival.

627
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
I'm going to the festival.

628
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
I'm going to the festival.

629
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,400
You helped me?

630
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Yes.

631
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
I did this on my own.

632
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Lin Qi Le doesn't want to play against you.

633
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Don't misunderstand.

634
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,400
I'll play for you in the future.

635
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Don't bother Lin Qi Le.

636
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
No.

637
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
She asked you to tell me this?

638
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
We are all classmates.

639
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
If we can't be friends,

640
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
then I don't think we can play together.

641
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
You can't play with me.

642
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
I don't think so.

643
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I can't.

644
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
That's my strategy.

645
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
If I don't do it,

646
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
If you can't be friends,

647
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,240
you'd better not interfere with each other.

648
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,880
The shelf is here.

649
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,600
I...

650
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,560
I'll give you one.

651
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,960
Lin Xing.

652
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,520
Thank you.

653
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:20,920
Thank you.

654
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,840
I'm sorry.

655
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,040
I won't interfere with your business anymore.

656
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,920
It's Shui Zhen Ni's.

657
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,040
Don't be angry.

658
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,640
I've reminded Meng Qian Xiao Xi.

659
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,120
She won't interfere with you anymore.

660
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,000
Thank you.

661
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,040
The physical test today is

662
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,280
800 for girls and 1500 for boys.

663
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,680
Let's hurry up and take the time to take the test.

664
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,760
We're almost done with the test.

665
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,400
Okay.

666
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay.

667
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,920
Why are you so tired?

668
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,200
Why are you so tired after listening to the physical test?

669
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,400
You have to take the test in senior year.

670
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,680
You have to take the test sooner or later.

671
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,600
Which one first?

672
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,800
Song Chu Yang.

673
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,640
Are you not feeling well?

674
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,240
Yes.

675
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,200
Tong Le Tian.

676
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,800
Yes.

677
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,360
It's okay.

678
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,560
Jia Si Si.

679
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,600
Do you want to ask for a leave from the teacher?

680
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Teacher, I want to take a leave.

681
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,480
I'm sorry.

682
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,240
I'm sorry.

683
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,520
I want to take a leave.

684
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,360
I'm not feeling well.

685
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,080
Do you want to take a leave?

686
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,680
Teacher.

687
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,720
Do you want to take a leave?

688
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,680
I'm sorry.

689
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,080
I'll take it.

690
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:13,200
Who doesn't run to scare the

691
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,600
young lady?

692
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,200
Xia Xiao Xi.

693
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,220
Xia Xiao Xi, come on.

694
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,860
Xia Xiao Xi, cheer up.

695
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,280
그� sea

696
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,000
my father will never forgive me.

697
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,280
Good call.

698
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,400
Fighting, Kyaw Aha!

699
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:52,840
Good call.

700
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,240
Good call.

701
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,760
Good call.

702
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,200
Hey!

703
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,080
Good call!

704
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,120
Kevin is coming!

705
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,800
tribesman!

706
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,760
Come on!

707
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,200
Come on!

708
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Come on!

709
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,240
Do you think

710
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,000
you can beat me?

711
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,240
I'm not here to compete with you.

712
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,440
I just want to tell you

713
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,960
that someone is taking you and Lin Yitang

714
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
to the ocean.

715
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,680
I know you two are nothing.

716
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,480
But those people wouldn't think so.

717
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,120
How do you know?

718
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,440
You know us well, right?

719
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,480
I know Lin Yitang.

720
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,400
Stop calling him by his name.

721
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,160
He has nothing to do with you.

722
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,680
Yuqiang,

723
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,840
I'm telling you this

724
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,880
because I want to tell you.

725
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,800
This might bring

726
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,480
trouble to Lin Yitang.

727
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,280
Don't you know?

728
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,480
You're the trouble.

729
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,000
What else

730
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,640
did you write in that letter?

731
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,680
What letter?

732
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,680
I know

733
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,200
that the last letter is with you.

734
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,800
Give it back to me.

735
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,080
I took it from Brother Fei Lin.

736
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,720
Why didn't you take it

737
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,560
if you wanted it?

738
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,240
Adjust your breathing.

739
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Take one step at a time.

740
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,600
Take one step at a time.

741
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,480
Don't rush.

742
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,160
Come on.

743
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Come on.

744
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,720
Hold on.

745
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,640
You can do it.

746
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,040
Come on.

747
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
Come on.

748
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,840
Come on.

749
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,320
Don't rush.

750
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,240
Don't rush.

751
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,240
You're good, Lin Qi.

752
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,320
You're so good.

753
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,960
You...

754
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,240
Xiaoman doesn't like to drink

755
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,040
peanut milk.

756
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,960
She likes to drink cola.

757
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,760
I'll buy it for her.

758
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,480
You didn't buy it for her.

759
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,520
It's for Lin Qi Le.

760
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,680
Lin Qi Le just fainted.

761
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,360
She was sent to the infirmary.

762
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,600
She fainted?

763
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,840
Drink this.

764
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,560
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

765
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,280
Okay?

766
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,640
Miss.

767
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,120
She's fine.

768
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,240
Do you need to go to the hospital?

769
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,640
It's okay. Don't worry.

770
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,160
It's just a little bit of heat.

771
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,520
She's not in good health.

772
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,480
She'll be fine after a rest.

773
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,080
Here.

774
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,040
It's okay. You can go back to class.

775
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,880
You can talk here.

776
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,920
It'll affect her rest.

777
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,560
Give it to me.

778
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,040
Do you feel better?

779
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,400
Then you can sleep here.

780
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,840
You'll be fine in the afternoon.

781
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,000
I'll go to the hospital for you at noon.

782
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,720
Okay.

783
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,000
You two, don't stay here with me.

784
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,120
Go back.

785
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,000
Go back.

786
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,600
Let's go. It's okay.

787
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,200
Goodbye, Miss.

788
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,320
Goodbye.

789
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,480
Go back.

790
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
That ...

791
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,480
Then...

792
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,680
Jiang Qiao Xi?

793
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,780
Ying Tou, are you feeling better now?

794
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,680
I'm craving peanut butter.

795
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,600
But my annual appointment,

796
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,360
I'll only drink it ontop of you.

797
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,960
I can only drink hot water.

798
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,920
I don't want to drink hot water.

799
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,360
What should I do?

800
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,760
Don't be afraid.

801
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,800
Aunt Juanzi is going to work.

802
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,400
I've boiled the peanut milk.

803
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,400
Drink it.

804
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,320
Jiang Jiaxi.

805
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,640
You're so nice.

806
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,280
I hate you the most.

807
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,560
You have to stay with me

808
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,040
even if I'm sick.

809
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,240
Do you understand?

810
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,360
Jiang Jiaxi.

811
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,680
It's so nice

812
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,560
to have you.

813
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,120
What's wrong?

814
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,920
Are you hot?

815
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,720
Why are you here?

816
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,880
Let me take a look at you.

817
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,240
I don't need you to look at me.

818
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,800
What's the relationship between us?

819
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Do I need you to look at me?

820
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,360
Strictly speaking,

821
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,920
our relationship now

822
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,600
should be in the same class.

823
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,840
Thank you, classmate.

824
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
But I'm fine.

825
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,640
I'm fine.

826
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,320
I'm fine.

827
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,080
I'm fine.

828
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,840
I'm fine.

829
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,600
I'm fine.

830
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,440
I'm fine.

831
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,200
I'm fine.

832
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,000
I'm fine.

833
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,800
I'm fine.

834
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,600
I'm fine.

835
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,360
I'm fine.

836
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,720
But I'm fine.

837
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,480
Don't sit here.

838
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,160
The teacher will come and see you later.

839
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,040
It's hard to explain.

840
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,000
Just go.

841
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,960
I'm fine.

842
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,360
I just said I came to see a doctor.

843
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,600
I'll get some medicine.

844
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,760
You said you wouldn't be in the class.

845
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,360
I'll do it if it's about you.

846
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,440
Who cares?

847
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,480
Okay, I won't say it.

848
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,320
Go.

849
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,400
Go.

850
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,440
Didn't you just say

851
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,880
it's great to have me?

852
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
I didn't mean that.

853
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,240
I remember

854
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,880
when you were little,

855
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,520
when you were sick,

856
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,080
I was always by your side.

857
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,280
Really?

858
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,280
I don't remember.

859
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,600
It's okay.

860
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,520
I'll remember it for you.

861
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,720
Jiang Qiao Xin.

862
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,720
Why do you always say

863
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,000
these things?

864
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
You're so annoying.

865
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,800
Is that all you can think of?

866
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,800
Are you leaving or not?

867
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,440
If you don't, I'll leave.

868
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,320
Wait.

869
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
I'll leave.

870
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,520
You should have a good rest.

871
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,960
You...

872
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,160
Don't say

873
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,720
these useless things again.

874
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,880
I don't like it.

875
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,320
I find it annoying.

876
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,120
Okay.

877
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,160
I got it.

878
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Jiang Qiao Xin.

879
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,560
Why are you here?

880
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
Sir.

881
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,320
Someone didn't let me...

882
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
Sir.

883
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,480
This student is not feeling well.

884
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,400
So, he came to see you.

885
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
But you're not here.

886
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
What's wrong with me?

887
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,040
Your brain.

888
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,040
My brain?

889
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,400
Sir.

890
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,200
I just promised someone

891
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,120
that I can't lie.

892
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,880
So, I'll tell you the truth.

893
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,720
We're classmates.

894
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,720
And

895
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,680
I came to see him.

896
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
Sir, I'm leaving.

897
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,560
Good.

898
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:04,400
bit out the pueblos before waiting for me

899
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,400
so many years passed by now my image is blurry

900
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,240
here is a piece of shouted13,so it seems you know

901
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,480
peel it now hip to hip

902
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,480
grill it with you

903
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,280
as we about tourez a bl answer

904
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,760
Like a real mountain, you hold me in front of you

905
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,920
Like a mountain, running

906
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:40,360
The sunset turns the universe red

907
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,320
You're in my pain

908
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,720
I look at you

909
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,280
You're the one who's not paying attention

910
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:55,440
At this moment, I understand peace and freedom
