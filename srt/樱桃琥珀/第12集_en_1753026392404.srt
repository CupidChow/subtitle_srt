Episode 2

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thank you, teacher. Goodbye.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Congratulations, Li Gengtao.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You used to be the last one to be left out.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now you're the second one to be left out.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Your progress is a waste of time.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm nervous because of your progress.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you're the third one out of three,

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
is that my step back?

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You have big eyes.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Didn't you see it when you taught the paper?

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm not teaching paper.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm asking the teacher questions.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What's with the expression?

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What?

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're finally getting the hang of it?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Jiang Qiaoxi taught me a method.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
She said if you don't know the answer

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
when you're doing the question,

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
you can think about why you're asking the question.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I used this method to solve the question.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I suddenly realized that all the physical questions

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
are the same as the first question.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Li Gengtao, you're being too much

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
for the people you know.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm getting nervous.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't say that I'm better than you.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Are you going to join the physical competition

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and join the gym class?

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Not really.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She's 17 years old.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
She's a good cook.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
She's already over a year old.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Gengtao, it's okay.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't be so stubborn.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not going to talk to you.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You two are not good at talking.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hurry up and go.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Today is the big day

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
for us to go to the Little Town.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't know if Qingying and Du Shang

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
have bought the fireworks.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Slow down.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Are you okay, Dad?

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yunyun, be careful.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Zhu Yan.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Are you serious?

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They're serious.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I've thought about it.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're here.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You can really help me a lot.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Brother Qin.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
My Yunyun and your Du Shang

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
have discussed it.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Du Shang is a child.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He's very supportive.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's a filial child.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He doesn't want his mother

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
to be out there

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and be in the sun

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and be in charge of you.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're here with me.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can do business.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Brother Qin, how about this?

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll give you 20% of my earnings

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
as a cash payment.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Do you think it's okay?

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How much is it

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
to rent a small shop normally?

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I only gave you 20%

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and it's already enough.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How about this?

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well,

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
there's no room

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
for you to work outside.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You can stay here

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and try to set up a stall

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
for a month.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We'll talk about it

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
after a month.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yunyun, Du Shang.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you want to eat something good tonight?

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's go out and eat.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's celebrate our double-storied co-op.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Why are you going out to waste money?

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's eat at home.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll do it.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mom, we have to go to the beach

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
at night.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We can do it another day.

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It seems that we can

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
eat double-storied co-op

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
often in the future.

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Mrs. Double-storied co-op,

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the spicy and sour chicken noodle

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
you made last time was very delicious.

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Can you make it again tomorrow?

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No problem.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Qin Yuanyuan,

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll leave the right to

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
have a good taste in the future.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll leave it here.

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Brother Qin,

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
a bag of Chinese food

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and a big gift bag.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't just stand there.

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you want to buy Chinese food,

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
you can buy a soft bag.

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No need to find it.

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Little Yan.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Son.

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Little Yan,

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
what's wrong with you?

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What's going on?

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You didn't do your homework.

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Can you give it back to me?

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The pig's feet are not hot.

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's hot.

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Be careful.

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't hit me.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hello, Yin Tang.

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Jiang Xiaoxi,

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the activity tonight

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
has to be canceled.

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What's wrong?

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Nothing.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Stop!

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Stop!

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We're here.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Du Sha, open the door.

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Du Sha.

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
These kids.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What's wrong, Yin Tang?

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We're looking for Du Shao.

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Come on, son.

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yin Tang, you two.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's okay.

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's okay.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm cooking with my dad.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Son.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yin.

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're here.

151
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I made a table of dishes

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
for you and Aunt Cao.

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You didn't eat, right?

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Come on, come on.

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Come in and eat together.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No, no, no.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm not hungry.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not hungry.

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why are you being polite to your uncle?

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Thank you.

161
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I feel that Uncle Du has changed a lot.

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
His temperament has changed a lot, too.

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I think so.

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
In that case,

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Du Shao won't leave.

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Wait for me.

167
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How is it?

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Are you okay?

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm fine.

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I bought fireworks.

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You can go to the beach.

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's okay.

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When you're free,

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
we can go together.

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You can have dinner

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
with your parents tonight.

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Aren't you going to the East Camp?

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's colder when you come back.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How can you go?

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's not just a winter.

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Besides,

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I also prepared

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
something else for everyone.

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You can go.

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll go.

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're so little.

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Bye.

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, don't worry.

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's go.

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's go.

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Good morning.

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Good morning.

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Good morning.

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Where's Jiang Xi?

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
She hasn't come yet.

196
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Good morning.

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm coming.

198
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Good morning.

199
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Jiang Xi.

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Slow down.

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

202
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Aren't you going to the competition?

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why are you going to school with us?

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You even reminded us

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
to ride together.

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Before I go to the competition,

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
the thing I want to do the most

208
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
is to go to school with you.

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What do you have?

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yin Tao told me that

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
if I want to go back to the mountain team,

212
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I have to warm up your hearts.

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So you came up with

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
the simplest way.

215
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Give a gift.

216
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes.

217
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I prepared a gift.

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't know if you dare to accept it.

219
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You've said it like this.

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
How can you give it to us

221
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and we dare not accept it?

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
One for each person.

223
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I know the scarf.

224
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a fake one.

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You know it yourself.

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Of course.

227
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You know how to make scarf.

228
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're so good.

229
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's not hard.

230
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's just a math formula.

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I spent a lot of time

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
on drawing your scarf.

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Forget it.

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
In Jiang Qiaoxi's heart,

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
everything can be math.

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
When I think about Jiang Qiaoxi's scarf,

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I feel so strange.

238
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Enough.

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Stop talking.

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I have a sense of picture.

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The sound of the heart beat

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Pass through the darkness

243
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The unusual power

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
My dream

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I want to let go

246
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I want to let you see

247
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The light that shines in my heart

248
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Actually,

249
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I was so happy

250
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm so bored.

251
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I have to find something to do.

252
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Don't say scarf.

253
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I can make a sweater.

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Jiang Qiaoxi,

255
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
forget about the sweater.

256
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This scarf is enough for us to drink.

257
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why is the scarf red?

258
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I like red.

259
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We all thought you liked black the most.

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Black is not willing to do it.

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But red is.

262
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But this is too red.

263
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like a traffic light.

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I've never worn such a red.

265
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You guys are so noisy.

266
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Red is so good.

267
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Red is the sun.

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It represents hope and warmth.

269
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I like it.

270
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I take it.

271
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Thank you, Jiang Qiaoxi.

272
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You can take it if you want.

273
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I can't afford it.

274
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Jiang Qiaoxi,

275
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
you are quite foreign.

276
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why is this scarf so dirty?

277
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Who is dirty?

278
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You are dirty.

279
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Put it on.

280
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The white flowers on the road of youth

281
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The white flowers on the road of youth

282
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Hurry up.

283
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Through the darkness

284
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
My ordinary strength

285
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
My dream

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I want to release

287
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I want to let you see

288
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
My heart is shining

289
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I want to sing

290
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I want to sing

291
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Teacher He.

292
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The other students who participated in the competition

293
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
are about to leave today.

294
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Why are you still in school?

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I just want to go back to school

296
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and have a few more classes.

297
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I've already asked Mr. Feng from Austin

298
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
to take the exam tomorrow.

299
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why are you all wearing red scarf?

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Teacher He,

301
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
we are wearing red scarf

302
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
to help Jiang Qiaoxi get a good start.

303
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes, teacher.

304
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay, let's go to the classroom.

305
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay, let's go.

306
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Goodbye, teacher He.

307
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Goodbye, teacher He.

308
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Goodbye, teacher He.

309
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Goodbye, teacher He.

310
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Shouldn't Jiang Qiaoxi

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
go to prepare for the competition?

312
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Why is she still with that guy?

313
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
She is so childish.

314
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's not Jiang Qiaoxi.

315
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Isn't that Jiang Qiaoxi?

316
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
She is so tall.

317
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Who else can it be?

318
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I told you that's not Jiang Qiaoxi.

319
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
She has never laughed so happily.

320
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
How can she laugh so happily?

321
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
This chicken soup

322
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
is amazing.

323
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's so delicious.

324
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Linda.

325
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Linda.

326
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I want to eat meat.

327
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Can you be a little more graceful?

328
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You can still eat chicken soup?

329
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't you eat it now?

330
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can take it

331
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
to the East Shrine on the way.

332
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Then I'll fry it for you.

333
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I want to eat sweet and sour pork.

334
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I want to eat steamed buns.

335
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
No.

336
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Why, Linda?

337
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Why?

338
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I haven't eaten it for a long time.

339
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes.

340
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Then we have to do it one by one.

341
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
My mom is so tired

342
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
after eating all night.

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's right.

344
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
She is too busy to come here.

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is it right?

346
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So annoying.

347
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Then I'll be the first one to come to my house.

348
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Then I'll be the second one.

349
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Then I'll be the third one.

350
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Then I'll be the fourth one.

351
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Jiang Qiaoxi.

352
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Is Qiao Qi's mom here?

353
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No.

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let's talk about it.

355
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Jiang Qiaoxi.

356
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Did she rent the house

357
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and not go to the house of the housekeeper?

358
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
She told me

359
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
that she had no right

360
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
to make this decision.

361
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This kid is

362
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
so annoying.

363
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I thought she went to the housekeeper.

364
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Mr. He told me

365
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
that I knew she was here.

366
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't worry, mom.

367
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The game is almost over.

368
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
She must attend

370
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
this opening ceremony.

371
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Mr. He,

372
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
we'll go first.

373
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Okay.

374
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The game is almost over.

375
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

376
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The game is almost over.

377
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

378
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The game is almost over.

379
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

380
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The game is almost over.

381
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

382
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The game is almost over.

383
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

384
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The game is almost over.

385
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

386
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The game is almost over.

387
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

388
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The game is almost over.

389
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

390
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The game is almost over.

391
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

392
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The game is almost over.

393
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

394
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The game is almost over.

395
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

396
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The game is almost over.

397
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I've booked the tickets for tonight.

398
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The Game of Thrones

399
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Remember.

400
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't be nervous at the first minute.

401
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't read too much.

402
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Put your focus on the questions.

403
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
First, you have to answer the questions with high scores.

404
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
God of War.

405
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
How are you doing at the test?

406
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You are...

407
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I...

408
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I know you don't know me.

409
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm Qi Le.

410
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm a freshman in our school.

411
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I got the last question in the preliminary round

412
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
because of my dream.

413
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's why I got into the national competition.

414
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm here to apply for a major participation.

415
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Hello.

416
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm Jiang Xiaoxi.

417
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
God of War, you don't have to introduce yourself.

418
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We all know you.

419
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
My dad.

420
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
My dad?

421
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The teacher of the CMO of our province.

422
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's him.

423
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Mr. Ji.

424
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
He keeps saying your name at home.

425
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He said your math was great.

426
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
He said you are a man of great power.

427
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
He wanted you to be his son.

428
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You don't have to be so quiet.

429
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's already this time.

430
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Why are you bothering others?

431
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
See?

432
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I told you.

433
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You are his son.

434
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You are talking nonsense here.

435
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You are talking nonsense here.

436
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
See how I'll deal with you when you get home.

437
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What's wrong?

438
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Are you not feeling well?

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
No.

440
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I just have a fever.

441
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You are sick at this time?

442
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Have you taken your medicine?

443
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Don't take your medicine.

444
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You will faint if you take your medicine.

445
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You won't be able to answer the question if you faint.

446
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't take your medicine.

447
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
God of War,

448
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
did someone take the exam to get into the school of portrait painting?

449
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
School of portrait painting?

450
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
There is a legend in CMO.

451
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Before the exam,

452
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
the best student will borrow a portrait of portrait painting.

453
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Then all his luck will be shared with him.

454
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
God of War,

455
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
someone wants to harm you.

456
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What harm?

457
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You are also a math student.

458
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
How can you be so superstitious?

459
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Is it embarrassing?

460
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Dad,

461
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
math is always about learning.

462
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Besides,

463
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
if someone like me can get into the national competition,

464
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
it's all about luck.

465
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't mess with me at such critical time.

466
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Dad,

467
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
you and Wang Shuren have to do it for yourself.

468
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Do it?

469
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What does the word written in his handwriting mean?

470
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I heard that Qi Le said

471
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
there is such a saying.

472
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's said that before the exam,

473
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
write 16 words on the left hand

474
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and 16 words on the right hand.

475
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It can change the exam luck.

476
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There is such a saying?

477
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Did you write it?

478
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Why should I write it?

479
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't need luck.

480
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You are right.

481
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Jiang Xiaoxi,

482
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
why do I hear

483
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
that you are not in a good voice?

484
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Are you sick?

485
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm fine.

486
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm much better.

487
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I had a fever before,

488
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
but I'm not in a good mood now.

489
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You have a fever?

490
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Can you stay there alone?

491
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You had a fever before the exam.

492
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You are really unlucky.

493
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
God bless me.

494
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's the last day.

495
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I hope you don't get affected.

496
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't need God's blessing.

497
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I just need

498
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yin Tao's blessing.

499
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What blessing?

500
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You are joking at this time.

501
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Don't worry.

502
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It doesn't matter.

503
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It won't affect me.

504
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yin Tao,

505
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I...

506
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I want all of this to end.

507
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I want all of this to end.

508
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Nothing can stop me.

509
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why do you keep saying

510
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
that everything will end?

511
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What will end?

512
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't know.

513
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I just want to be with you.

514
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I want to be with you.

515
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What will end?

516
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Don't worry.

517
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You will know soon.

518
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay.

519
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Bye.

520
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Are you okay?

521
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,280
Are you okay,

522
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Dongxue?

523
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm fine.

524
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I need to rest

525
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and get some fresh air.

526
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Are you sure you are okay?

527
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm fine.

528
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I will stay here

529
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and take care of you.

530
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,960
Simple!

531
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,300
�

532
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,320
S Wonderful!

533
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,380
S N

534
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,240
A N

535
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,560
굉장히

536
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,820
How should I recieve it?

537
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,380
Population

538
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,640
Dorothy Wanzhou

539
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,040
Ji Zhong

540
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,520
Stop laughing

541
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,440
Side D��비

542
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,080
What did I say just now

543
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,480
If you have S and An

544
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,240
to request An

545
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,640
58

546
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,840
Wait for one

547
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,160
I have a morale meal of the past fifty

548
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,400
Have a previous day

549
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,880
Yes

550
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,480
Stop! Stop!

551
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,680
I'm not a teacher.

552
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,560
I'm a teacher.

553
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,240
What are you doing?

554
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,640
I'm a teacher.

555
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,360
Choose.

556
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,880
I'm a teacher.

557
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,080
What?

558
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
Of course, it's the Olympic Games.

559
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,840
It's about to start.

560
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,400
Do you want to choose Jiang Qiao Xi to win?

561
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,480
Jiang...

562
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,240
Qiao...

563
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,080
Xi...

564
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
I don't choose.

565
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,880
You don't choose?

566
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,160
It's not like you, Yin Tao.

567
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,560
In order to cheer up Jiang Qiao Xi,

568
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,480
Ren Yu Qiao has given up.

569
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,000
Right?

570
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,520
I'm not cheering up Jiang Qiao Xi.

571
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,240
I'm looking at the rare opportunity.

572
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,840
Xiao Hao is wearing a wool.

573
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,600
Hurry up.

574
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,440
It's about to start.

575
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
It's about to start.

576
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,040
It's about to start.

577
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,640
It's about to start.

578
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,440
It's about to start.

579
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:10,920
It's about to start.

580
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,760
It's about to start.

581
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,280
They're guessing

582
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,280
who will join the national team.

583
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,400
Are you in?

584
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,560
Of course not.

585
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,840
You're not feeling well now.

586
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,840
I don't want to play with them.

587
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,880
If I don't get a fever,

588
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,080
you'll be in, right?

589
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,760
Do you think I'll be in?

590
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,280
Of course I think you'll be in.

591
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,320
But

592
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,360
I won't play with them.

593
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,880
I think

594
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,920
they're just trying to be satisfied.

595
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,840
But

596
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,320
I don't want to be happy

597
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,280
about your competition.

598
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,000
Do you know

599
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,920
how much is my risk-earning ratio?

600
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
Risk-earning ratio?

601
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
What is it?

602
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,240
Risk-earning ratio?

603
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,400
Master,

604
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,120
isn't it a financial term?

605
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,200
Why are you talking about this?

606
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,680
I'm sorry I didn't explain it clearly.

607
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,160
I just didn't understand the intro.

608
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,200
Forget it.

609
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,960
It's fine.

610
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,880
My risk-earning ratio is lower than the estimate.

611
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,960
If you don't participate,

612
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,120
you won't lose anything.

613
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,880
And

614
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,240
I'm coming back soon.

615
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,560
It's almost over.

616
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,960
Jiang Qiao Xi,

617
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,760
what is the end?

618
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,920
I thought about it for a day today,

619
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,640
but I still didn't figure it out.

620
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
Are you saying the competition is over?

621
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,320
Everything

622
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,560
is about to end.

623
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,920
Anyway,

624
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,080
I wish you

625
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,480
a great victory.

626
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,520
A great victory?

627
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,480
I like the word.

628
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,640
I need it, too.

629
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,200
Thank you.

630
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,400
Hello.

631
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,200
Why are you talking to me like that?

632
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,320
When will you come back?

633
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,480
From today,

634
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,440
the fourth day.

635
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,360
I'll be back.

636
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,760
Okay.

637
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,320
Master,

638
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,080
can you come in?

639
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,880
Jiang Qiao Xi.

640
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,400
Yin Tao,

641
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,600
will you pick me up

642
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,800
on the day I come back?

643
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,280
Okay.

644
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,200
I'll pick you up.

645
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,240
After the competition,

646
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,760
it's getting slowly difficult

647
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,320
now.

648
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,440
I wanna go home.

649
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,860
It's

650
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,960
the morale is becoming much weaker.

651
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,140
Which means

652
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,360
you won't have a good day.

653
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,920
Can you show me

654
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,920
your moves on the day I come back?

655
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,920
xin zheng

656
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,400
The gym of Restaurateur

657
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,800
International Class 1

658
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,160
of the National Tournament

659
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,480
Grace's

660
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,480
You are the champion of the competition today.

661
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
God of War,

662
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
you have a fever and made a mistake this time.

663
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Otherwise, you would have killed the whole field in a second.

664
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
But,

665
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
with your ability,

666
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
even if you are in the top of the normal,

667
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
you are also a fated champion.

668
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
No, I'm not a champion.

669
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Thank you.

670
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
But,

671
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
I don't think I need it.

672
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
In this competition,

673
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,480
there is a player who is good at

674
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
running and diving.

675
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,480
He got a full score of C.

676
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
Let's congratulate

677
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Jiang Qiuxin from the top of the family.

678
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
You are a champion.

679
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,480
You are so good at hiding.

680
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,480
I told you before,

681
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
a champion is a champion.

682
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
Jiang Qiuxin,

683
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
most importantly,

684
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
can study a little maybe even A.

685
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
If you don't mind me telling you

686
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
this much,

687
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
let me tell you one of many things,

688
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:01,980
that is,

689
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
if we can meet in person,

690
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,480
when you want to know more about Jiang Qiuxin,

691
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
everybody wants to know about him,

692
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
and only he is jewelry for us.

693
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Jiang Qiuxin,

694
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,080
I too am just like you now

695
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:31,120
Totally leaning on

696
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:41,800
I'm just like you now

697
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,480
Look, a new leader

698
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,600
Jiang Qiaoxian

699
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Jiang Qiaoxian

700
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,480
Jiang Qiaoxian has been calling for four days

701
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,520
He calls at least half a car every day

702
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,720
Who is calling him?

703
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
He said he was cold

704
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,080
He is going to the bathroom

705
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,760
He is still with his friends

706
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,960
He is going to the bathroom

707
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,480
It doesn't matter if he is cold

708
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,360
Come on, guys

709
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,200
Come on, gather over there

710
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,000
Come on

711
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,640
You are getting better

712
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,840
Much better

713
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,840
I don't feel much

714
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,440
Have you eaten?

715
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,400
Not yet

716
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
How can you recover

717
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,640
if you don't eat?

718
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,120
I am in a hurry

719
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,640
Then let's go to eat

720
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,240
OK, OK

721
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,480
Let's have breakfast together

722
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,720
Let's go together

723
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,200
I am going to take the sword

724
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,960
Here you are

725
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,920
Thank you

726
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,440
Here you are

727
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,200
Thank you

728
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,920
Senior, my name is Qi Le

729
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,400
Your name is Qi Le?

730
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,640
My name is Lin Qi Le

731
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,880
Senior

732
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,000
Is your nickname Rong Rong?

733
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,920
Rong Rong

734
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,240
Qi Le Rong Rong

735
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,840
Yes, this is it

736
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,480
You

737
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,080
You watch the five-point show

738
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,320
When Jiang Tiao Xin was a kid

739
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,800
She liked to watch the new season

740
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,800
Senior Lin

741
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,880
You really knew Jiang when you were a kid?

742
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,520
Yes

743
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,200
I read this book when I was in the east

744
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,880
Really?

745
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,520
I like this book very much

746
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,800
I want the sky

747
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,120
I want the land

748
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,400
I want the land

749
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,000
I can't bury my heart

750
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,080
I want everyone to understand my will

751
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,120
I want all the Buddhas to laugh and die

752
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,840
Look

753
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,200
Fortunately, you used this

754
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,640
to cover your scar on your forehead

755
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,720
It's OK

756
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,600
You should be almost healed now

757
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,040
I can still see it

758
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,400
I think there is no difference

759
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,720
I think I should see it too

760
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,200
I am afraid my red teeth will be 벙纯

761
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,560
That truth is coming

762
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,840
Then, do you need to take the exam later?

763
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,800
No

764
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,960
I won't take it

765
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,280
I also won't take it

766
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,080
I don't have to take any examination

767
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
It's comin down to me

768
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,360
I can only take a test next year

769
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,960
But Oh Yanzi didn't have to take any exam

770
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,360
Because I got full marks

771
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,440
The 통� Osaka World Inc Itself

772
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,200
And what does that mean?

773
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,800
I think I should participate in the international competition.

774
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,040
International competition means going abroad to play.

775
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,680
Yes.

776
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,120
So, after teaching the students,

777
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,560
they don't need to come to school anymore.

778
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,480
If you can join the national team,

779
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,000
you can go to Qingbei University directly.

780
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,520
Eat.

781
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,280
Let's go.

782
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,600
Thank you, college.

783
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,080
You're welcome.

784
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,760
Thank you, senior.

785
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,360
Jiang Xiaoxi.

786
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,880
So, you won't go to school on Monday?

787
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,800
I'll go to school.

788
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,440
All of this

789
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,600
is over.

790
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,280
Senior Jiang,

791
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,520
you won't go to the national team?

792
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,600
I won't learn math.

793
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,520
I'll go back to school.

794
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
You won't learn math?

795
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,360
Mom,

796
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,640
these are all the math study materials

797
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,600
I've sorted since I was a kid.

798
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,880
I'm tired of them.

799
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,200
If you want to,

800
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,280
you can follow the order.

801
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,120
What do you mean?

802
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,920
I guessed it.

803
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,600
You must have forgotten.

804
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,440
When I was in the first grade of primary school,

805
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,760
I just came back from Hong Kong.

806
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Because I was too greedy.

807
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,480
I didn't complete the math homework

808
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,640
you arranged for me.

809
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,200
You tore all my math books.

810
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,240
You also told me

811
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,440
you had no other choice

812
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,400
but to learn math.

813
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,240
I'll do it myself.

814
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,560
I'll do it myself.

815
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,640
I don't want this choice.

816
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,040
What are you acting?

817
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,680
A gentleman avenges his enemy.

818
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,640
It's not too late.

819
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,480
No.

820
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,640
I can't be notified when time comes.

821
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,160
I spent the past 10 years

822
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,600
answering your questions.

823
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,560
I don't want to

824
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,840
transfer any investment

825
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,400
to the field of maths genius.

826
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,800
I've given up.

827
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,960
I really thought that

828
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,240
you were smart.

829
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,600
You know that

830
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,200
if you Use some dagger to stab me,

831
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,600
You just want me to know

832
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,040
that I wasted so many years of effort.

833
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,360
Right?

834
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,680
Mom,

835
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,520
I waited until today

836
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,760
because only today

837
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,200
you're willing to listen to what I want to say

838
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
and see what I want to do.

839
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,360
I don't want to show up.

840
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,920
I'm not a shadow to anyone.

841
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
I'm Jiang Qiaoxi.

842
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,040
I have my own name.

843
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,360
You shouldn't mention his name.

844
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,720
He's different from you.

845
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,640
He knows how hard it is for me.

846
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,240
When Meng Chu was four years old, he told me

847
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,560
he was going to the north of Qing.

848
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,960
He wanted to be the most powerful person

849
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,360
in the world of math.

850
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,280
If he were still alive,

851
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,840
he would envy you a lot.

852
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,200
I'm sorry.

853
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,120
But I'm the one who's alive now.

854
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,960
He said that Meng Chu didn't complete

855
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
the life of a genius.

856
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,600
What does it have to do with me?

857
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,200
How could you...

858
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,800
How old is he now?

859
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,200
How could you do that?

860
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,760
How could you...

861
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,240
How old is he now?

862
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,680
How could you do that?

863
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,400
Are you okay?

864
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,040
I'm fine.

865
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,920
Sit.

866
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,920
distort

867
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,960
So good about Qiaoxi.

868
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,960
She is good and know about me.

869
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,280
But we didn't give her a choice messed up.

870
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,440
I really bodies she is a lose-och.

871
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,800
Mr. Liao's attitude towards Qiaoxi

872
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,320
has been misunderstood by him.

873
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,960
Good dog,

874
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,400
I made notes when she has a class.

875
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,320
I was doing pages and I made them.

876
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
He's just like a chairman.

877
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,320
He's like a clothesman.

878
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
He's been to the bathroom for three minutes.

879
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
He needs water.

880
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
He can't sit.

881
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,320
That's because he has a nail on his head.

882
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Hello?

883
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Manager Cai.

884
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
Okay, okay.

885
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
We'll come over.

886
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
Okay.

887
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
I'll talk to you later.

888
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Xiao Xi.

889
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
I know you're tired.

890
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
You can say that you're exhausted.

891
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
How about this?

892
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
I'll take you on a trip.

893
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
Let's go out and relax.

894
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
Didn't you want to go to Tibet?

895
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,320
Huangshan, Taishan,

896
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,320
all the famous places are okay.

897
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,320
If you don't want to go with me,

898
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
you can ask your friends to make a group.

899
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,320
We'll pay for all the expenses.

900
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
Go to wherever you want.

901
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
No, mom.

902
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
Take them abroad.

903
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
I'm not here to make a fuss today.

904
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,320
I'm not here to ask for a vacation.

905
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,320
I'm just telling you.

906
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
From today on,

907
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
I don't want these things.

908
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,320
From now on,

909
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,320
I have a name.

910
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,320
My name is Jiang Xiao Xi.

911
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Xiao Xi, I'm wrong.

912
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,320
I'm begging you.

913
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
I'm sorry.

914
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
I shouldn't have died.

915
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
Please don't give up.

916
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,320
You can't go to the north.

917
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,320
You've been working so hard.

918
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
You want to be the world champion.

919
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,320
Do you know that?

920
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Mom, I'm telling you now.

921
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
Don't you understand what I want?

922
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,320
What do you want?

923
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
What do you want?

924
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
Is that girl in Qunshan?

925
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Because of her?

926
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Is it?

927
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
I understand.

928
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Anyway, in your heart,

929
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,320
the only crime that can be pinned to me

930
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,320
is this one, right?

931
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,320
But you were so good when you were little.

932
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
You listened to mom.

933
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
You went to Qunshan.

934
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
You met those people.

935
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Everything has changed.

936
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,320
For so many years,

937
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,320
your dad and I have done so much for you.

938
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,320
Why do you give up so easily?

939
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,320
Mom, think about it.

940
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
All these things that I did since I was a kid,

941
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,320
was it really just for me?

942
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
You and my dad are so strict with me.

943
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
Isn't it because you're afraid?

944
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,320
You drank too much when you were a kid.

945
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
But I told myself,

946
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Jiang Muchu,

947
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
it's all my fault.

948
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
Mom should have come to pick you up.

949
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,320
Mom shouldn't have let dad pick you up.

950
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,320
He was always late.

951
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Then I realized,

952
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Jiang Muchu,

953
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,320
he escaped because of the math class.

954
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,320
You didn't pick him up, so he...

955
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,320
Xiao Jing, stop talking.

956
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
I've grown up, I understand.

957
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,320
You want him to be a genius.

958
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
But he...

959
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
He just wants to find a place

960
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,320
that can hide from you.

961
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
At 13,

962
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
he disappeared in a small mountain, so close to home.

963
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
You really believe that...

964
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
You can't talk about him like that.

965
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Jiang Zhaoxi,

966
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
do you think you can do this to your brother?

967
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,320
Do you think you can do this to your dead brother?

968
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
Why did you do this to him?

969
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Who did this to him?

970
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
What are you talking about?

971
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
Jiang Muchu has the same eyes as you,

972
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
the same blood as you.

973
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
He wouldn't think that.

974
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
Jiang Muchu has the same blood as me,

975
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,320
the same eyes as me.

976
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
My skin, my bones, my flesh,

977
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
everything on me,

978
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,320
you gave it to me.

979
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
And these,

980
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
these awards,

981
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
these awards,

982
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
you gave it to me.

983
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
Don't you want them?

984
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,320
Then I'll return these blood to you today.

985
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
I only do my Jiang Zhaoxi.

986
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Jiang Zhaoxi.

987
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Jiang Zhaoxi.

988
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Tonight,

989
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,320
we're having hot pot.

990
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,320
Are you going to eat?

991
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,320
You know that I'm not good at eating hot pot.

992
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
But if you're here,

993
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
and you're eating with me,

994
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
I can eat a lot.

995
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
Let's go.

996
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Jiang Zhaoxi.

997
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Here.

998
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
I'll sit here.

999
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
I'll sit here.

1000
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Wait.

1001
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,320
Your wound needs to be disinfected.

1002
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,320
I'll get some wine.

1003
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
After you're done,

1004
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
we can eat hot pot.

1005
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
My mom made fried pork.

1006
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,320
You have to eat more.

1007
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
So I can eat more.

1008
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
How about this?

1009
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,320
You count ten.

1010
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1011
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,320
I'll pay you back after ten.

1012
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1013
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1014
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1015
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1016
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1017
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1018
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1019
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1020
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1021
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1022
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1023
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1024
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,320
I'll definitely pay you back after ten.

1025
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,320
Jiang Qiao Xi left.

1026
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,320
Jiang Qiao Xi didn't write to me.

1027
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,320
She didn't call me.

1028
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,320
I don't want to think about Jiang Qiao Xi anymore.

1029
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,320
I won't be hurt because of her anymore.

1030
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,320
Once in the night,

1031
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,320
I was like a dust cloud.

1032
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,320
The north wind blew

1033
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,320
and I couldn't find a place to settle down.

1034
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Once in the dream,

1035
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
I thought I was still lost.

1036
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,320
But I heard the sound of the dream

1037
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,320
that was being made up.

1038
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,320
I was like a dream

1039
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,320
that was being made up.

1040
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,320
Across the darkness,

1041
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:23,320
the extraordinary power

1042
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,320
of my dreams,

1043
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,320
I want to release it.

1044
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,320
I want to let, I want to let you see

1045
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
the light that shines in my heart.

1046
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,320
I want to sing, I want to sing for you

1047
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:45,320
my loneliness and confusion.

1048
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,320
I want to forget the past,

1049
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,320
the ordinary growth.

1050
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:57,320
I'm floating, I'm looking to the distance.

1051
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,320
Once in the dream,

1052
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,320
I smelled the fragrance.

1053
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Like the fragrance of white fireworks on the way to the front.

1054
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,320
Across the darkness,

1055
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,320
the extraordinary power

1056
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,320
of my dreams,

1057
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,320
I want to release it.

1058
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,320
I want to let, I want to let you see

1059
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,320
the light that shines in my heart.

1060
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:43,320
I want to sing, I want to sing for you

1061
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,320
my loneliness and confusion.

1062
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,320
I want to forget, I want to forget the past,

1063
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,320
the ordinary growth.

1064
00:44:53,320 --> 00:45:01,320
I'm floating, I'm looking to the distance.
