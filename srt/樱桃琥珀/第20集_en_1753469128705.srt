Episode 2

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I had so many dreams.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In my dreams, it was like a different parallel universe.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There were so many you.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Each you had a different ending.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In parallel worlds,

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
you probably didn't expect

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I would be like this.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Do you know

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
what you look like now?

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You look like

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
a normal person.

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You're tanned, but you're still beautiful.

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're beautiful.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're tanned, but you look healthier.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You have a place to live.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Someone is talking to you.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're thinking about me.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is the best ending in my dreams.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you know what I dreamed of?

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I dreamed that you were shot to death

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
by a bullet.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Qiao Qiao Xi, if it were you,

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
you heard that,

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
but then I disappeared,

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and I couldn't contact you.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What would you think?

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I would think

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
that you must have been very happy.

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
At least,

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you wouldn't be like me now.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're like me.

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I won't leave.

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I won't leave, Qiao Qiao Xi.

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I won't leave.

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I won't leave.

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I won't leave.

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Qiao Qiao Xi.

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Qiao Qiao Xi.

45
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Brother Wen,

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
after you get up in the morning,

47
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
you have to buy breakfast.

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The shrimp dumplings at the corner.

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He should like them.

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why don't you buy them yourself?

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Thanks.

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No.

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Hey, Yang Xi.

54
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,400
What are you doing?

55
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,200
Where are you going?

56
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,400
I'm going to sit on the ground for a while.

57
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,400
Are you crazy?

58
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,600
With this physical strength, you should stay at home.

59
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,000
Your girlfriend is here.

60
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,280
Come.

61
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,680
Why are you staring at them?

62
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,280
These two are abortionesses.

63
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,000
Princess Super Beautiful could not find Control of him.

64
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,080
This guy kidnaps the Queen of Shangму, and the Princess has to work.

65
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,400
It's fine.

66
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,560
Zhang [#Yai Ru tou pang is the boy on love Island Workshop?

67
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,760
There's a boy on love Island workshop.

68
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,920
What's your name?]

69
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,880
Zhang.

70
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,360
Hello.

71
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,000
Please give us a lift.

72
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,040
Hello.

73
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,640
Can I help you?

74
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
You are the one who made the bond change.

75
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,480
Hello, this is Xia Ruo事情 terminator.

76
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,080
I didn't wake you up, right?

77
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,240
No, no.

78
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,960
Well...

79
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,560
I'm in Hong Kong now.

80
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,840
I found Jiang Xiaoxi.

81
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,840
That's good.

82
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,120
I called you

83
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,520
to tell you about this.

84
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,960
Previously,

85
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,400
the interviewer saw Jiang Xiaoxi's photo

86
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,160
on MSN Space.

87
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,240
It's the photo of her doing home training in Hong Kong.

88
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,720
Only we saw it.

89
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,000
At that time, Qin Yuanyun said

90
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,680
I didn't...

91
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,320
But I thought about it for a long time.

92
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,080
I also discussed it with the interviewer.

93
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,840
I think I should tell you something.

94
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:43,920
It's okay.

95
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,160
I know what Qin Yuanyun thinks.

96
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,600
She did it for me.

97
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,160
Where is Jiang Xiaoxi?

98
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,320
Is she okay?

99
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,080
She...

100
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
She's not okay.

101
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,920
But if you go there,

102
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,160
you will make her feel better.

103
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,520
You are her little hero.

104
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,520
You're right.

105
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
I'll hang up then.

106
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,240
If you need anything,

107
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,280
you can contact me.

108
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,640
I'll be waiting for you.

109
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,320
Bye.

110
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,400
Okay.

111
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,280
I'll hang up.

112
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,800
Where are you?

113
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,960
Jiang Xiaoxi.

114
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,360
Jiang Xiaoxi

115
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,240
Have you had breakfast?

116
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,080
Jiang Xiaoxi asked me to buy it for you.

117
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,640
I'll pay for it.

118
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,920
Thank you.

119
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,960
You're welcome.

120
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,640
Thank you.

121
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,280
Jiang Xiaoxi

122
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,560
Well...

123
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,520
Did you book a hotel?

124
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,400
I'll send you there after breakfast.

125
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,640
If you don't book it,

126
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,360
I'll book it for you.

127
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,480
There's a discount.

128
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,840
I know you're here for Vincent.

129
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,040
Don't worry.

130
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,920
Leave the phone number to me.

131
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,720
I'll call you as soon as he comes back.

132
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,880
Hello.

133
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,480
Hello.

134
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,480
I won't leave.

135
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,760
Jiang Xiaoxi hasn't come back for a night.

136
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,040
Even if she wants to leave,

137
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,320
she won't come back.

138
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
She has to come back

139
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,240
to get her luggage and documents.

140
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,280
So I won't leave.

141
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,320
Don't persuade me.

142
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,160
Go.

143
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,160
No way.

144
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,320
She can't leave.

145
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,520
If she could leave,

146
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,680
she would have left long ago.

147
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,560
Don't worry. Go to the hotel.

148
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,720
I really won't leave.

149
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,880
Don't persuade me for her.

150
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,680
Thank you.

151
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm leaving.

152
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,400
How about this?

153
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,680
After breakfast,

154
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,520
I'll tell you

155
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,400
where Princess Changping is.

156
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,760
I'll take you to her.

157
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,080
Do you know where she is?

158
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,760
I'll take you there.

159
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,800
Wait for me.

160
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Li Shi.

161
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,160
Don't worry.

162
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,720
She slept in the palace last night.

163
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Palace?

164
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,480
The ground floor

165
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,960
is occupied by construction workers.

166
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,080
Construction workers.

167
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,480
You mean construction workers?

168
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,000
Yes.

169
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,200
This job is hard-working and time-sensitive.

170
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,960
She has no money, no education, no time.

171
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,680
She can easily get her license.

172
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
It suits her.

173
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,120
Does she have any education?

174
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,360
Has she never taken the test before?

175
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,880
No.

176
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,240
She's in Hong Kong University.

177
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,640
Her grade is 8.

178
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,000
She's in Hong Kong University?

179
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,480
Hong Kong workers

180
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,880
are students from Hong Kong University?

181
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,760
That's not true.

182
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,800
But

183
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,640
if Hong Kong University students insist on going,

184
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,760
they won't object.

185
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,360
After all,

186
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,320
as long as you work overtime,

187
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,520
you can make a profit of 50,000 to 60,000 a month.

188
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,440
50,000 to 60,000?

189
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,160
Yes.

190
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
What's the difference between her and me?

191
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,640
I was there for several hours,

192
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,860
and her旅人纪录

193
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,400
was nonsense.

194
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,440
Mr下去 and Mr down?

195
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,520
pisces.

196
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,840
What's going on?

197
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,160
I'm not readied.

198
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,520
He needs to set up an office.

199
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,600
After he does his top job,

200
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,440
he'll be his employee.

201
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,440
I'm the one who's in trouble.

202
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,360
He's a good guy.

203
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,640
He can help me with the finance

204
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,720
and make a lot of money.

205
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,040
I'll pay him the rent.

206
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,520
I'll let him live in the biggest house in the building.

207
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,480
Otherwise, he won't have enough money.

208
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
The rent in Hong Kong will make him dry.

209
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,560
He lives in the biggest house?

210
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,840
Yes.

211
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,480
Why is he so difficult?

212
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,120
I'll tell you.

213
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,600
To be honest,

214
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,440
I thought the photo in his room

215
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,560
was his imagination.

216
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,080
After all, he doesn't look normal.

217
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,520
When I saw you,

218
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,280
I was so scared.

219
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,560
You're a real man.

220
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,840
Ying,

221
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,400
he's going to be a tutor

222
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,680
and go to the construction site.

223
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,760
You also paid him the rent.

224
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,800
Do you know what he's doing with the money?

225
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
Sometimes,

226
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,720
people prefer to get off the car with strangers

227
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,040
than to talk to the closest person.

228
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,960
You have to ask him.

229
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,400
I can't make the decision.

230
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,320
It costs more than that.

231
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,840
The driver in this car,

232
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,080
you have to ask him to Compared it with what did you do to Ecuador?

233
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,360
I got no choice.

234
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,040
uring

235
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,920
Your wife asked him to bring you $500 to Gla Gaza.

236
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,200
Does he pay you according to your pollution insurance?

237
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,840
My wife is not staying home anymore.

238
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,120
Don't complain.

239
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,160
Listen to me.

240
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,720
I'm amounting it all.

241
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,040
I've finally finished asking my wife for help.

242
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,360
I'm going to make her pay.

243
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,520
簡單地說

244
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,240
Woohoo!!!

245
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,100
Ah HuO!

246
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,200
Old indeed

247
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,040
Hot requirement

248
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,160
It was you

249
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's go

250
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,320
Not spicy

251
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,120
No.

252
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,460
SomeWOO.

253
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,100
What?

254
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,500
Jiang Xiao Xi.

255
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,580
Don't go, Jiang Xiao Xi.

256
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,660
I saw you.

257
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,420
Jiang Xiao Xi.

258
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,420
Jiang Xiao Xi.

259
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,780
Jiang Xiao Xi.

260
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
Don't run.

261
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,980
Stopнибудь.

262
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,740
Stopatlite.

263
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:27,860
Xiao Xi.

264
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,100
Xiao Xi.

265
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
Stop.

266
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,300
Don't run.

267
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,140
I'm scared.

268
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,900
Ming Tao.

269
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,140
I'm scared that he'll stop me. Don't let him run away.

270
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,860
Ming Tao.

271
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,540
Don't move.

272
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,340
Don't move.

273
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,620
Let go of me.

274
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,300
Don't move.

275
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,420
Are you okay?

276
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,220
Let go of me.

277
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:02,900
Don't move.

278
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,340
Miss, can I steal your stuff?

279
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,180
Miss.

280
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,140
I said I'm fine.

281
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,700
Don't move.

282
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,220
Are you okay?

283
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,300
I'm fine.

284
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,860
Can I steal your stuff?

285
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,060
I'm your friend.

286
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,020
I'm done.

287
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,420
Don't hurt me.

288
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,900
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,380
I'm scared.

290
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,140
Are you okay?

291
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,860
I'm just a little far from you.

292
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,500
You're so lucky, young man.

293
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,580
Are you okay?

294
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,620
Don't run away.

295
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:29,900
What's wrong?

296
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,780
I'm sorry.

297
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,020
Don't run away. I can't catch up with you.

298
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,660
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,140
I can't do it.

300
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,740
Hey.

301
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,820
Wait.

302
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
I'll take you to the hospital.

303
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
I'm sorry.

304
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,260
Lin Tao.

305
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,580
Lin Tao.

306
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,860
Don't run away.

307
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,900
I'm not.

308
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
I'm here.

309
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,900
Be careful.

310
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Don't run away.

311
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,340
Memories wander in the air.

312
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,340
Pass through the window of time.

313
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,340
The shade of summer is bright.

314
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,020
I look far away.

315
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,420
The wishes that I didn't say that year.

316
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,540
The shadow of familiar becomes longer.

317
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,300
Your outline is gentle beyond the sight.

318
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,940
The world is spinning.

319
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,060
Simple.

320
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,580
You look pretty on TV.

321
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,260
You must be very delicious.

322
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,100
You can't eat it.

323
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,900
It's all my fault.

324
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,980
How can it be?

325
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,980
It's so delicious.

326
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,660
It's delicious.

327
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,580
You eat it.

328
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,260
Okay.

329
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,380
I'll eat it.

330
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,620
You have a red cat, too?

331
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,500
Hey.

332
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
What are you doing?

333
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,780
I'm sorry.

334
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,420
I'm sorry. You're so mean.

335
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,380
You're so mean.

336
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,420
You...

337
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,820
Lin Tou.

338
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,900
You like to watch the waterfalls.

339
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,500
Let's go there together.

340
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,540
But I don't think there's a water park.

341
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
There's a water park.

342
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,620
But I don't like water parks.

343
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,140
Then I won't go.

344
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,780
If you're there,

345
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,820
I'll be there.

346
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,020
Then we'll go.

347
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,900
You're so kind.

348
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,340
I'm always here.

349
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,540
Lin Tou.

350
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,820
Why don't you finish your homework?

351
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,140
I haven't finished my homework.

352
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,740
I haven't done mine either.

353
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,020
Jiang Qiang Xi.

354
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,300
Why haven't you finished your homework?

355
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:59,620
Falun.

356
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,760
like everyone else

357
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,680
beside me

358
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,760
and myself

359
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,860
Everyone

360
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,960
told me

361
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,000
How did you grow up so big

362
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,440
You are just like a little baby in my room

363
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,580
Really

364
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,580
Thank you.

365
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:33,980
Lin.

366
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,980
You've grown up.

367
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,140
We're in the middle of the summer.

368
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,300
We're a bit tired.

369
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,660
You know,

370
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,180
Hong Kong is so cold.

371
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,020
It's different from Hong Kong.

372
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,060
Your girlfriend

373
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,260
came here in a nightgown.

374
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,740
She didn't even wear a jacket.

375
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,180
She was sweating on the way.

376
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,620
And the blood in the body

377
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,700
can't be tolerated

378
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,020
when the heat is over.

379
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,220
No.

380
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,220
I'll stay here with you.

381
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,780
Go back to bed.

382
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,740
You need to rest well

383
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,620
before you get better.

384
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,020
Lin.

385
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:20,940
Lin.

386
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,340
Take me home.

387
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,740
I don't like the smell of the hospital.

388
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,980
Take me home.

389
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,340
My air conditioner is broken.

390
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,860
You're sick

391
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
because of the cold and heat.

392
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,780
You'll only get sick

393
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,060
if you go to my house.

394
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,740
I can stay here for the rest of my life.

395
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,060
I don't want to stay here.

396
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,620
Come in, please.

397
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,260
I'll check the room.

398
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,500
Sir.

399
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,860
Is there anyone who can help you?

400
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,820
That same place is Denn Yuan's.

401
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,660
Get Zeyu up to wait for him.

402
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,540
Is he ill?

403
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,100
Can she wait for me there?

404
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,260
but she's來

405
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,300
for the hospital.

406
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,540
You can book me first.

407
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,660
When she wakes up,

408
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,660
bring her down to the ground.

409
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,340
She's not your girlfriend. Why do you bring her here?

410
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,340
She's my girlfriend.

411
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,140
Oh.

412
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,660
Then you wake her up

413
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,660
and bring her to the ground.

414
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,740
I just had a dream.

415
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
I dreamt that

416
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,740
someone said I was his girlfriend.

417
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
Who is this person?

418
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
It can't be you, right?

419
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,740
Jiang Xiao Xi.

420
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,740
Dreams are all the opposite.

421
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,740
The opposite?

422
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Then what do you mean?

423
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,740
I don't know.

424
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,740
Then you mean

425
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,740
I'm your boyfriend?

426
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,740
If you don't want to sleep,

427
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,740
come down and walk.

428
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
I'm dizzy.

429
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,740
Jiang Xiao Xi, do you know

430
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,740
my senior in college

431
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,740
will be my makeup artist.

432
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,740
I'm good at applying eye shadow,

433
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,740
blush,

434
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,740
and apply mascara.

435
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,740
But

436
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,740
the lipstick and high heels

437
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,740
you gave me,

438
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,740
I never used them.

439
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,740
Because I always remember you said

440
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,740
you don't want to miss the look of me

441
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,740
wearing high heels.

442
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,740
Director Lin,

443
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,740
stop talking.

444
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,740
No, I have to say it.

445
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,740
I have to say it.

446
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
Jiang Xiao Xi, you're really

447
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,740
really annoying.

448
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
You're bad.

449
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,740
You lied to me.

450
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,740
You avoided me.

451
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,740
You don't believe me.

452
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
But even so,

453
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,740
I don't hate you.

454
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
Because I know

455
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,740
you must have wanted to come to me.

456
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,740
Just like when you were little,

457
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,740
you wanted to go back to the mountains alone.

458
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,740
Ming Tao,

459
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,740
I can't bear to be alone anymore.

460
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,740
I don't want you to go.

461
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,740
So I came to you.

462
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

463
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,740
don't be afraid.

464
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,740
I found you.

465
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

466
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,740
don't be afraid.

467
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,740
I found you.

468
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

469
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,740
don't be afraid.

470
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,740
I found you.

471
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

472
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,740
don't be afraid.

473
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,740
I found you.

474
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

475
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
don't be afraid.

476
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,740
I found you.

477
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

478
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,740
don't be afraid.

479
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,740
I found you.

480
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

481
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,740
don't be afraid.

482
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
I found you.

483
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

484
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,740
don't be afraid.

485
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,740
I found you.

486
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

487
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,740
don't be afraid.

488
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,740
I found you.

489
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

490
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,740
don't be afraid.

491
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,740
I found you.

492
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

493
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,740
don't be afraid.

494
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,740
I found you.

495
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

496
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,740
don't be afraid.

497
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,740
I found you.

498
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

499
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,740
don't be afraid.

500
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,740
I found you.

501
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

502
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,740
don't be afraid.

503
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,740
I found you.

504
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,740
Jiang Xiao Xi,

505
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,740
don't be afraid.

506
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
Where are you going?

507
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
I'm going to buy some water.

508
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,740
I'm going to buy some water.

509
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,740
Do you need money?

510
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,060
I wish I could buy water in the last ten days.

511
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,740
The oral medicine certificate is ready.

512
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,220
Don't even have time to eat now at 11 p.m.

513
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,900
I need to take a shower.

514
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,100
I am sweating a lot.

515
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,620
Sure.

516
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,540
and a relationship quality check?

517
00:33:48,700 --> 00:34:13,580
Then ask

518
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,420
Xia Mo better.

519
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,740
Wait for me. I'll be back.

520
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,740
You can go in and wash.

521
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,740
That...

522
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,740
The water on the left is hot water,

523
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,740
and the cold water on the right.

524
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,740
Put your clothes here.

525
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,740
I'll go and wash.

526
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,740
I'll go and wash.

527
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,740
I'll go and wash.

528
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,740
I'll go and wash.

529
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,740
I'll go and wash.

530
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,740
Put your clothes here.

531
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,740
I'll go out first.

532
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,740
I'll go and wash.

533
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,740
The lock is broken.

534
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,740
I'll ask someone to fix it.

535
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,740
How long will it take?

536
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,740
It might take some time.

537
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,740
Can you watch outside for me?

538
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,740
I'm fast.

539
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,740
Okay.

540
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,740
It's okay. You can wash.

541
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,740
I'll be at the door.

542
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,740
Jiang Qiang Xi.

543
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,740
What's wrong?

544
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,740
Nothing.

545
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,740
I just wanted to see if you were there.

546
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,740
I'm not leaving.

547
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,740
I'm not leaving.

548
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,740
I'm not leaving.

549
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,740
I'm not leaving.

550
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,740
I'm not leaving.

551
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,740
I'm not leaving.

552
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,740
I'm not leaving.

553
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,740
Jiang Qiang Xi.

554
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,740
What's wrong?

555
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,740
Nothing.

556
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,740
I'm not leaving.

557
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,740
I'm not leaving.

558
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,740
I'm not leaving.

559
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,740
I'm not leaving.

560
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,740
I'm not leaving.

561
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,740
I'm not leaving.

562
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,740
I'm not leaving.

563
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,740
I'm not leaving.

564
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,740
I'm not leaving.

565
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,740
I'm not leaving.

566
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,740
I'm not leaving.

567
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,740
I'm not leaving.

568
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,740
I'm not leaving.

569
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,740
I'm not leaving.

570
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,740
I'm not leaving.

571
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,740
I'm not leaving.

572
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,740
I'm not leaving.

573
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,740
You're up.

574
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,620
Get used to it.

575
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,220
You made fine tea this afternoon.

576
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,780
This became sweetener for you.

577
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,300
Is your shower gel delicious?

578
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,380
I just bought it just for decoration.

579
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,740
I'm done.

580
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,260
You can go and wash up.

581
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,540
Me?

582
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,260
You didn't take a shower for a whole day?

583
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,620
I'm done.

584
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,780
You're done?

585
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,380
You look like

586
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,540
you were in high school.

587
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,780
I wasn't that dark before.

588
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,420
But looking into your eyes,

589
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,460
I can see you in high school.

590
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,740
That was

591
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,540
a long time ago.

592
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,220
It's only been two years.

593
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,820
How long has it been?

594
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,420
So,

595
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,060
tell me.

596
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,140
What's wrong

597
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,540
with you these two years?
