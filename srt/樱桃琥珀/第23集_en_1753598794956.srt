Episode 18

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,400
What about this?

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,480
Look at mine.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,400
This...

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,800
Hello.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,400
Hello.

7
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,640
How much is this?

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,360
That's two thousand and eight.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,560
Two thousand and eight.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
What about this?

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,440
This is three thousand and two.

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,520
Three thousand and two?

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,160
Yes.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,600
Which one do you think is better?

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,760
Yang Xi?

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,520
What's wrong?

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,680
Why don't you talk?

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,480
You told me

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,560
that you can tell me

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,760
if you have the mood.

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,840
Can I rely on you more?

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,720
Okay.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,600
What do you want?

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,440
How about you choose one?

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,360
I'll give it to you.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,040
How about this?

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,480
I don't want the sunglasses.

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,440
I want something else.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,960
What else?

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,280
Okay.

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,640
Anyway, we have six or seven thousand left

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,360
after we buy the sunglasses.

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,760
You can choose whatever you want.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,800
I'll buy Yu Qiao's sunglasses for her.

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,160
I happen to want to give her a gift.

36
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,640
Why?

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,240
Last time, Yu Qiao came to Hong Kong

38
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,720
and talked to me.

39
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
In fact,

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,320
she really has more time with you

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,320
than I do.

42
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
Maybe

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,240
she really knows you better than I do.

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,920
Why do you say such strange things?

45
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm just saying.

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm just saying.

47
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
What strange things?

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
I just want to thank you

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,120
for your support.

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,360
You never gave up on me.

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,880
Don't say that.

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,560
Actually, Yu Qiao

53
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,920
also treats you as a friend.

54
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,920
He's worried about you.

55
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
You know what?

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,440
He's the one who found your Hong Kong address.

57
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
I told him.

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,160
If I didn't find you

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,920
without him,

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,280
it would be more difficult.

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
So,

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,360
I have to thank him.

63
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,160
You two are really alike.

64
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,360
You two

65
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,480
only want others to be happy.

66
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Look at this.

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
It's quite suitable.

68
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
Do you want me to go back to Hong Kong to study?

69
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
What do you mean?

70
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,680
Nothing. Just say it.

71
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
What do you want to buy?

72
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,200
You won a big prize.

73
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
You have to spend some money.

74
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
I don't want to spend money.

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
I just want to buy you a new one.

76
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
Is that okay?

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,320
I've just thought about it.

78
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,080
I want to buy Brother Tang some green plants.

79
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,240
When he's discharged,

80
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,600
he'll be happy to see

81
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
flowers and grass.

82
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,400
I also want to buy him some red wine.

83
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,960
Brother Tang will celebrate his discharge.

84
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
And...

85
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Rui Rui, right?

86
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,360
We should buy him some toys,

87
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
new clothes,

88
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,120
and Uncle and Aunt.

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
No.

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
You don't want to buy yourself anything, do you?

91
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,200
Brother Tang told me

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,800
that I should go shopping with you.

93
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,200
Why?

94
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,640
You want to buy lipstick and high heels?

95
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
That's fine.

96
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
I look good without lipstick.

97
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm tall enough without high heels.

98
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Let me stand here.

99
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,320
Let me tell you.

100
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,680
Those things

101
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,120
are meaningless to me.

102
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,920
They're meaningful because you gave them to me.

103
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,720
You're so nice,

104
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
I'll miss you more.

105
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,240
There's nothing you can do if you can't.

106
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
I'll leave the day after tomorrow.

107
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
I know.

108
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,440
That's why

109
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,920
we need to buy things as soon as possible.

110
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Don't be unhappy.

111
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,720
Let's go shopping tonight.

112
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Okay.

113
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,520
I'll go to see Tang and Tang.

114
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Okay.

115
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,520
Okay. I'll go shopping with you.

116
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Tang.

117
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,320
Tang, we're here.

118
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,120
Come.

119
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
We're here.

120
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Tang.

121
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Tang, today,

122
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,920
we're going to sing the rain, fall,

123
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,120
and the moon and the moon, so far.

124
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
I'm so happy.

125
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Thank you.

126
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,120
You're not letting me come in?

127
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
I'm so happy.

128
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
I'm so happy.

129
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Thank you.

130
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,120
I'm so happy.

131
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,120
I'm so happy.

132
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,120
I'm so happy.

133
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
I'm so happy.

134
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm so happy.

135
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm so happy.

136
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,120
Let me in.

137
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
What?

138
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,740
A

139
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,740
tree.

140
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,740
A tree.

141
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,740
Thank you.

142
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,740
You're so kind.

143
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,740
Uncle,

144
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,740
I bought you some tonics.

145
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,740
Uncle.

146
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,740
I'm not getting up.

147
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,740
Thank you.

148
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,740
Thank you.

149
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,740
Thank you.

150
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,740
Thank you for the red wine.

151
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Thank you.

152
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
You really got six dishes.

153
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,740
That's over 9,000 yuan.

154
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740
Yeah.

155
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,740
I didn't expect to get the prize.

156
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
What you said is right.

157
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
You should be patient.

158
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Let me say something.

159
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Zai,

160
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
thank you for the past two years.

161
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Thank you.

162
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Thank you for taking care of me.

163
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
It's not easy.

164
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Especially my wife.

165
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Don't mention it.

166
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
You're welcome.

167
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,360
I used to have debts.

168
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
I haven't taken them back.

169
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Although it's not easy to come back now,

170
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,360
if I go there myself,

171
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,360
they will give me a face.

172
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,980
I'm not a big deal.

173
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
So,

174
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,980
our family's business is over.

175
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,980
So,

176
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,980
Zhao Xi,

177
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,980
your contributions are all gone.

178
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,980
I think you've always been

179
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,980
talented in math.

180
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,980
Don't waste it.

181
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
Study hard.

182
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,980
At this time,

183
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,980
think about it.

184
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,980
What do you want to do?

185
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,980
What's your plan?

186
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,980
Brother Tang,

187
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
I've thought about it.

188
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Zhao Xi,

189
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
I want to

190
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
go back to Hongyang.

191
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
You want to go back to Hong Kong to study?

192
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I've studied in Hong Kong for a year.

193
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I haven't forgotten

194
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,600
what I've learned.

195
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
If I go back to Hongyang,

196
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
I can get a good score.

197
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
But you're studying finance now.

198
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
You'll have a good background

199
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
in Hong Kong.

200
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,220
I understand

201
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,220
Luo Chen and Zhao Xi's business.

202
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,220
Think about it.

203
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,220
If he continues to study here,

204
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,220
he will be in the third year

205
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,220
of the United Kingdom.

206
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,220
Okay.

207
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,220
If Luo Chen can go home for dinner today,

208
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,220
I'm also shocked.

209
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,220
The doctor agreed.

210
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,220
I'll take him back later.

211
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,220
Don't talk about such an important thing

212
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,220
in the lunch table.

213
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,220
Let's eat.

214
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
I'm sorry. I'll talk to you later.

215
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Let's eat.

216
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,840
No, I'm not talking about it.

217
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Actually, I know

218
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
that feelings are really important sometimes.

219
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
But sometimes,

220
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,840
what's more important than feelings

221
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
is the ability to know feelings.

222
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Don't just look at the current situation.

223
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Sometimes, you have to look at your future.

224
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
Right?

225
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
I'm useless now, right?

226
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
I won't listen to you.

227
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Let's eat. Don't talk about important things.

228
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,460
Let's eat.

229
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,460
Cheers.

230
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,460
Be happy.

231
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,460
Be happy.

232
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,460
Be happy.

233
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,460
Be happy.

234
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,460
I can understand a little bit.

235
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,460
When I was a kid, I watched

236
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,460
the Shandong Girls with my parents.

237
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,460
I like the Shandong Girls.

238
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,460
Do you want to say that

239
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,460
I'm not good-looking?

240
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,460
Yes, many people say that.

241
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,460
I can't help it.

242
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
I'm so happy.

243
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
I'm with a fairy.

244
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Are you really going

245
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
to retake the college entrance examination?

246
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
I've already told you to wait for me for two years.

247
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
I can't do nothing.

248
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
I'll let you wait for me for three more years.

249
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
But you're already a student of Hong Kong University.

250
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Why do you have to retake the college entrance examination?

251
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
And you'll be under a lot of pressure to retake the college entrance examination.

252
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Yin Tao, do you remember

253
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,700
what I said to you

254
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
after you finished the college entrance examination?

255
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
I said

256
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
I wanted to go to school with you

257
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
and go to the library

258
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
and go to the canteen together.

259
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
Even if you go back to Hong Kong University,

260
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
we can only

261
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
live for one year.

262
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
It's okay.

263
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
As long as there's a chance, even if it's for one year, I'm willing to.

264
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
You said you wanted me to

265
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
make up for my 18-year-old mischief.

266
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
You're here to buy a pot.

267
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
Yes.

268
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
I used to like cooking.

269
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
But I've been too busy these two years

270
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,940
and I don't have time to cook.

271
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,940
I've been in good shape recently.

272
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,940
I just want to pick up this hobby.

273
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,940
You really don't have to save money for me.

274
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,940
I saved a lot of money for home education.

275
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,940
And our bonus.

276
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,940
You can think of something else.

277
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,940
How about this?

278
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,940
You said at that time that

279
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,940
Tang Cao thought the girls' signs were lipstick and high heels.

280
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,940
How about you ask Tang Ge

281
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,940
what he thinks the boys' signs are?

282
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
I can actually buy you

283
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,560
some suits and leather shoes.

284
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
You'll definitely look good in them.

285
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
But I don't want suits or leather shoes.

286
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
I think

287
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,560
the boy's signs

288
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,560
should be full set kitchenware.

289
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Really?

290
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Really.

291
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Besides,

292
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
you're leaving tomorrow.

293
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,560
I want to cook for you.

294
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Okay.

295
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
But you've got such a big certificate.

296
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
What if you can't do it well?

297
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
After all, you haven't cooked for two years.

298
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
You look down on me?

299
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
I have all the recipes here.

300
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Why do you borrow the recipes when you don't cook?

301
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
You don't understand.

302
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Those are all the ingredients I imagined.

303
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
The ingredients you imagined?

304
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
When you're not full,

305
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
you forget the recipes and get hungry.

306
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,560
No.

307
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
I'm not hungry.

308
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,180
No.

309
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
Didn't you tell me

310
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,180
that when you can't see me,

311
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,180
you're thinking of another parallel world?

312
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,180
Me too.

313
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,180
When you're not by my side,

314
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,180
I dream of

315
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,180
another parallel world.

316
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,180
In that world,

317
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,180
we're always together.

318
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
I'll cook a lot for you.

319
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Then...

320
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
You have to work hard.

321
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
I'm a regular at your Aunt Juan's restaurant.

322
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
If you don't cook well,

323
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
I won't eat.

324
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
It's impossible to surpass Aunt Juan.

325
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
But I can practice more.

326
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I'll let you go home and eat.

327
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Okay.

328
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Did you remember what I said?

329
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
If you want to choose Chen,

330
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,420
you have to choose a round belly.

331
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,420
It's nice and sweet.

332
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,420
Don't cry.

333
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,420
Wait. Look at this.

334
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,420
Linda.

335
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,420
Don't you think

336
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
we've been living like this

337
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,420
since a long time ago?

338
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,420
What you said is nonsense.

339
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
We grew up together.

340
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
You're always cooking at my house.

341
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
I'm always in a hurry.

342
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
But it's the first time

343
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
we're going to the supermarket

344
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
and thinking about what to eat.

345
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
I think

346
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
we've been like this

347
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,040
many times.

348
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Yang Qiao Xi.

349
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Why did I just find out

350
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
that you usually

351
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
have a lot of

352
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
things in your head?

353
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
It's much better than I thought.

354
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
I want to turn these fantasies

355
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
into real.

356
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,660
I'll take this.

357
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
Okay.

358
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
Linda.

359
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,660
I...

360
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
I won't keep you waiting.

361
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
Even if I continue to study in Kangdai,

362
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660
I will be back to Hongyang

363
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,660
to find you soon.

364
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,280
I'm done.

365
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
You must be quick

366
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
to run to the supermarket.

367
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,280
You...

368
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,280
want to buy it?

369
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,280
Let's go.

370
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,280
If you want to buy it, then buy it.

371
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,280
What?

372
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
You think

373
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
I don't know?

374
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
It's okay.

375
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,280
I...

376
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
I can understand.

377
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
I'll go.

378
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280
I...

379
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Are you serious?

380
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
I...

381
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
saw it all.

382
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
There's smoke on your window.

383
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
You're smoking, right?

384
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
It's okay.

385
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
My dad used to smoke, too.

386
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Then he quit because of my mom.

387
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
He sent you to eat chewing gum.

388
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Here.

389
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,900
Here.

390
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
You don't usually smoke much.

391
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
You'll quit soon.

392
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
This feels good.

393
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Let's start.

394
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,900
I'm sorry.

395
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
I'm embarrassed.

396
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
I'm coming.

397
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,900
I'm sorry.

398
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
The sun shines

399
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,900
warmly on her

400
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Open your eyes and smile

401
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Prince rides the white horse

402
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
Looking at the sky

403
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,900
The clouds are not talking

404
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,900
Quietly

405
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,900
waiting for her answer

406
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
Day and night

407
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
The gentle light

408
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,520
covers her face

409
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,520
She's shy

410
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
and hides behind the curtain

411
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
The blue sky

412
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
is lying in the grass

413
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
She stops by

414
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
and listens to me

415
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
The blue sky

416
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
is lying in the grass

417
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
She stops by

418
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,520
and listens to me

419
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
The blue sky

420
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
is lying in the grass

421
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
The blue sky

422
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
is lying in the grass

423
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
The blue sky

424
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
is lying in the grass

425
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,360
That's a surprise!

426
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,020
Hey,

427
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,040
why are you doing this without after?

428
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,900
My arm...

429
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,600
Here you are.

430
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,760
Will we have dinner together later?

431
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah.

432
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,900
Lin.

433
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,000
Hey, asidefrom you,

434
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,160
I've treated you unfairly preparing up for the whole time.

435
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,840
Bye.

436
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,400
You really want to hear it?

437
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,120
I'm afraid you'll cry.

438
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,760
She's miserable.

439
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,440
No, no, no.

440
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,240
I don't believe you can make me cry.

441
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,640
I'm a very tough person.

442
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,400
You tell me.

443
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,200
Wait, wait.

444
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,160
Don't be fooled by her.

445
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,440
It's easy to cry.

446
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
So, do you want to talk about it?

447
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,240
Yes.

448
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,960
Let me tell you.

449
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,720
She was so stupid when she first came here.

450
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,280
She thought we were all very complicated here.

451
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,320
She insisted on making herself look like a tough guy.

452
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,120
The scar on her head.

453
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,200
She wanted to make herself look good.

454
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,360
She kept her head up every day.

455
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,480
She thought she was not easy to bully when she saw the scar.

456
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,760
Why are you saying everything?

457
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,280
She's really funny.

458
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,960
Look at her.

459
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,760
When I saw you,

460
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,920
I was so annoyed.

461
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,360
You were so rich

462
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,800
and you even had a big family.

463
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,400
If my dad didn't like you,

464
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,920
I would kick you out.

465
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,720
At that time.

466
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,840
Look at Ying.

467
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,520
You were so rich

468
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,240
and rich.

469
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,400
Ying took you in.

470
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,280
He was so nice to you.

471
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,440
I'm not rich.

472
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,880
You must be talking nonsense.

473
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,080
Cherry, I'm a rent worker.

474
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,640
You have to pay rent

475
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,200
and kick her out when she can't afford it.

476
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,800
Right?

477
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,920
I helped her

478
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,880
not because of this.

479
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,640
Why?

480
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
They say

481
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,080
men can't bear to see women cry.

482
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Actually, men can't bear to see men cry.

483
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,760
That night,

484
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
she was playing Titanic.

485
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,000
She cried.

486
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,760
Yes, that's right.

487
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,400
Titanic is easy to cry.

488
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,600
But people usually cry

489
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
when they see Jack's ship.

490
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,520
She didn't.

491
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,600
She cried

492
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,560
when she promised

493
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,280
Rose and Jack

494
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,680
to live a good life.

495
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,400
That was the most hopeful part.

496
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,040
But she cried so badly.

497
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,960
I think

498
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,320
this little boy

499
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960
is actually very pitiful.

500
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,520
Then I'll just

501
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
wait for a while.

502
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,880
Ying,

503
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,120
I'll give you a toast.

504
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,600
Thank you for taking care of Jack

505
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,880
for the past two years.

506
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,080
You're welcome.

507
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,800
Don't spit it out.

508
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,520
I'm full.

509
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,320
You've been hiding it for a long time.

510
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,240
It's not cheap.

511
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,160
How is it? Is it good?

512
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,160
It's...

513
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,320
It's so spicy.

514
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,240
Stop drinking.

515
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,160
It's too hot.

516
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,440
Here.

517
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,200
I'll add some ice.

518
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,800
Ying,

519
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,880
I came to Hong Kong

520
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,080
and drank a lot of good wine.

521
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,640
I drank wine with Jiang Xiaoxi's cousin.

522
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,960
And your whiskey.

523
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,920
Both are good and expensive.

524
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,720
But

525
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,000
I can't get used to it

526
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,760
no matter how I drink.

527
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,880
Why do I like drinking?

528
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,080
You can't drink

529
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,360
after giving birth.

530
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,880
Actually, Ying

531
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,880
can't help drinking.

532
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,680
Not everyone is like Vincent.

533
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,160
He's loved by a good girl like you.

534
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,240
Ying is loved by everyone.

535
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,720
So he drinks.

536
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,280
Who believes you?

537
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,000
Jiang Xiaoxi said you're very flowery.

538
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,360
You're just acting.

539
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,160
You're not a loser.

540
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,320
I'm not good to them.

541
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,120
They're not good to me either.

542
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,960
It's fair.

543
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,760
Come on, let's eat.

544
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,600
Don't be sad.

545
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,520
You'll meet someone

546
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:31,920
who's really like you.

547
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,200
Don't be sad for him.

548
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,200
You believe him, too.

549
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,920
He has a building.

550
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,200
And he has land in Luoma.

551
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,360
He counts the land and the sun

552
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,400
every day at home.

553
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,680
You don't understand.

554
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
The sun sets when the clouds are gone.

555
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,480
The sky is dark when the sky is dark.

556
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
These things

557
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,760
are not worth it.

558
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,720
You can have it if you don't have it.

559
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,800
It's not easy for you to get here.

560
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,840
Cherish each other.

561
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,640
You're the lucky ones.

562
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,840
Jiang Xiaoxi.

563
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,960
Tao.

564
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,440
Jiang Xiaoxi.

565
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,960
Why did you come to Yun Tao?

566
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,920
Are you a drug addict?

567
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,600
I just thought

568
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
you wouldn't answer me like this

569
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
tomorrow.

570
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,520
I want to call you by your name.

571
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,240
Yun Tao.

572
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,560
Do you know

573
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,720
what I'm thinking

574
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,000
when I hear you call me by my name?

575
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,840
You're thinking

576
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,200
why Yun Tao's voice

577
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,280
sounds so good?

578
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,200
I don't have a taste.

579
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,800
Yun Tao.

580
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
All these years,

581
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,560
I've always wanted to prove myself.

582
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,120
I'm Jiang Xiaoxi.

583
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,120
Before,

584
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,320
I tried to

585
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,720
be silent,

586
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,440
give up math,

587
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,480
and the treasure box.

588
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,600
Even...

589
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,800
I even tried that

590
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,240
to prove that I'm Jiang Xiaoxi.

591
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,000
But now I suddenly realize

592
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,960
I have to call you by your name.

593
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,840
I've already existed.

594
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,160
Hello.

595
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,320
Qianyue.

596
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,520
I...

597
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,600
I'm in Hong Kong.

598
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,320
I know.

599
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,640
I...

600
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,920
I found Jiang Xiaoxi.

601
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,360
I know that too.

602
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,400
Lin Yun Tao.

603
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,200
Lin Yun Tao.

604
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,840
It's 3 a.m. now.

605
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,680
I...

606
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,440
I know.

607
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,640
How do you feel now?

608
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,880
Happy or not?

609
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,080
I don't know

610
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,520
if I'm happy or not.

611
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,800
I just feel...

612
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,000
I feel that I'm different from before.

613
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,000
But nothing has changed.

614
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,160
Didn't you call for nothing?

615
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,600
No.

616
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,200
It's just that

617
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,240
I suddenly realized a secret.

618
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,320
It's that kind of...

619
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,480
I used to see some adults on the road

620
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,320
and feel that they have some common secrets.

621
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,960
But now,

622
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,560
I also know that secret.

623
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,080
You're so ungrateful, Lin Yun Tao.

624
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,560
How can you know this secret before me?

625
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,160
I...

626
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,160
I told you the first time.

627
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,840
You're still so happy.

628
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,360
What should I do, Lin Yun Tao?

629
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,960
You said that

630
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,360
I'm a little scared.

631
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,440
You're scared, too, Tou Xia.

632
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,320
I'm a girl, too.

633
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,480
I'm scared, too.

634
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,840
Don't be scared.

635
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,440
It's just that

636
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
you have to find the person you like.

637
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,040
When you're with the person you like,

638
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,360
you won't feel scared.

639
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,040
This ceremony has been vaulted now!

640
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,320
I need to pack this and go

641
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,380
Remember this.

642
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,800
This is our third topic so I'll keep it in mind at all times.

643
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,640
You!

644
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,340
We have to complete these two topics all together.

645
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,340
I'm sorry to disturb you.

646
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,600
I know, right?

647
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,440
I'm sorry.

648
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
You really

649
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,640
don't need me to send you to the airport?

650
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,840
I don't want you to send me.

651
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,360
Because I don't want you

652
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,960
to come back from the airport alone.

653
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,840
I want you to pick me up at the airport.

654
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,360
Then I'll feel

655
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,000
that I'm picking up Ling Yintao.

656
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,760
Instead of seeing the airport,

657
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,280
I'm sending Ling Yintao back here.

658
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Don't cry.

659
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Don't be like this.

660
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,920
I really want to cry too.

661
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,600
Why don't we find a place

662
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,080
to cry for me?

663
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,280
Jiang Xiaoxi.

664
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,360
You said you'd come back for me.

665
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,320
You said it.

666
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,920
I... I'll wait for you.

667
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,360
I'll wait for you.

668
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,240
You promised me.

669
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,920
You promised me.

670
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
I promise you.

671
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,960
I'll definitely find you.

672
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,360
You promise?

673
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
I promise.

674
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:59,400
The wind in my mind

675
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,400
The scenery in the past

676
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Jiang Xiaoxi.

677
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,880
I like you very much.

678
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
You know it.

679
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,560
You're the key to who I am

680
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,240
Be with me and become myself

681
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,600
I like you very much too.

682
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,120
The night sky is long

683
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,640
Besides,

684
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,640
my dream is

685
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,680
to be an excellent teacher.

686
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,640
Whether it's a kindergarten teacher,

687
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,360
elementary school or middle school teachers,

688
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,240
it's all good.

689
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,440
I want to use my own strength

690
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,480
to let my students

691
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,880
gain more knowledge

692
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,320
and let them know themselves.

693
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Accept themselves.

694
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
Know the future.

695
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,400
Know your direction.

696
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,880
I won't be embraced and melted.

697
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,520
I'm always here.

698
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,680
What about you?

699
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,400
What do you want to do?

700
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,880
In the past,

701
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,480
I wanted to give up math

702
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,080
and leave my parents.

703
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,800
But now,

704
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,200
especially after

705
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,800
what happened to my brother's family,

706
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,480
I want to be a financial person.

707
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,800
I know the financial world

708
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,400
can drag a person down

709
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,320
and destroy a person.

710
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,120
But you're with me.

711
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,680
I'm not afraid.

712
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,760
I must be a person

713
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,600
who can drag others down.

714
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,360
Go ahead.

715
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,360
Do what you want to do.

716
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,840
I want you to be yourself.

717
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,400
I'll be myself too.

718
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,360
Although we

719
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,120
may not be together

720
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,800
on our own way,

721
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,520
as long as we know

722
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,680
we like each other,

723
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,760
the distance is not a problem.

724
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,840
Nothing will change, right?

725
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,760
I don't have your news anyway.

726
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,800
I've been waiting for you for two years.

727
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,800
In the future,

728
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,040
there will be no worse situation.

729
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,840
We will be better in the future.

730
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,280
So do what you want to do.

731
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,040
Stay in Hong Kong.

732
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,520
That's the story.

733
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,800
Jiang Yao Xi said

734
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,960
she would come to us immediately.

735
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,760
You're so nice.

736
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,760
So,

737
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
at the end of the story,

738
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,160
the prince and the princess

739
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,720
are happily living together?

740
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,520
Right.

741
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,960
The princess is still in Hong Kong.

742
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,480
But the prince who saved her

743
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,320
is going back to Hong Kong to study.

744
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,040
No one knows

745
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,760
what the future will be like.

746
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
It doesn't matter.

747
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,840
Didn't the princess say

748
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,200
she would come to you in the future?

749
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,360
Moreover,

750
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,200
the princess who can share her birthday wish

751
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,360
with others

752
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,760
is definitely not a bad princess.

753
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,280
The story of a good princess

754
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,000
is a good ending.

755
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,400
The princess who can share her birthday wish

756
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,480
with others

757
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,640
is definitely not a bad princess.

758
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,520
Yu Qiao,

759
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,320
I'm back from Hong Kong.

760
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,360
I brought you the Leipon sunglasses.

761
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,840
I wanted to buy it for you.

762
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
But in the end,

763
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,840
it was Jiang Yao Xi's money.

764
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,480
She said she wanted to thank you.

765
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,240
Yu Qiao,

766
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,160
thank you very much.

767
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,760
Are you busy now?

768
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,040
Do you want me to send it to you?

769
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,280
Yin Tao, thank you.

770
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,320
I'm still preparing for the exam.

771
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,280
I'm going to have an interview in Canada soon.

772
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,440
I don't have much time.

773
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,680
Tell Jiang Yao Xi

774
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,240
that one pair of sunglasses is not enough.

775
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,120
Tell her to come to Hong Kong

776
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,480
and bring sunglasses to me

777
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,080
to make a fair offer.

778
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,360
Okay.

779
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,960
I'll tell her.

780
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,840
Thank you.

781
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,560
Thank you.

782
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,480
You two have been busy all day.

783
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,400
Take a break.

784
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,280
See if there's anything I can do.

785
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
I'll help you.

786
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,800
No need, Aunt Shuang Yan.

787
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,160
I don't check these clothes

788
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,400
while walking the line.

789
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,480
I don't know what to do.

790
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,240
I'm worried about sending it out.

791
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,120
Besides,

792
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,600
my dad finally found

793
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,800
something he likes to do.

794
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,800
He's not happy

795
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
if you let him go.

796
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,760
Shuang Yan,

797
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,560
this thing

798
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,960
can talk to customers

799
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,320
from all over the country.

800
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,680
It's interesting.

801
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,520
Yin Tao?

802
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,000
Yin Tao sent you a message.

803
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,960
Yin Tao sent you a message?

804
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,120
Yin Tao

805
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,680
found Qiao Xi?

806
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,120
Yes.

807
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,360
Jiang Qiao Xi hid from him

808
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,560
and went to Hong Kong.

809
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,920
He still got him out.

810
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,960
Well,

811
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,760
Yin Tao and Qiao Xi,

812
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,800
are they...

813
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,760
Aunt Shuang Yan,

814
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,920
it's what you think.

815
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,520
They're just good-looking.

816
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,160
What about you?

817
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,400
Dad,

818
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,840
I'm not interested in this.

819
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,240
Yu Qiao...

820
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,240
Dad, what are you talking about?

821
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,240
The most important thing for me now

822
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,120
is to buy a car.

823
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,360
What?

824
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Buy a car?

825
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,920
Yes, buy a car.

826
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,280
Why do you think about that?

827
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,720
Cars are so expensive now.

828
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,880
You don't even have a driver's license.

829
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,640
I'll get a driver's license.

830
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,640
I'll try my best to buy a car,

831
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,680
no matter how expensive it is.

832
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,640
I just want to buy

833
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,800
my favorite car.

834
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,680
As long as I drive this car,

835
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,640
everyone will know

836
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,040
that I'm a great person.

837
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,560
I just want to

838
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,880
hold the steering wheel in my own hands.

839
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,320
I'll drive a long way

840
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
with my favorite song

841
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,120
to see many beautiful scenery.

842
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,440
I want to be you on my rich driving history.

843
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
I want to be Yin Tao.

844
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,480
I want to be Cai Fang Yan.

845
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,640
I can also be Yu Qiao.

846
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,720
Of course, I want to be Aunt Shuang Yan.

847
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,520
I just want to take the people I like

848
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,680
to every corner of the world.

849
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,480
Jiang Yang Xi, I'm here.

850
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,600
How long have you been waiting for me?

851
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,400
Just a while.

852
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,600
I was stopped by the junior girls

853
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
on the corridor.

854
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,160
Do you miss me a lot today?

855
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,640
Of course I miss you.

856
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,600
I miss you too.

857
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,720
I miss you so much.

858
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
What's wrong, Yin Tao?

859
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,320
I miss you so much.

860
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,280
When I come back,

861
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,000
I'll take you to the amusement park.

862
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,920
Jiang Yang Xi.

863
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,600
I just woke up.

864
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,400
There are too many people in the bathroom.

865
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,720
I also feel so lonely.

866
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,240
Because I'm not aware of my scene

867
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,600
But here in the opposite lane,

868
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,800
I'm always by your side

869
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,960
That's the beauty of the呵呵

870
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,320
The grandpa I met right before

871
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,240
I'm still watering the flowers

872
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,480
Were you upset when I took a picture?

873
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,320
I'm just saying

874
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,880
when I break the glass

875
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,160
Isn't there something Guess יא approved

876
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,400
Now, why do I even steal your sauce?

877
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,640
Maybe if you spit it later

878
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,720
She's correct.

879
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,160
I did?

880
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,200
Yes.

881
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,280
If she really did,

882
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,520
that means she must have drawn a picture that

883
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,840
But dear friend, I have you, that's enough.

884
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,360
You are my firewood.

885
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,520
You used to sing this song with me.

886
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,280
In the distance.

887
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,320
guru

888
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,440
I lots of letters

889
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,720
Mom is in Li Li

890
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,920
Li Li

891
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,800
Li Li

892
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,120
can't wait to burn St Tutu
