Episode 5

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,200
Love with Princess

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Episode 18

4
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Lin Qi Le, what did you dream about?

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Lin Qi Le

6
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Ms. Yang, wipe the table with some water

7
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,600
Lin Qi Le, wake up

8
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Lin Qi Le

9
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,600
What's wrong?

10
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
Mr. Wang asked you to go to his office

11
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
Your mom is here

12
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
Lin Qi Le, mom

13
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,200
You really have to take care of this kid

14
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,800
I'm a good girl

15
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
Why don't you focus on studying?

16
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,600
This is the first year of high school

17
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,000
How many days have you been in school?

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How many days are left before the college entrance examination?

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You still write letters in class

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,200
Several teachers have responded to me

21
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,000
At this stage,

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,800
no one is active in studying

23
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,600
Parents should be more active

24
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,400
Mr. Wang is right

25
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,200
I will trouble you in the future

26
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
I'll go back today

27
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Ok

28
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Keep in touch if we have anything

29
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Mr. Wang, don't see me off

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
Ok

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,200
Thank you

32
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Let's go

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,200
Yin Tao, if you still want to write those letters

34
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,800
you can write at home

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,200
I don't think

36
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,800
there is anything wrong with writing letters

37
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
But if it's in class

38
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,200
it will affect the teacher's management

39
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I think you should write at home

40
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
I think you should write at home

41
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Mom

42
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,200
I am a very strange kid

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,600
I will always let you and dad worry

44
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,000
Sorry, baby

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
You originally

46
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,000
should be with friends

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
But now

48
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
alone

49
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,400
staying in the skirt

50
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,600
Who do you think I am?

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,160
What are you talking about?

52
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,840
What Gu Lingling?

53
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,120
I have my mom,

54
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,160
I have my dad,

55
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,520
and I have the whole Qun Mountain.

56
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
I think I can't leave you guys at all.

57
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,640
And I want to be the last guardian of Qun Mountain.

58
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,680
Really?

59
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,680
Yes.

60
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Yun Tao.

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,040
You're growing up.

62
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,320
Growing up is a process of elimination.

63
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,880
If you keep yourself trapped in the past,

64
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,720
you will be obsessed.

65
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,160
People are fluid.

66
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,440
Emotions are also fluid.

67
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,720
You keep yourself trapped in the past.

68
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,120
Of course you will be unhappy.

69
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,440
What if a person

70
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,160
completely let go of the past?

71
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,840
It's like nothing happened.

72
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,200
Does it mean that he is doing well?

73
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,120
I don't know if he is doing well.

74
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,920
But mom knows

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,680
that Yun Tao is not doing well.

76
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,720
Those letters,

77
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,280
you have to send them out.

78
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,600
The letters that are left with you

79
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
are the end.

80
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,320
Jiang Qiaoxi,

81
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,400
the construction site is almost finished.

82
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,280
These three water tower

83
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,800
are no longer cold at night.

84
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,440
Sometimes I think

85
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,520
if you go back to Qun Mountain at night

86
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,200
and don't see the lights of the three water tower,

87
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
will you get lost?

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,400
Jiang Qiaoxi,

89
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,600
a bunch of red is so sweet.

90
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
I want to keep some for you every time.

91
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
If one day

92
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,000
we meet in the summer,

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I will bring a bunch of red to see you.

94
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
Jiang Qiaoxi,

95
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,200
Jiang Qiaoxi,

96
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,200
we haven't seen each other for five years.

97
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Are you okay?

98
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,000
Chunlu died a few days ago.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,800
We agreed that

100
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
she is your daughter.

101
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,200
So I thought

102
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,000
I needed to write a letter to tell you.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,400
I buried her in the mountain top

104
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,600
where we went to see the sunset together.

105
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
You are the sunset.

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,400
So

107
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,000
she can be with me forever.

108
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Jiang Qiaoxi

109
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,600
Hello?

110
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,000
Lin Yitang, it's me.

111
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Qin Yiyuan?

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why did you call me so early?

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,800
Lin Yitang,

114
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,000
did you write a big letter

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,800
to Jiang Qiaoxi?

116
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,000
How do you know?

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Didn't I tell you

118
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,600
not to contact her again?

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Why?

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
She still doesn't have time.

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
She doesn't even have time to read the letter.

122
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
It doesn't matter if she is busy.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,600
She is her, you are you.

124
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,200
Don't think about her anymore.

125
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,400
Don't mention her.

126
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,600
Tell her the truth.

127
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,200
You can't...

128
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,000
What truth?

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,200
Qin Yiyuan,

130
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
what's going on?

131
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,600
Did something happen?

132
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,800
Don't ask.

133
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,000
Anyway, don't contact her again.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,600
Don't.

135
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,600
It's not you.

136
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,600
Qin Yiyuan

137
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,000
Qin Yiyuan

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,400
Qin Yiyuan

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,000
Qin Yiyuan

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,800
Qin Yiyuan

141
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
Qin Yiyuan

142
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
Qin Yiyuan

143
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,800
Qin Yiyuan

144
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,400
Qin Yiyuan

145
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,200
Qin Yiyuan

146
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,000
Qin Yiyuan

147
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,800
Qin Yiyuan

148
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
Qin Yiyuan

149
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,400
Qin Yiyuan

150
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
Qin Yiyuan

151
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Qin Yiyuan

152
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Qin Yiyuan

153
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Qin Yiyuan

154
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Qin Yiyuan

155
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Qin Yiyuan

156
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,400
Jiang Qiaoxi

157
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,000
Jiang Qiaoxi

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,400
Jiang Qiaoxi

159
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
Jiang Qiaoxi

160
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,600
You must write to me.

161
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,400
You must write to me.

162
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,800
Hello.

163
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll be back in a few days.

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,400
Hello.

165
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,800
I'll be back in a few days.

166
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,400
I know.

167
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
No matter how brave I am,

168
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,200
I can't find wings.

169
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Memories are floating in the air.

170
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Passing through the window of time.

171
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,400
The shade of summer is still bright.

172
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm in the distance.

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,400
The wish you said

174
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,600
is getting longer.

175
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
Outside the line, your outline is gentle.

176
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,200
Miss.

177
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Miss.

178
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,000
You're not driving?

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,800
I'll give you the orange peel.

180
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Orange peel.

181
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,200
Thank you.

182
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,400
The breeze is in my mind.

183
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,600
The scenery in the waterfall

184
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,000
is like yesterday's morning.

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,600
In front of reality, the future is like a butterfly.

186
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,000
It hurts.

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,400
It hurts.

188
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,000
It hurts.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,400
It hurts.

190
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,800
It hurts.

191
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,400
It hurts.

192
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,200
What the hell is this place?

193
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,200
Did you hear that?

194
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,400
Did Xiao Qiao Xi really go to Mount Shun before?

195
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,000
I heard that she was found in Hong Kong.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,600
She didn't go to Mount Shun.

197
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,400
I'm not sure.

198
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,200
It's said that a girl gave her a letter of blessing.

199
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
You're spreading the news.

200
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,600
Aren't you afraid that Xiao Qiao Xi will be angry?

201
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,000
Who knows?

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,600
Yu Qiao and Fei Ling De were fighting in the class.

203
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,400
That's right.

204
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,000
I heard that

205
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,400
Xiao Qiao Xi has been from Hong Kong to Hong Kong for 11 years.

206
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,600
Fei Ling De and Yu Qiao Xi are from Hong Kong.

207
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
That's right.

208
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
They were fighting in the class.

209
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,400
I heard that they were fighting in Hong Kong.

210
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,200
Sorry miss.

211
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Sorry miss, sorry.

212
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,000
Yu Qiao.

213
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,320
I heard someone calling Yu Qiao at school.

214
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,520
Who?

215
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,600
A girl.

216
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,880
Her voice sounds like a cherry.

217
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,600
Cherry?

218
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,720
You must have heard it wrong.

219
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,840
How could the cherry be here?

220
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,280
The teacher is here.

221
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,000
Let's go.

222
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,560
Hey,

223
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,320
why don't you wear our school uniform?

224
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,200
Are you not from our school?

225
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,280
I'm from the 11th grade.

226
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,520
11th grade?

227
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm here for a friend.

228
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,200
You're not here to find Jiang Qiao Xi, are you?

229
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,280
You're that cherry?

230
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,200
What's your relationship with Jiang Qiao Xi?

231
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,880
Did you really write that letter?

232
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,000
Forget it.

233
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
Why are you still at school?

234
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,600
Oh my god.

235
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,840
She's here.

236
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,600
It means she really knows Jiang Qiao Xi.

237
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,880
Jiang Qiao Xi.

238
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,920
Jiang Qiao Xi is here.

239
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,000
Chen Xiao Man is here, too.

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,840
Jiang Qiao Xi.

241
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,440
Jiang Qiao Xi.

242
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,240
That person

243
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,760
is really here to find you.

244
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,600
He really doesn't want to

245
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,680
cause you so much trouble.

246
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,520
It's none of your business.

247
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,160
You don't have to solve

248
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,480
any of the problems.

249
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,320
But he...

250
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,040
I don't know him.

251
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,000
Then...

252
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,680
Then who is he?

253
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,880
I don't know him.

254
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,320
He probably doesn't want to

255
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,360
have anything to do with this girl.

256
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,800
Jiang Qiao Xi doesn't know him.

257
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,520
He's just not a person.

258
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,800
He doesn't like to lie.

259
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,840
He's really a liar.

260
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,600
He's really a liar.

261
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
He's really a liar.

262
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,320
He's a liar.

263
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,120
He's a liar.

264
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,000
He's a liar.

265
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,880
He's a liar.

266
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,920
He's a liar.

267
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
He's a liar.

268
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,840
Miss Li An.

269
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,640
You can't do this.

270
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,360
Get down.

271
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,600
Get down. What are you doing?

272
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,400
That...

273
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,840
That guy is really something.

274
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,240
Miss.

275
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,240
You...

276
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,360
You didn't do well in the exam.

277
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,960
Or did you have a fight with your family?

278
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,280
Get down. Get down.

279
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,040
Kid.

280
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,560
Hurry.

281
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,680
I'll hold you. Hurry.

282
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,960
Hurry. Get down.

283
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,520
Get down.

284
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,760
Why is this kid so stubborn?

285
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,680
Get down.

286
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,800
How tall are you?

287
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
How tall are you?

288
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
How tall are you?

289
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,720
How tall are you?

290
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
How tall are you?

291
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
How tall are you?

292
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,000
How tall are you?

293
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,800
Hurry.

294
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,800
Hurry.

295
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,120
Slow down.

296
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,520
I didn't want to jump.

297
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:35,960
Hurry.

298
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,280
Hurry.

299
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
I didn't want to jump.

300
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,720
Be careful.

301
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
Look. How tall are you?

302
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,280
I'm really fine.

303
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,520
How dare you?

304
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,320
This kid.

305
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,000
Where's your family?

306
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,880
Wait.

307
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,320
Come.

308
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,200
Pour the water first.

309
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,520
The drink is cold.

310
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,000
Here.

311
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Drink some hot water.

312
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,600
Thank you.

313
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,440
It's cold.

314
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,120
Here.

315
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,160
Look at the TV.

316
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,080
It's a good看.

317
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,680
Where can a man

318
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,080
find a man like me?

319
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,360
Okay

320
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,280
I need to focus on the university

321
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,000
I have a lot of trouble

322
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,800
Tell the teacher

323
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,880
I didn't take the competition

324
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,440
Wow

325
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,080
You're so good

326
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,080
Great

327
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,800
Thank you

328
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,000
You lock your heart,

329
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and fall asleep in the clouds.

330
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
If dreams don't leave any traces,

331
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,200
we're just little,

332
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,200
flying over each other.

333
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
But I'm willing

334
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,200
to forget the light as the stars,

335
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
for you.

336
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680
The night is gentle,

337
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
you pretend to walk away.

338
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Your hands are warm,

339
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,680
and you're out of breath.

340
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,680
We're just like the tide,

341
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,680
going through the big waves.

342
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,680
I'll go with you.

343
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,680
You're the reason I step in.

344
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Memories

345
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,680
are like unknown places.

346
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,680
I turn around and look into your eyes.

347
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,160
I'll hold your unspoken love.

348
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,160
You're the reason I still shine.

349
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
The light of the morning

350
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,160
is like a memory.

351
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,160
When I look into your eyes,

352
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,160
I see you.

353
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Jiang Xiaoxi,

354
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
your mom called me.

355
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
She said she'd pick you up.

356
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Have you been following me?

357
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
I felt you were in a bad mood,

358
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,640
so I...

359
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
I won't tell your mom.

360
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
Girl!

361
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Go!

362
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Wait.

363
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Be careful.

364
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,640
Be careful.

365
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Come on.

366
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
And...

367
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Ying!

368
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
Ying!

369
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
How did you get hurt?

370
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Who are you?

371
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
I'm...

372
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
You're injured.

373
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
You're joking.

374
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
How did you get hurt?

375
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Is it serious?

376
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
I'm fine.

377
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,640
I...

378
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,640
I opened my shoelaces.

379
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
You're an adult.

380
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Let me carry you.

381
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,640
You're walking like a baby.

382
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
I'm an adult.

383
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,640
I don't need you to carry me.

384
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,640
Why are you being polite to me?

385
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
One is 1.59 meters,

386
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
the other is 1.60 meters.

387
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
It's uncomfortable to walk like this.

388
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Then close your eyes.

389
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
Don't look.

390
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Lin Hengtao.

391
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,120
You have a runny nose.

392
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
Where?

393
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
Do you remember

394
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
when Xiao Tan said that

395
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
when Xiao Ke'ai got married,

396
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
I gave her a bunch of chocolates.

397
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
I ate them all

398
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
and took out your chocolates

399
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
to show off in front of us.

400
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
The chocolates fell into the ditch.

401
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
Your mom cried for a long time

402
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
and forced her to put you on her face.

403
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Stop talking.

404
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
You're laughing at me.

405
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
You and Cai Fang Yuan

406
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
are like little ghosts.

407
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
When I was a kid,

408
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
I climbed so high

409
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
that I didn't dare to come down.

410
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Wei Yong passed by

411
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
and asked you to call me a ghost.

412
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
Stop talking.

413
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Slow down.

414
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Let's go.

415
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Come on.

416
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
What are you doing?

417
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Help me down.

418
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Let's go.

419
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
I'll walk over there.

420
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
I can't see.

421
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
Let's sit down.

422
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
I can walk by myself.

423
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
I don't need you to carry me.

424
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
We haven't seen each other

425
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
since we were kids.

426
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
We're only a few years older

427
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
than when we were kids.

428
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
You're still trying to

429
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
make it up to me.

430
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
No.

431
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
You can't do it.

432
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Why can't I?

433
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,080
Because some people will be sad.

434
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
You're the one who'll be sad.

435
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,080
Why me?

436
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Your eyes are crying like that.

437
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Who can be sadder than you?

438
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
I'm sorry.

439
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Buy me some water.

440
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
Thank you.

441
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
What?

442
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Just buy some paper and water.

443
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,080
I don't need you to carry me.

444
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,560
I don't need your money.

445
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Take it.

446
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Here.

447
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
Drink some water first.

448
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
Slowly.

449
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Why didn't you ask me

450
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
why I came to the city?

451
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
When you go to my house later,

452
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
what do you want to eat?

453
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
I went to your school today.

454
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
I heard a lot about me.

455
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Shouldn't you tell me

456
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
something?

457
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
About Jiang Xiaoxi.

458
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Ying Kang.

459
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,560
Don't think about Jiang Xiaoxi anymore.

460
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,560
She's not the person

461
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
we knew when we were kids.

462
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Then who is she?

463
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
After coming to the city,

464
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
she has been separating us.

465
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
Just like we've never

466
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
known each other.

467
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Ying Kang.

468
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
We should

469
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
not know her anymore.

470
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
So

471
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
why hasn't she

472
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
contacted me these years?

473
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Every time I asked you about her,

474
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
you said she was studying

475
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
and busy.

476
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
It's Qin Yiyun.

477
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
She said

478
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,560
you girls

479
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
wouldn't let us

480
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
talk about it

481
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
because of these sad things.

482
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
What about that letter?

483
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
What's wrong with that letter?

484
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Why does everyone know about it?

485
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
It was sent by Feiling.

486
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
She is now

487
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
Jiang Xiaoxi's friend.

488
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
Today, I...

489
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Did Jiang Xiaoxi ask her to send it?

490
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Even if it wasn't Jiang Xiaoxi,

491
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
she still agreed to it.

492
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
I met Jiang Xiaoxi today.

493
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
She is much better than before.

494
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,560
But I still recognized her at a glance.

495
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
But she actually

496
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
said she didn't know me

497
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,560
in front of everyone.

498
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
How did she become like this?

499
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Ying Kang.

500
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Didn't you always say

501
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
you saved the city and saved the people?

502
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Just take it as

503
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
we met that Jiang Xiaoxi

504
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
and she was eaten by the city.

505
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
She was eaten.

506
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Even her skin was eaten.

507
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
If my parents knew you were here,

508
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
they would be very happy.

509
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Of course.

510
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Uncle Yu and Aunt Zhang Pin

511
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
liked me the most

512
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
when we were in Qun Mountain.

513
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Of course.

514
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
My mom said she would go to your house

515
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
and steal you from you.

516
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
Come to our house and be our daughter.

517
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
What's wrong?

518
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,520
That's Jiang Xiaoxi's car.

519
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
The one in front is the cadet.

520
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Aunt Liang,

521
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
I won't go up.

522
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
I'll take a taxi back.

523
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
Xiaoman,

524
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
I'll call your parents

525
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
and ask them to pick you up.

526
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
No need, Aunt Liang.

527
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Please don't tell my parents

528
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,520
about this.

529
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,520
I'm very disappointed

530
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
with you today.

531
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
You should

532
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
focus on your study

533
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
when you are so young.

534
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
How can you be with her?

535
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,520
I know, Aunt Liang.

536
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
But I hope

537
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
you don't blame Jiang Xiaoxi.

538
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
I'm sorry.

539
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Aunt Liang,

540
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
I'm sorry.

541
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
I shouldn't have done this.

542
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
We might not

543
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
do this again.

544
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Where is

545
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
the girl

546
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
they are after?

547
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
Who knows?

548
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
That girl is called Chen Xiaoman.

549
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
They say

550
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
she is our class's class's class teacher.

551
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
She is a good student.

552
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Jiang Xiaoxi

553
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
is the best in the class.

554
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,520
She is the second.

555
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Are they close?

556
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,760
I don't know

557
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,760
Jiang Xiaoxi didn't talk to us

558
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
for a long time

559
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,280
She only played with those

560
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,120
who were good at studying

561
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,560
Like that girl?

562
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,600
But there are other people

563
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
and a boy

564
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,600
who are annoying

565
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,400
I heard someone

566
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
wrote a love letter to her

567
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,240
It's a big deal

568
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,760
There are many people

569
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,880
who wrote love letters to Jiang Xiaoxi

570
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,520
But she never

571
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,240
cared about it

572
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,920
I'll send you back

573
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,520
No, no, Aunt Liang

574
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,920
You go back and have a rest

575
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,640
OK

576
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,280
Take care

577
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,800
OK

578
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,120
I'll see you in a moment

579
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,440
So

580
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,360
Jiang Xiaoxi allowed my letter

581
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,720
to travel around

582
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,740
just for

583
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,800
that girl?

584
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,680
Fortunately, this is not so serious

585
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,800
I don't know

586
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Come on.

587
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Li Cheng.

588
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Coming.

589
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
Lin Yitang.

590
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
Lin Yitang.

591
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
Lin Yitang.

592
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,160
You two came too late.

593
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,600
Lin Yitang left.

594
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
Left?

595
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Fine.

596
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Let's go, too.

597
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
You two.

598
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Lin Yitang.

599
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Lin Yitang.

600
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,000
You think we don't know you

601
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
after you changed your horse's trotter?

602
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I knew it.

603
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,600
You didn't know we wouldn't leave.

604
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,000
You two are much better at finding people

605
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
than you were in the past.

606
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
Fine.

607
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
This is the laundry that Qin Yanyun asked me to bring you.

608
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,400
She said she would help her dad with the wedding.

609
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
I won't come over.

610
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,600
How's Uncle Qin's leg?

611
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,000
He can't bear to spend money on going to the hospital.

612
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
He's still practicing.

613
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,800
Does practicing work?

614
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,800
Only the purpose of life is useful.

615
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,200
It's probably a psychological effect.

616
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,400
He said he'll recover soon.

617
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
Okay.

618
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Let's eat.

619
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,400
Okay, I'm done.

620
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Give it to me.

621
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Yintang.

622
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,800
Tell us about the mountain patrol.

623
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
I miss the old days so much.

624
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,000
Did you take down the house?

625
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,400
Almost.

626
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,600
You're not alone in the mountain patrol,

627
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,400
are you?

628
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You don't know

629
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,200
that strawberry field

630
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,600
is still picking strawberries every year.

631
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,000
Sunset Fountain is also open.

632
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,800
And the big tree,

633
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,200
I can't finish eating the flowers

634
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,800
that I pick every spring.

635
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,800
The flowers my mom made

636
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,200
are still in season.

637
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,600
I can't eat them all.

638
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,000
My mom made steamed rice with flowers.

639
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,200
Now I'm the only one eating it.

640
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Don't mention me.

641
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,400
Don't talk about me.

642
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,600
How about you?

643
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Yintang, your parents are here.

644
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,400
Come on.

645
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,200
Sister Qing.

646
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,800
Dad.

647
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,200
You hit me.

648
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,600
I can't lose you.

649
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,400
Look.

650
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,200
What did I say?

651
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,000
Where did you go?

652
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,200
Your parents always look for you.

653
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,000
Right?

654
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,600
You scared us.

655
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,800
It's okay.

656
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,600
It's okay.

657
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,400
The kid is at home.

658
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,200
Where can he go?

659
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,000
Right?

660
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,600
Right?

661
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,400
We can ask Lin.

662
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Right?

663
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,800
Sit down, Haifeng.

664
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,600
Sit down.

665
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,400
Sit down.

666
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Put the bag down.

667
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,200
Sorry.

668
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,400
I'll tell you next time.

669
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,400
I've decided.

670
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
What?

671
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Yintang,

672
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,000
you must transfer to the middle school next semester.

673
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,400
Yintang, listen to Uncle Cai.

674
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,600
We won't live with our parents.

675
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
You can transfer.

676
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,400
You can go to school with Yunqiao.

677
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,000
That's great.

678
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,800
Lin, listen to our advice.

679
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,800
Our project

680
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,400
will be over in a year.

681
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,800
Right, Haifeng.

682
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,400
You know that

683
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,200
Yintang likes to be with everyone

684
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,800
and have fun.

685
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
I don't believe that

686
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,200
he can have fun

687
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,600
by himself.

688
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,200
I can have fun wherever I am, Aunt Zhang.

689
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Yintang,

690
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,200
you don't have to be so sensible.

691
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,000
Right.

692
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,400
You grew up watching us.

693
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,400
Even if your parents don't tell you,

694
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,600
we'll arrange for you

695
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
to go to school.

696
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
Right.

697
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,800
If Manager Jiang is here today,

698
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,400
he can help you

699
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
to get your house done.

700
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,600
No hurry.

701
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,200
He knew you two were coming.

702
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,800
He wanted to see you.

703
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
But he had something to do.

704
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,400
Qiao Xi

705
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,600
ran out with a girl in the class.

706
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,800
Qiao Xi?

707
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,200
She was caught by Lin Hongwei.

708
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Right.

709
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,000
Come on.

710
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
It's okay.

711
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,200
Slow down.

712
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,600
Where are you taking me?

713
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,800
Du Shang, can you hurry up?

714
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Yintang is on the road.

715
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,000
Slow down.

716
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yes, I'm taking her.

717
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,200
Slow down.

718
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
Lin Yintang,

719
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
are you too heavy?

720
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,800
I'm heavy?

721
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Li Qing,

722
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,600
you're dragging Du Shang down?

723
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,200
What are you doing?

724
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
You're climbing the park at night.

725
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,000
You'll know when you get in.

726
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,600
What should we do?

727
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Come on, Yintang.

728
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,400
What the hell are we doing?

729
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
I can go up by myself.

730
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Be careful.

731
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Not bad.

732
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,600
It's a good thing.

733
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Come on.

734
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,800
Don't touch me.

735
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
Be careful.

736
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Hurry up.

737
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Go.

738
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
What are you doing?

739
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,200
Yintang,

740
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,600
the cliff stopped us when we were kids.

741
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,000
We've been climbing the mountain for so long,

742
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,400
but we didn't see the big white geese you miss.

743
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Today, I'll show you these geese.

744
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,800
Just take them as big white geese.

745
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,000
Yintang, look.

746
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
That geese is the bravest.

747
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,200
It loves to show off.

748
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,400
We all think

749
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,000
it's the same as you when you were a kid.

750
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,600
Right?

751
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Let's go.

752
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Let's go.

753
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,400
I'm sorry.

754
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
What?

755
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,400
We didn't eat you.

756
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
Yintang,

757
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,200
come to the province.

758
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,600
You don't need us.

759
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,400
We need you.

760
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,800
No.

761
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Can you not be so rude?

762
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,600
I hate you.

763
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,400
Yintang,

764
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
we've done enough.

765
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,400
Come on.

766
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
You're so annoying.

767
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,000
Stop crying, Yintang.

768
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,800
What's behind you?

769
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,200
There seems to be someone.

770
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Who?

771
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,800
Be careful.

772
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
I'm sorry.

773
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
I love you, Taifang.

774
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
The last one.

775
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Be careful.

776
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
Slow down.

777
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
The last one.

778
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
The last one.

779
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Slow down.

780
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Slow down.

781
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:56,400
Lemon sighting

782
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
Mingtao.

783
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
What are you doing here?

784
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,160
The night watchman told me that you were here.

785
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
I came to see you.

786
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,160
Do we know each other?

787
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,600
I'm sorry, Ming Tao.

788
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Why did you say you didn't know me?

789
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
We had a better solution.

790
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,960
I think that was the best solution.

791
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
The best solution?

792
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,800
So you think that if you don't know me,

793
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,200
you won't let me be in the limelight?

794
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,640
You won't let me be in the limelight?

795
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
You hurt me?

796
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
But you have many ways.

797
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,160
You can tell them that we are friends.

798
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,160
It's the old way.

799
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,960
That letter wasn't a letter of invitation.

800
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,160
It was just a rabbit.

801
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,240
I can't tell you about the situation back then.

802
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Because there was someone else around you.

803
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
It's not convenient to tell, right?

804
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,600
Let's change the route.

805
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,760
What?

806
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,640
Excuse me,

807
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,040
Lakota concentrated on her reading sent 중에.

808
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,640
Thank you.

809
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,600
He said he learned form a lot of China тhe mre.

810
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,400
So he declared that he was the top in my class.

811
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,120
As for me, I recorded the passed the training.

812
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,680
I remember

813
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,160
I took the test for the first time.

814
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,560
It's not convenient, right?

815
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,320
Qiao Xi

816
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,360
seems to have run away

817
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,800
with a female student in the class

818
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,320
Liang Hongfei caught her

819
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:58,280
The sun shines down, it's warm, kiss it

820
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:04,120
Open your eyes and smile, look at yourself on the white horse

821
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,920
Looking at the sky, the distant clouds are not talking

822
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:17,000
Quietly, the car is waiting for her answer

823
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,960
The moonlight is gentle, covering the face

824
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,000
She is shy, hiding in the grass

825
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,520
In the requests for summer solitude,

826
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,400
Sui Sui Nian is lying in the grass

827
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:46,680
She just stopped by me

828
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:54,360
Eh

829
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,720
Nowadays, we variant words

830
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
