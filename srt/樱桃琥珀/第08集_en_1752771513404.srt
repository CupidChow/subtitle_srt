1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,040
usual

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
To love To heal

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I think you did well this time.

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You didn't work hard,

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
but you got the fifth place.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I did.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I really did.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What class are you in?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're in Class 18,

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the middle school of experiment.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's good that you didn't get the first place.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was wrong.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Anyway, I'm very satisfied.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I think it's good.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Right?

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It has nothing to do with

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
working hard or not.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm busy.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's eat.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes, drink the soup first.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It smells good.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What soup?

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Pig brain soup.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I cooked it especially for you.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Eat brain and not brain.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're still like me.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What are you laughing at?

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My parents cooked me pig brain soup

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
because they love me.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm so bad at it.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's good that they didn't hit me.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Ning Tao,

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
don't say that I hit you like your parents.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm the one who was beaten by

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
a man and a woman.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm good.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But I didn't love him this time.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My parents saw the score,

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
saw Yu Qiao,

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and got 15th place.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They thought this test would be hard.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I got the first place

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
without getting the first place.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're so good.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're so proud.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yu Qiao,

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
how did you get the test?

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I heard from others

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that you got the test on purpose.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This is not your level.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
How is that possible?

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Who am I?

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I got the test on purpose.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I just didn't get the test well this time.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When others asked me,

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I made an excuse.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If I didn't say that,

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I would have been embarrassed.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
There are 15 people

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
in the training class.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Three of us are in the whole mountain.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
One fifth of the proportion.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We must study hard.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We can't be embarrassed

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
in the whole mountain.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Do you understand?

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How about this?

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll ask my mom to

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
make more pig's brain soup.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We three can drink it together.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't need it.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll save some for you.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But seriously, Yu Qiao,

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
no matter what happens in the future,

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
we can't do it in school.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Didn't I learn it from you?

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Me?

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I...

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I have so many good things.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You don't want to learn them.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You just want to learn some bad things.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You have

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
so many good things

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
that I can learn from you.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Here.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Give me the paper.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I haven't finished yet.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Who wants yours?

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm so good at this.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yu Qiao,

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
why haven't you finished yet?

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Isn't your physics

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
always good?

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Teacher, I'm checking.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't check. Just hand it over.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Stop writing.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm almost out of breath.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Are you going to find me?

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll send you the letter.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Leave me alone.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll let you hurry up.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay. That's good.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay. Let's go back.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay. Thank you, teacher.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ying Qi Le, Cui Fang Yuan.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Are you still thinking about what to do?

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Are you done?

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll be right back.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hand in your paper.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll take a look.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're so lucky.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Your formula

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
can't be just based on the driver's experience.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You have to use your abstract thinking.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This little ball

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
naturally falls into the spring.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's in contact with the spring.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The spring is compressed.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The spring force is constantly increasing.

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm here.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yin Tao.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yin Tao.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yu Qiao is here.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yu Qiao, help me persuade her.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
She's been there since she came back this afternoon.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
She hasn't moved.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't worry, Ms. Juen Zi.

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Leave it to me.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay. I'll get back to work.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Go by yourself.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What are you doing?

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're fighting with yourself.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't bother me.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you bother me, I'll fight with you.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why are you in a hurry?

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm here to help you.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Help me?

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't learn physics

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
from the beginning.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But I have the experience of success

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to pass it on to you.

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Pass it on.

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But I have a condition.

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Tell me.

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There's a sports meeting soon.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I want to help the basketball game.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What do you think?

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Even if you don't say it,

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll help you persuade her.

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay?

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You can say it.

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But you have to know physics

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
by the word.

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You said you wanted to teach me physics.

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why do you play the balloon?

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Lin Yin Tao.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Your task now

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
is not to let the balloon fall.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You have to help me.

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm here.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm here.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm here.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm here.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't let the balloon fall.

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hold it.

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What are you doing?

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Feel the air resistance.

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Promise to experience the charm of physics.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Are you fooling me?

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Lin Yin Tao,

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
trust me.

175
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If you don't experience it today,

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
you may not be able to do physics tomorrow.

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But as long as you can hold on for 30 minutes

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and don't let the balloon fall to the ground,

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
you have a good chance to solve the problem tomorrow.

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If you don't believe me,

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
go back now.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So magical?

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If I can't solve the problem tomorrow,

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
how many times do I have to play the balloon today?

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How many times do I have to play you tomorrow?

187
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Stop talking.

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Feel it with your heart.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What do you mean?

190
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Just have fun if you want to play together.

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The balloon disturbed you.

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I find you are really boring, Xu Qiao.

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Cai Ling, where are you?

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What are you doing?

195
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm just enjoying myself.

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I just want to play.

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I was just kidding.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Stop.

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Let go.

201
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm just kidding.

202
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm just kidding.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm just kidding.

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What do you mean?

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm just kidding.

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm just kidding.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I just want to play.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm just kidding.

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
What's wrong with Cailing?

210
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,920
What Cailing?

211
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,280
Lin Xingtao, call me.

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,800
I'll call you.

213
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
Why are you laughing?

214
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,720
I've received Cailing three times these days.

215
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,640
I'm still asking.

216
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,480
I didn't sing the song.

217
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,120
How can you blame me?

218
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,800
I called and asked Yin Yeqing.

219
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,960
She said

220
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,080
this is a customized Cailing

221
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,320
by the end user 6019.

222
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,120
Ten yuan per song.

223
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,360
Yu Qiao, you have a grudge with me?

224
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,920
You want to play tricks on me?

225
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,680
Good for you, Yu Qiao.

226
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,960
You're so mean.

227
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,240
Cailing only gives Qin Yinyun.

228
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,280
Not us.

229
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,480
What nonsense?

230
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,800
It must be sent by Yu Jin.

231
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,240
Yu Jin?

232
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,840
You still let Yu Jin play with your phone?

233
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,920
I'm not that good.

234
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,360
Help me cancel it.

235
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:25,640
Don't worry.

236
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,840
It's not much.

237
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,320
Where's your phone?

238
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,160
In my bag.

239
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,720
Here.

240
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Don't be angry.

241
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,560
Yu Jin is so...

242
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,840
He's got it wrong again.

243
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,800
Cancel it.

244
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,000
Cancel what?

245
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,120
He should be reduced to nothing.

246
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,920
Fine.

247
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Reduced to nothing.

248
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,000
Canceled?

249
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,360
Li Ying stron en.

250
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,480
You did it on your own.

251
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:37,440
What's wrong?

252
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,080
Don't say anything.

253
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,680
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,080
New actor!

255
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,840
Please!

256
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,040
Stop running.

257
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Listen to me.

258
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,480
What's there to say?

259
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,400
It's just a joke.

260
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,360
You're really mad at me?

261
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,720
I'm very angry that you're mad at me.

262
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,360
What do you want me to do?

263
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
I'm happy for you.

264
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,360
I'll order a food and drink for you.

265
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
No.

266
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,720
This...

267
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,760
New actor,

268
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,320
our main task now is to learn.

269
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,760
Don't think about those useless things.

270
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,240
What about Jiang Xiao Xi?

271
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,280
She's useless to you too?

272
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,800
Don't be angry.

273
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,040
What does it have to do with you?

274
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
What are you two doing?

275
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,240
Meng.

276
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,720
What's going on?

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,520
Why didn't you wait for us this morning?

278
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,560
You left on your own?

279
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,840
Ying Zi, who's bothering you?

280
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,680
No one's bothering me.

281
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,080
I just miss myself.

282
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,800
How did we get together?

283
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,720
I want to study hard.

284
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,160
Ying Qi Le,

285
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,720
aren't you being too cold-hearted?

286
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,760
How can we just want to study?

287
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,280
You're just being cold-hearted.

288
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,680
I'm just being cold-hearted.

289
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,760
I'm just being cold-hearted.

290
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm just being cold-hearted.

291
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,040
I'm just being cold-hearted.

292
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,160
I'm just being cold-hearted.

293
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,640
You're the one who's affecting me.

294
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm helping you to learn too.

295
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Your help is always the opposite.

296
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,640
That throwing balloon.

297
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,360
I really can't do anything about that throwing balloon.

298
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,520
That's why I came up with that trick.

299
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,480
Stop talking.

300
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,520
I know how to learn.

301
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,800
Just leave me alone.

302
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,400
Especially you, Yu Qiao.

303
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,440
Leave me alone.

304
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,640
What are you doing?

305
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,760
What are you doing?

306
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,600
I'm...

307
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,800
Listen to me.

308
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,640
Listen to me.

309
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Listen to me.

310
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

311
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,560
Sorry. Sorry.

312
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,840
Sorry. Sorry.

313
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,360
I came to school by myself today.

314
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,240
From now on,

315
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,920
I don't plan to have dinner with Yu Qiao and her crew.

316
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,920
My classmates treat me as a bird.

317
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,520
I don't plan to ineffective them, either.

318
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,520
So now,

319
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,120
you're the only person I can have dinner with.

320
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,520
If you lose to Yu Qiao,

321
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,200
you'll be treated like a little child.

322
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,400
From now on,

323
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,240
you'll only get to have dinner with her alone.

324
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,960
Is there any way

325
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,520
that maybe she's murdered by ye Zhang Ye Jiang?

326
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,920
I don't think there's any policy

327
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,360
Who told you to be a actress?

328
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,400
Who told you to make these changes?

329
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,160
Lin Yitang,

330
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
do you think you're so selfless and great?

331
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,960
Do you want to have dinner with me?

332
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,680
You don't want them to laugh at me, do you?

333
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,080
Do you care about me or not?

334
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,800
Look.

335
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,680
Qin Yanyun's Lin Yitang

336
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,000
is so similar to our attitude.

337
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,960
What's wrong with Yitang and Qin Yanyun?

338
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I understand.

339
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
The problem is not about

340
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,480
what we did to offend Lin Yitang.

341
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
It's about her and Qin Yanyun having a fight.

342
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,320
So this is the reason

343
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,160
why you're so careless.

344
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,600
Guys,

345
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,960
this is the application form for our sports meeting.

346
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,400
You should pay more attention

347
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,520
to the project you're working on.

348
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,800
You should have a collective consciousness

349
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,320
to make our class more glorious.

350
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,760
Meng Qi Le,

351
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,840
I didn't expect you to be so active

352
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,600
and sign up for basketball.

353
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,200
I'm looking forward to your performance.

354
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,800
When did I sign up for basketball?

355
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,400
Why did you sign up for basketball?

356
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,200
Who is she?

357
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,400
Meng Qi Le,

358
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,000
she's so good at it.

359
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,480
Why did she still ask me to sign up for basketball?

360
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm afraid she'll be out of the game.

361
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,400
I forgot.

362
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,080
Didn't you say it yourself?

363
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,400
If I don't sign up for the competition,

364
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,600
you can shout for me.

365
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,040
I'll help you.

366
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,640
I...

367
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,480
I don't want to join.

368
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,360
I don't have time. I have to study.

369
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,160
I can't be so bad in the monthly exam next time.

370
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,840
It's a long process.

371
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,600
Don't push yourself too hard.

372
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,240
You'll be out of the game

373
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,600
if you don't sign up for basketball.

374
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,040
Yu Xiao,

375
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,800
please don't interfere with my business again.

376
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,120
Thank you.

377
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,080
Guess who else signed up for basketball?

378
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,600
Who?

379
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,600
Li Jing.

380
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,720
How could she sign up for basketball?

381
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,080
She can dance?

382
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,480
Xiao Man,

383
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,160
why are all your things so special?

384
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,520
I've never seen

385
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,520
this kind of bracelet in my house.

386
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,160
If you like it, I'll bring it for you.

387
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,720
Here.

388
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,160
How could you be so shy?

389
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,960
It must be not cheap.

390
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,120
It's not much.

391
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,480
My dad brought it back to me

392
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,360
when he went abroad.

393
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,880
He often brings this kind of thing back to me.

394
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,320
You can wear it if you like.

395
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Thank you, Xiao Man.

396
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,640
You're always so generous.

397
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,840
It's okay. We're all from the La La Team.

398
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,040
Look.

399
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,800
She's acting like this again.

400
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,880
I know what you mean.

401
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,680
She was from our team last year.

402
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,280
But she's not more than five years older than us.

403
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,480
Mr. Lu, I'm Lin Qi Luo from Class 18.

404
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,120
I don't know if she's a basketball player.

405
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,320
We want to play with her.

406
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
Actually, I'm her classmate.

407
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,200
You're a basketball player.

408
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,920
I don't want to join.

409
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Lin Qi Luo.

410
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,720
I know you.

411
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,120
When we were choosing people,

412
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,720
we considered their body shape.

413
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Your body is small.

414
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,440
You're good at stretching.

415
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,280
Since you're here,

416
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
let's train together.

417
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,680
Sir.

418
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,080
I'm afraid I can't do it.

419
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,080
It's mainly because I've been

420
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,920
slid down in the training ground recently.

421
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,960
Although I've been slid down in the training ground,

422
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,720
I think

423
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,680
I should join the school's group activities.

424
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,960
So I can overcome my psychological fear.

425
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
I can do it.

426
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,760
Okay. I'll go to the training ground.

427
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Do you have a sports suit?

428
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,680
I do.

429
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,440
Okay.

430
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,120
What are you listening to?

431
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
What are you listening to?

432
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,160
Lin Qi Luo has signed up.

433
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,800
She's quite strong.

434
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,360
The free registration project.

435
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,840
As long as the body height and body shape are matched,

436
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,880
you can participate.

437
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,280
Look at these things.

438
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,560
They're all written on the bag.

439
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,080
I'd like to have a 200 yuan

440
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,040
final bodieshaking contest.

441
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,920
Can I 13 ft stand with you later?

442
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,080
If you don't speak, I'll ask you.

443
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,200
It's so difficult.

444
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,480
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

445
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,600
Long, long, what, what.

446
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,720
Come on, step on it.

447
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,360
Step on it.

448
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,760
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

449
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,080
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

450
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,240
Lin Yitong said she didn't want to join.

451
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,560
I knew it.

452
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,200
How could she not

453
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,400
participate in this kind of thing?

454
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,960
She always likes to play the role of a gentleman.

455
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,760
Every time on the first day of the sixth month,

456
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,400
Yintong is the most excited.

457
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,200
I insisted on giving up to Lin Yitong

458
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,680
because I was too shy to face her.

459
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,120
This is because they are related.

460
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
As long as they make up,

461
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,840
we won't be bullied.

462
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:44,040
What, what, what, what.

463
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,680
Yes.

464
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,400
Okay.

465
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,840
What, what.

466
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,600
I'm going to line up today.

467
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,480
Whoever dances best,

468
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,960
I'll choose the one who dances the best.

469
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,080
Teacher, what else do you choose?

470
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,840
It must be our Xiaoman.

471
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,280
Our Xiaoman is in the middle.

472
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,360
Teacher, coach.

473
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,680
Qi Yanyun dances well.

474
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,800
She's pretty.

475
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,280
She can dance well too.

476
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,280
What are you talking about?

477
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,320
Qi Yanyun is quite suitable.

478
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,960
You did well last year.

479
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
But Chen Xiaoman is not bad either.

480
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,840
It depends on your performance.

481
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,320
And everyone should practice hard.

482
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,560
Everyone has a chance.

483
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,120
Today we will train

484
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,680
a group of people to do the drag action.

485
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,480
You guys divide into groups first.

486
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,680
Choose the one who drags and who will be the second.

487
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
You four, right?

488
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,400
I think I can do it.

489
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,800
Qin Yanyun.

490
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,840
Lin Qi Le, you two are in the same group.

491
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,320
Teacher, Lin Qi Le and I are not...

492
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,120
Teacher.

493
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,080
We are in the same group.

494
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
That's not good.

495
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,920
You two can't complete the drag action.

496
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,880
You six are in the same group.

497
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,400
Come on, Wushuang, Han Xiaoxiao, go to this group.

498
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,400
Teacher, Qin Yanyun and I,

499
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,560
Lin Qi Le, they are not very familiar with each other.

500
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,640
What does it have to do with being familiar?

501
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,160
This is a school activity, not a child's home.

502
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,000
Teacher, I mean

503
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,360
Qin Yanyun and I are not very familiar with each other.

504
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,920
We don't even trust each other.

505
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,960
How can I dare to let them pick me up?

506
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,240
Besides, they don't dare to let me pick them up.

507
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,960
If you have so many opinions,

508
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,600
I'll give you a stage and you can dance on your own.

509
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,520
Then I'll dance back and forth.

510
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,920
Can you pick me up?

511
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,960
You dare?

512
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,800
You are so tall and it's quite scary.

513
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,000
What's scary about this?

514
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,280
I can dance well, I'm not afraid of these.

515
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,360
Qin Yanyun, what do you mean?

516
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,520
What do you mean?

517
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,720
Don't you understand?

518
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,360
You have been teaching for nothing for nine years.

519
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,280
All right, all right.

520
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,840
Wushuang, Qin Yanyun,

521
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,240
you two have a good talk.

522
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,480
We are all a group.

523
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,280
I'll make the decision, you two go to that group.

524
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,760
Teacher.

525
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,560
Wushuang, if you have so many opinions,

526
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,360
don't practice. I can't teach you.

527
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,560
Let's go, let's go over there.

528
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:16,980
Look.

529
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,200
There.

530
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
I'm not a good singer.

531
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
I'm not a good singer.

532
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
I'm not a good singer.

533
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,280
I'm not a good singer.

534
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
I'm not a good singer.

535
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
I'm not a good singer.

536
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,280
I'm not a good singer.

537
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
I'm not a good singer.

538
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
I'm not a good singer.

539
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
I'm not a good singer.

540
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
I'm not a good singer.

541
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
I'm not a good singer.

542
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
I'm not a good singer.

543
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
I'm not a good singer.

544
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
I'm not a good singer.

545
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
I'm not a good singer.

546
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,280
I'm not a good singer.

547
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
I'm not a good singer.

548
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
I'm not a good singer.

549
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,280
I'm not a good singer.

550
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
I'm not a good singer.

551
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
I'm not a good singer.

552
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
I'm not a good singer.

553
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
I'm not a good singer.

554
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
I'm not a good singer.

555
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
I'm not a good singer.

556
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
I'm not a good singer.

557
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
I'm not a good singer.

558
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
I'm not a good singer.

559
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,280
I'm not a good singer.

560
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
I'm not a good singer.

561
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
I'm not a good singer.

562
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
I'm not a good singer.

563
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
I'm not a good singer.

564
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
I'm not a good singer.

565
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,280
I'm not a good singer.

566
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
I'm not a good singer.

567
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
There must be something wrong in your head while singing.

568
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
I'm not a good singer.

569
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
I'm not a good singer.

570
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,280
I'm not a good singer.

571
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,280
I'm not a good singer.

572
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,120
I'm fine.

573
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,960
Qin Yanyun.

574
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,640
Are you okay?

575
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,320
Teach me again.

576
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,880
Or they'll be over-confident.

577
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,920
Every time I was up and down,

578
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,240
I couldn't catch up

579
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,320
with my old-timer.

580
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,880
Shouldn't they teach you?

581
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Your four fingers

582
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,960
are like new.

583
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,400
Qin Yanyun.

584
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,720
Yes.

585
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,480
Not bad.

586
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,560
You know Lin Qi Le is not good at skills.

587
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,760
And you're willing to teach him.

588
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,920
Although his tone is not very friendly,

589
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,640
his attitude is worth ignoring.

590
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,200
Teacher.

591
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,040
Yes.

592
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,360
Qin Yanyun was teaching me.

593
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,840
He's not only familiar with his moves,

594
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,920
but also helps me.

595
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,000
He's capable and caring.

596
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,080
He's not only

597
00:25:50,080 --> 00:26:07,660
good at

598
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
good at

599
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
badminton.

600
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Good luck.

601
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Qin Yanyun.

602
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
Do you know

603
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
why I asked you to practice with me

604
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
after school?

605
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
I don't want to know.

606
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Because I want you to go home with me.

607
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,920
Do you know why I promised you

608
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
to practice at night?

609
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
Why?

610
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
I don't want to.

611
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Then your badminton

612
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
won't be a problem to others.

613
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
I...

614
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
I asked you to help me.

615
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
I didn't ask you to torture me.

616
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
You're good at

617
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,920
good at

618
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,920
badminton.

619
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
No.

620
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
How many?

621
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
Only 100.

622
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
Without physical strength,

623
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
you have no power.

624
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
You're good at

625
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
badminton.

626
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Can you see it?

627
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
I have to

628
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
do it better.

629
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Then I can hold you.

630
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
I'll make you fall again.

631
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Don't be so full of yourself.

632
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Even without you,

633
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
there are two other pigs.

634
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
I'm sorry.

635
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Tianming,

636
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
when did you

637
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
hold my dance class?

638
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
You're so good at dancing.

639
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
I've never held it.

640
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
I practiced hard.

641
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
You practiced hard.

642
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
You practiced so hard.

643
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
You can practice so well.

644
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,920
You're so good.

645
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
What's so great about it?

646
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
I'm just a sword.

647
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Even without their things,

648
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
I won't be worse than them.

649
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
I'll be better than them.

650
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
I just want to

651
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
be proud of myself.

652
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Don't worry.

653
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
As your team member,

654
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,920
I will never

655
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
be a drag queen.

656
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
I'm so happy

657
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
to see you.

658
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,920
I'm so happy.

659
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
I'm so happy.

660
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
I'm so happy.

661
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
I'm so happy.

662
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
I'm so happy.

663
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
I'm so happy.

664
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
I'm so happy.

665
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,920
I'm so happy.

666
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
I'm so happy.

667
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
I'm so happy.

668
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
I'm so happy.

669
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
I'm so happy.

670
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
I'm so happy.

671
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,920
I'm so happy.

672
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
I'm so happy.

673
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
I'm so happy.

674
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
I'm so happy.

675
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
I'm so happy.

676
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
I'm so happy.

677
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
I'm so happy.

678
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm so happy.

679
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
I'm so happy.

680
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
I'm so happy.

681
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
I'm so happy.

682
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
I'm so happy.

683
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
I'm so happy.

684
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
I'm so happy.

685
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,440
I'm so happy.

686
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
I'm so happy.

687
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,920
I'm so happy.

688
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
I'm so happy.

689
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
I'm so happy.

690
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
I'm so happy.

691
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
I'm so happy.

692
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,920
You can rappers

693
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
jakus

694
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,400
and smoothly

695
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,920
relish music

696
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,920
为你喝菜

697
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
The time

698
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,920
为坚 decid

699
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,920
不嫌期待

700
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
киん桃

701
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,680
And then?

702
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,080
Then she called me

703
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,600
and asked your number.

704
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,800
Be serious.

705
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,600
She's calling you now.

706
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,040
You didn't answer it.

707
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,000
Hello.

708
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,480
The number you have dialed is busy.

709
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,560
The number you have dialed is busy.

710
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,160
The subscriber you have dialed is busy.

711
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,320
Two, three, four.

712
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,400
Jiang Xiaoxi.

713
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,600
Hello, Yin Tao.

714
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,160
Jiang Xiaoxi.

715
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,120
How are you recently?

716
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,160
I...

717
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,320
I...

718
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Did something happen to you?

719
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,640
I'm fine.

720
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,960
I'm fine recently.

721
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,120
The only problem is

722
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,840
you're not here.

723
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,120
But you'll go back to school.

724
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,200
So...

725
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,360
Nothing wrong.

726
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,440
Don't worry about me.

727
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,200
As long as I don't find it difficult

728
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,120
to do something in school,

729
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,720
I can do anything.

730
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,120
So, how are you doing over there?

731
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,120
As long as you're fine,

732
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
I'm fine.

733
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,560
Jiang Xiaoxi, the light is on.

734
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,400
Jiang Xiaoxi, the light is on.

735
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,640
Can you

736
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,920
call me for a long time?

737
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,280
No.

738
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,840
The light is on.

739
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,560
But I can still talk to you.

740
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,640
Talk about what?

741
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,240
You...

742
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,920
You should rest early.

743
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,640
It's more important to rest.

744
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,960
I hope when we meet again,

745
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,760
we can be together.

746
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,560
I will.

747
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,280
Okay.

748
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,440
Very good.

749
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,320
Not bad.

750
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,680
Very beautiful.

751
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,400
Very good rhythm.

752
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,800
Very good, Lin Qi Le.

753
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,760
You've made great progress.

754
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,800
Xiaoman.

755
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,520
Xiaoman.

756
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,200
Do you want to go to the infirmary?

757
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,920
I'll go to the infirmary.

758
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,280
Are you okay?

759
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,200
I'm fine, teacher.

760
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,640
Lin Qi Le didn't do it on purpose.

761
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,440
No.

762
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,240
You stepped on me just now.

763
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,120
Yes.

764
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,440
I stepped on you.

765
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,440
Sorry, Lin Qi Le.

766
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,880
What do you mean yes?

767
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,600
It's just...

768
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,880
Okay.

769
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,280
Everyone, take a rest.

770
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,120
You two take her to rest over there.

771
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,560
Slow down.

772
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,160
Okay.

773
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,560
Xiaoman.

774
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,720
Are you okay?

775
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,840
I'm fine.

776
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
I hope you don't get hurt later.

777
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,000
Lin Qi Le is too much.

778
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,720
He just praised him once.

779
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,640
He was so impatient to hurt you.

780
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,840
Could it be that

781
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,240
he wants to replace you

782
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,360
and be a martial artist?

783
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,640
No.

784
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,040
I don't know

785
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,240
if he should stay here.

786
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,800
He should leave.

787
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,800
He shouldn't stay here.

788
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,840
He must have been trained

789
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,080
to this extent.

790
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,640
Are you going to quit?

791
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,240
If you quit,

792
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,240
I won't stay here either.

793
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,080
Me too.

794
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,440
I'll go with you, Xiaoman.

795
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,320
You said it.

796
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,840
If you quit,

797
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,240
there will be others.

798
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,120
I can teach Lin Qi Le

799
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,680
and teach others.

800
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,640
Great.

801
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,880
You can also be a leader

802
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,760
for your senior.

803
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,560
Chen Xiaoman.

804
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,920
Don't talk.

805
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,440
I know you won't be angry with me.

806
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,880
I heard it.

807
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,160
Talk to me today.

808
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,360
Don't pretend.

809
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,440
You look so handsome

810
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,680
when you support me today.

811
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,640
I'm sorry.

812
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,200
I'm sorry.

813
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,840
I'm sorry.

814
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,560
I'm sorry.

815
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,200
I'm sorry.

816
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,800
I'm sorry.

817
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,480
I'm sorry.

818
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,120
I'm sorry.

819
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,840
How about this?

820
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,040
Go to the clothing store on Sunday

821
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,840
to order some clothes.

822
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,120
After you finish,

823
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,280
go shopping with me.

824
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,280
Didn't you say

825
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,520
I've become

826
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,920
vulgar since I came to the experiment center?

827
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,000
You're a fashion master.

828
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,600
Help me point out.

829
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
After we shop,

830
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,720
we can go for milk tea.

831
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,880
After drinking milk tea,

832
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,760
it will mark our

833
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,600
peace ceremony.

834
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,640
It's officially completed.

835
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,440
How about it?

836
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,720
I'll think about it.

837
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,080
Okay.

838
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,280
Think about it.

839
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,120
Qin Yanyun.

840
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,520
Qin Yanyun.

841
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,360
What a shame.

842
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,400
Lin Xinlong.

843
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,920
Where's Qin Yanyun?

844
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,800
Why did she

845
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,080
leave you alone?

846
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,280
I don't care.

847
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,480
Leave her alone.

848
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,600
Can you do it?

849
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,000
No way.

850
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,080
It's otras Marco.

851
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
What are you talking about?

852
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,160
If I leave here,

853
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,680
how could I keep her?

854
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,680
After новые mature girls

855
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,960
are dumped,

856
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,600
some rich women

857
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,840
will wish to marryex support

858
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,880
some rich man

859
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,920
a new bachelor.

860
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,840
Ready, 3, 2, 1.

861
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,360
So pretty.

862
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,520
It's suitable for the purple.

863
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,560
Let's try this one.

864
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,840
Let's try this one.

865
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,800
It's so white.

866
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,400
The purple one is so white.

867
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,760
The red one is also good.

868
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,840
The red one is also good, isn't it?

869
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,880
The red one is so eye-catching.

870
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,800
So good.

871
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Let's try this one.

872
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,320
Let's go.

873
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,240
Let's try this one.

874
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:17,920
Okay.

875
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,720
Let's go.

876
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,360
Xiaoman, you look great in this.

877
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,000
I think you look so white.

878
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,400
So pretty.

879
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,600
The red one is so pretty.

880
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,920
The waist is so thin.

881
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,560
Our team members have good skin.

882
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,760
The red one is suitable for the color.

883
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,680
Everyone will look great in this red one.

884
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,520
Xiaoman is right.

885
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,160
Xiaoman, you're so considerate.

886
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
You even thought of this?

887
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,000
Of course, we're like Xiaoman.

888
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,240
So straight.

889
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,880
Then we'll choose this red one.

890
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,960
What do you think?

891
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,840
Okay.

892
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,440
Let's go.

893
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,320
It's really pretty.

894
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,800
The shoes are so long.

895
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,720
So pretty.

896
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
The shoes are whiter.

897
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,320
So pretty.

898
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,120
You're so good at choosing.

899
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Let's try this one.

900
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,880
Lin Qi Le, what do you think?

901
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,520
You sound like you have a choice.

902
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,840
Don't say that.

903
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,560
As a dancer,

904
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,000
I'll respect everyone's choice.

905
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,200
What do you think?

906
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,920
Lin Qi Le,

907
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,680
just accept the majority.

908
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,120
We'll choose this one.

909
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,000
Remember to take Qin Ye Yun's clothes.

910
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,600
Xiaoman, you're so pretty.

911
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,960
You're so straight.

912
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,120
So pretty.

913
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,400
Let me find it for you.

914
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,520
This is so pretty.

915
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,640
It's so pretty.

916
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,440
What is this?

917
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,360
It's S-shaped.

918
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,280
S-shaped.

919
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,000
Yes.

920
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,240
Do you want to change it?

921
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
Yes, you should change it.

922
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,120
I'll go.

923
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,080
Don't come over.

924
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,880
Don't come over.

925
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,760
There's a

926
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
light here.

927
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
It's so pretty.

928
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,880
Wait for me.

929
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,400
There's something wrong with my clothes.

930
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,680
Auntie, look at this.

931
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,960
This is dyed.

932
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,720
This is...

933
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,880
You're right.

934
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,760
Wait a minute.

935
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,640
I'll go to the back room

936
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,000
and change it for you.

937
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,960
Can you hurry up?

938
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,840
Okay.

939
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,680
There's someone else.

940
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,920
Wait for me.

941
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:21,840
There's someone黑

942
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:45,140
It's done simple helping your

943
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,480
Locking your heart

944
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,280
Yes, please.

945
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,240
I'm here to help you.

946
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,080
You're the reason I still can't

947
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,880
doubt.

948
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,440
I'm in the unknown.

949
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,920
I turn around and see your love.

950
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,680
You're the reason I still shine.

951
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,680
Missing you

952
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,160
is like the light in the morning.

953
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:52,300
I dream of you in my dream.

954
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:14,500
The sunshine flavor in kiss her 완� WHOO.

955
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:20,500
Open your eyes and smile, the prince rides the white horse

956
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:26,500
Looking at the sky, the clouds are not speaking

957
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:32,500
Quietly, the messenger is waiting for an answer

958
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:38,500
The moonlight gently covers the face

959
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,500
He is shy and hides in the grass

960
00:43:44,500 --> 00:44:07,100
The sky is blue, the

961
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:15,500
sun will rise and say goodbye

962
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:26,500
A little cat and I are on the road

963
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:32,500
Many years have passed, the appearance of the past has been blurred

964
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:38,500
I hold a pen and draw a small magic on my finger

965
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:44,500
I sing with you on the hillside

966
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,500
We accidentally met

967
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:57,500
The young man is holding me in front of him, running like a mountain

968
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:03,500
The sunset is going to be red

969
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,500
You are in my pain, I look at you

970
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,500
The beautiful attention is all you

971
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:18,500
At this moment, I understand peace and freedom
